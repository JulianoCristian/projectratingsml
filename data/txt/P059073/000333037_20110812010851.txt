         F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The development objective of the project is to provide a reliable, affordable and sustainable water supply
service and improve the sewerage and sanitation in the "Service Area" of the Dar es Salaam Water and
Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) that includes Dar es Salaam and part of the Coast region.


Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

Despite the restructuring of the project, the PDO remained the same. The changes were more to reflect the
changed institutional arrangements, re-allocation of the credit proceeds to enhance the project sustainability
and the extension of the closing date to make up for the slow start and the loss of momentum with the
termination of the Lease contract.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

(a) Country Background

1.       In 1999, Tanzania was one of the world’s poorest countries, with a per capita Gross
National Income of about US$240. At this time, the country was rapidly urbanizing. According to
the Government of Tanzania (GOT) one-third to half of the urban population lived in unplanned
or squatter areas. In addition, the country was evolving from a one-party socialist state (from
independence in 1961 until the mid 1980’s) into a multi-party democracy. The country held its
first national multi-party elections in 1994, following political and economic reforms introduced
in the late 80s. The government introduced more economic reforms in the 1990s, including the
restructuring of state-owned enterprises. Furthermore, following the establishment of a
Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) in 1993 — to manage the divestiture
and privatization program—350 commercial entities were successfully divested and the GOT
introduced private participation in infrastructure services. Considering the previous socialist
model followed by the GOT, these reforms marked a remarkable change.

(b) Sector Background

2.      The Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) was created in 1997 with
the mandate to provide piped water supply and sewerage services to the Dar es Salaam
metropolitan area. Low tariffs, dilapidated infrastructure, and a lack of investment hampered
DAWASA’s efforts to improve services. Due to leaks, non-metered connections, and illegal
usage in 2002 much of the water supplied could not be accounted for. While DAWASA reported
that 70 percent of the households in Dar es Salaam had access to piped water (including water
from standpipes or neighbor’s taps), most areas had service for only a few hours several days per
week. Less than 10 percent of the urban population was connected to a sewerage system. Most
wastewater treatment facilities were not functioning and pit emptying services were inadequate.
The city suffered from periodic outbreaks of cholera and other water-borne diseases.

3.      In 2001/2002 the GOT laid the foundation for reform and public-private partnerships
(PPP) in water services. A National Water Policy (NWP) was adopted calling for the
development of an enabling environment for the delivery of reliable, sustainable and affordable
services. The NWP also sought to introduce full cost recovery and financial autonomy. It
endorsed independent and transparent regulation of services; emphasized the need to extend
services to low-income households; and encouraged private sector participation and small-scale
service providers. The GOT authorized DAWASA to appoint an operator under a concession or
lease contract, effectively giving DAWASA the functions of an asset holding company. Later,
the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) was created to regulate tariffs.

(c) Rationale for Bank Assistance

4.      The Bank has actively supported PPP in water supply and sanitation operations in Africa
for over two decades. In Tanzania the Bank supported broad program of parastatal reform and a
specific lease contract for water supply and sewerage services in Dar es Salaam through the
Public and Parastatal Sector Reform Project (Cr. 2507-TA) and the Privatization and Private

                                               1
Sector Development Project (Cr. 3304-TA). In 2003 the Dar es Salaam Water Supply and
Sanitation Project (DWSSP) became effective. Its purpose was to support a public-private
partnership (PPP) and finance investments in infrastructure. Donors provided funds to support
the project: AfDB (US$48 million), EIB (US$34 million), and IDA (US$61.5 million).

5.      DWSSP was aligned with the government’s Tanzania Assistance Strategy (TAS) and its
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) developed targets consistent with the Millennium
Development Goals (MDG). The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which supported TAS
focused on: adherence to macro stability, improved governance, increased poverty focus, and
increased private sector participation in the economy.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

(a) PDO

6.      The original project development objective was to provide a ―reliable, affordable and
sustainable water supply service and improve sewerage and sanitation in the service area of the
Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA)1‖. Project activities were therefore
expected to improve public health in a city prone to outbreaks of cholera and other water-borne
diseases, and support productive activities in Dar es Salaam.

(b) Key Performance Indicators

7.      In the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) the following targets for outcome/impact
indicators were set for the end of year five of the lease contract:

         70 percent of customers to obtain 24 hour water supply service under adequate pressure;

         100 percent of the water samples taken to meet the water quality standards specified in
          the lease contract;

         80 percent of sewage collected to be treated;

         95 percent of effluent samples to meet specified standards;

         A life-line tariff for domestic customers to be fully implemented;

         Revenues from water and sewerage services to cover all operations and maintenance
          costs, and to allow for a 10 percent contribution to the construction costs of the project.

8.    The following targets were among the output indicators listed in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD)2:




1
    The Development Credit Agreement does not include the word ―sewerage‖ in the PDO.
2
    The targets shown in boldface were included in Schedule 5 of the DCA.

                                                   2
       Production capacity guaranteed at 9,000 m3/d (Mtoni); 82,000 m3/d (Upper Ruvu) and
        180,000 m3/d (Lower Ruvu) by year 2008;

       About 1,040 km of distribution pipes to be installed by year 2008;

       About 135,000 connections to be rehabilitated and metered by year 2008;

       About 35,000 additional residential connections to be installed by year 2008;

       At least 80% of new domestic water supply connections installed under the project to be
        financed from the ―First Time New Domestic Water Supply Connection Fund” (New
        Connection Fund) by year 2008;

       About 250 new water kiosks to be built by 2008;

       26,000 m3/day of collected sewage to be treated to specified standards before discharge
        into the environment by year 2008;

       About 50 community WSS schemes to be built and operated by year 2008;

       About 173,000 meters to installed by year 2008;

       UfW reduced to 35 percent by year 2008;

       Combined collection ratio of private and public water supply and sewerage bills to
        increase to 90 percent by year 2008;

       Water resource management and corresponding environmental assessment to be carried
        out by year 2007;

       Water supply feasibility study and preliminary design to be completed by year 2007;

       Strategic sanitation plan to be completed by year 2006;

       Sanitation feasibility study and preliminary design to be completed by year 2007;

       Urban WSS sector development strategy to be prepared by 2005.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators
9.       The project was restructured three times (in February 2006, 2009 and June 2010) to
reflect changes in institutional arrangements and activities, but the PDO and key indicators were
retained (see sections 1.6 and 1.7 below). During the Mid-Term Review, DAWASA and Dar es
Salaam Water & Sewerage Company (Operator) (DAWASCO) requested the revision of several
PDO key indicator targets as it was unlikely that they would be achieved. Revision of the output
indicators for the number of meters to be installed and the total number of rehabilitated and new
connections down to 100,000 would have been consistent with the reduced number of meters to
be procured (100,000), however, no changes were made.


                                                3
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
10.     At appraisal it was estimated that at the end of the project 80 percent of the Dar es
Salaam population would have access to piped water: 1.4 million people with access to direct
connections, 1.3 million people with access to stand posts, and 170,000 people with access to
water through community schemes. The projected 2008 population was 3.2 million.

11.      Low-income communities would benefit from the project through the: (i) establishment
of a New Connection Fund to finance small diameter domestic connections, (ii) densification and
extension of the secondary distribution network to construct new connections and standposts,
(iii) adoption of a lifeline tariff for the first five cubic meters per month for domestic customers,
and (iv) the Community Water Supply and Sanitation Program (CWSSP) to construct water
supply and sanitation schemes for 50 low-income communities not served by the main
distribution network.

12.     Improvements in services provided through direct water supply and sewerage
connections were also expected to benefit institutional and commercial customers in Dar es
Salaam.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

(a) Component 1: Rehabilitation and extension of water supply facilities

13.       Amount: US$106.05 million (IDA US$36.0 million), including:

                                                 4
(c) Component 3: Community Water Supply and Sanitation Program

15.     Amount: US$3.85 million (IDA US$2.25 million), to be implemented by DAWASA with
the assistance of specialized NGOs, and consisting of grants to be awarded by DAWASA to
about 50 beneficiary communities for:
         Water supply schemes in low income communities not served by the main network;
         On-site sanitation facilities and hygiene promotion;
         Community mobilization and training in the management of these schemes.

(d) Component 4: Institutional strengthening program

16.       Amount: US$25 million (IDA US$13.95 million), including:

         A sub-loan of US$5 million to the Operator to help finance its initial operating costs;

         Technical assistance to DAWASA;

         Training of DAWASA and Ministry staff;

         Emergency operational equipment and repairs to be financed by DAWASA under the
          Lease Contract;

         Technical assistance to the Wami/Ruvu Basin Office.

(e) Component 5: Preparation of a medium term WSS development program

17.       Amount: US$6.15 million (IDA US$5.65 million), including:

         Studies for the selection of the future water source and of the ground water capacity in
          the Service Area in association with a comprehensive regional environmental assessment;

         Feasibilities studies and designs of additional water supply facilities;

         Preparation of a strategic sanitation plan, feasibility studies, and designs;

         Preparation of a strategy for developing the urban WSS sector.

1.6 Revised Components
18.       In March 2006 the following activities were made to Components 1, 4 and 5:

         Component 1: The number of meters to be procured was reduced to 100,000;

         Component 4: Funds were reallocated to provide a sub-loan to the Operator, allow
          training for staff, and introduce a new management information system;

         Component 5: Three new works sub-components were added: (i) Groundwater
          development, including the drilling of three deep boreholes to test the water quality and

                                                    5
        capacity of a newly identified aquifer under Dar es Salaam; (ii) repair of a breach on the
        Ruvu River at Kidgozero; and (iii) construction of a waste management facility to handle
        solid waste for the city and sludge from the wastewater ponds.

1.7 Other significant changes
19.     First, the selection of a Private Operator was a condition of project appraisal and the
effectiveness of the lease contract a condition of credit effectiveness. When the lease contract
with the Private Operator (City Water Services) was terminated in June 2005 (due to breach of
contract), the government created a public company, DAWASCO, to take over operation of water
supply and sewerage services. The project restructuring recognized this change in the
implementation arrangements.

20.     Second, DAWASCO’s responsibility for implementing new DWP contracts was handed
back to DAWASA, with the exception of the installation of customer connections, water kiosks
and related elements that would be assigned from time to time.

21.     Third, the closing date was extended from December 31, 2008, to December 31, 2009, to
make up for the slow start and the loss of momentum caused by the termination of the lease
contract. A second extension of six months was granted until June 30, 2010, and a third
extension of five months until November 30, 2010.

22.     Fourth, the proceeds of the IDA credit were reallocated to provide additional funds for
Categories 1 (Works), 4 (Training) and 5 (Operating Costs of the Operator) by reducing funds for
Categories 2 (Goods) and 3 (Consulting Services) and using funds in the Unallocated category.
Retroactive financing was provided from Category 5 for emergency expenditures incurred by
DAWASCO after the termination of the lease contract with the private Operator.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

(a) Quality at Entry

23.      During preparation, the Bank conducted a Quality at Entry Review which rated the
Project Highly Satisfactory. The country context described above (section 1.1) and the GOT’s
role in leading the PPP reform appeared to provide a favorable environment for the engagement
of a private operator to ensure financially sustainable services. The Bank’s policy favored PPP as
the most promising approach for improving the performance of services. The design of the
project was ambitious in that it was premised on a professional private operator turning the utility
around. The institutional, commercial and technical interventions were appropriate and most of
the civil works were completed despite some delay. In addition, the Project Development
Objectives were consistent with the CAS’ objectives, the GOT’s PRSP, and considered relevant
to achieve the MDGs.

(b) Project Preparation

24.     The process of selecting a private operator was complex, involving three tendering
processes which took five years to conclude.

25.      The preparation process began in 1997 after a British company Biwater International Ltd.
approached the GOT with an unsolicited proposal. On the advice of the World Bank, the GOT
opened up the bidding to other private operators. Saur, Vivendi and Northumbrian were also
invited to submit bids. As there was a wide variation among the bids the Presidential Parastatal
Restructuring Commission (PSRC) decided not to evaluate them.

26.      In 1998 the PSRC decided to request a second round of bids for a lease contract,
following a Bank-funded workshop on PPP options, and with the strong endorsement of the
World Bank team. The selection process became contentious. Biwater alleged that the
structuring of the lease contract and the bidding process favored the French firms and declined to
submit a bid. Saur and Vivendi, both of which had expressed concerns about inadequate
protection from risks, submitted bids containing qualifications. In May 2000 their bids were
declared non-compliant.

27.     A third tendering effort was undertaken. Saur, Vivendi and Biwater Gauff Tanzania
Limited (BGT), a new partnership that did not meet the criteria, were pre-qualified. Upon
reviewing the bid documents, DAWASA’s financial advisor and the Bank recommended that, in
the case of a bidder being a special purpose limited liability entity (i.e., the case of BGT), the
performance guarantee should be provided by the parent company/majority shareholder. But this
requirement was not incorporated into the final documents. Saur and Vivendi requested several
amendments to deal with risks such as the lack of reliable baseline data and discretionary
decisions of the regulator. When their requests were not accommodated these companies
withdrew from the bidding process. Ultimately only BGT submitted a proposal. Although the
Bank team expressed concern about the soundness of BGT’s proposal, following a ―safe space‖
review, the World Bank issued a ―no objection‖ to the award of the contract. BGT and a
Tanzanian investor subsequently created the operating company City Water Services Limited
(CWS).

28.     A ten-year Lease Contract was signed in February 2003 and CWS began operations in
August 2003, coinciding with the effectiveness of the project. In hindsight, the project team’s
concerns were justified because the company encountered difficulties almost immediately, due
primarily to its failure to manage operations, the DWP and PWP effectively. Risks identified by
the other potential bidders also contributed to the private operator’s failure (and subsequently
plagued DAWASCO as well).

29.    All other aspects of project preparation proceeded without incident, including the
engagement of NGOs to assist with the preparation and implementation of the CWSSP.

(c) Lessons of earlier operations

30.     The PAD did not draw lessons learned from previous projects in Tanzania as there was
no relevant private sector project. Instead it drew lessons from other WB funded projects in West
Africa involving private operators under lease contracts. On this basis the PAD highlighted the
following criteria for success:

                                                7
         The celebration of a Development Contract between the GOT and DAWASA;

         A commitment by the GOT to cause its agencies to pay water bills in a timely manner;

         Transfer of some responsibility for implementing the investment program to the
          Operator;

         A tariff structure that would allow access to piped water by low-income households;

         Stakeholder participation to build a strong consensus on the privatization of a key public
          service;

         Targeted programs for low-income communities that would not be served by the main
          piped system.

31.       The attempt to apply these lessons had mixed outcomes:

         The lease contract entered into by the GOT and DAWASA did not adequately address
          risks;

         The lease contract incorporated measures to ensure the GOT paid its water bills;

         The lease contract was structured to allow the Operator to implement key parts of the
          investment program, but changes introduced shifted this responsibility between
          DAWASA and the Operator;

         Until 2005 tariffs were regulatory indexed to reflect inflation, and a lifeline tariff was
          introduced, however it had limited reach due to the low number of individual
          connections;

         During project preparation stakeholder consultation with sector actors and low-income
          communities was satisfactory, but the vested interests (commercial staff of the operator,
          tankers, etc.) that could undermine the speedy turnaround of commercial performance did
          not receive enough attention – especially given the suspected high levels of water theft;

         Pro-poor programs were established: to reach un-served areas (CWSSP with good
          results); to increase the density of kiosks (with poor results); and to improve affordability
          and access (lifeline tariffs and free connections).

(d) Risks

32.       The PAD’s identification of risks was broad, and included:

         The inexperience of DAWASA and EWURA;
         The failure of GOT agencies to pay water bills;
         The failure of the Regulator to adjust tariffs;
         DAWASA’s weak capacity to implement construction projects.


                                                    8
33.     While the overall risk was identified as ―substantial‖ and mitigation measures were put in
place, the severity of some risks was underestimated and, as a result, the associated risk
mitigation measures were inadequate. For example, the risk that the operator would fail to
perform was rated ―moderate‖, and the impact of this potential failure on the achievement of
project objectives was not identified. Improved operator performance was expected to ―free up‖
unaccounted for water for redistribution to new customers. Despite concerns raised by
DAWASA during project preparation, that production capacity would need to be increased before
the 2010 estimate provided in the PAD, the Bank noted that measures to improve efficiency
should precede augmentation of capacity.

34.      The factors that undermined the lease contract with the private Operator and had a
significant negative impact on the project were: (i) the difficult relationship between BGT and its
local shareholder; (ii) the failure of the shareholders to contribute the equity necessary to keep
CWS solvent; and, (iii) the Operator’s failure to adopt and implement a successful turn-around
strategy thereby improving access, increasing collections and reducing water losses.

35.     Finally, the recommendation that the parent company should provide the performance
guarantee was not adopted. Thus the GOT has been unable to collect US$5.6 million that it is
owed by the now bankrupt CWS.

2.2 Implementation

(a) Components 1 and 2: Rehabilitation and extension of water supply and wastewater
facilities

36.      Two-thirds of total project funding (US$128m) was allocated to rehabilitate production,
transmission, storage, distribution, wastewater collection and treatment facilities. Most of the
major construction works were achieved by project closing. This is an important accomplishment
in light of the project’s difficult start. By the end of the project only two key activities (repair of
the Kidogozero Breach and construction of a sludge facility) — added during the second
restructuring — were not implemented.

       PWP. The start-up of the PWP lagged until January 2004 because CWS did not provide
        advance payment bonds in a timely manner. Further delays resulted when, after the
        termination of the CWS contract, the SIPE contract had to be reassigned to DAWASCO.
        The rehabilitation works, the delivery and installation of bulk meters, the creation of
        distribution zones, and district metering were not completed until mid-2010. This had an
        especially negative impact on operational performance, particularly reducing non-
        revenue water (NRW) and improving financial performance.

       DWP. Arrangements for implementation of the DWP were adjusted twice. Firstly,
        responsibility for implementing the DWP was transferred to DAWASA after technical
        auditors found that the strategy adopted by CWS was flawed (focused on installing pipes
        rather than rationalizing water supply). Secondly, the DWP was returned to the operator
        (DAWASCO) after the Mid-term Review (MTR) raised concerns about the need to
        ensure consistency in assignment of responsibility for operational improvements.




                                                  9
       NDWP. The rehabilitation of water supply assets and extension of wastewater facilities
        by DAWASA was completed without major problems despite delays in procurement,
        delivery of equipment and construction.

37.      The MTR found that both DAWASA and DAWASCO needed to improve their capacity
to plan and monitor implementation. Nevertheless the MTR rated implementation as
―satisfactory‖ — and by the end of the project the works had substantially been completed. A
significant number of indicators were also met (see Annex 2). However, new challenges, in the
form of vandalism of new infrastructure and encroachment of human settlements (around the
wastewater treatment ponds) emerged. DAWASA undertook several public awareness programs
to involve the citizenry in protecting the water and wastewater system and by December 2009 the
severity of these problems had decreased.

(b) Component 3: Community Water Supply and Sanitation Program

38.     DAWASA’s Community Liaison Unit (CLU) implemented the CWSSP, with the
assistance of specialized NGOs. This was one of the most effectively managed and successful
components of the project despite a slow start. By December 2010 DAWASA had completed 50
small water supply schemes and many of these were operational. As a result the original target
was exceeded about 275,000 persons had access to the CWSSP’s facilities. Water User
Associations (WUAs) constructed some sanitation facilities, including three public toilets for
local markets and promotional EcoSan latrines.

39.       Implementation of the CWSSP encountered some difficulties but these were largely
addressed by the project closing. In particular, the mobilization and formation of WUAs required
a greater effort on the part of the NGOs; both DAWASA’s and the NGOs’ procurement
procedures had to be aligned with those of the lenders; in addition, the completion of CWSSP
facilities that relied on bulk water from DAWASCO was delayed— this resulted in frustration
among potential users.

40.      CWSSP schemes appeared to be financially sustainable as revenues collected from the
WUAs were sufficient to cover operations, maintenance and expansion. The MTR acknowledged
that the WUAs needed follow-up support to manage the systems effectively. During the last
months of the project DAWASA engaged a consultant to provide technical assistance and
training for WUAs. Also, DAWASCO established a pro-poor unit to provide technical support to
off-network community-based schemes.

(c) Component 4: Institutional Strengthening Program

41.     DAWASA implemented the institutional strengthening activities under this component
and accomplished the technical assistance and training for its staff satisfactorily. However the
Operator’s critical role in implementing the major institutional changes required to deliver results
was neglected. As a result training for CWS/DAWASCO’s staff and the introduction of the MIS
system came too late in the project and therefore had no significant impact.

42.     The slow start-up and subsequent exit of CWS delayed implementation and dampened
commercial and operational performance. Both CWS and DAWASCO’s collections fell far short
of projections— caused in part by the lag in installation of new connections and continued high
levels of non-revenue water. Although DAWASA and DAWASCO agreed to accelerate the

                                                10
cleanup of the customer data base to enable rationalization and metering of connections in line
with the findings of the MTR, tariffs were also a problem. The regulator, EWURA, refused to
approve the indexation of tariffs for three years (June 2006 to June 2009) — due in part to
DAWASA and DAWASCO’s failure to meet its conditions — and instead allowed the customer
tariff to be restructured (2007/08) to give DAWASCO a higher percentage of the tariff revenues.
Other problems encountered during implementation and highlighted in the MTR included
vandalism of equipment provided to the Wami/Ruvu Basin Authority and the failure to control
encroachment in the catchment area. These weaknesses in enforcement reduced inflows into the
Mtoni water works by 61 percent.

(d) Component 5: Preparation of a medium term WSS development program

43.     The completion of all key studies planned under this component contributed to updated
sector plans and strategies, and to the exploration and development of deep water aquifers. For
instance, the Kimbiji aquifer was discovered using innovative methods. The aquifer, with a
potential yield of 200,000 cubic meters a day, will improve the availability of water for Dar es
Salaam in the future.

44.     The studies used data and information from oil and gas exploration work, combined with
hydrogeological investigations, which include drilling of three test wells - at Mpiji (abandoned
due to high salt content); Kimbiji (high quantity and quality); and Mpera (high water quantity and
quality) to find these aquifers. The first phase development of the Kimbiji aquifer will be
undertaken through a follow up operation (the Water Sector Development Project).

45.     Following the MTR a new design for repair of the Kidogozero Breach (Ruvu River) had
to be commissioned as previous attempts had failed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation: Design, Implementation and Utilization
46.       The monitoring and evaluation framework defined in the PAD relied on:

         Annual technical reports on performance with regard to key indicators to be prepared by
          the Operator;

         Quarterly reports on the implementation of construction programs, studies and technical
          assistance to be prepared by DAWASA;

         Tariff reviews and, before the end of the first five years of the Lease Contract,
          recommendations on the customer tariff and structure based on detailed willingness-to-
          pay studies and an analysis of the cost of the services;

         An MTR of project performance to be carried out by the financing agencies;

         An independent review of the implementation of: DAWASA’s Development Contract;
          the Lease Contract; and Customer Contracts, all of which were carried out prior to the
          MTR.

47.    This framework could have provided an adequate basis for monitoring project
implementation but its application remained weak throughout the project. The monitoring of

                                                11
technical and fiduciary aspects of the project (rehabilitation, capital works, and social and
environmental covenants) was consistent, but project monitoring fell short in several respects:

         The collection and verification of data on operational performance and the survey of
          beneficiaries did not receive adequate attention;

         Efforts to enforce the lease and allow the restructuring of the DAWASA/DAWASCO
          arrangement were implemented late;

         Steps to monitor financial performance and achieve financial sustainability were
          ineffective.

48.     While the issue of weak overall management capacity and the need for greater
accountability was identified as a general short-coming, little attention was paid to improving
data quality. In the final analysis, DAWASA (including CWS and DAWASCO) failed to ensure
that a dynamic and coordinated approach to collecting and monitoring data on operational
performance was in place. On its part, the GOT failed to take action on restructuring the
DAWASA-DAWASCO relationship to improve accountability and strengthen performance.

49.     The lack of good quality operational performance data was detrimental to the project
because the establishment of internal systems for rigorous data collection, verification and
analysis should have been a high priority for all actors. To some extent delays in cleaning up the
customer data base and installing meters led to poor quality of data, however, it was also
symptomatic of the dysfunctional relationship between DAWASA and DAWASCO.

50.       Specific aspects of this weak monitoring and evaluation system include:

         Unavailability or inconsistency of data in Annual Technical Reports prepared by CWS
          and DAWASCO — the Auditors’ report cited irregularities in the data reported by
          DAWASCO, but did not provide corrected data;

         DAWASA’s Quarterly Reports varied in quality. Even though they provide sound
          information on the implementation of capital works and studies, they lacked clarity with
          respect to operational data. There were also inconsistencies between DAWASCO’s and
          DAWASA’s and EWURAs reports making it difficult to assess outcomes;

         The Tanzanian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) was contracted to carry out a series of
          household surveys in the DAWASA service area to determine the impact of the DWSSP.
          There was no evidence that survey results were used by DAWASA or DAWASCO as
          inputs for the formulation of development and operational strategies, or by EWURA as a
          basis for evaluating tariff proposals. The document review conducted for this ICR also
          revealed that the survey was not tailored to DAWASA’s or EWURA’s needs and
          therefore did not include data on several crucial matters (e.g., volumes consumed and
          prices) or present it in a manner that could be used to report on indicators and targets.




                                                 12
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(a) Safeguards

51.     The safeguards policies triggered for the project included (i) environmental assessment
and (ii) involuntary resettlement. Both the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were in place at project start. During implementation, a number
of issues were identified and most were addressed and resolved satisfactorily.

52.      A persistent problem was the illegal discharge of industrial wastewater into the waste
stabilization ponds below approved standards. In response, DAWASA served notice to the
industries, disconnected the non-complying industries, and reported them to the National
Environmental Management Council.

53.     Another issue was the encroachment of human settlements near key water sources and
around the waste stabilization ponds, due to the delayed fencing. DAWASA was unable to move
the households that had settled close to the waste stabilization ponds outside the original
boundaries set at the design stage. The fence was therefore built closer to the pond.

(b) Fiduciary Compliance

54.      Procurement of works, goods and consultancy services was generally conducted
satisfactorily by DAWASA. IDA and the other financiers (AfDB and EIB) followed their
respective procurement guidelines for reviewing and clearing procurement documents for the
activities each financed. While the process was slow in the beginning, it later picked up and
eventually all procurement was carried out under the agreed procurement plans. These plans
were updated several times to match implementation progress and changing needs. The last
revision took into account the extension of the project completion date from December 31, 2009,
to June 30, 2010, to allow completion of ongoing activities affected by slow or repeat
procurement, particularly on some of the delegated works packages.

55.     DAWASA developed and maintained acceptable financial management arrangements for
the project including staffing, internal controls, accounting systems, policies and procedures,
record keeping, budget and information systems, and funds flow arrangements. Project financial
management issues that were identified during audits and supervision missions and in
management letters were discussed and resolved satisfactorily. However, timely payment of
counterpart contributions was problematic and this affected the pace of project implementation.
For example in the financial year 2009/2010, the approved budget for counterpart funds was
TSh 5.3 billion, but the amount received as of March 31, 2010, was TSh 876 million.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
56.     The project design included several studies aimed at preparing for follow-on operations,
with an emphasis on expanding production capacity, improving sanitation and protecting the
environment. The studies resulted in (i) a water resource development plan and proposed water
supply scheme; (ii) a sanitation improvement plan; and, (iii) a preliminary design and tender
documents for a sludge management facility and sanitary landfill. The GOT plans to finance
several follow-on activities as part of its Water Sector Development Program (WSDP). A


                                              13
consultancy to prepare the Kidunda Dam Project and a comprehensive assessment of the Kimbiji
Aquifer are being carried out with support from the ongoing IDA funded Water Supply Support
Project (WSSP) project and the Norwegian government. The development of these two water
resources will significantly improve the water available in Dar es Salaam and bring production
capacity in line with population growth.

57.      By December 2010, some minor adjustments in the lease contract between DAWASA
and DAWASCO had been made. However, Bank’s supervision missions had encouraged the
GOT to undertake a more fundamental restructuring of the institutional framework governing the
relationship between the asset holder DAWASA, and the operator DAWASCO. As the
performance of DAWASCO is critical for the sustainability of investments financed under the
project (see section 3.5), a more fundamental review of the institutional and policy framework
will be required. In view of the substantial investments planned under the WSDP, the Bank
should link any future assistance to more concrete actions to strengthen the policy and
institutional environment, and improve commercial and operational performance.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
        Rating: Satisfactory

58.     The PDOs remain relevant to Tanzania’s National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of
Poverty (MKUKUTA I and II), the FY11 Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST), and the
upcoming Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY12-15, all of which include access to improved
water supply and sanitation as a key objective. The priorities that the project sought to address
also remain relevant, but engaging a private operator is not considered a viable option at this time.
Difficulties faced during preparatory and implementation phases, including failure by both the
Bank and the GOT to act on key risks that were identified at various stages, are largely
responsible for the modest achievement of project outcomes. One of the most successful
components of the project was the CWSSP which had a positive outcome. Efforts to expand the
CWSSP therefore continued after the project closed.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

59.     The PDO — to provide ―reliable, affordable and sustainable‖ water supply services, and
improve sewerage and sanitation services in the area served by DAWASA — was partially met.
Three of the five project outcome targets were achieved:

       First, the ―implementation of a life-line tariff for domestic customers‖ was achieved,
        although this had a limited impact as only 17 percent of households had a house or yard
        connection in 2009 while 27 percent of households bought piped water from neighbors or
        kiosks and paid higher unit prices;




                                                 14
         Second, in 2009/10, the ―percentage of water samples in the distribution network that
          met standards‖ reached 97 percent against a target of 100 percent and the number of
          samples meeting e-coli standards (not a PDO-specified indicator) reached 99 percent;

         Thirdly, by the end of the project, 100 ―percent of collected sewage was being treated‖
          and the volume was 46 percent more than the target.

60.       The last two outcome targets were only partially met:

         Only 30 ―percent of DAWASCO’s customers had 24/7 water supply‖, compared to the
          target of 70 percent, due in part to inadequate supply and the high level of NRW which,
          at 53 percent, was higher than the output indicator target of 35 percent; and finally

         Revenue from services did not “…cover all O&M costs and allow for a 10 percent
          contribution to the construction costs of the project‖. The inadequacy of tariff revenues
          was of grave concern because the ―revenue improvement program‖ failed to improve
          performance and it was clear that in order for the sector to breakeven (financially),
          collections needed to almost double in 2010. While an increase in tariffs in 2010
          prevented the situation from worsening, EWURA’s reluctance to allow regular inflation
          indexation is likely to pose a problem in future. Collections can be expected to reach the
          targets only after NRW is brought under control, and the number of active connections
          approaches the project target of 170,000, DAWASCO must therefore act in tandem to
          reduce rising core recurrent costs which are also a cause for concern. These can be
          addressed by taking the above steps — if costs were averaged over a larger number of
          active connections they would be manageable. Performance on standard indicators
          recently specified by the Sector Board, project development outcome indicators and
          project output indicators are presented in Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency
          Rating: Unsatisfactory

61.      The project’s efficiency is rated unsatisfactory based on the data available. This rating
takes into consideration noticeable inconsistencies in data. For example, the household survey
indicated piped water coverage of close to 54 percent in 20093, while DAWASCO/DAWASA
reported 81 percent coverage, and EWURA reported 82 percent coverage. Problems with data
availability and accuracy plagued the project from the beginning and no solid baseline was
established. As a result, it was not possible to use the economic parameters laid out in the
appraisal document to assess the project’s economic efficiency. The lack of sound data to use in
assessing project performance obscures the picture of what has been achieved in terms of
expansion of the customer base, changes in the composition of the customer base, and actual
revenues collected by the different consumer categories, among other possible achievements.



3
 It is unclear what definitions of piped water are used by DAWASA, EWURA and NBS. For example
under the CWSSP, 2,000 households and 496 kiosks were connected through ―small independent piped
networks‖ that relied on boreholes. DAWASA and EWURA may have included the statistics from these
borehole based piped water supplies in their data on piped water supply.

                                                 15
62.     The analysis prepared at appraisal assumed that a large part of the project’s benefits
would be for households using stand posts or kiosks. These consumers would benefit from time
savings due to closer proximity of water supply. Those that would gain access through a
household connection would also benefit from household expenditure savings as a result of the
introduction of a lifeline rate. It is unlikely that the lifeline rate has had a major impact on
household expenditure on water due to the fact that most connections appear to have relatively
high consumption levels. DAWASCO data shows that average consumption per active
connection is about 50 m3 per month, which is believed to be due to a high degree of water
sharing among neighbors. Similarly, the number of kiosks served from DAWASCO’s network
increased from 115 in 2006 to 195 in 2009 (although DAWASCO indicates that this rose to 294
by project closing)4 . Furthermore the very limited number of kiosks resulted in households’
relying on neighbors, and data in this respect does not allow an estimation of time savings.
Finally, changes in the water vendor market have been marginal. The proportion of the
population depending on mobile vendors decreased from 9.9 percent in 2006 to 8.4 percent in
2009, and the effect in absolute terms was very small.

63.      The original economic analysis was based on conducting a financial analysis and adding
(or subtracting) the benefits (or losses) described above. These benefits appear to have been
minimal, and the results of the financial analysis conducted at ICR stage further illustrate the
weak position of the implementing agency at the close of the project. Analysis of the with-
project cash flow shows net operating revenues growing steadily worse, and the net present value
is negative.

64.       Unit cost efficiency was also analyzed with the following results:

         The water supply component was US$106 million (without contingencies) at project
          appraisal and at project closing. During appraisal, it was estimated that 685,000 people
          would benefit from new connections (35,000 connections, 250 new kiosks) and another 2
          million people from improved services (rehabilitation of 100,000 connections and 1,000
          kiosks) – resulting in a unit cost of US$39 per capita5. At the close of the project, the
          total number of people benefitting from new connections was 416,290, (from 12,029
          connections at an average of 10 people per connection and 296 kiosks at 1,000 people per
          kiosk) and 275,000 served through CWSSP; and the number of people with access to
          improved services (consumers receiving service daily) was 1,000,000 (100,000
          rehabilitated connections) resulting in a unit cost of US$62 per capita (or 1,691,290
          people served)6.

         The project also spent more than US$22 million on sewerage improvements. The
          benefits from this component are hard to assess, because the data on the number of
          incremental sewerage connections also shows large inconsistencies. DAWASA reports
          show an increase of 11,000 new sewer connections between 2006 and 2009, which would



4
  This increase may be the result of adding CWSSP kiosks which were installed by DAWASA rather than
DAWASCO.
5
  CWS declared moribund all connections without water or with illegal connections bringing down the total
number of connections at the start to 53,832.
6
  Most of the original 1,000 stand posts or kiosks were either abandoned, shut down, or converted into
domestic connections.

                                                   16
        translate to a cost of US$2,000 per connection. Although this is a high cost, especially
        when benchmarked against the cost of such service elsewhere in the world, the outputs
        exceed what was expected in the PAD (to increase sewerage connections from 3,000 to
        5,400). Other sources show very little improvement in the number of sewerage
        connections (such as the EWURA data).

       The Community Water Supply and Sanitation Program was estimated to cost US$3.85
        million while providing 170,000 people with services, which at appraisal resulted in a per
        capita cost of US$23. Benefits from this component have been positive and are
        continuing to increase. DAWASCO reported 65,000 beneficiaries in 2009 with an actual
        cost per capita of US$59, but by the end of the project, a census carried out by DAWASA
        showed that 275,000 had benefited – a per capita cost of about US$14. The exact number
        of beneficiaries from the CWSSP requires further verification, because the population in
        the CWSSP areas has increased significantly. DAWASA is currently planning a second
        census that will establish the impact of the project.

65.      As some of the project benefits remain to be realized (20,000 connections are being
installed by DAWASA with fittings purchased through the project), and the initial data as well as
the data collected by the different agencies during implementation was deficient, the overall high
unit costs for the different project components suggest that the project has not used its resources
efficiently.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

        Relevance: Satisfactory

        Achievement of PDOs: Moderately Unsatisfactory

        Efficiency: Unsatisfactory

66.      Overall, the project remains relevant, and the priorities identified in the PAD are
highlighted in relevant policy documents of the GOT. The modest achievement of the PDO is
explained by a number of challenges faced during implementation, including (i) difficulties
encountered in engaging an operator with the capacity to turn around operational performance;
(ii) a supply side constraint made worse by rapid population growth and worsening NRW; and,
(iii) the weak financial performance that resulted from insufficient revenues, low tariffs, and
mounting debt. Based on these factors, the project outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
This outcome could have been prevented by more proactive decision making at various stages of
the project, on the part of the Bank and the government. The social, economic, financial impacts
of the project were far less than expected. The sector still has some distance to go before fully
achieving desired outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

67.      The project promoted: (i) the improvement and expansion of services for the poor
through the adoption of a lifeline water supply tariff for the first five cubic meters of domestic
consumption; (ii) the establishment of the First Time Connection Fund (FTCF) to finance free
new small-diameter domestic connections; and (iii) the CWSSP to build water supply and
sanitation schemes in communities that could not be served by the main networks in the near
future. The lifeline tariff was established prior to effectiveness of the project and has been
applied since then. However, as mentioned above, it benefitted a small percentage of the
population who have direct access to a house or yard connection. Using the FTCF initially
proved to be impractical because of restrictions set at appraisal on the type of households that
could benefit7. The criteria were relaxed in 2007, but this had no impact on the project, because
all new connections made under the DCW (which was completed in 2010) were provided free of
charge to all users. The fund remains in a separate account, and DAWASCO started to use it
under revised rules established in late 2010.

68.     The CWSSP established a foundation for further improvements and expanded services in
un-served, low-income communities. In fact, expansion of the CWSSP began before the project
ended as the CLU also rehabilitated 35 existing schemes that had been built under an earlier IDA-
funded Urban Sector Rehabilitation Project (USRP). Further expansion was hampered by limited
funding and therefore DAWASA worked with DAWASCO regarding the possibility of using the
5 percent contribution from communities to establish a fund for further expansion of the program.
Sustainability of the schemes depends on effective management by the WUAs. This need will be
addressed by a new pro-poor unit that was created in DAWASCO, which, in addition to
providing oversight of off-network community water schemes, will ensure the proper operation of
kiosks and will promote social connections.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

69.      The project sought to improve services by engaging a private operator. Institutional
changes therefore focused on the Operator, including credit arrangements, the lease contract, and
staffing. It also focused on the role of, and relationship between, DAWASA and the Operator.

The Collapse of the Lease Contract with CWS

70.      In preparation for the award of a lease contract to a private operator DAWASA was
restructured as an asset holding company. All operating staff and responsibility for operations
were transferred to the private operator – CWS. But CWS failed to meet its obligations and its
performance was inadequate:

        Its shareholders did not inject the full amount of their agreed equity contributions;



7
 While the criterion set at appraisal was for households with less than 4 taps in the house to get a free
connection, the application of this criterion proved difficult due to household and living patterns that were
at odds with this. Many households with 3 taps in the house are considered non-poor.

                                                     18
       A new billing software system was not completed until March 2005, and it turned out to
        be faulty, leading to the system’s subsequent replacement;

       Prior to its termination, CWS’s average monthly collections in 2004/05 were 48 percent
        lower than projected and 21 percent lower than DAWASA’s had been in 2002/03;

       CWS could not collect US$1.5 million despite the GOT’s guarantee to pay, because
        many bills were disputed and could not be verified due to a lack of information about the
        location of connections and the lack of metering;

       CWS did not regularly pay the rental fee to DAWASA, periodically withheld Lessor
        Tariff collections to pay its own operating costs, and misappropriated First Time New
        Domestic Water Supply Connection funds;

       The number of connections rehabilitated with meters installed was less than one quarter
        of the targets for the first two years of the contract;

       The delegated works strategy developed by CWS was found to be flawed by the technical
        auditors because it focused on installing pipes rather than rationalizing the supply of
        water;

       CWS failed to develop the base values for key performance indicators specified in the
        lease contract during the enhanced monitoring period and did not submit reports on
        operational performance in a timely manner.

71.     From August 2004 until May 2005, the GOT, DAWASA and CWS attempted to
renegotiate the contract. The services of a mediator were funded by the IDA credit, but the
parties did not reach an agreement. On May 12, 2005, DAWASA called CWS’s performance
bond in its entirety. After CWS failed to reinstate the performance guarantee within the period
required, DAWASA served a notice of termination of the contract on May 25, 2005. CWS
claimed that the notice of termination was invalid and thus would not agree to an early
termination. On June 1, 2005, CWS’s three British managers were deported. A few days earlier
the GOT had created a new public operating company, the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage
Corporation (DAWASCO), which assumed management of the services that same day.

The resumption of operations under DAWASCO

72.     Following the departure of the private operator the services were leased to DAWASCO.
The lease contract framework was retained as the operation by DAWASCO (a public operator)
was seen as a temporary arrangement until the selection of a new private operator. But the public
opinion did not favor a similar contractual arrangement as there was significant disappointment
with PPP in infrastructure in Tanzania. Thus, installing a public operator to undertake the core
functions of provided by the private operator was the preferred solution for the near to medium
term. Under the circumstances it was unlikely that a new private operator would be interested in
such a contract.

73.    The transfer of the lease from a private to public operator was not straightforward as
many of the assumptions of the lease contract were only valid for a private operator. Under the
new framework – both entities were owned by the GOT; their boards were appointed by the

                                               19
Minister of Water and Irrigation without any framework for accountability; and their CEOs were
appointed by the president or the minister rather than a board of directors. This framework
undermined the principal-agent relationship that was essential for ensuring the accountability of
both entities. DAWASCO’s lease contract was similar to that of CWS. But, in practice,
DAWASCO was not required to execute a performance bond and the financial penalties for non-
compliance with the performance targets were not enforced. The MTR highlighted the need to
improve monitoring, to return oversight of DWP to DAWASCO, to improve planning and
coordination capacity in both DAWASA and DAWASCO, and to restructure and strengthen
DAWASCO’s O&M and management capacity. But for the transfer of DWP none of these
recommendations were implemented. During the first three years of the contract, DAWASCO
did not achieve its annual targets, and DAWASA was unable to oversee DAWASCO as they both
reported directly to the same authority.

74.    These institutional arrangements were the subject of the multi-stakeholder ―Conference
on the Institutional and Management Framework for Dar es Salaam Water Supply” held in
December 2009 (see Annex 6). Following the workshop, the World Bank mission recommended
immediate actions, including:

       The review of the institutional arrangements to allow an enforceable principal-agent
        relationship;

       Considering the option of transferring the responsibility for bulk water supply to
        DAWASA and allowing DAWASCO to buy water in bulk and distribute it;

       Entering into several short-term output-based service contracts to address key water
        production, treatment and transmission issues;

       Restructuring DAWASCO into several semi-autonomous geographical units;

       Outsourcing DAWASCO activities - such as non-revenue water (NRW) reduction,
        cleaning up the customer data base, and extension of distribution networks to un-served
        areas; and

       Making cost estimates and financing plans (including the need for external financing) for
        the proposed contracts within 12 months.

75.    Most of these recommendations were not implemented.              Only the first action was
completed when the project closed in December 2010.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Regulation

76.     The GOT created an independent regulator as part of its strategy to promote private
participation in water services. An independent regulator is not necessarily compatible with a
lease contract model unless the regulator incorporates the provisions of the lease contract into the
regulatory framework ex-post, or its terms are designed to be consistent with a pre-existing
regulatory regime. Neither condition was met in this case and regulatory conflicts per se did not
arise during the tenure of the private operator. EWURA started operating after the private

                                                20
operator had departed. Prior to that, the Minister acted as the Interim Regulator and made
decisions on the basis of the lease contract terms.

77.      EWURA did not approve annual tariff indexations. Instead it treated requests for
indexation as periodic tariff revisions, for which the criteria are more stringent. Thus tariffs were
not indexed for three years (2006, 2007, and 2008). EWURA’s refusal to adjust tariffs was
contrary to expectations that considered indexation to be guaranteed by the lease contract. The
failure to index tariffs contributed to the poor financial performance of the services between 2006
and 2009, and compromised the GOT’s commitment to ensure financial viability. Also,
DAWASA and DAWASCO were required to meet criteria for which no other entity was holding
them accountable, which improved their accountability but did not resolve the principal-agent
issues discussed above.

3.7 Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

(a) Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

79.      In the 90s the Bank encouraged the engagement of private operators in water supply
services. In Tanzania, the Bank and the IMF had urged the GOT to engage a private operator for
several years, and the GOT was eager to do so. When the GOT was approached by a private
operator to provide water supply services, the Bank advised it to open this up to bidders in a
transparent and competitive manner. It was in this strongly pro-private sector environment that
project preparation began. The preparation team invested significant resources in supporting the
GOT’s effort to choose an operator, relying heavily on experience with private operators in west
African countries where lease contracts had been successful and the signing of the Lease Contract
was a condition of project approval. These experiences helped the team to identify potential
challenges and risks, however the financial loss that the GOT could incur in the event of the
operator’s default was not identified as a risk in the PAD and PSRC, and its transaction advisors
did not act on the recommendation that the parent company of the bidder be required to provide
the performance bond. The risk that EWURA would not allow annual tariff adjustments to reflect
inflation was considered to be modest but this was underestimated.

80.      The Bank’s preparation team had concerns about the selection process, and the selected
private operator’s technical capacity and financial viability. It recognized that the Lease Contract
did not provide protection against some risks identified by other bidders. The Bank nevertheless
raised no objection to the bid documents and subsequently to the contract. In hindsight, the
warning signs that emerged during preparation appear more obvious than they did at the time. If
these had been recognized, the Bank might have suspended preparation and reassessed the
proposed project at an early stage. It is worth mentioning that Bank management was aware of
the difficulties encountered by the project team and was very supportive of the team throughout
the process.

81.     The capital investment strategy and the CWSSP were well-designed. The investment
components emphasized emergency rehabilitation works, reducing NRW, and increasing
connections in the early years, followed by limited expansion works. Procurement documents for
the works were ready when financing for the project became effective. A detailed matrix of
project outcome and output indicators linked to project components was developed. More
emphasis could have been placed on the importance of rigorous beneficiary impact surveys and
willingness to pay studies as tools for measuring the impact of the Project and for planning. For
example, their profile would have been enhanced had they been listed as project output indicators.

Quality of Supervision

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.      The Bank performed reasonably well regarding the overall implementation of
rehabilitation works and capital investments, ensuring fiduciary compliance and building
DAWASA’s capacity to manage the project. But it faced challenges ensuring environmental and
social compliance and creating M&E capacity. The Bank team also ensured a smooth transition
of the activities supported under Component 5 which are currently being implemented under
WSDP. The Bank team was also pro-active in advising and guiding DAWASA and MOWI’s
attempts to resolve the crisis and renegotiate the contract with CWS. However, given the
dysfunctional nature of the institutional arrangements that emerged, it should have taken a
stronger stance with regard to restructuring the DAWASA/DAWASCO arrangement — for
example, declining to extend the closing date until this was done. The government’s slow action
to ensure adequate arrangements for successful operation of the water supply affected the
performance of DAWASCO, and this reflected negatively on the project outputs.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

83.     The mixed but disappointing outcome of the project was due not to the failure of
individual staff members but to institutional factors that favored pushing forward with the project
despite conditions that were likely to compromise success. The actions taken were not sufficient
to reverse poor performance or improve sustainability of outcomes.

(b) Borrower Performance

Government Performance

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

84.     During the preparation phase, the GOT was keen to attract a private operator and pushed
hard to create the conditions for PPP. However, perhaps as a result of its lack of prior experience
with PPP, it failed to recognize that the difficult conditions in Dar es Salaam required a more
experienced private operator and posed significant risks to bidders. The PRSC did not take heed
of the Bank’s advice in this regard. It is likely that more than one bid would have been submitted
had PSRC been more responsive to bidders’ requests for risks to be addressed in the draft contract.
It also did not accept the recommendation that the parent company provide the performance
guarantee — it is unclear if Biwater objected or whether PSRC may not have recognized the risk.

85.      In many respects, the GOT’s performance during project implementation was satisfactory.
It took a number of important actions that were important for the success of the project. While
the private operator was in place, tariffs were indexed annually — although EWURA
subsequently refused to allow annual indexation of tariffs from 2006 – 2009. After the private
operator was terminated, the GOT injected TSh 2.0 billion in equity, contributed to the
retrenchment of DAWASCO staff, rescheduled DAWASA’s debt service until 2010/2011, and
honored its commitment to ensure that government entities paid water bills – though both


                                                23
operator’s inability to verify the amounts consumed made it difficult to take advantage of this
commitment.

86.      But the GOT’s actions on other critical issues were unsatisfactory. First, the failure to
establish an effective principal-agent relationship between DAWASA and DAWASCO weakened
overall project performance. This was the most serious shortcoming, because it undermined the
accountability of the two entities, the achievement of project outcomes, and the long-term
sustainability of the services. At project closing, the legal revisions necessary to restructure the
relationship had not been implemented. Second, EWURA’s actions contributed to the poor
financial performance of DAWASCO and the failure to achieve project outcomes. However,
their position regarding the indexation of tariffs was consistent with their legislation and
regulations (which was upheld by the Tanzanian Fair Competition Tribunal). EWURA’s
decisions revealed an inconsistency between the regulatory framework and the project that will
need to be taken into account in future operations8. Third, on one occasion, the GOT did not take
planned steps to ensure compliance with safeguards - allowing the construction of houses within
20 meters of the fences around the stabilization ponds, despite recommendations of the Bank
team. A directive from the Prime Minister that no house be pulled down meant that these houses
remain closer to the ponds than desirable— posing possible safety and health risks. Finally, the
GOT’s decision not to accept DAWASA’s proposal to convert the CWS sub-loan into equity,
reduce the interest rate from 11.5 to 5 percent, and provide further deferment of debt repayment
for three more years until July 2013 will have a significant impact on project sustainability.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

87.     The implementing agency, DAWASA, was ultimately responsible for its own
performance and that of its contractors, initially CWS and later DAWASCO. DAWASA’s
positive accomplishments included successful completion of all capital works within budget, and
taking satisfactory action to address many of the issues that were identified jointly with the Bank,
including procurement and contract management issues, and the need to develop an in-house
planning capacity. Secondly, DAWASA’s role in implementation of CWSSP was also positive,
and most issues that arose were effectively resolved. Thirdly, studies aimed at the development
of future water sources and identification of medium-term capital works program were also
completed on time, and the introduction of the EDAMS network asset and modeling systems was
a major step forward— providing a good foundation for improving the management of the
network.

88.     Areas where DAWASA’s performance could have improved were (i) the timeliness of
completion of capital works and bulk metering, (ii) more systematic and effective management of
operational performance data, (iii) more rigorous supervision of NBS household surveys, (iv) and,
more decisive and timely action with regard to resettlement and encroachers within stabilization
pond boundaries. In addition, DAWASAs relationship with DAWASCO was difficult to manage,
because the principal-agent problem was not solved. Despite the lack of effective oversight,
DAWASCO’s positive accomplishments included the downsizing of staff numbers, creation of

 As the lease contract was designed before EWURA had been created, its establishment introduced new
challenges that had not been anticipated earlier.

                                                24
performance incentives for managers and staff, and the decentralization of commercial operations.
Although collection efficiency (collected amount as a percentage of amount billed) eventually
reached an acceptable level, the very low amounts billed and collected created serious problems.
By project closing, collections amounted to only 60 percent of the target in 2009/10 and NRW, at
53 percent, remained unacceptably high. DAWASCO finally began to pay Rental Fees to
DAWASA regularly in March 2009, but its prior failure to pay accrued fees caused the latter to
require subsidies from the GOT.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

        Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

89.      The performance of both the GOT and the implementation agency was rated moderately
unsatisfactory. This reflects the mixed experience with respect to capital works, which were
satisfactorily implemented (with some delays), and the inadequate performance and failure to
take action to promote financial sustainability and accountability. These actions are likely to
contribute to deterioration of the positive achievements with regard to several outcome and output
targets.

3.8 Lessons Learned

(a) Examine a wider range of factors affecting success

90.      During project preparation and implementation there is a natural tendency to focus on the
factors that are most visible. These include the institutional framework, the identification and
design of rehabilitation and capital works, procurement matters, and environmental and social
safeguards. Less attention is paid to factors that could undermine successful implementation.
However, as this experience shows, the least visible conditions can significantly affect
improvements in operational and commercial performance.

(b) Take the concerns of a range of qualified potential bidders into account

91.      Borrowers need to be diligent in assessing the market and developing strategies for
attracting qualified bidders. PSRC’s failure to accommodate concerns of experienced potential
bidders regarding risks that had not been adequately mitigated. As a result two bidders withdrew
from the competition. The remaining bidder (Biwater’s) ability to deliver results was
overestimated and it was ultimately unable to overcome the challenges it faced. The concerns of
other bidders therefore appear to have been justified, and failure to take them into account
affected the success of the project.

(c) Withdraw or change course when project related issues cannot be resolved satisfactorily

92.      Perhaps the World Bank should have been more willing to withdraw from supporting the
transaction and the project when the selection process did not progress in a constructive and
transparent manner and afterwards, when the conditions to improve performance were not created.
Likewise, the GOT should have taken more timely action to adapt the lease contract and
straighten out the institutional arrangements between DAWASA and DAWASCO when it
became apparent that the lack of a principal-agent relationship was problematic.


                                               25
(d) Develop contingency plans in event of termination of the private operator’s contract

93.      Before the private operator’s contract was terminated in Dar es Salaam, little thought was
given to a contingency plan. Under duress, the GOT took emergency action to establish a public
operator to take over immediately. Although this action ensured the continued provision of
services in the short term, the arrangement was not adapted to circumstance and proved to be a
sub-optimal solution. Proposals for improving the institutional framework were developed five
years after the private operator’s contract was terminated. Although the possibility of contract
termination is always acknowledged in legal documents, the practical follow-up steps are rarely
given much thought in advance. Developing guidelines that could be followed in the event of a
collapse of a contract might pay off in the longer term. Such guidelines should address not only
short-term emergency actions but also subsequent steps to establish sustainable medium-term
solutions.

(e) Develop rigorous systems and processes for reporting, monitoring, and collecting
performance data

94.     The development of coordinated systems for monitoring, verifying, and using operational
and commercial data for strategic direction was underemphasized. DAWASA, DAWASCO,
EWURA, MOWI needed access to such data, as well as the financing agencies that support the
services. But information was scattered, inconsistent, and was barely used for strategic planning
and monitoring. Systems and processes for defining, measuring, recording, and verifying
information need to be developed early in project implementation. Implementing entities should
be required to develop strategic planning capacity and processes based on reliable information.
Credible data and plans for addressing shortcomings will help to avoid embarrassing criticism by
other well-meaning development partners.

(f) Ensure relevance and standard definitions of performance indicators

95.      Some of the project outcome and output indicators did not reflect the highest priorities
and there were definitional problems. For example, the indicator that 70 percent of customers
would have access to piped water 24 hours per day was not meaningful when only 17 percent of
households have a piped water connection. A more relevant indicator might have been the
percentage of households (or population) with access to improved water services 24 hours per day,
including boreholes, kiosks and yard taps. The Bank (Sector Board) has already taken steps to
establish and define standard indicators that address this issue. In addition, performance targets
that become unachievable during the course of a project should be revised. Otherwise, targets are
irrelevant and performance monitoring may be either neglected or meaningless.

(g) Ensure consistency of contract terms and the regulatory framework

96.     It was assumed that the independent regulator would honor the provisions of the lease
contract with regards to annual indexation of tariff. In addition, DAWASA’s Memorandum of
Understanding with MOWI did not specify tariff rules and procedures at all. Instead, it referred
to the lease contract, leaving DAWASA somewhat vulnerable in this regard. Such situations
need to be foreseen and taken into account in designing projects and contracts (whether with
private or public entities). One solution is for the regulator and other key actors to develop a
consensus on tariff priorities and policies so that all entities support the tariff provisions of
contracts. If the regulator cannot be bound in that way, contracts should include provisions for

                                                26
compensating the affected entities (asset holder, operator, etc.) for regulatory decisions that are
not consistent with the relevant terms of their contracts.

(h) Ensure the effectiveness of performance bonds

97.      The fact that DAWASA was unable to call part of CWS’ performance bond came as a
surprise and resulted in a delay in holding the Operator accountable and financial losses for the
GOT. The transaction advisors should have caught and remedied this flaw. In addition, the
feasibility of requiring the parent company of a limited liability private operator to provide a
performance bond or another protective mechanism needs to be examined, especially when
World Bank or IDA funds will be on-lent to the private operator. As noted earlier, after the
transfer of the lease contract from CWS to DAWASCO, no performance bond was required –
because of DAWASCO’s status as a public entity.

(i) Use surveys to guide operational strategies and plan future interventions

98.     While surveys of beneficiaries were foreseen as a key component of the project’s M&E
framework, rigorous surveys were not carried out. Better results might have been obtained if
more details had been specified in the PAD and if the completion of the surveys had been
included in the output indicators. The participation of contracted professionals may be necessary
to promote rigor while building the capacity of the national agency. The results of such surveys
should be examined by supervision mission and their implications discussed with the government
and Implementing Agencies.

3.9 Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower, Implementing Agencies and
Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

99.      DAWASA’s ICR provides a more positive outlook of the project than this ICR, primarily
because it assesses performance from a technical perspective and therefore gives more weight to
the completion of important rehabilitation and construction works that were completed during the
project and constituted a significant portion of loan proceeds. DAWASA had reservations from
the start that (under the conditions prevailing at the start of the project) the Operator could turn
around the utilities performance enough to ensure sufficient water supply until 2008 when the
project was expected to close. When the CWS contract failed DAWASA requested a change to
the PDOs to reflect more modest expectations for DAWASCO, however, this change was not
made. As noted above, the PDO should have been adjusted to take these concerns into account.

(b) Co-financiers

100.   Comments received from the AfDB are detailed in a separate Project Completion Report
(PCR) which is attached as Annex 8.

101.    Overall, AfDB perceived the performance of the government to have been moderately
unsatisfactory as tariff indexing was observed during the time that the private Operator was in
place but as the Private Operator left the GOT abandoned tariff indexing. This lack of political
will to support the project had and continues to have a profound effect on cash flows for


                                                27
DAWASCO and DAWASA. In addition, the audit reports for the project have consistently
shown that there is poor performance by the two Implementing Agencies (IAs). No action has
ever been taken by the GOT to address implicit management challenges at both IAs. In addition,
the performance of implementing agencies is considered to have been unsatisfactory, because
both DAWASA and DAWASCO have audited financial statements which reflect operating costs
that are higher than gross revenues. In fact, the trend has been that these operating costs continue
to rise while revenues remain flat. It is of grave concern that gross water revenues should
continue to be flat while metering and therefore billing has been increasing. More worrying is the
seeming inability of management to keep operating costs in line with revenues. Thus,
DAWASCO is unable to meet operation and maintenance costs, and is not sustainable even in the
short-term. Furthermore, DAWASA will not be able to meet its long repayment obligations.

102.    Regarding its unaccounted for water (UFW), which was 57 percent in 2009, DAWASA
and DAWASCO have for the past several years been unable to give a breakdown in terms of how
much of the water was lost due to the following: illegitimate or illegal connections, leaks,
disconnections. In fact, DAWASCO, even at the end of the project, is still unable to present a
clean database of its connected customers. These kinds of challenges are expected at the
beginning of the project, not at the end. Finally, in the past three or so years, the
recommendations to DAWASA and DAWASCO management especially on financial
management have been the same. However, minimal action, if any, has been taken, either by the
IAs, management, or the GOT, by way of corrective measures on the matters raised by the
financiers.

103.   Finally, the financiers could, with the benefit of hindsight, at some stage or other, have
taken measures to stop the poor project performance. Perhaps one option could have been to
suspend disbursements until corrective steps were taken.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
    1. Financial Analysis
As part of the ICR exercise, a review of the financial performance of the water supply operator
(DAWASCO) was undertaken. A full review of the financial performance of DAWASCO and
DAWASA relative to the projections of the PAD was not undertaken, simply because too many
assumptions of the original analysis were no longer applicable. A few of the original assumptions
are noted here:

       The original analysis was built around a 10-year lease of the water supply assets to a
        private sector operator. As discussed elsewhere, the lease was abandoned early in the
        Project.
       Original financial projections were based on 1999/2000 information, which itself was not
        considered reliable.
       Projections were also based in part on the bid of the selected leaseholder.
       Project investments during the first two years of the Project were critical to the
        institutions’ financial turnaround, including US$30 million to reduce UFW to be
        completed by Year 2.
       Reductions in UFW were to enable a growing customer base; improved collections –
        reaching 90 percent of billings by year 5 – were to underpin cash generation and the
        accumulation of reserves.

Tariffs were to be indexed annually to inflation

The original projections indicated financial viability for both the asset holder (DAWASA) and the
operator. Negative operational cash flows were projected for the first three years, but cash flows
would turn positive beyond year four. Owner’s equity was projected to stay positive throughout
the period of analysis. Most importantly, projections showed that profits would contribute to cash
reserves that would be sufficient to pay debt service.

As detailed in this ICR, serious problems resulted in (i) the breakdown of the lease agreement
between DAWASA and the operator and the subsequent takeover of management of the operator;
(ii) consequent delays in the implementation of management and operational reforms; and
(iii) delays in the implementation of key system investments. Other deviations from the
assumptions – such as the regulator not approving tariff indexing for several years – contributed
to operational and financial performance far below expectations. A few key comparisons (Table
A3.1) illustrate the gap:

Summary of Operator Financial Performance

The following provides a brief overview of the financial performance of the operator over the last
several years. In contrast to original projections, the operator has suffered operating and net
losses each of the years reviewed. This has been due to a number of operational factors – most
importantly, continued high water losses, and the related inability to sufficiently increase the
underlying customer base due to water unavailability. That said, an additional key factor,
somewhat beyond the control of the operator (although linked to its inability to improve its
operational performance), was the lack of indexing of revenues over several years. Only for
fiscal year 2010 did the regulator allow an increase in tariffs reflecting cumulative inflation over
the previous three years.

While the above figures (Table A3.2) reflect operational results, DAWASCO has done worse on
a cash basis, reflecting weaker-than-expected collections. DAWASCO’s net trade receivables
(i.e., after write-offs for uncollectible debt) have increased each of the last three years, from TSh
4.4 billion at end FY 2008, to TSh 7.1 billion at end FY 2010. More concerning, however, has
been significantly higher increases in DAWASCO’s trade payables. These have increased from
TSh 5.7 billion at end FY 2007 to TSh 28.2 billion at end FY 2010 – a TSh 22.5 billion increase
over a three-year period, which reflects expenses that exceed revenues and poor collections of
billings. Accumulated losses for DAWASCO now stand at TSh 33.5 billion; shareholders’ equity
is now a negative TSh 31.5 billion.

DAWASCO and DAWASA are expected to begin repaying interest and principal on their
borrowings from international financial institutions next year; debt service next year is expected
to be over TSh 20 billion, declining by about TSh 1 billion each year after that. Given
DAWASCO’s financial performance, and the fact that DAWASA’s available income is wholly
reliant on DAWASCO’s performance, it is clear that there is simply no possibility of the debt
being successfully serviced under current conditions. A declaration of bankruptcy isn’t possible
and the government will have to take on the debt service until the utility is able to generate
sufficient revenues.

     2. Economic Analysis
Re-creating the economic analysis of the PAD will not be attempted for a number of reasons:

The quality of data was an issue during appraisal. The analysis assumed that a large part of the
project’s benefits would be for households using kiosks (hereinafter referred to as kiosks). The
latter group of kiosk consumers would benefit from time savings and household expenditure
savings (due to the introduction of a lifeline rate). Yet, the household survey that was published
at the time of appraisal noted that most households using piped water depended on their
neighbors in supplying this water, while the number of kiosk users was very small.

The availability and quality of data is still a major issue. Different sources of data (DAWASCO,
household surveys carried out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), and the Energy and
Water Utilities Regulating Authority (EWURA)) are inconsistent, and it is therefore impossible to
reconcile the data in different parts of the PAD. For example, the original economic model could
not be used, because there is little actual data to complete it, — the economic analysis was based
on a large number of assumptions regarding amongst others the actual water use by different
consumer categories and the prices of water from different sources.

The lack of reliable data makes it extremely difficult to get a clear picture of what the Project has
achieved in terms of expansion of the customer base, changes in the composition of the customer
base, actual revenues collected by the different consumer categories and the like.

For example, in the case of DAWASCO coverage, the household survey conducted by NBS in
Dar es Salaam states that piped water coverage is close to 54 percent in 200913, compared to 81
percent as presented by DAWASCO/DAWASA and 82 percent by EWURA14. Even though the
numbers provided by DAWASCO and EWURA are close, the number of residential connections
is not very consistent with these coverage rates unless every single household provides water to at
least 3-4 households. Yet, the household surveys that were undertaken as part of the Project do
not provide evidence for such high levels of connections being shared. In the 2009 household
survey for instance, it was found that only 15 percent of customers share their connections with
their neighbors– with most of the sharing of connections linked to landlords providing water to
their renters through a single connection.

     (a) Beneficiaries of the Project

The immediate outcome of the Project was to provide a ―reliable, affordable and sustainable
water supply service and improve sewerage and sanitation in the service area of the Dar es
Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA)‖. It was assumed that the reduction of non
revenue water from 58 percent in 2003 to 35 percent in 2008 and the introduction of boreholes
(CWSSP) for those far from the network would provide the incremental water that would enable
the utility to expand its services. It was assumed that the Project would improve:


13
   It is unclear whether definitions of piped water used by DAWASA, EWURA and NBS are consistent.
For example under the CWSSP, 1700 households and 496 kiosks were connected through small piped
networks that relied on boreholes. DAWASA may have included borehole based piped water supplies in
their piped water supply statistics.
14
   EWURA’s definition does not refer to piped water.

                                                 34
        The quality and reliability of services to 100,000 connections serving about 1 million
         people and 1,000 kiosks serving another 1 million residents;
        The expansion of the service to 385,000 people through direct connections, 300,000
         people through kiosks, and 170,000 through the community water supply and sanitation
         services;
        Lead to a more equitable service by allowing direct access to piped water currently
         relying on neighbors or vendors;
        Improve revenue collection; and
        Introduce more efficient pricing.

Table A3.3 provides a breakdown of the beneficiaries that the NBS survey reports as having
benefited from the project. It shows that by 2009, 257,000 people gained direct access starting in
2006, while the number of people benefiting from access to kiosks increased by 31,000. As such,
an additional 288,000 people were reported to have benefited between 2006 and 200915. Yet, as
other NGOs also provided funds to DAWASA and DAWASCO and private boreholes were also
sunk, it is not clear how far the Bank Project can attribute these improvements to its actions. At
the same time, there was a decline in service provision through neighbors (155,000 people),
vendors (11,000 people), and others (67,000 people), totaling 233,000 people benefiting from
more equitable services.

Improvements in the quality and reliability of service were mixed. The percentage of
DAWASCO customers with a 24-hour water supply service under adequate pressure declined.
However, the number of people with improved reliability (as measured by service being available
at least on a daily basis) increased for people with access to house connections (from 39.6 percent
in 2006 to 66.9 percent in 2009 – or 114,000 people), but declined for people depending on yard
connections (from 44.9 percent in 2006 to 37.3 percent in 2009. In absolute numbers, there was
still an increase in the number of people (44,000 people) benefiting from daily water supply. The

  These data may not adequately account for the CWSSP water supplies which added another 275,000
customers through 50 schemes in areas that did not have access to the network.

                                                     35
quality of water supply exceeded the target (95%) as measured by the percentage of water
samples in distribution that meet standards specified in the Lease Contract on an annual basis. By
2009, 96.9% were meeting these standards compared to 70 percent in 2003/04.

With the progress made in improving services as documented between the household surveys in
2006 (baseline survey) and 2009, it appears that the targets set in the PAD were only partially met
through a combination of borehole (CWSSP) and DAWASCO services. These targets were
partially met due to various factors, particularly the limited availability of water available for
distribution.

     3. Economic Analysis during Project Appraisal
Replicating the economic analysis as laid out in the PAD is not possible with the data currently
available. Essentially, most of the information that needs to be included in the analysis can either
not be supplied, or if there is some data available, it cannot be verified.

The economic analysis assumed a set of benefits including (i) household expenditure savings by
existing and new domestic customers; (ii) household expenditure savings by existing and new
kiosk customers; (iii) time savings from not having to spend time fetching water; and
(iv) adjusted for the losses sustained by water vendors and by connected households selling water
to their neighbors.

     (a) Household Expenditure Savings for Domestic Consumers

The idea was that the introduction of a lifeline rate for domestic customers in combination with
inflation indexed tariffs would result in household expenditure savings for households. The
lifeline rate has been introduced, but it is unlikely that this has had a big impact on household
expenditure on water due to the fact that most connections are likely to have relatively high
consumption levels. The average consumption per connection based on DAWASCO data (and
assuming active connections only) is about 50 cum per month, because neighbors often shared
taps. As such, the savings that resulted from the small lifeline block of 5 cum per month is
relatively limited — most of the households targeted by this lifeline tariff consumed above this
level.

     (b) Time Savings

There has been a reduction in the number of people relying on neighbors. Yet, most of the time
savings benefits were related to kiosk users who would benefit from more kiosks that would
reduce the time needed to haul water. According to the NBS survey, the number of kiosks served
from DAWASCO’s network increased from 115 in 2006 to 195 in 2009. Yet, according to
DAWASCO, the number of kiosks was 295 in 2009 (of which 80 percent were functioning)16. In
view of the very limited number of kiosk users, time savings are largely a function of households
relying on neighbors. While these are hard to calculate – because it depends on how far the
neighbor lives from the household with a connection -- it is likely that the distance to a neighbor’s

 This increase may be the result of adding CWSSP kiosks which were installed by DAWASA rather than
DAWASCO.

                                                 36
yard is shorter than to a kiosk. None of the two household surveys provide any details on the
actual time spent hauling by households depending on neighbor water.

     (c) Changes in the Water Vendor Market

The changes in the water vendor market have been marginal. Although the proportion of the
population depending on mobile vendors decreased from 9.9 percent in 2006 to 8.4 percent in
2009, the effect in absolute terms was very small. Water vendors saw a decline in their customer
base of only 9,000 people. Hence, the loss in market share is minimal – as they lost less than 3
percent of their customer base between 2006 and 2009.

     4. Results
Because of the inherent problems in replicating the economic analysis under these circumstances,
it is suggested that the economic analysis as calculated during Project appraisal should not be
replicated. This analysis was based on conducting a financial analysis and adding (or subtracting)
the benefits (losses) that were described above. As these benefits (losses) are likely to have been
minimal, we are left with the results of the financial analysis. However, the results of the
financial analysis which assesses the cash flow with the Project and without the Project shows
that the net operating revenues are growing steadily worse and the net present value is negative.

Unit cost efficiency

The Project’s total cost, including contingencies, was estimated at US$164 million, of which
US$106 million was allocated for water supply; (ii) US$22.4 for wastewater/sewerage;
(iii) US$3.85 for community water supply; and (iv) US$31 million for institutional strengthening.

The water supply component was US$106 million (without contingencies) at Project appraisal,
and at the end of implementation. During appraisal, it was estimated that 685,000 people would
benefit from new connections (35,000 connections, 250 new kiosks) and another 2 million people
from improved services (rehabilitation of 100,000 connections and 1,000 kiosks) – resulting in a
unit cost of US$39 per capita17. At the close of the project, the total number of people benefitting
from new connections was 416,290, (from 12,029 connections at an average of 10 people per
connection and 296 kiosks at 1,000 people per kiosk) and 275,000 served through CWSSP; and
the number of people with access to improved services (consumers receiving service daily) was
1,000,000 (100,000 rehabilitated connections) resulting in a per capita cost of US$62 (or
1,691,290 people served)18.

The Project also spent more than US$22 million on wastewater/sewerage improvements. The
benefits from this component are hard to assess as the data on the number of incremental
sewerage connections also shows large inconsistencies. DAWASA reports show an increase of
11,000 new sewer connections (and assuming that the wastewater from all these new connections
is collected and treated) between 2006 and 2009, which would translate to a cost of US$2,000 per


17
   CWS declared moribund all connections without water or with illegal connections bringing down the
total number of connections at the start to 53,832.
18
   Most of the original 1,000 standposts or kiosks were either abandoned, shut down or converted into
domestic connections.

                                                 37
connection. Although this is a high cost, especially when benchmarked against the cost of such
service elsewhere in the world, the outputs exceed what was expected in the PAD (increase
sewerage connections from 3,000 to 5,400). Other sources show very little improvement in the
number of sewerage connections (such as the EWURA data).

The Community Water Supply and Sanitation Program was estimated to cost US$3.85 million
while providing 170,000 people with services, which at appraisal resulted in a per capita cost of
US$23. Benefits from this component have been positive and are continuing to increase.
DAWASCO reported 65,000 beneficiaries in 2009, or an actual cost per capita is US$59, but by
the end of the Project a census carried out by DAWASA showed that 275,000 had benefited – a
per capita cost of about US$14. The exact number of beneficiaries from the CWSSP requires
further verification as the population in the CWSSP areas has increased significantly. DAWASA
is currently planning a second census that will establish the impact of the project.

In conclusion, the economic benefits are unclear as some of the Project benefits remain to be
realized (e.g. 20,000 connections are still being installed by DAWASA with fittings purchased
through the Project), and the data available at the start as well as that collected by the different
agencies during implementation was deficient. The overall high unit costs for the different
Project components suggest that it has not been very efficient in using its resources.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results – 2009 NBS Survey
    1. Executive Summary

    (a) Objective of the 2009 Follow-up Survey

The main objective of the 2009 Follow-up Survey is to assess the impact of the Dar es Salaam
Water Supply and Sanitation Project aimed at improving service delivery to different parts of the
city commonly known as DAWASA Service Areas especially for the low income community
after the completion of the 2006 Baseline Survey.

    (b) Coverage of the Study

The survey covered the DAWASA Service Area in Dar es Salaam City as well as Kibaha and
Bagamoyo districts in Pwani region. According to the 2002 Population and Housing Census
projections, the DAWASA Service Area has a population size of 3.2 million in year 2009
compared to 2.7 million people in 2006. The areas covered in this study are attached in
Appendix1.

    (c) Sample Design

A scientific multi-stage (statistical) sample was designed to draw up 67 Primary Sampling Units
(PSUs) from the DAWASA service area. These PSUs are drawn from the 2002 Population and
Housing Census sample frame. The selection was distributed proportionally to the size of the
population that is served by DAWASA in Dar es Salaam, and Coast regions. In each selected
sampling unit (also referred to as cluster) all households that reside inside the geographical
boundaries of each cluster were listed exhaustively.

All listed households were given equal chance of being selected and a representative sample of 23
households was drawn from each cluster. Thus, a total number of 1,541 households were selected.
This sample is expected to provide estimates at district and regional levels.

    (d) Survey Instruments

In the 2009 Follow up Survey, a household questionnaire was designed to solicit information
from the selected households. The questionnaire was more less the same to the one which was
used in 2006 Baseline Survey. The household questionnaire was modified to suit the information
sought by the client. Later on, the survey questionnaires were translated from English into
Kiswahili to ease data collection exercise. The household Questionnaire is attached as Appendix
II. Also, Global Positioning System (GPS) machines were used to record the interviewed
household coordinates.

    2. Findings
Household Characteristics

The survey interviewed a total of 1519 Households in all selected clusters (67) in DAWASA
Service Area. Majority of selected households were from Kinondoni district (619 households)

                                               41
followed by Temeke (417) and Ilala (368). Pwani region had 115 households of which 69 were
selected from Kibaha district and 46 households in Bagamoyo district.

Results show that 80.8 percent of the selected households are headed by males and only 19.2
percent are headed by females. At the district level, Kinondoni recorded the highest proportion of
households that are headed by females (19.4 percent) followed by Ilala (18.8 percent) and
Temeke (18.2 percent). Bagamoyo has the lowest proportion of female headed households (13
percent).

Results show that the selected households had more females (51.1 percent) than males (48.9
percent), representing a sex ratio of 95.5. This means that for every 100 females there are about
96 males. About 30 percent of the survey population is comprised of those under 15 years old,
those aged between 15 and 59 years were 65.1 percent and only 5.3 percent were aged people
aged 60 years and above.

    (a) Socio-Economic Profile

Level of Education

Results indicate that 53.3 percent of the household members have primary education, 21.8 percent
have secondary education and about four percent have university education. The proportion of
the population without education accounts for about four percent. Results also show that there
were a significant percentage of persons who did not indicate their level of education attained
(10.2 percent).

Employment Status

The data show that 32.7 percent of the survey population in the working age group (15-59) were
self employed followed by students (32.1 percent) while unemployed persons accounted for 12.8
percent. Other groups namely employed or permanent workers accounted for 11.7 percent of the
survey population and 5.5 percent were casual workers.

Income Level of the Households

Results show that 32.5 percent of households have earnings between TShs 100,000 and TSh
299,999, followed by those earning between TSh 60,000 and TSh 99,999 (25.7 percent).
Households which are earning less than TSh 60,000 accounted for 17.3 percent and 10.9 percent
are earning between TSh 300,000 and 499,999. About four percent of households are earning
between TSh 500,000 and 699,999 and 4.2 percent of households are earning TSh 700,000 or
more.

Ownership of Assets

A substantial proportion of households in DAWASA Service Area own houses (46.7 percent),
42.3 percent own land or plot, while those who hire land or plot account for 11.5 percent.




                                               42
    3. Water Source and Supply

    (a) Basic Information

Within DAWASA service area, about nine percent of households have water sources located
within their premises (in-house), 11.3 percent of households have their water sources located in
their plots/yard and 51.1 percent were getting their water from neighbors’ yard/plot. When this is
compared with the 2006 results, the proportion of households which have their water sources
located in-house increased by about three percent and slightly more than two percent among
households with sources based in own plot/yard but declined among households using sources
located in neighbors’ plot/yard from 53.9 observed in 2006 to 51.1percent in 2009.

About seven percent of households within DAWASA service area are using water from kiosks,
5.7 percent have access to water provided by institutions and water vendors continue to play an
important role in providing water to 13.2 percent of the survey households.

    (b) Piped Water

The 2009 Follow-up Survey is the second after the first 2006 Baseline Survey that was conducted
in 2006. Results show that 53.8 percent of the households in the DAWASA Service Area were
using piped water. The 2006 Baseline Survey showed that the proportion of households which
were using piped water (59.6 percent) was much higher than that observed in the 2009 Follow-up
Survey. In Dar es Salaam, 51.4 percent of the survey households are using piped water as
revealed in the 2009 survey. This shows a decline in the proportion of households when it is
compared with those in 2006 (57.9 percent). A similar pattern is also observed in the survey
districts. This decline is possibly due to development of new settlements in some of the selected
clusters.

In-House Piped Water

Results show that there is a sizeable increase from about ten percent of households with in-house
water facility observed in the 2006 Baseline Survey to 15.1 percent revealed in the 2009 survey.
In Dar es Salaam, the proportion of households with in-house water facility increased from 10.2
percent in 2006 Baseline Survey to 14.3 percent in 2009.

At district level, the proportion of households with in- house water facilities increased during the
2006/2009 period. In Kinondoni district, the proportion of households with in-house water
facility increased from 10.3 percent in 2006 to 15.8 percent in 2009. Kibaha recorded the highest
increase of households with in-house piped water in their houses from about six percent in 2006
Baseline Survey to 27.5 percent in 2009.

Overall, about 85 percent of households in DAWASA Service Area, with in house water facilities,
use it for their own consumption and only 15 percent share with other households. Most in-house
water connections are within 50 metres from the main water pipe. Ilala is the only exception
where about six percent of the water connections are more than 1,000 metres away from the main
water pipes.




                                                43
Status of Water Connections

In assessing the working condition of in-house water connections, results show that there is a
decline from 97.7 percent observed in the 2006 Baseline Survey to 92.9 percent of households in
DAWASA Service Area in the 2009 Follow-up Survey. Analysis by district shows that all
districts reported fairly above 80 percent of households that had their connections working.

Availability of In-House Piped Water

Within DAWASA Service Area, 66.9 percent of households with in-house piped water were
getting water daily, about nine percent get water once in two to three days while 11.9 percent
responded that availability of water in households was unpredictable. At District level, 73.4
percent of households in Kinondoni with in-house piped water connections get water daily, 5.1
percent get once in 2-3 days and 10.1 percent of such households stated that availability of water
is unpredictable. In Ilala District, 80.0 percent get water daily, 13.3 percent get water more than
once a week and 6.7 percent are not sure on when they would get water. In Temeke, for
categories of households getting water daily and once in two to three days constituted about 40.0
percent each.

Availability of in-house piped water on a daily basis has increased from 39.5 percent in 2006 to
66.9 percent in 2009. Conversely, unpredictability of water flows declined to 11.9 percent from
20.9 percent of households that was recorded in 2006.

On the duration of water flow, results show that, overall, 79.7 percent of households within the
DAWASA Service Area (which were getting water whether daily or occasionally) were getting
water for six or more hours, about five percent were getting water for a period between four and
five hours, and five percent indicated that the flow was unpredictable. These results indicate a
significant increase in availability of water among households that get water for 6 or more hours
whereby the proportion of households increased from 60.5 percent recorded in 2006 to 79.7
percent in 2009. The proportion of households that reported that the flow was unpredictable has
declined considerably from 15.1 percent recorded in 2006 to five percent of households in 2009.

Water Meter Connections

Results from the survey reveal that 85.7 percent of households which reported to have in-house
piped water connections in DAWASA Service Area were fitted with water meters. At district
level, while Kinondoni had the highest proportion of households fitted with water meters (90.5
percent), 68.8 percent and 50.0 percent of households in Ilala and Temeke districts respectively
had their water connections fitted with water meters. Regarding the working status of the fitted
water meters, 98.1 percent of households with fitted water meters reported them to be in working
condition. Water meter connections in DAWASA Service Area have increased significantly from
55.7 percent in 2006 to 85.7 percent of households in 2009.

Overall, 67.6 percent of the households in DAWASA Service Area reported that their meters
were last read less than one month before the survey. However, less than one percent of
households reported that their meters have never been read before the survey.




                                                44
Water Bills

About 90 percent of households indicated that they do receive water bills but 6.3 percent do not
get water bills. Proportions of households receiving water bills increased from 84.1 percent that
was recorded in the 2006 Baseline Survey to 89.7 percent in 2009. For households which receive
water bills, the majority of households (92.0 percent) get their water bills every month, while the
remainder s of households get their water bills after every three months. Overall, there has been
an increase in the proportion of households which receive water bills on monthly basis from 87.8
percent in 2006 to 92.0 percent in 2009.

On payment of water bills, 65.5 percent of households within DAWASA Service Area paid for
their bills within a month prior to the survey, 25.7 percent paid between one and two months,
about five percent paid within three or more months and about four percent of these households
were not sure whether the water bills were paid or not. Most customers who usually receive
water bills are paying their bills at the Utility Office (91.3 percent), a small proportion of
customers (2.4 percent) are paying for their water bills to Community representatives and 3.2
percent to water bill collectors.

In-Yard Piped Water

Results show that, within the whole DAWASA Service Area, the proportion of households with
in-yard piped water increased from 5.3 percent observed in the 2006 Baseline Survey to 9.3
percent in the 2009 survey. Likewise, the proportion of households in Dar es Salaam has
increased from 4.9 percent in 2006 to 9.3 percent in 2009.

Water Connections

Among households with in-yard piped water in DAWASA Service Area, 94.3 percent of the
households have their water connections working. A similar proportion was observed in Dar es
Salaam. Pwani recorded a slightly higher proportion of households with water connections that
are working (95.5 percent) compared to those observed in Dar es Salaam. Regarding households
whose water connections were not functioning, about five percent of households in Pwani were
disconnected for non-payment of water bills. About three percent within DAWASA Service Area
and two percent in Dar es Salaam had their water connections not working for non-payment of
water bills.

Availability of In-Yard Piped Water

About 99 percent of all survey households with in-yard piped water within DAWASA Service
Area, 99.2 percent of Dar es Salaam households and all households in Pwani were getting water.
On regularity of flow of water, 37.3 percent in DAWASA Service Area, 35.7 percent in Dar es
Salaam and 47.6 percent of households in Pwani were getting water daily. The proportion of
households that are getting water daily appears to be much lower than that observed among
households with in-house piped water (66.9 percent). About 17 percent of households in
DAWASA Service Area, 14 percent in Dar es Salaam and 33.3 percent in Pwani revealed that
flow of water into their in-yard water taps was unpredictable. These results show that provision
of water on a daily basis has declined from 44.9 percent recorded in 2006 to 37.3 percent in 2009.




                                                45
On how long water is flowing in a day, within DAWASA service area, the proportion of
households that were getting water for 24 hours accounted for 32 percent of all households, this
being almost the same as that observed in the 2006 survey (32.5 percent). About 27 percent of
households were getting water for more than six hours, 14 percent are getting water between four
hours but less than six hours, 13.3 percent were getting water between two hours but less than
four hours and only four percent of the households were getting water for less than two hours.

The problems or obstacles that were affecting accessibility of in-yard piped water were listed as
follows: About 53 percent of households in DAWASA Service Area and 54.9 percent in Dar es
Salaam revealed that they had low water pressure, 19.2 percent and 18.8 percent respectively said
it was being controlled by the landlord owning the in-yard water tap and 13.2 percent in
DAWASA Service Area and the same proportion in Dar es Salaam reported that there were too
many users. Among respondents who indicated that water supply is affected by low water
pressure, 11.5 percent of the households in DAWASA Service Area used water pumps, about 10
percent of the households in Dar es Salaam used pumps while a quarter of households in Pwani
had to use pumps to increase water pressure.

Water Meter Connections

About 80 percent of households in DAWASA Service Area have water meters, and 84.6 percent
of households in Dar es Salaam and 50 percent in Pwani have their water taps fitted with water
meters. On whether the fitted water meters were working, 95.2 percent of households in
DAWASA Service Area, 94.8 percent of households in Dar es Salaam and all water taps fitted
with water meters in Pwani were in good working condition. The results show that there is a
remarkable improvement on the proportion of households with water meters fitted to their in-yard
water taps. The proportion of households with water meters has increased from 39.2 percent
recorded in 2006 to about 80 percent of households in 2009. However, the proportion of
households with meters that are working has declined slightly from 96.8 percent in 2006 to 95.2
percent in 2009.

On when their meters were read for the last time, 42.5 percent of households in DAWASA
Service Area, 41.3 percent in Dar es Salaam and 54.5 percent of households in Pwani had their
meters read less than a month ago. About 21 percent of households in DAWASA Service Area
and 21.1 percent in Dar es Salaam had their meters read between one month and two months ago
and 16.7 percent of households in DAWASA Service Area and 18.3 percent in Dar es Salaam
indicated that their water meters have never been read.

Water Bills

Among survey households that have in-yard water points, 48 percent of households (landlords) in
DAWASA Service Area, 48.5 percent in Dar es Salaam and 45.5 percent in Pwani owned in-yard
water points. About 79 percent of landlords in DAWASA Service Area who are running in-yard
water taps are paying their bills at Utility Offices, 2.6 percent to a Community representative and
another 2.6 percent to a water bill collector.

On whether landlords were selling water to their neighbors, 17.1 percent of landlords said that
they were selling water to other households. Regarding other areas, 18.2 percent of landlords in
Dar es Salaam and 10 percent in Kibaha were selling water to other households. At the district
level, Temeke recorded the highest proportion of households (landlords) which were selling water

                                                46
(28.6 percent), followed by Kinondoni (17.3 percent) and Ilala and Kibaha (14.3 percent each).
In Bagamoyo, there are no landlords who are selling water to other households.

Among households (landlords) which are selling water to other households, 30.8 percent of
households in DAWASA Service Area and 33.3 percent in Dar es Salaam were supplying water
to less than five households. About 54 percent of households in DAWASA Service Area and
58.3 percent in Dar es Salaam were supplying water to 5-9 other households. Landlords who
were selling water to 10-14 households (DAWASA Service Area) constituted about 15.4 percent.

Regarding households not owning in-yard water sources, within DAWASA Service Area, 26.8
percent of households are paying for water from in-yard taps by sharing in paying their bills
monthly. Households which were paying their water bills as part of their house rent constitute
about five percent, 18.3 percent are paying a flat rate to their landlords and 35.4 percent are using
their own means to settle their water requirements. The 2006 Baseline Survey results show that
28 percent of households in the DAWASA Service Area were sharing in paying their monthly
bills, 20 percent were paying their water bills to their landlords, about five percent were paying
their bills as part of their house rents and 47.2 percent of households had their own means of
settling their water bills. Majority of households (65.9 percent) in DAWASA Service Area, not
owning in-yard water taps, were paying on average more than T. Shillings 1,100.

On non-payment of water bills, about five percent of the household respondents using in-yard
water in DAWASA Service Area said no retaliatory measures would be taken against them, 62.2
percent thought that they would be barred from getting water from the in-yard tap, 8.5 percent
would be evicted from the house where they are staying and 18.3 percent did not know what
would happen to them if they do not pay water bills. Results observed in the 2006 survey show
that 81.9 percent of households would be barred from using the service, about six percent would
be evicted from the house where they are staying and 7.1 percent of households said no action
would be taken against them if they do not pay their water bills.

Piped Water in Neighbor’s House/Yard

Within DAWASA Service Area, utilization of piped water from the households’ neighborhood
has declined from 58.3 percent that was observed in the 2006 Baseline Survey to 47.6 percent in
2009 survey.

Payment of Water Bills

Within DAWASA Service Area, majority of households (91.6 percent) which get water from
neighborhood sources are charged per bucket, 2.4 percent are paying for water on a monthly basis
and about two percent are paying for water as part of their house rents.

As a follow up to methods used in paying for water bills, within the DAWASA Service Area,
about five percent of households did not know the amount that they are supposed to pay, seven
percent are paying less than T. Shillings 700 per month, less than one percent are paying between
T. Shillings 500 and 1,100 per month and 87 percent of households are paying more than
T. Shillings 1,100 per month.

For households which do not pay their water bills, about 82 percent reported that they would be
barred from using the neighborhood water tap, 6.5 percent said nothing would happen and 8.4

                                                 47
percent do not know what would happen to them. Those who indicated unspecified action
constitute about three percent.

On whether households are satisfied with the way they were paying their water bills, 48 percent
felt the arrangement which was being used in paying water bills was fair, 32.3 percent were
satisfied with the arrangement and 19.8 percent of households felt the arrangement was poor.

    (c) Water from Kiosks

About two percent of all surveyed households within the DAWASA Service Area have access to
kiosks as their source of water. Dar es Salaam recorded a similar proportion of households that is
using kiosks as source of water (1.7 percent). No kiosks were observed in Pwani Area.

When one looks at the share of kiosks as source of piped water, about three percent of households
in DAWASA Service Area which use piped water have access to kiosks as their source of water.
This shows that there has been an increase of the proportion of households which are using piped
water in kiosks compared to that observed in the 2006 survey (1.2 percent). Results also show
that Dar es Salaam recorded about three percent of such households. At the district level,
Kinondoni has the highest proportion of households with access to kiosks (4.1 percent), followed
by Temeke (1.7 percent) and Ilala (1.1 percent).

Availability of Water at Kiosks

Availability of water at kiosks depends on the duration during which they remain open. Within
DAWASA Service Area, less than one percent of the households reported that kiosks were open
for less than five hours and 24.5 percent had kiosks open between five and nine hours. Majority
of households (59.8 percent) reported that kiosks remain open for 10-14 hours a day, 13 percent
reported that kiosks open for 15-19 hours and only 2.2 percent of households said that kiosks
remain open between 20 and 24 hours. This appears to differ with the situation that was observed
during the 2006 Baseline Survey whereby 52.6 percent of households in DAWASA Service Area
said that kiosks were being left open for a period between 10 and 14 hours and 34.1 percent
revealed that kiosks were open for a period between 15 and 19 hours.

Congestion at Kiosks

On congestion of people waiting to get water from kiosks, results show that 48.9 percent said
congestion sometimes happens, 32.6 percent of the households felt that congestion at kiosks
happens seldom, 11.4 percent indicated that congestion is usually there while about seven percent
said that there is no congestion of people who are waiting to draw water from kiosks. Results
from the 2006 survey show that 33.5 percent said that sometimes there is congestion, 17.9 percent
of the households in DAWASA Service Area said that seldom there were congestion, 38.7
percent of households said that usually there is congestion and about 10 percent of the households
said there is no congestion of people waiting to get water at the kiosks.

    (d) Provision of Water by Institutions

Faith-based institutions and other institutions such as schools have been providing water to the
neighboring households. About six percent of total households interviewed indicated accessing
water from institutions. Sources of water obtained from these institutions are largely from

                                               48
boreholes (60.4 percent) followed by protected wells which constitute about 25.6 percent. Piped
water contributed about 12.8 percent of water supplied by institutions.

About 90 percent of households which get water from institutions pay for it. In comparison with
the 2006 Baseline Survey, there is a slight increase of households which get water from
institutions from about five percent in 2006 to about six percent in 2009.

       (e) Water Vendors

Survey results indicate that 13.2 percent of households were supplied with water from water
vendors. On whether households knew source of the water they were buying from vendors,
majority of the respondents (52.1 percent) said that they were getting water drawn from piped
water taps; 26.8 percent were getting water from boreholes while 13.2 percent did not know the
source of the water.

Analysis from both the 2006 Baseline Survey and the 2009 Follow-up Survey reveals that there is
a remarkable decline in the number of households that use services of water vendors. It declined
from 17.2 percent recorded in 2006 to 13.2 percent in 200919.

       (f) Boreholes

Boreholes are ranked the second major source of water in the DAWASA Service Area,
accounting for 37.3 percent after piped water. About 62 percent of the households in DAWASA
Service Area are getting water from boreholes located in neighbors’ yard/plot, followed by kiosks
(12.0 percent), Institutions (9.2 percent) and from water vendors by 7.9 percent. Very few
households (4.1 percent) are getting water from boreholes which are located in the in-yard.

Households in Temeke district whose source of water is boreholes constituted 61.2 percent, those
of Ilala 59.0 percent, Kinondoni 12.8 and Bagamoyo 32.6 percent. No boreholes were observed
in Kibaha.

Results from the 2009 survey show that there has been an increase of people accessing water
from boreholes (37.3 percent) compared to 26.2 percent recorded during the 2006 Baseline
Survey. The results clearly show the importance of boreholes to many households in the
DAWASA Service Area.

       (g) Wells

In many parts of DAWASA Service Area, some households also get water from outlets such as
―wells‖ which may be either deep or shallow, depending on the economic capability of the
owners. Households that reported using water from wells as their main source of water accounted
for about five percent from protected wells and about one percent from unprotected wells within
DAWASA Service Area. Water from unprotected wells is normally considered unsafe and this
may cause water borne related diseases to households.




19
     The figures in the main report are 9.9 percent in 2006 to 8.4 percent in 2009.

                                                        49
    (h) Water Borne Related Diseases

The notion of water borne related diseases was analyzed to determine the extent of these diseases.
This enquiry related to two weeks preceding the survey. The water borne related diseases
referred to are diarrhea or dysentery, birharziasis, cholera and typhoid. Analysis of the study
population revealed that 2.7 percent of the study population were infected with water-borne
related diseases; Temeke recorded the highest proportion of cases on water borne related diseases
(3.6 percent), followed by Ilala and Bagamoyo (2.9 percent each) and Kinondoni (2.1 percent).
Kibaha reported to have less than one percent of the population who were infected with water
borne related diseases during the two weeks period preceding the survey.

On individual water borne related diseases, diarrhea/dysentery and typhoid were found to be the
most serious health problems that affected mainly the districts within Dar es Salaam region.
Among cases that were reported, 50.3 percent were cases about diarrhea or dysentery and typhoid
constituted 47.4 percent of all cases reported on water borne related diseases. A similar pattern is
observed in Kinondoni, Ilala and Temeke districts. The results of the 2006 Baseline Survey
revealed nearly the same trend as that observed in 2009.

    (i) Perception of Households on Water Quality

On perception of households about the quality of water, about 45 percent of households regarded
water as safe, 36.6 percent were undecided while 15.9 percent considered water unsafe for their
daily use.

    (j) Water Storage and Investments

Water Storage

Water storage is widely practiced by households mainly to meet future demand for water caused
by irregularity of water supply. Survey results show that majority of households (87.6 percent) in
the survey area had water storage facilities in their homes.

Among households within DAWASA Service Area which are storing water for future use, 12.4
percent are storing water that can last for less than two days. Majority of households (70.5
percent) have the capacity to store water for 2-5 days. Most households in the districts have the
capacity to store water for 2-5 days.

Various types and sizes of storage facilities are used by households such as jerry cans/buckets,
drums and overhead, underground and surface tanks to store water. More than three quarters of
the households (77.8 percent) in the survey area use jerry cans/buckets to store water and about
10.5 percent of households are using drums.

Investments in Water Storage Facility

With erratic supply of potable water in many households in the DAWASA Service Area,
households have taken deliberate steps of acquiring water storage facilities for their usage when
there is no supply of water. Results show that nearly half of the households (48.5 percent) in the
survey area had invested in the development of water storage system within one year period prior
to the survey.

                                                50
    4. Sanitation and Sewerage
The 2009 Follow-up Survey results show that among all surveyed households in DAWASA
Service Area, 53.2 percent of the households are using ordinary pit latrines, a notable decrease
when it is compared with the 2006 Baseline Survey (70.2 percent) and 19.1 percent of households
are using flush toilets (2006: 12.9 percent). Similarly, 17.9 percent are using Ventilated
Improved Pit Latrines (VIP) compared to 11.8 percent recorded in the 2006 Baseline Survey.

    (a) Improved Pit Latrines

A considerable number of households within the DAWASA Service Area (40.8 percent) have put
cement slabs on the floors of their pit latrines in a bid to improve the quality of the toilets. In
addition, 20.7 percent of households have put up durable shelters to their pit latrines. Apart from
the above two methods of improving the quality of pit latrines, 22.0 percent of households in the
survey area lined or stabilized their pit latrines.

Some households have made changes on the floor of their pit latrines in a bid to improve the
quality of the toilets. Improvements made include building a cement slab constituting 40.8
percent of households compared to 38.2 percent observed in 2006. About 22 percent of
households with pit latrines have put up lined/stabilized pit compared to almost the same
proportion of such households (22.5 percent) observed in the 2006 Baseline Survey and
households that improved their latrines by putting up durable shelters to their pit latrines
comprised of 20.7 percent compared to 23.1 percent recorded in the 2006 Baseline Survey.
Households that did not take any action to improve their pit latrines accounted for 13.2 percent
compared to 12.6 from the 2006 Baseline Survey.

    (b) Sharing Toilet Facilities
Results show that 37.4 percent of households interviewed in the DAWASA Service Area do not
share toilet facilities with other households. However, 28.9 percent share with 2-4 households,
22.8 percent share toilet facility with 5-7 households and about 11 percent share with eight or
more households. Compared to 2006 Baseline Survey, there is an increase of households that do
not share toilets from 33.4 percent to 37.4 percent recorded in 2009. However, there is a decrease
of about five percent of households that share toilets with 2-4 households, another decrease of
11.6 percent for toilets shared by 5-7 households, but a slight increase of 0.5 percent of
households that share toilets with eight or more households between 2006 and 2009.

    (c) Maintenance of toilet facilities
Survey results reveal that toilet facilities which are maintained by landlords constitute 65.9
percent of households with toilet facility in the DAWASA Service Area. This shows that the
proportion of landlords maintaining their toilet facilities has increased from 49.6 percent recorded
in 2006 to 65.9 percent observed in the 2009 survey. Households sharing toilet facilities in 2009
constituted about 18.7 percent compared to 31.4 percent reported in the 2006 Baseline Survey.
Households maintaining their own toilets (individual households) comprised of 14.4 percent
(2006 Baseline Survey) against 18.4 recorded in the 2009 Follow-up Survey.




                                                51
    (d) Disposal of Excreta
Results show that pit latrine is the most used method to dispose excreta accounting for 64.9
percent of households in DAWASA Service Area compared to 79.2 percent that was reported in
the 2006 Baseline Survey. It is followed by those disposing excreta using septic tanks which
account for 27.9 percent of households against 16.9 percent reported in the 2006 Baseline Survey,
indicating a substantial increase of households using this method. The use of public sewage
appears to have increased from about three percent observed in the 2006 Baseline Survey to 5.4
percent of households recorded in the 2009 Follow-up Survey. Although the use of public
sewerage has increased, this is still low probably because it is not well established in many parts
of Dar es Salaam City.

    (e) Duration of Filling Pit Latrines
The survey results show that 72.5 percent of households with pit latrines in the DAWASA
Service Area reported that their pit latrines never fill up and 16.9 percent of households do not
know how much time it takes for their toilets to fill up. However, about 5 percent indicated that
their toilets were taking less than 12 months to fill up and 4.5 percent said that it was taking
between 12 and 24 months. Only 1.4 percent of households said that their pit latrines would take
25 months or more to fill up.

    (f) Washing Hands after Use of Toilet Facility
People’s attitude and behavior on hygiene was measured by asking them whether they were
washing hands after going to the toilet. Survey results show that 95.6 percent of the respondents
in DAWASA Service Area wash their hands after coming from the toilet compared to 97.4
percent reported in the 2006 Baseline Survey. Out of those who reported to wash their hands,
80.2 percent wash their hands with soap and water. This is lower than that observed in 2006
(87.8 percent). Respondents who wash their hands with water only constitute 15.3 percent and
respondents who do not wash their hands at all after going to the toilet account for 3.6 percent.
Respondents who were washing hands with water only in the 2006 Baseline Survey were 9.5
percent and those who were not washing their hands after using the toilet were only 1.4 percent.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
Conference on Institutional and Management Models for Dar es Salaam Water Supply and
                           Sanitation Services, December 2009

    1. Summary
The conference organized by DAWASA took place on December 10 and 11 in Dar es Salaam. It
was opened by His Excellency Prof. Mark Mwandosya, Minister of Water and Irrigation (MOWI)
and attended by about 60 participants. The conference agenda is attached to this. In support to
the conference, the Bank made available to participants hard copies of a series of short ―P-Notes‖
and PPIAF ―Gridlines‖ available on the Bank Water and PPIAF websites related to topics
discussed during the conference. There were presentations on lessons from Global experience,
models from regional utilities, perspectives of national agencies (e.g. EWURA), and
recommendations from consultants studies on institutional arrangements for DAWASA and
DAWASCO.

In discussions with the Bank team, the Minister clarified that the government is expecting the
conference to come up with concrete proposals for reform that can be implemented within the
short term – 6 months, medium term - 18 months, and long term - 36 months to improve its
performance. It was noted that in the short to medium term it will be unlikely to introduce
legislative changes, so the range of options proposed should take this into account.

    2. Presentation of the Current Institutional Arrangement
In her presentation of the initial findings of the case study she is preparing for the Bank, Ms. T.
Triche (World Bank consultant) first summarized the recent evolution of the institutional
arrangement and of the performance of the water supply and sanitation (WSS) in Dar es Salaam
since the late 1990s. Despite regularly increasing number of active water accounts and of bill
collected, cash revenues from operations are still insufficient to cover the combined operating
costs of DAWASCO and DAWASA. In 2008/09 only about 44% of the water produced
generated a cash revenue. A significant reduction of non-revenue water (NRW) will not be
possible until after all bulk water meters are installed early in 2010. The case study clearly
identifies two key issues to be addressed in the near future:

The lack of accountability of the Boards of Directors (BOD) and management teams of both
DAWASA and DAWASCO for results laid out in the legal agreements that underpin the current
service delivery arrangement; and

The lack of enforcement of contractual obligations between DAWASCO and its customers (non-
payment of water bills and theft of water are still very high), DAWASA and DAWASCO under
the Lease contract and DAWASA and MOWI under the Performance contract.

The CEOs of DAWASA and DAWSACO are appointed or nominated by the Minister, MOWI
rather than by their respective BODs. As a result, DAWASCO’s accountability to DAWASA for
implementation of the Lease contract is undermined. The replacement of the private Operator
CWS by a public corporation DAWASCO has resulted in a somewhat dysfunctional
accountability framework.


                                                53
Dr. S. Temu (University of Dar es Salaam) in her institutional review of the water supply sector
in Dar es Salaam supported the findings presented by Thelma Triche. She highlighted the fact
that: (i) DAWASA did not appoint DAWASCO as Operator under the Lease contract; and
(ii) because the BOD of DAWASA and DAWASCO are appointed by the Minister, MOWI it is
difficult for DAWASA to enforce the contract. She emphasized the need for clarity in principal-
agent relationships among the partners involved in the lease contract. She noted in particular that
key performance targets under the Lease have not been met and there is no possibility of holding
DAWASCO – which did not post a performance guarantee and is not exposed to penalties in case
of non performance – accountable.

    3. Presentations on Public-Private Partnership Options
Mr. A. Locussol (World Bank consultant) presented the findings of recent World Bank research
on the performance of PPP in WSS with a special focus on Western and Central Africa. The Dar
es Salaam accountability framework centered on a Lease contract between an asset holding
company and a professional operator was modeled after some of the schemes successfully
implemented in this region (Senegal, Niger). It even includes an additional enhancement of the
accountability framework by clearly separating the functions of policy formulation (that remains
with the MOWI) and of economic regulation (that was transferred to the independent EWURA).

Mr. Miguel Alves (FIPAG, Mozambique) presented the delegated management arrangement
implemented in Maputo (lease contract between the asset agency, FIPAG, and an international
operator), four largest cities (management contract) and nine additional cities (enhanced technical
assistance) and its accomplishment so far with regards to key performance indicators. Though
the lease contract encountered serious difficulties in the early years, and the lead private operator
withdrew, the government and remaining private operator (Aguas de Portugal) renegotiated the
contract and have persevered in its implementation. The accountability framework is also of
interest. A Stakeholders’ Forum that includes representatives of the municipalities and domestic
and private consumers, nominates members of FIPAG’s Board of Directors, with final
appointment by the Minister. The CEO is appointed by the Board. This framework ensures that
the CEO is accountable to the Board which, in turn, is accountable to the municipalities and
customers. The lease contract operator is directly accountable to FIPAG. In the other cities,
managing directors of the services are recruited and appointed under performance contracts with
FIPAG. It is worth noting that performance did not improve as quickly as originally expected but
improvements are now being achieved.

Mr. Alves emphasized the importance of: (i) setting realistic goals and the existence of a
mechanism to adjust goals as the situation evolves; (ii) the management of political, social,
professional and financial expectations; (iii) the development of firm strategies and flexible
tactics and the authority to make decisions by both the asset holder and the operator; and (iv) the
selection of the right people to lead the partners.

Mr. P. Omutia (WSC, Nairobi, Kenya) presented extension of distribution systems in low income
communities of Nairobi, Kenya implemented in partnership with several local NGOs.

In his presentation of the comprehensive review of PPP options for DAWASCO, Prof. J. Katima
(University of Dar es Salaam) confirmed that the Government has not ruled out the possibility of
involving the private sector in the provision of the WSS service in Dar es Salaam. The review
identifies not less than 12 options that could possibly be considered ranging from stock market

                                                 54
flotation to simple technical assistance. While options aimed at raising financing cannot
realistically be envisaged for a WSS sector that does not even cover its operating costs, the
review identifies several ―lower end‖ options, such as Service contracts, that do not transfer
management of the utility to a private partner but that could be implemented within the current
framework while limiting both the ―visibility‖ of the PPP and the risks transferred to the private
partners.

In his presentation, Mr. J. Moss (Aquafied) explained the need for rebuilding a positive
perception among international private operators that Tanzania is a country where business can be
normally carried out after the protracted bidding period and the abrupt termination of the CWS
Lease contract. He emphasized that a PPP is a partnership and that if one of its partners sinks the
partnership inevitably collapses. He also emphasized that any new PPP envisaged by the
Government, even lower end options, should be designed after consultation with potential
professional partners.

    4. Presentations on Public Sector Options
Dr. S. Mugisha (NWSC, Uganda) presented the key ingredients of the turnaround of the Ugandan
public water supply utility NWSC during the last 10 years: empowerment and increased
accountability of staff at all levels through an innovative internal contracting arrangement
between the BOD and the CEO and the CEO and each manager. He also noted that good practice
in contracting requires: clarity of (i) obligations, roles and responsibilities of both parties;
(ii) performance indicators to be monitored, targets to be achieved and monitoring framework;
(iii) incentives, bonuses and penalties; and (iv) dispute resolution mechanisms are as essential for
internal contracting as for public-private contracting.

    5. Presentations on the Economic Regulation of the WSS Service and
       Service to the Poor
After a rapid introduction by Mr. A. Locussol of the rationale for economic regulation, key
principles to be followed by a performing Regulator, key objectives to be pursued by WSS tariff
setting and designing of subsidies that do reach those who need them, Eng. M. Mutegeki
(EWURA) presented the mandate and activities of the Regulatory Body EWURA since it started
operations in 2006. EWURA has so far reviewed applications by DAWASA and DAWASCO for
automatic indexation of the Operator and Lessor tariffs, as provided for in the Lease and
Performance contracts – and by extension in the Licenses – and customer complaints. Eng.
Mutegeki highlighted: (i) the difficulties encountered for enforcing compliance with the terms of
a Lease contract implemented by two public companies to which sanctions and penalties cannot
be applied; (ii) the need for adjusting performance targets to better reflect the actual situation; and
(iii) the difficulty to do it in the absence of credible data.

Eng W. Malima (UNICEF) presented the achievement and challenges of the community water
supply and sanitation activities implemented in parallel to, but coordinated with, the ongoing
rehabilitation and extension of the water distribution and sewer networks.

    6. Discussions on the Way Forward
Group discussions that followed the presentations were organized by Mr. C. Sayi (PS, MOWI,
chairman of the conference) and Mr. J. Rugumyamheto (facilitator of the conference) around four
main themes:
       Institutional options;
       Governance and accountability;
       Financial incentives and regulatory framework; and
       Performance improvement

Although it is often difficult to structure such group discussions and to focus recommendations to
be formulated in a very short period of time, the four groups identified some common themes that
could guide the way forward.

Institutional options

In her presentation, Dr. S. Temu had summarized the key features of six possible institutional
arrangements after consulting with a limited number of stakeholders and focused on two options
that she believes would be acceptable and could easily be implemented:

Retain the current arrangement with a public DAWASA as asset holder/infrastructure developer
and DAWASCO as public operator both ensuring with DAWASCO reporting to DAWASA
rather de facto reporting to MOWI;

Retain DAWASA as asset holder/infrastructure developer and split DAWASCO into several
public distribution companies under contract with DAWASA that would see its role extended to
that of bulk water supplier.

Group discussions highlighted the need for establishing a ―principal/agent‖ relation between
DAWASA and DAWASCO, as provided for in the DAWASA Act, initially worded for a public-
private partnership. This would require a legal review of the existing texts and in particular of the
Government Notice that created DAWASCO under the Corporation Act. Participants
recommended that this should be done by March, 31 2010. Group discussions did not cover,
however, other options such as the merging of DAWASA and DAWASCO into a single WSS
utility company or the split of DAWASCO into several smaller water distribution companies
under contract with a DAWASA acting as asset holder and bulk water supplier probably because
of the lack of time and guidance to frame their discussions.

Governance and accountability

All groups highlighted the need for increasing the accountability of DAWASA and DAWASCO
BOD and management teams; one option for DAWASA would be to enter into a performance
based contract (PBC) with the Government (MOWI, MOF) and set achievable (SMART) targets.
Similarly, groups suggested that PBC should be entered into by DAWASCO and specialized
contractors for specific tasks such as NRW reduction. There were mentions of the need for
pursuing DAWASCO decentralization and for developing anti-corruption plans by both public
entities.



                                                 56
Financial incentives and regulatory framework

No group mentioned the need for adjusting compensation packages of DAWASA and
DAWASCO staff but all referred to financial incentives to encourage improved performance.
Interestingly, ―emotional‖ incentives were identified as necessary, suggesting that proper
motivation of staff by charismatic managers may be a missing element. One group mentioned the
need for designing the WSS tariff with the objective of protecting the water source.

Performance improvement

Group discussions suggested that so far little emphasis has been put on customers. Large
customers which could generate a significant share of the revenues should be paid special
attention. On the other hand arrangements should be sought with community based organizations
for bulk water supply in lower income areas or informal neighborhoods where demand for
residential connections is limited and extension of distribution network difficult. Group
discussions also highlighted the need for: (i) rapidly improving commercial operations (meter
reading, bill distribution and collection); (ii) pressurizing distribution networks or in case of non
permanent service, supplying water at fixed hours so that customers can adapt their consumption
pattern; and (iii) regulating the tanker ―industry‖. Several groups emphasized the need for setting
―realistic‖ performance targets.

Suggestions of the World Bank Mission

The Mission, as many participants to the conference, believes that the current Lease contract
arrangement is dysfunctional. Even if existing legal texts are amended to re-establish the
principal/agent relation between DAWASA and DAWASCO it is doubtful that the Lease contract
will ever perform successfully because the main driver for compliance with contractual terms, i.e.,
the obligation for generating a profit will still be lacking or be pretty weak. If the Government
does not wish to consider introducing private interests in DAWASCO in the short and medium
terms, the Mission believes that a mechanism for clarifying the relationship between DAWASA
and DAWASCO needs to be established to reach service delivery targets, ensure clear lines of
accountability, and improve contract enforcement. The Government should take note of the
recipes that worked well in Uganda, i.e., appointment of a dynamic management team on market
terms and strict enforcement of internal individual contractual obligations; Kenya, Mozambique
and other countries in the region. The Government should continue to refine and improve the
model and prepare a longer term plan that includes provision for two more in depth reviews as a
basis for reforms in 18 and 36 months.

 The Mission, as many participants to the conference, understands that the Government wishes to:
(i) limit amendments to the current legal framework to the strict minimum in the short and
medium term; but (ii) nevertheless improve its overall performance. In which case, the Mission
would suggest that the following options be considered:

       The principal/agent relation between DAWASA and DAWASCO should be established:

               Within 3 months: a legal review should be carried out to establish practical
                options available;




                                                 57
           Within 6 months: institutional arrangements should be amended to allow an
            enforceable principal/agent relation.

   The role of DAWASA should be extended to include bulk water supply: DAWASA
    should take over from DAWASCO the operation of the production plants and
    transmission lines up to the bulk water meters.

           Within 6 months: the outline of a bulk water supply contract, guaranteeing
            quantities of water delivered at reservoirs and specifying rules governing the bulk
            water tariff would be set, revised and indexed, should be prepared and reviewed
            by EWURA;

           Within 12 months: a bulk water supply contract should be signed by DAWASA
            and DAWASCO and approved by EWURA.

   DAWASA should be encouraged to consider short-term ―output based service contracts‖
    with professional companies to address some of the key issues the water
    production/transmission function is currently faced with, in particular: (i) the proper
    operation of the recently rehabilitated treatment plants; and (ii) the high level of losses on
    the Upper and Lower Ruvu transmission lines.

           Within 6 months: DAWASA should outline an ―outsourcing‖ plan;

           Within 18 months: Service contractors should be mobilized after a proper and
            transparent selection process.

   The role of DAWASCO should be limited to that of water distribution and wastewater
    collection and treatment; as mentioned above, the bulk water supply agreement with
    DAWASA should be signed within 12 months.

   DAWASCO should be encouraged to consider the possibility of strengthening its
    delegated water distribution and wastewater collection/treatment operations, including
    possibly restructuring into several semi-autonomous geographical units. DAWASCO
    should also be encouraged to consider short-term output-based service contracts with
    professional companies to address the many issues the water distribution function is faced
    with, in particular: (i) reduction of NRW within ―district metered areas – DMA‖; (ii) the
    identification and regularization of existing customers; and (iii) the extension of
    distribution networks to un-served areas where demand for connections has been clearly
    identified.

           Within 6 months, DAWASCO should outline ―delegation‖ and ―outsourcing‖
            plans;

           Within 12 months, DAWASA and DAWASCO should agree on a workable
            implementation arrangement for construction activities to be carried out by
            DAWASCO on the water distribution and wastewater networks (similar to the
            former delegated work program);



                                             58
          Within 18 months, DAWASCO should have mobilized a first batch of service
           contractors.

   DAWASA and DAWASCO should prepare cost estimates and financing plans for the
    above proposed contracts.

          Within 12 months DAWASA and DAWASCO should clarify if external
           financing is needed for OBSC.

    2. Assessment of Development Objectives and Design and Quality at
       Entry
Dar es Salaam city and the townships of Kibaha and Bagamoyo were experiencing poor water
and sanitation services due to aged infrastructures, low investments and high demand supply gap
from existing surface sources. People were sometimes forced to use unsafe water sources or pay


                                                     60
exorbitant fees to water vendors. Also due to lack of adequate and functioning sanitation services
there were repeated cases of cholera outbreaks.

Thus the main objective of this Project was to improve provision of water and sanitation services
to be more reliable, affordable and preparation of strategic masterplans for future sustainability.
This objective was to be accomplished through: (a) rehabilitation and limited expansion of the
existing water and sewerage infrastructures, (b) carrying out feasibility studies for developing of
new water sources, preparation of water supply and sanitation expansion strategic master plans
(c) introduction of public private partnership in the operation of water and sewerage services,
(d) establishment of a regulatory framework, (e) introducing a life line tariff, (f) capacity building,
(g) charging service tariff that cover all operation and maintenance costs plus 10% contribution to
counterpart funds for future investments.

The DWSSP comprised of four major components as follows:-

Water and Sewerage Capital Improvement Program: To rehabilitate/upgrade and limited
expansion of the existing Water Supply and Sanitation systems and hence improving the
availability of water and collection and treatment of sewage for protection of public health and
the environment.

Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project (CWSSP) – To assist low-income communities
to have better access to water supply & sanitation.

Institutional Strengthening of DAWASA/MOWI/WRBWO/EWURA in order to improve overall
water resources and supply management.

Strategic Studies for Future Investments: Involved evaluation of Future Water Sources, Water
Supply and Sewerage Expansion Strategic Master planning.

During the midterm review in December, 2006 the project’s original objectives were not revised.
However the following issues were emphasized in order to ensure timely achievement of the
original objectives as follows, (a) that the operator (DAWASCO) must speed up customer survey
and data base clean up to ensure that more customers are identified and billed, (b) must speed up
connection rationalization and metering, (c) increased efforts to speed up delegated works
implementation, (d) DAWASA must assist DAWASCO to improve its institutional capacity,
(e) DAWASA and DAWASCO to form a joint recovery team to ensure more revenue collection
to reach Ts.2.5 billion by June, 2009 and (f) lastly the Project completion date to be extended by
two years to December, 2009.

In December, 2009 the final evaluation mission was satisfied that most of the components were
substantially completed except for few a delegated works contracts namely, Part 2E and 3A and
3B. Overall program delivery was 98%. The borrower and implementation agent requested for
additional time extension of six months to June, 2010 in order to finish the remaining works.
Components with unused funds were reallocated to other agreed activities including training of
operator staff, buying of extra customer meters, procurement of pumps for Upper and Lower
Ruvu treatment works and permanent repair of the Kidogozero breach works.

    3. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs
Overall Outcome: Satisfactory

The original Project objective is still consistent with GOT’s water and sanitation policy and
millennium challenge targets of ensuring sustainable and affordable water and sanitation services
to all sections of our society.

DAWASA employed the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) as an independent agent to conduct
impartial evaluation of its outcomes to measure achievement of the Project objectives. A baseline
survey was conducted in June 2006 and a follow up one in December 2009. The surveys revealed
that services have improved tremendously although some objectives have not fully achieved. For
example frequency of water availability in the household on daily basis increased from 39.5 to
66.9 percent from 2006 to 2009 against 70 percent of household with 24 hours supply. Also there
has been notable health improvement following reduction of water related deceases.

Eight sewerage systems which were almost none functioning have rehabilitated including all
oxidation ponds, pumping stations and consumer connections at Kariakoo. The sewer connection
increased from 10,000 to 14,000 by the end of Project period.

Strategic master plans for water sources and sewerage have been developed and medium term
works for sources, water supply and sewerage systems expansion will be implemented through
water sector development programs (WSDP) from next fiscal year 2010.

When the Project is measured against these goals, in general the following have been achieved:

       Low-income communities have better access to water supply & sanitation
       Water supply is stable and there is improvement in collection and treatment of sewage.
       Improved public health by reduction of cholera occurrence
       Improved institutional and capacity building
       Improved economic condition as a result of improved water supply to industries and
        households

    4. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
The Project implementation faced a number of constraints which were outside the control of the
GOT or the Implementing Agency. These constraints included the following (i) failure of the
private operator; (ii) works delays due to problems outside contractors’/consultants’ control;
(iii) delays of financiers approvals; (iv) incomplete customer inventory and poor commercial
performance on part of DAWASCO.

During implementation of the project, DAWASA was forced to terminate the private operator,
City Water Services Limited (CWSL) for material breach of the lease contract less than two years
after they started work. This had a big effect on the progress especially implementation of the
delegated capital works (DCW) and the priority work projects including SIPE and POG which
were under the operator.


                                               62
The performance of the second operator has also been below expectations, since they have not
been able to attain the lease targets especially in the case of revenue collection. This has affected
the liquidity of DAWASA making it unable to meet its financial obligations including debt
servicing and maintaining minimum cash requirement.

Assessment of Outcome Targets and Risks: The three anticipated risks were (a) Inexperience of
DAWASA in monitoring the performance of the operator and in dealing with requests to adjust
the terms of Lease Contract of the Operator Tariff to reflect changing conditions. DAWASA
successfully managed all issues regarding Operator supervision and timely application of Tariff
indexation to the regulator. (b) Inexperience of EWURA in monitoring performance of the
various actors (GOT, DAWASA, the Operator or the customers) and in appraising requests for
Customer and Operator Tariffs adjustments. During the period EWURA fairly managed and
monitored various actors’ interests. (c) ―Capture‖ of EWURA by one stakeholder (GOT,
DAWASA, the Operator or the customers). EWURA has strived gradually to become
independent from influence of its key stakeholders.

The original outcome targets for the Project were:

To ensure by the end of the Project about 70% of customers obtain 24 hour water supply under
adequate pressure. Percentage of customers receiving 24 ours supply is currently estimated at
30%. This percentage excludes the Non Revenue Water loss which is estimated at 55%.
Furthermore about 70.5 of surveyed households had water storages enough for more than two to
five days. Therefore generally the Project has been a success if Project had enough scope to
reduce physical losses, which means more water could be available with adequate pressure to
reach customers with more supply hours. (b) To ensure that 100% of water samples meet quality
standards specified under the lease contract by the end of project. Actual water quality was 95%
by December, 2009. This was attributed to contamination of water due to burst pipes thus leading
to low residual chlorine in the distribution system. (c) To ensure 80% of collected sewage is
treated and 95% of effluent samples meet quality standards specified in the lease contract.

Wastewater effluent quality parameters surpassed targets except for BoD which was 80% as at
December, 2009. This was due to slow maturity rate as a result of newly rehabilitated ponds and
illegal industrial chemical dumping. These industries have been served with notices to comply
with required standards or face disconnection. (d) To fully implement a life-line tariff for
domestic customers. Due to complexity of identifying poor households and customers drawing
water from public taps, consuming up to 5 cubic meters per month are charged Operator Tariff
only. (e) To ensure that revenues meet operations and maintenance costs plus 10% contribution
to capital investments. The financial sustainability objective has not been fully attained because
of low revenue collection by the operator.

    5. Outcome Implementation of Project Components

    (a) Component 1: Rehabilitation and Extension of Water Supply Facilities

Amount USD 106.05 PAD; 99,122,514 Actual millions

Rating: Satisfactory



                                                 63
This component involved (a) rehabilitation of the three Water Treatment facilities of Upper Ruvu,
Lower Ruvu and Mtoni plants. The aim was to bring back to their original installed capacities of
90 Mld, 182Mld and 9Mld per day respectively. These works were successfully completed and
production attained 96% of original objective of 272Mld. This is partly attributed to low flows
from Kizinga river which is the water source for Mtoni Treatment plant. (b) Rehabilitation of
transmission mains and primary distribution mains. This component which involved replacement
of weak sections in the transmission mains, washouts and air valves, installation of bulk meters
and laying of primary distribution mains to improve bulk supply within the city. There are major
improvements in water distribution within the city, about 1475km of primary secondary and
tertiary of pipes were laid, and including a total of 135,000 connections were rehabilitated and
metered. In addition 69 bulk water meters were installed in various parts of the system to
enhance NRW monitoring and management.

    (b) Component 2: Sewerage and Waste Water Rehabilitation and Extension

Amount USD 22.4 millions PAD, 18,051,976 Actual

Rating: Satisfactory

The component involved rehabilitation and limited expansion of the all sewerage systems within
the city. Major sewerage works have been successfully implemented with almost all components
100% completed except for relocation problems at Kurasini and Vingunguti ponds. All waste
stabilization ponds are operational, sewage collection and pumping stations have been
rehabilitated and limited coverage expansion within Kariakoo area implemented. Operator has
been equipped with new operation and maintenance tools, plants and equipments. The incidences
of sewer blockage and overflows have dramatically been reduced and timely unblocking is taking
place. The number of sewer connection increased from 10,000 to 23,873 by April, 2010.

    (c) Component 3: Community Water Supply and Sanitation Program (CWSSP)

Amount USD 3,850,000 PAD, Actual 1,813,010

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

A total of 42 CWSS Projects were constructed by December, 2009 against target of 50. About
698 public kiosks were built in this project, 301 under DCW and 397 under CWSSP. Currently
42 community water and sanitation projects are operational and 11 more will be completed by the
end of the project. These together with USRP community projects also rehabilitated in this
Project are serving more than 406,000 families including the low income groups plus around
1884 household connections against the project target of 120,000. Communities have benefitted
from improved water supply and sanitation services and through DAWASA assistance some of
Water User Associations (WUAs) have been able to expand these systems through savings and
therefore reaching lower income people.

    (d) Component 4: Technical, Commercial and Financial Institutional and Capacity
        Reform

Amount: 25,000,000 million USD PAD, Actual 22,400,990

Rating: Satisfactory

This component was meant to build capacities of both MOWI/DAWASA/WRBWO/
EWURA/DAWASCO through training, supply and installation of equipments requisite for water
resources management. The component was successfully implemented. However training of
DAWASCO’s (the operator) staff which was not part of the programme had to be undertaken in
view of the termination of the private operator City Water Services (CWL). This was delayed
because the new public operator needed time first to right size the company.

Support to Wami Ruvu Basin Water Office which included rehabilitation of 29 river gauging
stations and 6 weather gauging stations was successfully implemented. The support has helped
the basin to start data hydrological collection after a 10 years period of stations breakdown.

    (e) Component 5: Future Water Sources and Supply Studies

Amount USD 6,150,000 PAD, Actual 5,192,360 million USD

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Studies for future water sources were successfully conducted whereby about 26 surface and
groundwater options were evaluated against technical, environmental, social and economic
viability. The study which was completed in 2007, recommended two most efficient sources out
of the rest and these were regulation of Ruvu River by building a dam at Kidunda and
development of the newly found deep groundwater aquifer on the southern part of the city. The
two sources have been earmarked for development under WSDP from next financial year
2010/11. Thirty deep production wells will be developed in two phases and the first phase of
twenty wells scheduled to be operational by 2013. This source is estimated to add about 390,000
cubic meters and the first phase will add 260,000 cubic meters per day.

Two strategic master plans for extension of water supply and sewerage systems to cover the
unserved areas were also successfully developed. The proposed medium term works will be
implemented between 2010 and 2015, which will see coverage increase from the current 70% and
10% to 90% and 30% for water and sewerage services respectively. However this will depend on
availability of funds currently estimated in our three years rolling plan at 360.97 million USD for
implementation of medium term sources and water and sewerage network expansion.

    6. Overall Evaluation of the Project’s Outcomes by Borrower/
       Implementing Agency
The project performance and results are considered to be satisfactory. The borrower and
implementing agency and other stakeholders successfully implemented their obligations except
for the operator. Capital investments programs have been successfully implemented within
budget and time. Capacity building was successfully implemented with regulatory institution in
place, training and equipments procured for all intended purposes. New water sources have been

                                                65
found and medium term works identified and their procurement is according to plan. Issues
raised in the last evaluation mission including environmental and social, operator’s commercial
performance will be sorted out before the closure of the project.

    7. Bank/Co-financiers Evaluation of the Project
The December, 2009 evaluation mission rated the project as marginally satisfactory. This was
due to marginal commercial performance of the operator. To ensure project sustainability the
GOT and DAWASA are undertaking several measures to ensure commercial viability including
(a) revising of the DAWASA Act of 2001 in order to amend it to enable creation of Principal
Agent relationship between DAWASA and DAWASCO (the Operator), (b)revising the Water
Supply and Sanitation Act, 2009 to amend regulations governing customers compliance to bills
payment and WSS infrastructure protection. These measures are aimed at improving compliance
of the operator; improve bills payment, to discourage vandalism of WSS infrastructures and
dumping of toxic industrial waste to the newly rehabilitated oxidation ponds.

    8. Assessment of the Project’s Prospects and Sustainability

    (a) Short Term Sustainability

The current revenue collections cover only 65% of OPEX and 10% of CAPEX. This has caused
low achievement rating of the project.

In view of this the GOT, DAWASA and DAWASCO are implementing the several measures to
ensure short term sustainability, (a) Decentralization of DAWASCO operations to areas and
signing of performance contracts. This will enhance performance through performance targets, in
which area managers and staff will be compensated or sanctioned for poor performance. It is
expected that they will put more efforts to collect revenue by identifying illegal connections,
inactive accounts, timely meter reading and bills delivery, and disconnecting of non paying
customers. (b) The GOT is in the process of amending the water and sanitation act to make it
more stringent to nonpayment of bills, illegal dumping of toxic waste to sewerage systems and
tempering or theft of water and sewerage works appurtenances. The review also intends to
shorten the prosecution process of the culprits, (c) to ensure short term liquidity for DAWASA,
the GOT agreed to suspend loan repayment for one year up to July, 2010 and efforts are still
being made so that the $6 million extended to CWL is written off, (d) DAWASA has completed
installation of system input meters in all water production plants and bulk zonal meters to
strengthen NRW management.

    (b) Long Term Sustainability

The long term sustainability of Dar es salaam water supply and sewerage services looks very
bright after realization of the following interventions results, (a) currently DAWASA and
DAWASCO through the leadership of EWURA and MOWI are working together to review the
lease agreement to reflect changes on the ground and accommodate the lessons learned over the
first phase. This is expected to harmonize performance and accountability of both parties,
(b) secondly DAWASA through technical assistance from MCC is undertaking major tariff
review and willingness to pay studies. These are important inputs for the next tariff review
application, which will take into consideration all O&M of the regulated assets plus 15% to cover


                                               66
capital investments cost and customers’ ability into the balance, (c) if all goes well the two
immediate capital investment support programs under the WSDP and MCC are expected to
increase our sources production capacities and network coverage.

The following outcomes are expected from those projects including additional 90,000 cubic
meters of water will be added into the system after completion of Lower Ruvu, a duplicate
1400mm transmission main from Lower Ruvu will be installed to increase the carrying capacity
and act as a fall back in case of old pipe burst and additional 62,328 more customers will be
connected all by 2012/13. Furthermore in the same program NRW will be reduced from current
estimated level of 55% to 35% this will bring in more revenues and reduce physical losses.
Construction of the Kidunda dam and development of groundwater at Kimbiji and Mpera
supported by WSDP will allow network expansion to the southern part of the city which is not
being served by Upper and Lower Ruvu plants.

    9. Lessons Learned
DWSSP delayed implementation because of late funding made its expected outcomes to be less
noticeable due to growth in demand for services.

For better results sequencing of DCW packages should have started from transmission corridors.
This would have reduced NRW along the transmission mains and thus enabling more water to
reach the Terminal and Kimara reservoirs.

Community water and sanitation projects must be free from political interference.

Through implementation of this project DAWASA has gained more experience in areas of project
management, strategic planning, benchmarking and dealing with various stakeholders.

Selected Key Lessons
H.0     General

The scheduled rehabilitation works were effectively implemented and successfully managed by
DAWASA; together with the community water supply and sanitation program, institutional
capacity building and studies for future expansion. Under the studies, new deep ground water
aquifers were identified in the southern part of the city and three 400 – 500 m test boreholes were
drilled to verify the water quality, which was found to be acceptable. Furthermore, whilst at the
start of the project, there were no functioning bulk meters in the system and only about 3% of
customers were metered, at the end of the project bulk meters had been installed together with
more than 100,000 customer meters.

However, the primary target of the project design, i.e. upgrading commercial operations and
enhancing the financial situation of the Utility to cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs,
service long term debt and contribute to capital investment was not achieved after failure and
termination of the private operator (City Water Ltd) in June 2005. Five years after appointment of
a public operator (DAWASCO), revenue collection has not improved to the required level. It was
envisaged in the Project Implementation Manual that commercial operations would be upgraded
and non revenue water would be reduced to specified levels, however at the end of the project
non revenue water is still very high and revenue collection does not still meet operational costs.

While numerous lessons are apparent, three selected ones are discussed below in relation to the
failed lease, reliable database and non – revenue water.




                                                70
H.1     Due to the poor baseline data and the dire condition of the assets, a lower risk delegated
        management contract was, potentially, a more prudent PPP preparatory step prior to a
        lease, as suggested by an AfDB pre-appraisal mission in September 1997. Replication
        of successful PPP models from other regional settings should fully take into account local
        characteristics and conditions.

An AfDB pre-appraisal mission comprising Mr. Jallow, Mr. Khotle and Ms. Wang, which visited
Tanzania from 27 August to 6 September1997 was informed of the Government’s intention to
introduce PPP in the form of a joint venture (JV), as advertised in July 1997. The mission was of
the opinion that a low risk PPP in the form of delegated management would be a better starting
option due to the vast information gap and the poor condition of the assets. It was however not
possible for the mission to discuss this option with Government in detail, because of prevailing
consultations on the proposed joint venture. The Bank therefore gave its opinion to the
Government and requested to be updated on the progress and outcome of the JV pre-
qualification process. A comparison of various forms of PPPs including joint venture, lease and
management contract, is shown in Annex 6.

Eventually, the Government abandoned the proposed JV option. While it had been expected that
JV partners would bring in the required capital financing, none of the four international companies
which submitted substantive proposals (Biwater UK, Saur France, Vivendi France and
Northumbrian UK) were ready to secure the required capital investment. In June 1998, the
Government sought the assistance of a Transaction Advisor, (Seven Trent Water International) to
assist in the PPP process. A workshop on the various options for PPP was also conducted. It
was eventually decided to request bids for a lease contract.

The lease contract with a private operator was signed in February 2003 but was terminated after
only two years of operation, due to breach of contract. The Dar es Salaam lease was based on a
successful model introduced in Senegal in 1996, and adopted in Niger in 2001. However, the
Senegalese population has a strong tradition of paying their water bills and the collection ratio
was good when the Senegal lease started. In contrast, the Dar es Salaam lease was ineffective,
and its enforcement by the Asset Holding Authority (AHA), was difficult.

After termination of the private operator, a public operator was appointed and there was a smooth
transition of operations. Given the failed lease, the Government indicated that it would like to
pause and review the unsuccessful transaction before going forward with the next attempt at
public-private partnership; which was accepted by a majority of the financiers. Based on the
views of a representative from the International Federation of Water Operators during the
operators’ roundtable organized by the Government in December 2009, it was unlikely that the
Government could have embarked on a quick attempt at another public-private partnership,
immediately after the failed lease, taking into account the acrimonious way in which it ended.

Although the PPP process was open to all international water operators, only four international
professional partners submitted substantive proposals. Furthermore, at the final round of bidding
for the lease, only one bid was received. As discussed in the second lesson below, the lack of
reliable baseline data led to a lease which was not sufficiently conclusive financially and
commercially. A management contract could have been a better starting option which could have
been “rolled into” a lease at the appropriate time.

It is also to be noted that at project appraisal, the prevailing experience on successful WSS PPPs
in Africa was limited. It is only in the 1990s and 2000s that major efforts were made to introduce
substantive private sector participation in the water sector in Africa, including in Ivory Coast
(where previous contracts were consolidated into a lease in 1987), Senegal and South Africa in
1996, Gabon in 1997 and Niger in 2001.


                                                71
Due to weaknesses in various PPPs in Tanzania during the 1990s and early 2000s, a PPP policy
was formulated in November 2009, followed by a corresponding legal and institutional framework
through enactment of the Tanzania PPP Act of 18 June 2010, which includes rules, guidelines
and procedures governing PPP procurement, development and implementation.

H.2     Reliable baseline data is crucial in the formulation of complex contracts such as major
        WSS leases, including, accurate customer data, reliable network data including flows and
        system losses, correct billing and collection records etc; its implications should not be
        underestimated

Historically, there was little accurate data collected on flows in the Dar es Salaam system. Thus,
at the start of the project, there was no reliable operational data on which to establish effective
performance criteria for many of the major parameters of the lease contract, which significantly
compromised its effectiveness. Performance targets are of limited use, without reliable baseline
data, together with effective reporting and monitoring mechanisms.

During the last stage of the lease bidding process, two of the three pre-qualified bidders did not
submit a bid because of the risk levels they perceived, including lack of reliable baseline data.
Bidders had been asked to bid only on the operator tariff. Other conditions remained identical for
all bidders including: (i) initial equity contribution to the capital of the Operator, (ii) financial
support to the Operator’s start-up activities, and (iii) fees for managing program works assigned
to the Operator. A guiding minimum operator tariff was specified in the bid, and accepted by the
only bidder who submitted a bid.

The tariff was a key driver of the lease financial model, to ensure recovery of operating costs
together with requirements for servicing of debts and returns to shareholders. However, it was
contingent on the volume of water available for billing, which in turn depended on the quantities of
the existing system losses that could be recovered by the rehabilitation.

The lack of a comprehensive and accurate customer data base together with poor data on the
flows in the system meant that the Operator tariff was established on the basis of information that
was not sufficiently solid. Furthermore, although rehabilitation measures were part of the project,
there was uncertainty in predicting their immediate operational impact.

It was also difficult to establish realistic time frames for achieving some of the key project
indicators because of the uncertainty in the baseline data. For example, it was envisaged that at
the end of the five 5 years original project time frame, 70% of customers would obtain 24 hour
water supply service under adequate pressure. Currently, only about 25% of customers are
getting reliable water supply. The target was optimistic considering that its attainment depended
largely on the quantities of the existing system losses that could be recovered by the
rehabilitation as there were no additional sources scheduled in the first 5 years.

H.3     Reduction of non revenue water requires special dedicated effort.

Reduction of non revenue water (NRW) is still a major challenge for the financial sustainability of
the project. NRW is the difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system
and that billed to consumers. It comprises leakage, theft and improper billing. At the start of the
project, in 2003, NRW was estimated above 50%. At present (2010) NRW is still estimated
above 50%. In its edition of 4th December 2010, the Tanzania “Daily News” reported that the
Minister for Water urged the Operator (DAWASCO) to reduce NRW after he carried out a field
                                   nd
survey of Bahari beach area on 2 December 2010 and locating 15 areas with water leakages
which have lasted for a long period.



                                                 72
The Regulator reported in its 2008/2009 report that among the urban water authorities in
Tanzania, the Dar es Salaam operator (DAWASCO) is the overall least performer in NRW
management. The Regulator recommends that NRW should be less than 20%. Furthermore, the
operator’s collection efficiency is at 77 % on current bills, without considering arrears in respect of
previous months. The collection efficiency should be more than 95%. In their 2008/2009 audit
report, the auditors noted that the operator is unable to quantify how much of NRW has been lost
through leakages or to identify individuals who have not been billed for their consumption.

One of the major lessons that the public operator (DAWASCO) learned from the failed private
operator lease is that a reliable customer database is paramount for effective NRW and customer
management together with billing efficiency. Accordingly, immediately after takeover in 2006,
DAWASCO with support from the Uganda National Water and Sewerage Corporation, embarked
on a major effort to improve the customer information data base including linkage to a GIS
system. However, after an initial promising start, progress slowed down. In discussions with the
new DAWASCO CEO (appointed in June 2010) the PCR mission was informed that the exercise
has now been revamped and is scheduled for completion early next year.

It essential that the effort to establish a reliable customer information database be completed as a
matter of priority and effective strategies of reducing non revenue water are worked out and
implemented.
