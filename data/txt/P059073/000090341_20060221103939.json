through:\n            (a) rehabilitation of facilities for production,\n            transmission, storage and distribution of drinking water,\n            and waste water collection and treatment; (b) extension of\n            piped water supplies and sewerage services; and (c)\n            reorganization of the United Republic of Tanzania's\n            water utility company, the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage\n            Authority's (DAWASA) operations to achieve effective\n            service delivery and financial sustainability. As part of\n            the reorganization efforts anticipated in (c) of the Project\n            objective, it was proposed to turn DAWASA into an asset\n            holding company, transferring the actual operation of water\n            and sewerage services to a private operator. The proposed\n            amendments are made to the Project as requested by the\n            Government of the United Republic of Tanzania to this effect\n            following the termination of the Lease Contract with City\n            Water Services by the Government."}, "docdt": "2006-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
