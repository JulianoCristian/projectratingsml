Development\n            Policy Operation (AgDPO 2) Program is a single tranche\n            credit for $25 million equivalent intended to help the\n            Government of Ghana (GoG) implement the revised Food and\n            Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II). This\n            operation backs the Bank's strategy of supporting\n            Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS\n            II), which seeks to modernize agriculture through policy and\n            institutional reforms that deliver the following: (i) the\n            gaps between observed and achievable yields are narrowed,\n            particularly for food crops; (ii) post-harvest losses are\n            reduced; (iii) the irrigated area is increased and informal\n            schemes are better managed; (iv) farmer organizations are\n            empowered to better represent economic interests of their\n            members; (v) the management of Ghana's fisheries is\n            improved; and (vi) budgetary resources for agriculture are\n            well allocated and executed. The AgDPO 2 is consistent with\n            the Bank's strategic focus on country systems, and the\n            Government's draft aid policy that seeks a greater\n            share of foreign assistance in the form of budgetary support."}, "docdt": "2010-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
