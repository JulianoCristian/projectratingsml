Financing Data        SDR 16.5 million (US$25 million equivalent)
                      Blend IDA terms: 35 year maturity with a 10-year grace period
Operation Type        DPL series (2nd of 3). It is proposed to terminate the series prematurely
                      with the current operation and begin a new series immediately following
                      Board approval. The new series would be aligned with the CAADP
                      Compact signed 28 October, 2009.
Main Policy Areas     These are: (i) agricultural technology, (ii) irrigation, (iii) farmer
                      organizations, (iv) marine fisheries, (v) land management; and (vii) budget
                      formulation and execution.
Key Outcome           These are (respectively, according to main policy areas above): (i) the rate
Indicators            of technology adoption, the ratio of post-harvest losses in key crops, and
                      performance of irrigation schemes; (ii) the value of non-traditional
                      agricultural exports; (iii) the number of functioning farmer organizations
                      accessing different types of services; (iv) lodged revenues from fisheries
                      sector (licenses etc); (v) the number of farmers adopting soil and water
                      conservation technologies; and (vi) the budget execution ratio.
Program Development   The operation is consistent with the CAS objective of supporting Ghana's
Objective(s) and      poverty reduction strategy and in particularly `modernizing agriculture'.
Contribution to CAS   The justification for the proposed modifications to the operation mid-series
                      are articulated in the draft CAS Progress Report. The program
                      development objective is "to increase the contribution of agriculture to
                      growth and poverty reduction while improving the management of soil and
                      water resources."
Risks and Risk        The main risks are: (i) change in policy direction in response to continued
Mitigation            shocks in global food markets; (ii) a challenging fiscal and macroeconomic
                      context; (iii) burgeoning costs of the fertilizer voucher scheme; (iv)
                      continued weakness in public financial management; and (v) delays in
                      completion of the sector wide approach and further advances in
                      harmonization and alignment.
                      Mitigation strategies to address these risks are as follows: confirmation of
                      the Government of their continued commitment to prevailing agricultural
                      policy framework; intense engagement with the IMF on macroeconomic
                      stabilization programs; immediate preparation of the proposed follow-on
                      series and inclusion of fertilizer voucher program in the policy matrix;
                      technical assistance to improved financial management; and active
                      engagement post-CAADP.

         PROPOSED SECOND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY
                        OPERATION TO GHANA

                                       1. INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed second agricultural development policy operation (AgDPO 2)
is a single tranche credit for $25 million equivalent intended to help the Government
of Ghana (GoG) implement the revised Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy
(FASDEP II). This operation backs the Bank's strategy of supporting Ghana's Growth
and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II), which seeks to modernize agriculture through
policy and institutional reforms that deliver the following: (i) the gaps between observed
and achievable yields are narrowed, particularly for food crops; (ii) post-harvest losses
are reduced; (iii) the irrigated area is increased and informal schemes are better managed;
(iv) farmer organizations are empowered to better represent economic interests of their
members; (v) the management of Ghana's fisheries is improved; and (vi) budgetary
resources for agriculture are well allocated and executed. The AgDPO 2 is consistent
with the Bank's strategic focus on country systems, and the Government's draft aid
policy that seeks a greater share of foreign assistance in the form of budgetary support.

2.      The agricultural policy was approved by Cabinet in July 2007 and was
endorsed by the new Government following the elections of December 2008. It
constitutes a sector policy that extends beyond the Ministry of Food and Agriculture
(MoFA) and encompasses the mandates of all ministries that are expected to contribute to
agriculture sector outcomes. The Policy was formulated in a consultative manner, and
benefitted from inputs from all stakeholders including development partners (DPs), civil
society and the private sector.

3.      Ghana recently concluded its Round Table under the Comprehensive
African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP). A new Sector Plan (2009 ­
2015) is under preparation.1 The CAADP Compact was signed at the Round Table, held
in October 2009, by Government, development partners, private sector and civil society,
and it commits all stakeholders to renewed collective and individual efforts to support
agricultural development. It also provides an enhanced framework for scaling up
resources to agriculture ­ in particular, in line with G20 commitments at l'Aguila and
Pittsburgh ­ and for improved harmonization and alignment.

4.      The Bank and Government agree that to better accommodate the
Government's specific implementation priorities moving forward, the Bank will
terminate the current series with this operation and immediately begin preparation
of a new series. As reflected in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Progress Report,
this constitutes a strategic response with the following expected benefits: (i) it allows for

  For the purposes of consistency with OP8.60, the Sector Plan can be interpreted as a `sectoral PRSP'
involving policy reforms and an expenditure program to achieve sector objectives.

                                                     1
closer alignment of Bank support with the new Government's agenda ­ both in terms of
content and in respect of the political cycle; (ii) it provides for a more compelling case to
scale up assistance beyond the levels originally envisaged in the CAS, in recognition of
the financing gap identified in the newly articulated investment program under the
CAADP framework; and (iii) it facilitates a better alignment of more specific policy
measures to be supported with the Government's policy and institutional reform agenda.

5.      Sector budget support should be seen in the context of other budget support
organized under the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) framework to which the Bank
contributes through the Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC).
The EGPRC and the MDBS are not appropriate instruments to deepen the sector level
policy dialogue as they necessarily focus on cross-cutting issues including public
financial management (PFM) and economic governance. At the same time, the
Government is yet to fully address budget needs at the sector level, relying predominantly
on DP-financed investment projects. While these investments have contributed to faster
agricultural growth and export diversification, a key objective of the current AgDPO
series is to strengthen the Government's ability to plan and implement using its own
budgetary resources. This approach is validated by progress to date under AgDPO 1.
                                     2.   COUNTRY CONTEXT

6.       Ghana is at a critical juncture in its development path. Recent domestic and
exogenous shocks as well as structural weaknesses have presented setbacks to an
otherwise impressive record of macroeconomic achievements. GoG has embarked on an
aggressive program to restore macroeconomic stability; important not only to address
immediate challenges but also critical if Ghana is to develop the robust policy and
institutional landscape to effectively manage its oil economy (Sections 2.A and 2.B).
Macroeconomic balance is essential if the recent gains in poverty reduction wellbeing are
to be maintained (as explained in Section 2.C). Moreover, the consequences of
macroeconomic instability will be keenly felt by the agricultural sector which has been a
driver of overall GDP growth in recent years (as described in Section 2.D).

           A.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
7.      The Government that took office in January 2009 inherited a challenging
macro-economic situation, brought on by a series of shocks which exacerbated a
structural trend of widening fiscal imbalances. Rapid fiscal expansion in 2008 and the
sudden closure of access to international capital markets in September 2008 resulted in a
widening current account deficit and a contracting capital account surplus. By end-2008,
fiscal and current account deficits, including grants, reached 14.5 percent and 18.7
percent of GDP respectively. While fiscal expansion was not a new phenomenon2 it was
exacerbated by a combination of severe exogenous shocks, including floods and droughts
in late 2007, a rise in world food prices, which prompted the Government to introduce
food tax exemptions, and a rise in oil prices, which led the Government to purchase oil on
behalf of utilities, in the absence of effective tariff adjustment mechanisms. The electoral

    The public sector wage bill increased from 8.5 percent to 11.3 percent of GDP from 2005 to 2008.

                                                      2
cycle also contributed to the fiscal expansion. Deficits and demand pressures strongly
contributed to the depreciation of the Ghana Cedi, which lost approximately 45 percent of
its value against the US dollar in the year to June 2009, and to accelerated consumer price
inflation, which reached 20.7 percent in June 2009.

8.      In response, the Government immediately adopted a multi-year fiscal
stabilization plan to bring down the deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2011. Immediate
actions in 2009 sought to restore expenditure control and the 2009 Budget Law approved
by Parliament in March 2009 targeted a 9.4 percent fiscal deficit in CY2009. Subsequent
structural reforms in the public sector and in energy are intended to stabilize (in 2010)
and then reduce (from 2011) the debt to (non-oil) GDP ratio. By focusing on non-oil
GDP, targets can be met even if oil revenues, expected to flow in the last quarter of 2010,
are delayed. The 2010 Budget Law laid out before Parliament in November 2009 targets
a 7.5 percent fiscal deficit in CY2010.

9.      The International Monetary Fund (IMF) supports the Government's fiscal
stabilization plan. On July 15, 2009 the IMF Board approved a 3-year arrangement
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for Ghana in an amount of
US$600 million to support the government's economic program to tackle macroeconomic
imbalances. The IMF acknowledges that the current fiscal deficit will take time to be
resolved due to structural rigidities. While substantial up-front adjustment was needed in
2009 to limit the potentially adverse consequences of fiscal imbalances for inflation and
public debt, additional measures will still be needed in 2010 and 2011 to bring down the
fiscal deficit to sustainable levels. The program is expected to be reviewed by the IMF
Board in May/ June 2010.3

10.     Through the EGPRC, the Bank has also been supporting structural reforms
to restore budget discipline and tackle long-standing public sector and energy
issues, while protecting the poor.4 Efforts supported by the EGPRC concentrated on
measures to: (i) establish a treasury single account, improve compliance with the public
procurement law, correct any budget deviations (fiscal deficit, pro-poor expenditures),
publish fiscal accounts, and submit to Parliament the Freedom of Information Bill; (ii)
reconstitute the boards of energy-related utilities and regulatory authority, adopt an
electricity sector financial recovery plan, adopt legislation on oil and gas regulatory
framework and fiscal regime, implement a net hiring freeze in the public sector, eliminate

  This exercise will be a combined first and second review of the PRGF.
4
  EGPRC was approved on June 30, 2009 by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors, for a total
amount of US$300 million equivalent to be disbursed in two successive tranches of US$150 million each.
The first tranche was disbursed upon effectiveness in July 2009. The Government plans to complete all
second tranche release actions in Q3 FY10. By February 2010, prior actions regarding (i) the meeting of
fiscal deficit and pro-poor expenditure targets, (ii) the submission of the freedom of information bill to the
Parliament, (iii) the classification of pro-poor expenditures were considered met by the World Bank staff,
pending receipt of appropriate means of verification. Progress was also significant on the remaining prior
actions, that is, the approval by Cabinet of the electricity financial recovery plan and the fiscal and
regulatory frameworks for the oil and gas sectors, the elimination of ghost workers from the Ghana
Education Service and the classification of Sub-vented Agencies. A Minister of State for Public Sector
Reform was appointed and employment audits initiated in all MDAs.

                                                      3
   ghost workers in health and education services, classify half of sub-vented agencies in
   preparation for their rationalization, divestiture, or commercialization; and (iii) extend the
   number of beneficiaries in Ghana's cash transfer program5 and review the effectiveness
   of pro-poor expenditures.

   11.     Since mid-2009, the economy has shown strong signs of stabilization, while
   weathering the impact of the global financial crisis. Both the fiscal and current account
   deficits were reduced during 2009, in part because of positive exogenous shocks (high
   hydroelectric reserves with good rains, lower oil prices, high cocoa and gold prices and a
   good cocoa harvest) as well as significant progress in fiscal stabilization. The fiscal

deficit fell to 9.7 percent of GDP by end of 2009 (against 11.8 percent a year earlier)
while the balance of payments' current account registered a 9.9 percent of GDP deficit
(against 16.6 percent a year earlier). Since July 2009 the exchange rate broadly stabilized
against the US$, and the inflation rate started to decelerate to 15.9 percent ­ close to the
Bank of Ghana target of 14.6 percent and within the range agreed with the Fund. By
February 2010 6-month Treasury Bills were subscribed at 18.7 percent down from 26.4
percent in February 2009. Real GDP growth decelerated in 2009 to 4 percent compared
to 7.3 percent in 2008.6 The banking sector has expanded rapidly (by 25 percent through
September 2009) while maintaining strong capital adequacy ratios, although the share of
non-performing loans has increased to 14.7 percent in December 2009 (roughly double
the previous year's figure). Poor financial positions of some state owned enterprises is
affecting a number of specific banks.7

         B.       MACRO-ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
12.      By end-2009, the IMF considered Ghana to be on track to meet its medium
term fiscal targets. Estimates for end-2009 point to a fiscal deficit marginally above the
fiscal target of 9.4 percent set forth in the 2009 Budget. Higher than anticipated domestic
interest costs and arrears, and lower than anticipated grants and tax revenue contributed
to the slippage. In contrast, primary expenditures were severely compressed (although the
share of pro-poor expenditures was protected)8, thereby contributing strongly to fiscal
deficit reduction. The Government and the IMF agreed to revise the fiscal deficit target
for 2010 upward (from 6.0 percent GDP initially envisaged at the signature of the PRGF,
to 7.5 percent), so as to accommodate the continued liquidation of expenditure arrears
and outstanding commitments.9,10 Such a revision is also increasing the targeted fiscal


6
  GDP estimates are based on indirect indicators of supply and a 15-year old base year - 1993, possibly not
reflecting structural economic changes which occurred since. GDP is currently being revised by the
Statistical Service with IMF technical assistance using 2004 as the base year. The exercise could entail
significant revisions in GDP levels.
7
  For instance, Ghana Commercial Bank is particular exposed to the debts of Tema Oil Refinery. While
Government initiated a plan to securitize this debt in late-2009 this is yet to be finalized.
8
   The share of pro-poor expenditure in total expenditure stood at 26.8 percent by end-September 2009,
against 24.9 percent targeted for the full year 2009. In comparison, the share of actual pro-poor expenditure
in total expenditure stood at 22.7 percent in 2008 (against 24.5 percent targeted).
9
   The review at Parliament in August 2009 of the budget 2009 execution at mid-year revealed a stock of
outstanding public expenditure arrears and commitments largely exceeding that budgeted (US$ 1.2 billion
or 7.9 percent of GDP, against 2.5 percent budgeted). Such a stock was actually constituted of three
different types of commitments, of equal orders or magnitude: first, arrears accumulated in 2008 vis-à-vis
various Government funds (social security, district assembly common fund, national health insurance
scheme, Ghana education trust fund), as the Authorities fell short of resources to honor their commitments
given larger than budgeted wage expenditures; second, claims to cover energy-related losses of state
enterprises; and third, off-budget expenditures incurred mostly by the Ministry of Energy, as commitment
controls were relaxed to rapidly increase generation capacity following shortages in late 2007. The
supplementary budget adopted by Parliament in August 2009 for the remainder of 2009 allowed for raising
by 0.4 percent of GDP the appropriation to reimburse arrears.
10
   As part of a multi-year stabilization plan, the IMF considers the fiscal deficit target of 7.5 percent of
GDP for 2010 financeable. Fiscal and external deficits are financeable with an additional US$100 ­ 150
million support from the donor community in addition to the funding already planned for program grants
and loans (which included US$100 million from the World Bank).

                                                     5
   deficit target for 2011, at 5.4 percent of non-oil GDP against a previous target of 4.5
   percent.

   13.     Progress in 2010 towards fiscal stabilization is predicated on several
   important government reforms. While structural reforms in the public energy sector
   and public financial management are expected to prevent the recurrence of expenditure
   slippages, most of the fiscal adjustment will stem from additional tax and non tax
   revenue. Additional revenue will originate from the removal of important tax exemptions,
   the conversion of excise to ad-valorem taxes (to avoid inflation erosion), increased
   royalties from the mining sector, higher dividend distribution from state-owned
   enterprises, and better alignment of user fees with costs. The Fund noted the risk of a
   shortfall from over-ambitious revenue projections. In response, additional measures have
   been identified, including the securitization of some arrears that were initially to be
   repaid in 2010.

   14.    Successful fiscal stabilization is also predicated on positive GDP growth.
   Budget computations for 2010 are based on real GDP growth of 5 percent ­ 6 percent11
   which is dependent on a number of optimistic assumptions such as continued high export
   demand and prices12 and good rains. Following the sharp reduction of investments in


   11
      MoFEP plans on a 6.5 percent real GDP growth, while the IMF retains 5 percent. Nominal GDP growth
   assumptions are nevertheless the same, given different GDP deflator assumptions.
   12
      Terms of trade are forecast to worsen in 2010 (-11 percent), under the influence of rising oil prices.
   Export prices (gold, cocoa), if declining, are nevertheless expected to remain high in the central scenario, at

                                                                6
2009 there is a risk that growth could be constrained in 2010 through supply side effects.
By mid-2009, the output gap was estimated close to nil by the IMF, emphasizing the lack
of excess productive capacity. Under a low case scenario characterized by a less
favorable external and climatic environment, GDP growth could fall to 3 percent ­ 4
percent.

15.     The Government strategy is subject to risks. Successful negotiations with the
unions to secure a within-budget public wage increase and a gradual implementation of
the `single spine' reform13 are far from guaranteed. The recurrence of energy subsidies to
the industrial sector in particular14 is possible and measures to significantly increase tax
and non tax revenue may fall short of targets. Should one of these risks materialize,
additional fiscal adjustment would be needed, possibly through greater compression of
domestically-financed investment. This would call for a rapid reform of the earmarked
funds which finance most domestic capital expenditures in order to grant greater
discretion and flexibility to fiscal policy15 and/ or speedier disbursement of project loans
and grants, which would substitute for domestically financed investment projects to
sustain growth. Other options could include increased taxation on petroleum products,
capital gains or windfall taxes, and delayed payments on non essential items.16

16.     The implementation of the Government's economic stabilization and reform
program should minimize risks of external debt distress. The joint IDA-IMF debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) of July 7, 2009, assessed Ghana as remaining at a moderate
risk of debt distress, in spite of the large fiscal deficit in 2008 and consequent increase in
debt to GDP ratio. Indeed, while the starting point for the debt projections was less
favorable than in 2008, the combination of a more ambitious fiscal consolidation with a
greater insurance that oil production will start in late 2010 (and thus its inclusion in the
baseline scenario) contributed to a more favorable baseline than in 2008. Public sector net
debt (accounting for oil wealth saved in initial years of extraction) is projected to fall to
less than 40 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period (2029), down from 60
percent ­ 70 percent in 2008. However, failure to reduce the primary deficit from 2009
levels would be associated with a near doubling of the debt to GDP ratio over two


their 2008 level. Between 2004 and 2009, export prices grew by 67 percent, and were at their highest in
2009.
13
   The reform aims at unifying salary scales across the various public sector entities. Since it is not intended
to negatively affect anyone's salary, the implementation of the reform could be fiscally expensive. 100
million Ghana Cedi was budgeted in 2010 to start its implementation, to be completed over a five-year
period.
14
   The possible resumption of aluminum smelting operations at the state-owned VALCO would necessarily
entail large fiscal costs given that production is viable only with extremely cheap electricity, much below
marginal or average costs. Besides, the exclusion in the electricity financial recovery plan of large
electricity tariffs for the mining sector (currently subsidized through cheap electricity) could also endanger
the recovery of the sector at large, given the need in the alternative to substantially raise residential tariffs,
which might prove to be politically difficult.
15
   The sum of statutory funds (National Health Insurance Scheme, Social Security, Ghana Education Trust
Fund, Road Fund, District Assembly Common Fund, HPIC and MDRI related funds) the wage bill,
pensions and debt service constituted 80 percent of domestically financed expenditures in 2009.

decades. The debt sustainability analysis also underlines the need for continued
improvement in the business climate and prudent management of Ghana's oil revenues,
given the critical importance of strong growth in the non-oil sector for debt sustainability.

17.      Debt sustainability is also predicated on prudent non-concessional
borrowing. Following the issuance of US$750 million worth of Eurobonds in 2007 (to
finance additional electricity capacity and road networks), Ghana borrowed the
equivalent of US$458 million in 2008 to finance projects for rural electrification,
electricity capacity, housing and health. These projects are believed to carry important
development benefits, although lack of quantitative information precludes rigorous
assessment of their economic and social returns. The non-concessional borrowing policy
note distributed to the Board of Executive Directors in January 2010 recommended that
(i) IDA continue to provide Ghana its full IDA allocation on blend terms in FY2010 and
(ii) the policy should be reviewed before any new lending in FY2011.17 The PRGF
includes a US$300 million annual ceiling for non-concessional borrowing acknowledging
its relevance to financing projects related to oil and gas.

Macro-Economic Outlook, Agriculture and the Potential Impacts of Oil
18.     As Ghana seeks to benefit from the discovery of off-shore oil reserves,
measures will be needed to channel revenues into productive investments to mitigate
potential Dutch disease effects. Competitiveness will decline with real exchange rate
appreciation resulting from macroeconomic impacts of oil economy ­ as observed
elsewhere in the world. A recent World Bank assessment18 suggests that poor
management of oil revenues could push Ghana's long-term growth path below the non-
oil baseline trajectory, with long-term per capita growth of 2.3 percent compared to 3.4
percent for the baseline. (The model assumes existing distortions remain ­ freeing these
up would allow faster spending without such strong real exchange rate effects.) Under
this adverse scenario, by 2039 per capita incomes would be 20 percent lower than
otherwise. Investing a high proportion of oil revenues in productive investments will help
mitigate downside impacts by off-setting appreciation through productivity gains.

19.     Declining agricultural output and exports are a very real possibility. At the
peak of oil production in 2015 the model predicts that farm exports would suffer a
reduction of between 5.5 percent ­ 6.5 percent and that aggregate agricultural output
would fall by 1.0 percent ­ 1.2 percent compared to the base case. Cocoa would
particularly suffer although the nascent horticultural sector would also be adversely
affected as Ghana's competitiveness is severely compromised. In addition, the
combination of increased demand associated with the boom and long-term economic


17
    The recommendation is based on the following factors: (i) market conditions have changed
fundamentally; (ii) additional external financing sought by the Ghanaian authorities aimed at supporting
ongoing development projects is needed to sustain economic growth and assist in meeting the MDGs; (iii) a
graduated response permits time to assess developments as they unfold, including projected oil exports
beginning in 2011; and (iv) there are benefits associated with IDA's continued full engagement with this
country as it makes sectoral policy choices and builds up its own capacity to evaluate the expected returns
on its public investments.
18

decline of the non-oil sectors would imply significant redistributive consequences and
increased inequality. For example, a 10 percent appreciation is associated with a decline
in incomes of export farmers of 3 percent compared to a 0.6 percent increase in incomes
for public sector employees. Interestingly, this analysis suggests a small gain to food crop
farmers; however this is predicated on food crops remaining largely untradeable which,
given further improvements in transport infrastructure and more efficient value chains, is
unlikely.

20.    Sound fiscal management (for instance through a permanent income fund)
would provide additional resources for public investment of $458 million per year
which could be used in the agricultural sector. Sound investments of oil revenues
would reduce consumption expenditures (that are the major driver of real exchange rate
appreciation) while also funding public investments with the largest contribution to
productivity improvements. It is noteworthy that this sum is roughly equivalent to
average aid receipts over the last 5 years. Careful selection of the most appropriate
investments with the greatest productivity-enhancing pay-offs will be important.
Measures to close the yield gap (see below) would be a strong candidate since their
impact, given available technologies, could be reasonably rapid (compared to technical
innovation which has a long lag).

         C.       TRENDS IN POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
21.     Ghana recorded very significant poverty reduction between 1999 and 2006.
The estimated proportion of the poor in the total population went down from 39 percent
in 1999 to 29 percent in 2006.19 While all major regions recorded reductions in poverty,
some achieved them much more rapidly than others with the result that 86 percent of
Ghana's poor now reside in rural areas. The bulk of poverty is concentrated in the three
northern regions which now comprise more than half of the poor (against a fourth of
Ghana's population). There is substantial opportunity cost of lagging regions in terms of
foregone national GDP growth: had the northern regions grown at the same rate as the
national average in the seven years through 2004, national per capita incomes would have
been 5 percent higher.20 Inequality has increased with a Gini coefficient of 0.423
(2004/05) compared to 0.373 in 1991/92, and is now similar to Nigeria and Thailand.21
Efforts to address the special needs of these lagging regions have been initiated in the
recent past, and there are ongoing efforts to amplify them in the context of an ambitious
Savanna Accelerated Development Initiative which is supported by several DPs including
the Bank. (See Box 1.)

22.    Since 2006, various factors have affected poverty positively and negatively,
complicating the aggregate assessment. Per capita real consumption grew by almost 30
percent, which, if equally shared across households, should have generated substantial


19
   Poverty rates are computed using the national poverty line. Estimates using the international poverty line
of US$1.25 a day put the poverty rate at 30 percent in 2006, down from 39 percent in 1999.

   According to the latest World Development Indicators, the Gini coefficients for Nigeria and Thailand are
0.429 (2003/04) and 0.425 (2004) respectively.

poverty reduction gains (assuming unchanged distribution, the headcount index would
have approached 20 percent). However, important uncertainties regarding the
measurement of private consumption and its distribution among households and regions,
and the fact that some recent shocks might have disproportionally affected the poor
(droughts and floods in the Northern regions, food price increases in cities) could mean
lower realized reduction in poverty.

Box 1: The Sustainable Development Initiative for the Northern Savannah
Addressing the challenges of Ghana's Northern parts ­ an increasingly lagging region that does not have
the development benefits enjoyed elsewhere ­ is an important policy priority of the Government, and has
obvious implications for agricultural spending. Following the floods of 2007, the Office of the President
launched the Northern Development Initiative and established a Task Force to propose strategies for
developing Northern Ghana. This Task Force, made up of eminent persons from economic and political
think tanks, academia and civil society (with a strong representation from Northern groups) proposed: (i) a
specific development strategy for the North based on existing natural resource endowments (ii) the
establishment of a Northern Development Fund to secure specific financing for such a strategy; and (iii) an
Authority to oversee these efforts and coordinate other actors. An Act establishing the Fund was passed by
Parliament in November 2008.
The new Government has reiterated its commitment to advancing this agenda, and has expanded the
initiative from the three regions of the North (Northern Region, Upper East and Upper West) to cover the
entire Guinea Savannah agro-ecological zone (which includes the northern Districts of Brong Ahafo, Volta
Region and Eastern Region). The Savannah Accelerated Development Authority (SADA) is being
constituted to oversee implementation of the Strategy and the Act will be revised accordingly; an updated
Sustainable Development Initiative for the Northern Savannah with a twenty-year horizon (2010 ­ 2030) is
being finalized. Critical institutional issues of interface between the SADA and existing line ministries,
fiscal authority (for fund raising and expenditure controls) and governance structures will need to be
resolved. Clearly, the outcome of these deliberations and subsequent adoption by Government will have a
significant bearing on MoFA and existing institutions responsible for the agricultural sector. These are
currently uncertain, and further policy dialogue is required to establish clear institutional responsibility for
delivery of the Agricultural Policy. An initial allocation to SADA of Gh¢25million was made from the
FY2010 Budget.


23.     In 2010 income poverty could rise further, as per capita growth in private
consumption is expected to fall. Planned fiscal adjustment, such as increased cost
recovery in the energy sector and increased taxation, is expected to result in stagnant
aggregate per capita real private consumption in 2010, which would increase income
poverty in the absence of changes in income distribution. This underlines the importance
of protecting vulnerable households from the downturn in economic activity through
targeted measures, such as a further extension of the cash transfer program (Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty [LEAP]) to new beneficiaries and the protection of pro-
poor public expenditures as the budget contracts. The Government's recent review of
existing social protection mechanisms identifies LEAP as the best targeted available
instrument for reaching the poor,22 even if implementation costs remain. On the other
hand, tax exemptions for consumer goods and services (food imports, electricity,
petroleum) or inputs (diesel) mostly benefit the non-poor.


22
  World Bank staff calculations suggest that with 60 percent of its beneficiaries below the poverty line,
LEAP has the highest targeting efficiency among Ghana's social programs and subsidies.

24.     Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) depicts a
picture of quick gains but with some notable exceptions. The income poverty, hunger,
completion rates for primary schooling, gender parity at school and access to water goals
(MDG1a, MDG1b, MDG2, MDG3 and MDG7a respectively) are on track.23 Service
provision has been extended to millions of poor people in the past decade, and protecting
these gains must be a key priority. At the same time, other important MDGs, such as
sanitation (MDG7b), child (MDG4) and maternal mortality24 (MDG5) are still off-track
and require more effort. While progress on health-related MDGs would need to rely
mostly on efficiency gains (and goals may need to be revisited)25 a case can be made to
raise resources allocated to sanitation.26

               D.             RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
25.   Agriculture has driven Ghana's aggregate economic growth in recent years,
and remains the economy's backbone and the primary livelihood for the majority of
the population (of 22.5 million), especially the poorest. Agricultural GDP (AgGDP),


23
   When at least two observations are available after 1990, with a sufficient number of years separating
them, the World Bank determines whether a country is on or off track to meet a given MDG by 2015. To
do so, it compares the progress recorded so far with that needed to reach the MDG, under the assumption
that progress becomes increasingly difficult the closer countries get to the goal. Technically, this is
equivalent to comparing the annual growth rate between 1990 and today with the constant growth rate
required to reach the MDG in 2015 from the situation in 1990.
24
   Given the difficulty to estimate and monitor on a regular basis maternal mortality, an input indicator ­
birth attendance by skilled health staff ­ is retained for measuring progress. In 2007, the maternal mortality
rate was estimated at 451 deaths per 100,000 live births.

which accounts for almost 40 percent of the economy, grew by 4.3 percent in 2007 and
5.1 percent in 2008, with provisional outlook for 2009 indicating an increase of 5.7
percent (Table 3).27 Continued liberalization of the sector has been the main driver of
growth.28 In the early 1980s nominal rates of assistance were estimated to be -21 percent
(i.e. net taxation of the sector). By the early 2000's (2000 ­ 04) average taxation across
all commodities had fallen to 1.4 percent. While the main exportable sector ­ cocoa ­
during this recent period continued to be heavily taxed (implicit rates of -20 percent)
import-competing and other important food crops benefitted from substantial protection.
(Rice and maize benefit from a nominal assistance of +31 percent and +39 percent
respectively). Thus although the aggregate rate of taxation had fallen between the 1980s
and mid 2000s, significant differences in treatment of exportables and import substitutes
remained. The removal of import tariffs on food grains in response to the 2008 spike in
global food prices undoubtedly reduced the protection of import substitutes, although
quantification is not yet updated.

26.     In rural Ghana, poverty remains high in areas where the production of food
staples dominates. Poverty is higher and more extreme in the lagging regions of
Northern Ghana characterized by Guinea Savannah agro-ecological conditions. Poverty
rates in the Northern Region, Upper East and Upper West regions are 52 percent, 70
percent and 88 percent respectively, and these regions account for almost half of Ghana's
poor.29 Farming is the primary economic activity in these locations. The poverty rate of
46 percent among food crop farmers (nationally) is the highest among all occupational
economic groups, compared, for instance, to a rate of 8 percent among public sector
workers. Other locations in central and southern Ghana enjoy greater potential for
diversification into export crops (e.g. horticulture and cocoa). Poverty rates among export
crop farmers have fallen from 64 percent in 1991/92 to 24 percent in 2004/05, illustrating

   Ghana's national statistics are currently being revised, with technical assistance from the IMF. In
particular, the national accounts are currently based on 1993. A 2004 Supply and Use Table is now
available and includes more updated and comprehensive sources. The IMF has recommended to the Ghana
Statistical Service that this new Supply and Use Table forms the basis for benchmarking national accounts
in the future. See Appendix III, Ghana: Statistical Issues 2008 Article IV Consultation (IMF Country
Report No. 08/344) for further details.

that opportunities for improved livelihoods are available. Taking advantage of these
opportunities, however, requires a set of household attributes and environmental factors
(e.g. the availability of services) that are not always available to all smallholders.

27.     Ghana is reasonably food secure at the national level although household
food insecurity is a concern in certain regions. Significant food imports are rice
(almost half a million tonnes costing $600 million in 2009) and poultry with imports of
88,000mt in 2008 (twice the 2006 figure). Ghana does not face significant food deficits
and enjoys surpluses in certain commodities (see Table 4). However, in the Northern,
Upper East and Upper West, 10 percent, 15 percent and 34 percent of the respective
households are currently food insecure.30 Vulnerability to food insecurity is also observed
in other regions such as Ashanti and Brong Ahafo.

28.     The recent food and fuel price crises did not affect Ghana as badly as they
did other African countries, as gains in cocoa and gold partly off-set losses
elsewhere.31 Cocoa prices doubled in a year to over $3,000 per mt in mid-2008 and
remain at these levels. Nevertheless, local food prices did rise and remain high, in part
due to a poor second cropping season in 2008 in Southern Ghana. The prices of
agricultural inputs also increased with urea prices peaking at around $800 per mt in April
2008 compared to about $240 a year later. Global food prices have subsided somewhat
with rice now trading at around $500 per mt compared to over $1000 per mt in April
2008.32

29.    The food price increase weakened the terms of trade of many food-deficit
households.33 Previously, one days' labor provided wages sufficient to purchase 7kg of
maize in the Northern Region and 9.6kg in the Upper West. In October 2008, these
household terms of trade fell to 3.5kg and 5.6kg respectively. However, existing
production and consumption patterns suggest that the impact on overall poverty rates is

somewhat muted as most poor households are self-sufficient.34 For instance, a 25 percent
increase in cereal prices is predicted to increase the headcount poverty rate from 28.5
percent to 29.2 percent, a small jump given a substantial price change (although this
analysis excluded impacts of the financial crisis which is likely to have lowered incomes
including from remittances).

              3. THE GOVERNMENT'S AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM

30.     Given the importance of agriculture as a source of employment and
livelihoods, especially for Ghana's poor, agriculture features prominently in
Government's policies and programs. `Modernizing Agriculture' is a key pillar of the
GPRS II and is likely to feature prominently in the successor (the Medium Term National
Development Policy Framework). Given future prospects ­ and in particular oil ­ setting
clear objectives and achieving outcomes for agricultural development are increasingly
pressing. This section sets out the overarching policy environment in particular under the
CAADP (Section 3.A) and key existing government interventions (Section 3.B) focusing
on the response to the 2008 food price crisis and the fertilizer voucher scheme, fisheries
reform, and public expenditure management in the sector.

        A.       POLICY CONTEXT
31.      FASDEP II provides overall policy direction under six broad headings: (i)
food security and emergency preparedness; (ii) improved growth in incomes; (iii)
increased competitiveness and enhanced integration into domestic and international
markets; (iv) sustainable management of land and environment; (v) science and
technology applied to food security and agricultural development; and (vi) effective
institutional coordination. The key objectives and outcomes are summarized in Annex 1.
These are consistent with the four `pillars' of CAADP35 as supported by the African
Union (AU) and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).

32.     FASDEP II is a Government strategy and it explicitly recognizes the
collective efforts across Ministries that are required to achieve sectoral outcomes.
Cabinet endorsement is an important facet which promotes better coordination within
Government recognizing that investments of many ministries and agencies contribute to
sectoral outcomes. One weakness of FASDEP II, however, is that responsibility for the
cocoa remains with the cocoa marketing agency (COCOBOD) under the oversight of
MoFEP thereby undermining efforts at intra-Governmental coordination; a process to
revise the cocoa sector strategy has been underway although there is currently no clear
time frame for bringing this to a close.

Analysis for Ghana, World Bank Policy research Working Paper 4741, 2008.
35
   CAADP is organized along the following four pillars: (i) Extending the area under sustainable land
management and reliable water control systems; (ii) Improving rural infrastructure and trade-related
capacities for market access; (iii) Increasing food supply and reducing hunger; and (iv) Agricultural
research, technology dissemination and adoption.

                                                   14
33.     The Policy articulates an appropriate dual role for government to (i) foster an
enabling policy and regulatory environment to encourage supporting private sector
investments and (ii) provide priority investments and services where justified on the
grounds of market failure, because they are public goods (or services) or because of
equity concerns. It stresses the importance of transformation towards a modernized
agricultural sector ­ a theme carried over from the GPRS II ­ based on a diagnostic of
key constraints that has been validated through extensive stakeholder dialogue.

34.      The basic policy direction is set and unchanged. The new Government,
however, is refining the implementation priorities motivated by its own specific
agenda and in response to latest global developments. These will be presented in the
new Sector Plan covering the period 2010 ­ 2015. Consequently, beyond the current
agreed reform program supported by the Bank, the Government's detailed policy and
institutional agenda remains to be fully articulated. Government has set out an agenda of
immediate follow-up to the CAADP Round Table to complete the Sector Plan and
translate implementation priorities into a fully-costed investment program. The Sector
Plan also entails deepening donor harmonization and progress towards sector wide
approach (SWAp).

Progress in CAADP
35.     Ghana is participating actively in the CAADP process and completed the
Round Table on October 27 ­ 28, 2009.           Completion of the Sector Plan and
finalization of a fully-costed investment program are now the priorities. The signing
of the Compact was the culmination of an extensive consultative process and involved
private sector, civil society, donors (the Bank signed in its capacity as chair of the
Agricultural Sector Working Group) and a number of critical line ministries including
MoFA, and MoFEP. The Compact commits signatories to step-up support for the sector
and to improve coordination and harmonization in development efforts.

36.     As part of its commitment to CAADP, GoG is increasing budgetary
allocations to the sector. The Compact reaffirms Government's commitment to the
pledge under the Maputo Declaration.36 While GoG has been reporting allocations to the
AU/ NEPAD, there is no full consensus on what constitutes sector expenditure and a
baseline is required to effectively monitor progress.37 The narrowest definition is
spending by MoFA which amounts to less than 2 percent of public spending. If spending
on rural roads (under the Ministry of Transport) and agricultural research (under Ministry
of Science and Technology) are added the ratio increases to about 4 percent ­ 5 percent.
This is increased further to about 9 percent if expenditures by COCOBOD are added. It
should be noted however that the latter does not constitute public expenditure according


36
   The Maputo Declaration, made by African leaders in the context of the AU Summit in 2003, calls for 10
percent of national budgets to be allocated to agriculture sector with the aim of achieving 6 percent annual
growth and 5 percent annual labor productivity growth in the sector.
37
   An effort is underway in Ghana to (i) agree at a technical level how to account for multi-use expenditures
that contribute to agriculture sector outcomes (such as spending on rural roads); and (ii) confirm these
protocols within the budget guidelines to promote their consistent application to monitor progress against
the Maputo Declaration.

                                                     15
to the IMF's definitions.38 The recently approved Budget indicates budgetary allocations
to MoFA will increase from less than 2 percent in recent years to 2.5 percent in FY2010
and 3.20 percent in FY2011. 39 (Figures for spending across the sector are not available.)

         B.      ON-GOING PRIORITY GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS
37.     Improving small-holder productivity remains the focus of Government
efforts to modernize agriculture. Yield gaps ­ the difference between typical observed
yields and potential yields in well-run farms ­ are significant, ranging from 20 percent ­
60 percent conservatively measured (Table 5). Analysis suggests that closing the yield
gaps will increase agGDP growth to 6 percent by 2015.40 But this implies significant
scaling up of annual productivity growth: yields of maize would need to increase
annually by 6.1 percent compared to the 3.8 percent trend. This requires concerted efforts
across the extension services. An improved extension system is also needed if Ghana is to
adapt well to climate change through application of new technologies.41

38.     Several strategies are required to close the productivity gap: (1) ensuring
existing technology is effectively disseminated to, and adopted by, farmers; (2) creating
marketing incentives for farmers to invest in productivity improvements; (3) organizing
farmers to better function in increasingly complex agricultural value chains; and (4)
expanding the coverage of irrigated agriculture.

39.      The main thrusts of existing Government programs include the following:

         Collaboration between agricultural extension agents (AEAs), farmers and
         research staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is
         organized through Research and Extension Liaison Committees (RELCs) to
         determine the nation's research agenda;
         `Block farms' and `one acre demonstration plots' are used to demonstrate the
         merits of new technology for surrounding farmers and to provide direct support
         for beneficiaries;
         MoFA and MoFEP are collaborating on new approaches to agricultural finance
         which might include reforming the existing Export Development Investment Fund
         (EDIF) to include agricultural projects;
         MoFA is reforming its extension services beyond a production focus to include
         down-stream elements of the value chain beyond the farm gate, and in particular
         measures to reduce post-harvest losses;

   As laid down in the Government Financial Statistics.

   This excludes MDA expenditure financed by internally generated funds (IGFs), debt relief (HIPC and
MDRI) and donor funding including budget support, which is accounted for separately in Ghana's chart of
accounts.

to Climate Change. The case study analysis is identifying a set of technically feasible technologies but it

           MoFA is restructuring and increasing its support for farmer-based organizations
           (FBOs) to strengthen their ability to act jointly in agricultural value chains; and
           Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA) currently focuses its support on
           the 22 large-scale formal irrigation schemes and MoFA is realigning GIDA to be
           more effective in supporting the management of small-scale informal schemes by
           water users associations (WUAs);
           Complementary efforts are under way to promote sustainable land management
           (SLM) technologies as a core element of extension services ­ together with
           improved irrigation management address climate change; and
           Ongoing programs to support the recovery of the pineapple industry complement
           measures to strengthen links between large-scale producers and surrounding out-
           growers.

Government's Response to Global Trends in Food Prices
40.      Although Ghana is self sufficient across key food staples, the global food
price crisis posed a threat to many households and presented an opportunity to
reinvigorate efforts to achieve existing agricultural development objectives such as
productivity improvements and efficiencies in the value chain. Consequently, the
Government outlined a program of short-term measures including: (i) trade policy
measures to restrict food exports to neighboring countries and suspension of import
tariffs on food staples; (ii) initiatives to substitute cassava flour for costly wheat imports
in the local baking industry; (iii) intensive efforts to increase adoption of higher yielding
varieties of key staples, in particular NERICA42 rice varieties; and (iv) a program to
mitigate the high fertilizer prices and thereby promote fertilizer use.

41.   In practice, the Government is focusing on delivering inputs to increase
productivity ­ especially the fertilizer subsidy. This reflects pragmatism on the part of


42
     New Rice for Africa.

                                                 17
the Ministry and a focus on results as well as desire to maintain flexibility in the approach
to respond to changing circumstances. Short term responses included the distribution of
essential inputs such as seeds and tools with the support of key development partners, in
particular the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In some instances such inputs
were provided on credit, but as often observed, repayment rates have been low. In
designing the public works program, MoFA's priority was to rehabilitate the dams
destroyed by the 2007 floods. GIDA promoted the use of labor intensive methods by the
contractors. In parallel, Government recognized the potential of public works as part of
the national social safety net infrastructure and has requested Bank support for a program
to enhance productive safety nets.

Results of the Fertilizer Voucher Scheme
42.      A central pillar of Government's response to the food price crisis is the
introduction of vouchers to mitigate fertilizer price rises. Recognized strengths of the
program are: (i) the lead of the private sector and the Government's non-interference in
the distribution of subsidized fertilizers; (ii) the freedom of farmers to decide from which
store to purchase fertilizers, compared to the previous system of distribution by para-
statals; and (iii) the decision to exclude the most commonly utilized type of fertilizer in
the cocoa subsector from the subsidy program, thereby ensuring adequate targeting of the
program towards the food grain subsector. The scheme seems to be having an impact: in
2008 the three northern regions exhibited significant production increases in key staples
compared to the five-year average. Apparent weaknesses of the subsidy program include:
(i) lack of an explicit beneficiary targeting mechanism; (ii) lack of observance of a strict
cap on the maximum number of vouchers per beneficiary; (iii) heavy involvement of
fertilizer importers in the implementation of the program, thereby excluding independent
dealers from participating in the program; and (iv) poor communications resulting in the
practice of dealers not selling fertilizers to farmers without a voucher. Furthermore,
absence of a tie between the fertilizer program and efforts to increase the supply of
improved seeds to farmers is a missed opportunity.

43.      Although global fertilizer prices have softened, the Government has
continued the voucher scheme in 2009 and plans to extend it through 2015. Prices
remained high when the 2009 program was finalized. Currently prices of phosphate
fertilizers remain above historic levels and while the price of urea has fallen back to its
2005/06 level, it remains highly sensitive to crude oil prices, which over the medium-to-
long term are expected to remain significantly higher than the historic average.
Accordingly, if the original aim was to prevent reduction in the use of fertilizers due to
high prices, the intention now appears to be to stimulate its use. Since resource-poor
farmers have limited access to credit, there is indeed scope to provide an alternative
rationale for the fertilizer subsidy program. However, this alternative rationale should be
explicitly reflected in the design and operational rules of the envisaged program in 2010.
More concretely:

       A more explicit targeting mechanism should distinguish between long-term users
       of fertilizers (for whom the subsidy is simply a monetary payment) and those
       farmers without a track record of fertilizer use (for whom the subsidy stimulates

                                             18
        change in technology). District councils and other relevant local government
        bodies should be active in the identification of eligible farmers;
        The fertilizer response rate should be raised by incorporating improved seed
        supply efforts into the program;
        Subsidies per eligible beneficiary should be clearly capped to contain costs;
        All legitimate input dealers should be included in the program to facilitate
        deepening of the fertilizer market. This can be achieved by organizing the
        redemption of vouchers through commercial banks rather than through fertilizer
        importers as currently is the case; and
        A credible exit strategy should be announced to manage expectations of farmers,
        input dealers and fertilizer importers.
44.    Synergies between fertilizer use and improved planting material and in
particular improved seeds should be enhanced. Typically a greater impact can be
achieved from interventions that provide both seeds and fertilizer than interventions
supporting either in isolation. Providing improved seeds to match the area to be treated
with subsidized fertilizer would cost an incremental $5.5million (assuming maize
production only for the sake of simplicity). Consideration should be given to expanding
the voucher scheme to promote improved inputs more broadly and not just fertilizer.
Interventions to support the demand side of the local seed market and measures on the
supply side including the new seed law (as well as assistance for seed growers under the
program funded by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa [AGRA]), which would
be mutually reinforcing).

45.     A National Fertilizer Symposium is planned to address these issues, to
provide a forum for stakeholder consultation and to propose a set of protocols for
continued implementation of the program. This will build on three important reviews
have been undertaken: an assessment of the modalities of the program by the
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), a small survey of beneficiaries
sponsored by the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana, and an internal workshop
among MoFA staff involved in the program. Each has raised a number of concerns over
the efficiency and efficacy of the program, with proposals for refinement. At an estimated
cost of $30 million for FY2009, this program constitutes the largest single program of
MoFA. Efficient targeting and a clear exit strategy are required to contain costs of the
program, and measures to increase its impact should be adopted.

Fisheries Management
46.    Fishing is a major source of income for households along Ghana's 550km
coastline as well as communities around Lake Volta43 and spillovers with ancillary




43
  Data from the GLSS IV (2005/06) reveals that communities on the coast derive 40 percent - 50 percent
of their incomes from fishing, while for those on the Volta these figures are as high as 75 percent - 80
percent.

                                                   19
activities are also significant.44 Yet the policy framework for both inland freshwater
fishing, including aquaculture, and the management of Ghana's substantial off-shore
resources is poorly developed. Currently Ghana fails to realize the full benefit of its
fisheries natural resources while simultaneously suffering from over-exploitation and an
unsustainable catch.45 A fuel subsidy for the artisanal fleet costs the Government about
$10million per year and adds to over-fishing.

47.     Previously responsibility lay with both the Ministry of Fisheries (MoFi) and
the Fisheries Commission. Confusion in the accountability between these two bodies
prevented the implementation of MoFi's Aquaculture Strategic Framework (2006).
Clarification was required with regard to the roles and responsibilities of MoFi and the
Fisheries Commission, and this was largely accomplished by the abolition of MoFi by the
new Government, and the transfer of policy responsibility to a department in MoFA. The
Fisheries Commission is the superior authority for strategic policy making in the sector
and should be well placed to lead future reforms. Following approval of the Fisheries
Policy, the Government requested Bank experts to assess the magnitude of the challenge
and quantify the benefits of improved management to guide implementation. An options
paper has been submitted to Government for their review, and continued support from the
Bank and other donors will follow once a decision is made on the preferred way forward.

Public Expenditure in the Agricultural Sector
48.      Increased sectoral spending must be accompanied by improvements in
expenditure management to ensure that incremental resources are well spent. As
part of the MDBS assessment process, Ghana undertakes an annual external review of
public financial management (ERPFM)46 which highlights areas of weakness in generic
PFM systems. In addition, MoFA recently concluded its own Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (PEIR) of the sector.47 While the system is sufficiently robust for
successful implementation of a budget support instrument, a number of areas for
improvement could increase the impact of resources flowing through governmental
systems. Of particular concern is the failure of the three year rolling medium term
expenditure framework (MTEF) to properly function as a budgeting, planning and
expenditure control instrument ­ manifesting most clearly in aspirational outer-year
projections far in excess of first-year approved budgets. MoFA has estimated the
financing needs to achieve the objectives contained in FASDEP II for the next three years
­ annual requirements are more than double the allocations for FY2009. Not all programs

   There is extensive media coverage of so-called `pair trawling' by commercial vessels. Many of these are

        are fully accounted for.48 Table 6 is based on the presentation to the FY2010 Budget
        hearing: total requests are around Gh¢600 million while the 2009 allocation was Gh¢290
        million ­ including donor funds. On the one hand, this is indicative of an obvious funding
        gap that could be filled with additional resources. At the same time, a scale-up is unlikely
        to completely address the funding gap and there is no established and robust prioritization
        by which the most important projects will secure funding first.

        49.     Management of internally generated funds is an important element of
        expenditure management particularly for a number of agencies under MoFA's
        responsibility. However, as noted in the EGPRC, the Controller and Account General
        Department (CAGD) adopts a narrow interpretation of the 2003 Financial Administration
        Act and excludes expenditures from internally generated funds ­ i.e. revenues earned by
        agencies for services provided ­ from the consolidated financial reports. The extent to
        which revenues can be retained by the agencies (instead of being transferred to the
        Treasury) generates incentives for additional revenue-raising. The Fisheries Directorate,
        for instance, is largely funded through receipts. The Veterinary Services Department, in
        contrast, retains about 25 percent of revenues while the Animal Production Unit must
        lodge all its revenues with MoFEP. Internally generated funds are particularly important
        in the formal irrigation sector, with the large schemes able to charge and keep user fees.
        This presents an opportunity for a wider strategic review of prospects for cost-recovery
        among those parts of MoFA providing essentially private goods and services where at
        least part-payment for services provided could be feasible.

        50.    MoFA is implementing measures to improve the effectiveness with which
        current resources are deployed. A number of defunct committees have been
        reconvened, including the Budget Committee, the Internal Audit Committee, the
        Procurement Committee and the Estates Committee. Similarly, although not one of the
        pilot ministries, MoFA has installed a terminal of the Budget and Public Expenditure
        Management System (BPEMS) on its own initiative and requested MoFEP to be
        connected to the national infrastructure to improve budget and expenditure control.




        48
          For instance, the fertilizer voucher program is not funded under MoFA's allocation but from MoFEP
        contingency. While this was understandable in the first year of operation ­ it was, after all, an emergency
        response mid-year ­ if the program is to continue it needs to be properly budgeted and accounted for.

                                                             21
Further technical assistance to roll out the follow-on proposed Ghana Integrated Financial
Management and Information System is being provided by the Government of Japan.

51.      Two major assessments (the general ERPFM and the MoFA-specific PEIR)
conclude that MoFA will benefit from systemic improvements in financial
management. Some common issues were more severe in MoFA compared to other
agencies and departments. For example, delayed release of payments for extension
activities bound by the agricultural cycle are quite damaging, as are staff costs that crowd
out resources for operation and investment. The PEIR reported a number of sector- and/
or ministry-specific challenges. Some of these are second generation issues that derive
from promising reforms: for instance, district level planning is commendable but annual
district budgeting must be cognizant of budget ceilings and the implied required
prioritization. Other recommendations include applying greater rigor to existing
procedures such as scrutiny over procurement. MoFA is implementing a number of these
reforms and has set out an action plan in response to the PEIR. Notable priority measures
include: strengthening decentralized planning by rolling out the pilots of integrated
planning of district assemblies and the district agricultural departments; the development
of a communication strategy for intra- and inter-ministerial communication;
commissioning of a review of the effectiveness of various extension modalities; and
preparation and maintenance of a database of MoFA staff at national and district levels.

            4. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

       A.      LINK TO THE CAS
52.     The AgDPO 2 remains consistent with the CAS as well as the Ghana Joint
Assistance Strategy, and supports the Bank's commitment to harmonization, as stated in
the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and, more recently, the Accra Agenda for
Action (AAA). Similarly, the AgDPO helps to implement the Africa Action Plan in four
of the eight focus areas: (i) strengthening the African private sector; (ii) increasing the
economic empowerment of women; (iii) building skills for competitiveness in the global
economy; and (iv) raising agricultural productivity. The AgDPO is part of the Bank's
action plan to scale up agriculture in Africa and support the Government's efforts to
establish policies to drive agricultural growth.

53.     The proposed operation (SDR 16.5 million; $25 million equivalent) is larger
than anticipated in the CAS. AgDPO 1 was augmented in response to global events not
foreseen in the CAS ­ i.e. the dramatic increase in food and fertilizer prices. Although
prices have eased since their peaks of mid-2008, overall global conditions are likely to
remain challenging, with medium-term food prices expected to remain above their
historic trends, and certain fertilizer prices expected to remain high. The rationale for
scaling-up remains applicable to the current operation.

54.    Whereas the CAS envisaged a series of three operations, the AgDPO 2 would
be the last of the current series with a new series to follow immediately thereafter.
This revised strategy, described in the draft CAS Progress Report reflects changing
external and internal factors. Specifically:


                                            22
        A new series provides greater flexibility and opportunities for harmonization in
        the post-CAADP roundtable context;
        Confirming a set of policy actions for AgDPO 3 would be premature since details
        of the policy framework will be elaborated in conjunction with the new Sector
        Plan under preparation. Discussion of support for specific future policy measures
        is deferred until preparation of the first operation of the next series; and
        The experience with the current series illustrates the challenge of maintaining a
        deep policy dialogue across an electoral period. A new series beginning in mid
        CY2010 would better align the operation with Ghana's electoral cycle.
        B.       COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
55.     Donor coordination in Ghana was launched through the Comprehensive
Development Framework in 1999. Coordination has deepened in accordance with the
Paris Declaration and, more recently, the AAA endorsed at the Third High Level Forum
(HLF) on Aid Effectiveness held in Ghana in September 2008. The Bank is active in the
Agriculture Sector Group. Membership includes all the donors active in the sector,
including the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA)49, the German agency for technical
cooperation (GTZ), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the French development
agency (AFD), USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the Japanese
International Cooperation Agency. It includes non-traditional donors too, such as AGRA
(with a large Ghana program and regional office in Accra) and the Brazilian agricultural
research and extension agency (EMBRAPA) which manages a program of south-south
cooperation.

56.    The CAADP Compact, signed by the Bank on behalf of all DPs, has
strengthened the framework for donor collaboration, and includes commitments to
enhance the impact of development assistance. In addition, all DPs signed a secondary
memorandum of understanding (MoU) to indicate clear support among individual DPs
for the commitments embodied in the Compact. Two additional donors not actively
engaged in the sector but supportive of sector objectives through their contributions to the
MDBS (the European Commission and UK's Department for International Development
[DFID]) also signed the MoU. As part of post-Compact Action Plan, MoFA and
development partners will intensify efforts to conclude the SWAp (and, potentially,
pooled funding under the next AgDPO).

57.    The MoFA-DP Joint Sector Review (JSR), the next of which is scheduled for
May 2010, is an example of effective coordination. The first JSR was held in June
2008, and six teams reviewed specific sectoral outcomes. A second JSR, in June 2009,
built on the previous year's experience and recommended critical reforms, many of



49
  CIDA provides sector budget support of CAN$100 million over 2009 ­ 13 with annual base and
performance payments (75 percent and 25 percent respectively) contingent on meeting `trigger-targets'.
Through its Contribution Arrangement with MoFEP, CIDA funds flow through GoG channels using
existing GoG policies and procedures, but funds are allocated to MoFA

                                                   23
which are now being acted upon. The JSR is an integral element of a SWAp and reduces
the transaction costs of individual DP assessments by combining them into a single
exercise. These collective assessments also facilitate a consensus on sectoral performance
involving all DPs and the Government, and allow concerns to be highlighted jointly,
avoiding fragmentation among donors. The next Review will follow upon production of
MoFA's Annual Progress Report, including the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) report
for 2009. It is anticipated that the 2010 JSR would also comprise the assessment of the
performance tranche for CIDA's budget support operation and identification for the
proposed successor AgDPO series.

58.     The AgDPO continues to depend on analytical insights through economic
and sector work (ESW) supported by the Bank and other DPs. The Bank works
closely with USAID and particularly their Governance Strategy Support Program
(GSSP), which is implemented by IFPRI. Coordinated knowledge generation is also a
key theme under CAADP, with the proposed continuation of a Regional Strategy
Analysis and Knowledge Support System (ReSAKSS). As an interim step, MoFA has
proposed a research committee of senior managers, academics and DPs to better match
analytical work with their own priorities, improve the quality of knowledge, and to avoid
duplication of effort.

59.     The AgDPO also relates to the MDBS, which provides co-financed general
budget support. GoG and DPs have agreed on a framework memorandum to guide the
relationship between sector budget support operations and general budget support. This
has been effective in limiting cross-conditionality and in identifying policy issues best
dealt with through the sectoral operations or policy dialogue and those appropriate to be
`elevated' to the MDBS arena. Efforts are underway to improve the coordination between
the sector working groups and the MDBS working group to improve coordination
between sectoral instruments and the MDBS.

       C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
60.      AgDPO 1 described the links with existing Bank operations including: (i) the
West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (the allocation for Ghana is $15 million)
which is now being scaled up and expanded to Burkina faso, Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire;
(ii) the Land Administration Project (IDA's contribution is $20.5m against a total project
costs $55m) which closes in FY2011; a successor project is currently under preparation);
and (iii) the Community Based Rural Development Project ($30 million IDA; 10m from
AFD) due to close in FY2010.

61.     The Bank also has two complementary budget support operations, as
previously mentioned: the $300m EGPRC (which follows from previous series of
Poverty Reduction Support Credits) and the Natural Resources and Environmental
Governance (NREG) DPO series (FY2009 ­ FY2011). The EGPRC and the MDBS
architecture will remain key instruments to motivate cross-cutting policy and institutional
changes. On June 30, 2009, the Board approved a second NREG operation, and the third
and final operation in the series is currently under preparation. There will be no cross-
conditionality between the NREG, AgDPO and the EGPRC. As before, two sector DPOs
(i.e. NREG and AgDPO) will continue to rely on macroeconomic assessments and debt
                                            24
sustainability analysis carried out under the EGPRC. Dialogue between the two teams on
expenditure frameworks, budget allocations, and budget execution was strengthened
under AgDPO I. Closer collaboration on public financial management matters will
continue, and it is intended to broaden the scope of the future ERPFMs to complement
sector-level budget analysis. Policy measures within the proposed EGPRC 2 may include
agricultural issues, and the teams will ensure complementarity between the two,
recognizing the continued value of sector-DPLs.

Ongoing Operations: An Update
62.     Since the approval of AgDPO I, the Rural Finance Strengthening Project
(funded by IDA [$5.13 million], IFAD [$10.12 million] and AfDB [$5.01million]) has
closed with an IEG rating of `moderately satisfactory'. Elements of the outstanding rural
finance agenda are being carried forward primarily by IFAD under their new Rural and
Agricultural Finance program (RAFiP; approved by IFAD in December 2008), which is
based on the Agricultural Finance Strategy and Action Plan (AFSAP). IFAD has
requested the Bank to continue assistance to rural and agricultural finance, although the
current CAS did not foresee a follow-on operation. The Bank is currently seeking ways to
better deploy project activities under the existing Micro and Small and Medium
Enterprises (MSME) project ($118.95 million of which IDA finances $45.0million, the
International Finance Corporation [IFC] $40.0 million, GoG $1.90 million and the private
sector $32.0 million), and the Economic Management and Capacity Building Project
(EMCBP; $35.0 million, with $20.0 million from IDA for the financial sector reform).

63.     Both MSME and EMCBP include support to new product development in
the financial services sector, and technical assistance for actors in value chains and
business associations. These components will be utilized to promote innovative financial
services for farmers including, for instance, financing for out-grower schemes and
weather index insurance. Similarly, strengthening registered FBOs to act as business
entities to procure and deliver services for their members and to negotiate with input and
output dealers will be addressed through support for value chain actors and for business
associations.

64.    In addition, five new major operations have been approved or are under
preparation that are relevant for the purpose of AgDPO 2:

65.      The Ghana Transport Sector Project (P102000, $225 million) was approved
in FY2009, and supports implementation of Ghana's Transport Sector Development
Programme. This project includes a component for $50.5million to finance the
rehabilitation of rural/feeder roads, and will establish a structured process for identifying
feeder roads to be rehabilitated, giving priority to commercial agricultural potential.

66.    The West Africa Regional Fisheries Program includes nine coastal countries
from Mauritania to Ghana. The Program is implemented through a series of operations,
each targeting a different group of countries. The first operation includes Cape Verde,
Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone, and is scheduled to start at the beginning of CY2010.
The second operation is scheduled to start in CY2011, and would include Ghana. The
investments in Ghana would likely focus on strengthened governance and management of

                                             25
fishery resources, as well as investments to reduce illegal fishing and increase local value
added to fish products and will support the fisheries policy dialogue.

67.    A proposed operation to scale-up existing trust-funded TA for disaster risk
management (DRM) financed under the Global Facility for Disaster Recovery and
Reduction (GFDRR). Support from the Facility is likely to be scaled up significantly to
$5 million, to provide TA and capacity building to better integrate disaster management
and climate change. A joint disaster management and climate change mission involving
the Bank, the United Nations Development Program and DFID developed a proposal,
which is currently under review by the GFDRR Steering Committee.

68.     A proposed operation to support investments in commercial agriculture. This
operation, programmed for $100 million, would improve the policy environment,
including investment promotion measures and measures to enhance access to land for
investors, with necessary safeguards. It would have a geographical focus with direct help
to develop specific areas through key public infrastructure and public-private
partnerships. The IFC will be part of the design team to reflect roles of the World Bank
Group and to ensure the resulting IDA-financed operation leverages as much private
sector investment as possible.

69.     The Opportunities to the Poor Project would strengthen the capacity of
vulnerable rural households and communities in the poorest regions of Ghana to
move towards improved self-reliance and help to shield themselves against external
shocks through cash-for-work and conditional cash transfer programs. The employment
generating activities of the project would focus on the construction of productive rural
infrastructure, with a potential to generate secondary employment and support local
development. The cash transfer program would support scaling up the on-going
Government supported LEAP, and improve targeting and efficiency of the program
management.

70.    The three operations concentrated in the lagging Northern regions of Ghana
carry potential for transformative investments and well-coordinated technical
assistance operations to complement the policy reforms at the core of the AgDPO.
An on-going poverty assessment, which is expected to be completed in early-2010,
should provide critical analytical insights to assist the design of these projects.

            D.       LESSONS LEARNED
71.     Foremost among lessons reflected in the design of the overall DPO series50 is
the need to focus on the national budgeting and planning process linking the sectoral
ministries more firmly to the national processes. Improvements in this area through more
sophisticated budget negotiations are emerging, although confirmation of the evidence
will require a longer cycle of observation. AgDPO 1 has certainly placed more emphasis
on national budgeting processes, evidenced by MoFA's commissioning of the PEIR,



50
     It should be noted this series is the first agricultural development policy operation in Africa.

                                                         26
which provides a number of recommendations for improvements in budgeting and
planning and extends beyond issues of PFM to include human resource management.

72.    Second, improvements in PFM and wider institutional reforms are
inextricably linked. Notwithstanding additional factors external to the sector now
making reforms more difficult,51 indications are of a strong appetite to ensure that MoFA
and its agencies are `fit for purpose'. The AgDPO series provides focus to a merged
process of policy dialogue, sequential and iterative technical assistance to inform
management decisions, with diagnostic exercises guiding management responses.
Partners have positioned their assistance to support a Government reform program
expressed in the AgDPO agenda.

73.    Third, the AgDPO has encouraged development partners to focus on overall
sector outcomes instead of or in addition to narrow project performance. The JSRs
have proved to be effective instruments in this regard. Indeed, strengthening adherence to
SWAp principles was a key objective of the decision to initiate sector budget support.

74.     A fourth lesson is the challenge of maintaining a DPO series across election
cycles. The first operation noted the risks associated with the election. The slow-down in
policy momentum was exaggerated by the change in political orientation of the new
administration. At the same time, the AgDPO proved a useful instrument for highlighting
policy priorities to the incoming team. With the new Government now setting out an
ambitious program for their four-year term, there is an opportunity for sustained
partnership benefitting from reduced political uncertainty over the medium term.

75.     Fifth, the link between sector budget support operations and general budget
support as provided under the Bank's EGPRC has been strengthened. The MDBS
structure and the policy framework are being reviewed. One critical aspect of the review
is the relationship between the sector budget support instruments and the MDBS
structure, with recognition that adjustments are required to improve the synergies
between the two. One specific area for improvement is the extent to which the ERPFM
contributes to advancing the PFM dialogue at the sector level.

76.     A final lesson concerns efforts to harmonize diagnostic and analytical work.
Many studies have been done in and on Ghana's agriculture, and yet policy makers still
find themselves without easy access to quality analytical work. Many studies are funded
by individual projects. The absence of a central repository limits dissemination and
application of findings. Work is duplicated and, without widely accepted quality
standards, of mixed value. With few funds and limited capacity for analytical work
within Government, MoFA's priority areas are often under-resourced. To address this,
the program will support improved coordination of analytical work. MoFA has agreed to
establish a mechanism for quality assuring research in the sector.




51
     For instance, the abolition by the new Government of the Ministry of Public Sector Reform.

                                                      27
         E.       ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
77.     A compelling body of literature positions agriculture as a current and future
driver of economic growth and poverty reduction in Ghana. For instance, the 2007
Country Economic Memorandum and studies by IFPRI based on their computable
general equilibrium model identify the significant potential for agricultural growth by
closing existing yield gaps as well as additional opportunities for value addition. These
studies also confirm the wider literature on the substantial poverty reducing impact of
such growth. Analysis on the returns to public financing of agriculture interventions
shows that for Ghana to reach middle income status by 2015 with current returns to
public investment, agricultural spending would need to increase at 20 percent per year.52
At the same time, the PEIR and ERPFM reports present challenges in expenditure
management and recommendations for improvements. Bank analysis of the impact of the
oil economy has added to the urgency of improving the performance of agriculture53 as
well as the potential fiscal space created by sustainable management of revenues.

78.     The program draws from these studies and other specific assessments to
inform the specific measures to be supported. For instance, the USAID-funded
AgCLIR diagnostic,54 (which adopts a similar approach to the Bank's Doing Business
Survey) identified measures to increase private investment in agriculture including
measures to strengthen links with out-growers. This reinforced previous analytical work
that identified the important contribution to be played by FBOs55 in part as a conduit for
pluralistic extension service delivery funded by the Extension Development Fund56.
Similarly, an assessment of the scale of post-harvest losses57 provided quantitative data
on the costs of product degradation but also the fact that in terms of remedial measures
one size does not fit all ­ i.e. that the cause and extent of losses differs across
commodities and between value chains.58 A study to evaluate the effectiveness of
technology transfer from research and extension services to small-holders was
commissioned by MoFA but failed to meet quality standards and is being redone. FAO
assessments59 document the failure of past efforts at expanding irrigation schemes and in
particular the institutional challenges to sustainable management, noting that
management by users is associated with better irrigation performance and the resulting
increased incomes benefit all household members.60 Recent analytical work by the Bank

   For instance, 60 percent of main-season mango production is lost (almost half of this due to poor storage
at the market). Losses for cereals are much lower, at about 6 percent ­ 18 percent, with much of this during
harvesting operations. Loss rates for vegetables (between 10 percent ­ 20 percent) are attributed
particularly to damage during transport.

management of the fishing fleet.61

79.     Several assessments of the initial implementation of the fertilizer voucher
program (in 2008) identified a number of areas for improvement, while also
reflecting the differing positions among stakeholders. Three reviews have been
undertaken, in ascending order of analytical rigor: (i) a one-day workshop among MoFA
staff produced an internal report for management; (ii) a study commissioned by the
Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana62 was based on interviews in five Districts; and
(iii) a comprehensive description of the operation of the 2008 scheme published by
IFPRI63 (to be followed up by a second assessment examining outcomes to be completed
in early 2010). While all the assessments commend the initiative as innovative public-
private collaboration, they also cite anecdotal evidence of leakages and perverse
outcomes inconsistent with the intended objectives. The efficiency of targeting is of key
concern: The internal MoFA review argues that the administration costs of overseeing the
targeting is too high and therefore recommends a universal subsidy applicable at the point
of import. The IFPRI analysis identifies some displacement of prior fertilizer purchases
and argues that the absence of clear protocols in voucher distribution allowed for
applying unforeseen procedures that are likely to undermine the program objectives.
These analytical insights together with feedback from the current (2009) application are
helping MoFA refine the program for next year.

80.     The forthcoming Poverty Assessment will focus on spatial development and
the lagging regions of Northern Ghana. This is expected to be completed in early-2010
and will focus on the livelihood opportunities available in the north. It will address the
question that previous analytical work has identified;64 namely, the growth potential of
the region, including the large under-utilized land areas amenable to large-scale
agriculture and the prospects from regional markets in the Sahel.

     5. THE PROPOSED GHANA SECOND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT
                         LENDING PROGRAM

         A.       OPERATION DESCRIPTION
81.    The foregoing presentation of the macroeconomic and sectoral contexts
introduces AgDPO 2 as an instrument to reinforce the same development objectives
as AgDPO 1 within a somewhat changed environment. The objective remains to
increase the contribution of agriculture to growth and poverty reduction while improving
the management of soil and water resources. The operation will build on the measures
supported under AgDPO 1 in the six themes of the Agricultural Policy. Broadening the
sources of agricultural growth beyond the cocoa subsector into critical food crops and

productivity is vital to further accelerating the 5.7 percent growth rate observed in 2009.
Further, Ghana's competiveness in the non-oil sectors has to be strengthened, given the
threats of Dutch Disease associated with the advent of revenues from oil.

82.    The policy framework is truncated with the set of prior actions for AgDPO 2,
as set out in Section 5.B, to allow alignment of future actions with the policies and
investments that the new government is undertaking under the CAADP process. Once
confirmed by Government, this priority program will provide the policy anchor to the
proposed subsequent series.

Readiness for the DPL
83.     As reported in Chapter 2, Ghana's macro-economic framework is assessed as
adequate for the purpose of the proposed operation. The fiscal stabilization objectives
set forth in the 2010 Budget, the nature and pace of actions taken by the new Government
to regain control of the fiscal situation on a sustainable basis and the complementary
financial assistance from the IMF provide the macroeconomic framework for the
proposed operation to meet its objectives, and justifies the use of IDA resources. The
performance targets of the IMF's program have been met. The recently presented 2010
Budget is consistent with the agreed macroeconomic framework.

Achievements since AgDPO 1
84.    Agricultural GDP growth of 5.1 percent in 2008 and 5.7 percent in 2009
indicates strong sector performance. Attribution is not argued since AgDPO 1 only
disbursed in August 2008; nevertheless, Government's overall approach guided by its
Agricultural Policy and performance suggests that the broad policy thrust remains
appropriate.

85.     The electoral transition dominated the period since AgDPO 1 approval, and
the previous administration launched only a few major policy initiatives in its last
four months. Progress was limited to technical and administrative measures that, while
less than major reform initiatives, are nevertheless important steps towards program
objectives. Among them are the following:

       The conclusion of the first two rounds of the fertilizer voucher scheme, discussed
       extensively elsewhere in this document;
       A well-developed collaboration between MoFA and MoFEP on the emerging
       proposals for measures to increase access to agricultural credit;
       Re-integration of MoFi into MoFA, the establishing of the Fisheries Commission
       and the launch of a major reform of fisheries sector governance;
       Agreement between MoFA, Ghana Ports and Harbors Authority (GPHA) and the
       horticulture industry on the management arrangements for the cold storage facility
       at Tema Port (known as Shed 9);



                                            30
       The launch of a registration process by MoFA to identify existing FBOs and as a
       necessary precursor for a needs assessment on how best to support their improved
       function;
       Continued attention on PFM issues in relation to (i) dialogue with MoFEP on the
       appropriate accounting for sector allocations versus MoFA's budget as per the
       Maputo commitment; and (ii) within MoFA, management buy-in for diagnostic
       work to seek constraints to improved budgeting and planning; and
       Completion of the Sector Plan, the CAADP Round Table and the signing of the
       CAADP Compact as important vehicles for articulating sector strategies and
       resource needs, and securing support from stake-holders.
       B.      POLICY AREAS TO BE SUPPORTED UNDER THE OPERATION
86.    The priority policy areas to be supported under AgDPO 2 have been
confirmed with the Government. Table 7 presents the prior actions for AgDPO2
consistent with the objectives of the Agricultural Policy.

87.      Increasing the productivity of small-holder farms, a particular challenge in
the northern area: Studies show substantial yield gaps between those achievable even
with prevailing technology and those actually realized by farmers. Why do farmers use
particular technologies? How effective are Ghana's agriculture extension services and the
institutional arrangements for technology dissemination? These are fundamental
questions that need to be addressed in order to close the existing yield gaps. Further,
given the dominance of one-acre demonstration plots as the primary mechanism for
technology dissemination, it is critical to review the effectiveness of such modalities. An
assessment of the effectiveness of existing mechanisms for technology adoption is
therefore an agreed prior action. Although MoFA commissioned and received such an
assessment, the analysis did not meet MoFA's quality standards and failed to provide
robust analytical conclusions and policy recommendations. Consequently, MoFA has
commissioned a second assessment, expected to be completed in late CY2010.

88.     Reducing post-harvest losses: The recommendations from a recent diagnostic
assessment of the extent of post-harvest losses (see paragraph 78) include: (i) measures to
better connect front-line extension staff with traders so that the quality and handling
requirements of the market can be better articulated to farmers; and (ii) increasing the
emphasis on modern mitigation measures such as cold chains by promoting public-
private partnerships in cold storage facilities. In addition, sector monitoring needs to be
expanded to update post-harvest loss data, and monitor the effectiveness of these
measures. MoFA needs to include these recommendations in its annual work plans and
ensure that resources are allocated to put them into action. A prior action is for these
recommendations to be included in the sector plan for 2010 ­ 2015. This prior action has
been met.

89.    Promoting FBOs, as many challenges facing smallholders especially in the
horticulture sector can be effectively overcome with collective action: Government
will submit the Cooperative Bill to Parliament as a prior action to provide a sound and
transparent legislative foundation for FBOs to operate as business entities. This critical

                                            31
action has not been met because of the hiatus of new legislation imposed in the run-up to
the December 2008 elections. The new Government sought a review of all pending
legislation prior to onward submission. The Bill has now been submitted to Cabinet by
the Minister of Employment and Social Welfare and is awaiting onward submission to
Parliament. Similarly, the legislative framework should be supplemented with an
institutional framework that formalizes the role of farmers' groups and their associated
organizations. Establishing a database of outgrowers is a prior action for two reasons: (i)
it is a key step in enhancing traceability of agricultural produce that is particularly
important in the horticulture sector; and (ii) a central registry and database will facilitate
out-grower arrangements by reducing the transaction costs to commercial (nucleus) farms
of identifying potential participants of such schemes. This prior action has been
completed.

90.      Continuing strategic public investments in large-scale infrastructure to
encourage private investment in agriculture: State intervention will focus on policy
and institutional reforms to strengthen the enabling environment (such as the out-grower
database, above). In specific cases, however, publicly funded infrastructure is necessary
in facilities where their scale and operation exceed the capabilities of an individual firm,
i.e. the case of the refrigerated fruit terminal at Shed 9. Although Shed 9 will continue to
be a public asset, the operation of the facility should be run on a commercial basis. A
long-term solution would imply concessioning the facility to an independent operator; in
the meantime however experience is required to ensure appropriate pricing as well as a
period of demonstration in order to convince horticulture farmers to shift from reefer
containers to the use of reefer vessels. Consequently, Government will finalize an interim
management arrangement for Shed 9 among the industry, MoFA and GPHA to provide
for the independent commercial operation of the facility for 12 months while the
modalities of a long-term arrangement are identified. This has been met.

91.     Ensuring that interventions to boost agricultural productivity are
environmentally sound: This requires due diligence by Government, and subjecting key
sector policies to ex ante environmental assessment. Moreover, to be practical, Advisory
Notes are required from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to guide the day-to-
day implementation of the policy objectives. Therefore, a prior action is to complete an
environmental assessment of FASDEP II. This has been met.

92.     Expanding irrigated agriculture due to the prevailing agro-ecological
conditions and the likely effects of climate change: The Government's program departs
from previous approaches by giving greater responsibility to water users or beneficiaries
to manage water resources, operate and maintain schemes and improve performance. The
approach is centered on Joint Irrigation Scheme Management (JISM) that defines the
roles and responsibilities of users and GIDA as the technical supporting agency.
Operational procedures are required to put the new Irrigation Policy into effect. First, an
implementation schedule for the roll-out of collaborative management arrangements
between GIDA and water users associations is needed. Second, an inventory of all
informal schemes is required in order to rationalize the expanded coverage and to provide
a baseline of the number and performance of existing schemes. Both prior actions have
been met.

                                             32
93.     Supporting the Government's efforts to expand credit to agriculture: The
Government has recognized that the supply of and demand for credit is essentially a
private sector activity, and has taken steps to understand the perspectives of all stake-
holders on the constraints to increasing access to and utilization of agricultural credit. A
major change in the institutional approach is the active participation by MoFA and
MoFEP in the development of the AFSAP, which constitutes a multi-stakeholder strategy
for increasing agricultural credit. Government's participation in AFSAP alongside other
stakeholders is both a strength and a weakness: the measures embodied in the action plan
represent a consensual position on the priorities and challenges facing the sector and
thereby have strong ownership. At the same time, it is not a government policy per se,
although the Government has indicated that proposed revisions to Ghana's Financial
Sector Strategic Plan are likely to be based largely on the AFSAP. Government
participation in and stakeholder endorsement of the AFSAP is a prior action for the
operation. Note that this prior action is a revision to the original which referred to
Government undertaking a baseline assessment of access to agricultural credit. The
reason for the change is that political momentum among stakeholders behind the AFSAP
emerged only after the process started and after the AgDPO 1 had been approved.
Consequently, active participation by Government, and in particular by the two
Ministries with most interest, was considered the most critical measure to influencing
long-term policy regarding agricultural credit. This prior action is considered met, albeit
in modified form.

94.    Supporting the Government in revising the Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy
to articulate its approach to implementing the 2002 Fisheries Act: The Policy
framework will necessarily reflect important public policy trade-offs in the management
of natural resources ­ trade-offs between competing uses today, and between
contemporary uses that may undermine long-term viability. Consequently a broad-based
consultative process with stakeholders is most likely to result in policy choices with the
widest possible support. Government has prepared a new Fisheries and Aquaculture
Policy that has benefited from widespread consultation, has been endorsed by the new
Government, and has been published. This prior action has been met.

95.     AgDPO 2 builds on and supports deeper organizational and institutional
reform within the lead Ministry responsible for agriculture sector outcomes. The key
elements of the program originate in previous analytical work, much of it with a policy
and/or institutional focus. The PEIR indicates priority future reforms in public financial
management and institutional restructuring. MoFA is acting on the conclusions as
evidenced by management confirming an action plan to operationalize the key
recommendations. More urgently, a key reform in PFM arena is timely budgetary
releases, especially for services and investment spending, in line with the agricultural
cycle (as evidenced by 60 percent of items 3 and 4 released by the third quarter). Both
prior actions have been met.

96.    Progress against prior actions and overall performance benchmarks is
generally satisfactory. These prior actions are summarized in Table 7 along with a brief
explanation of their criticality and the current status. In Table 7, the prior actions are
organized in accordance with the objectives of the Agricultural Policy.

                     6. OPERATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION

       A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
98.     The AgDPO series is predicated on the criticality of agricultural growth for
poverty reduction. Agricultural growth remains central for poverty reduction. As
reported in the Program Document for AgDPO 1, the Poverty and Social Impact
Assessment (PSIA) of the government's overall agricultural component of the GPRS II
identified the most relevant aspects of the overall strategy from the point of view of
poverty and social impacts, and those policy objectives that risked undermining the status
of already disadvantaged groups. (See Section VI of the program document for AgDPO 1,
report No. 43477-GH.)

99.     At the policy level the draft Sector Plan incorporates two notable innovations
in Government policy viz. targeted beneficiaries. The first is the increased emphasis on
the food crops sector and food security, evidenced by increased allocations to these
programs. (As reported in Table 6, a large proportion of the MTEF is allocated to
programs under Policy Objective 1: food security and emergency preparedness.) The
second is the parallel effort to scale-up sizeable investments in commercial agriculture and
for these to include out-grower arrangements. These large-scale commercial farms were
identified in the original PSIA which recommended that in pursuing commercial
opportunities, links to small-holders be made.

100. With regard to the specific measures of the current operation, positive
poverty and social impacts are expected and while the operation does not have an
explicit regional focus, the operation contributes to the Government's efforts to
target regional disparities. First, by focusing on measures to improve the productivity of
food crops the target beneficiaries are, by implication, poor small-holder farmers. They
dominate the food crop sector; these farmers are the primary beneficiaries of the public
extension system and they also suffer the most severe post-harvest losses. Second, poor
subsistence farmers depend more heavily on FBOs ­ larger enterprises have sufficient
critical mass and managerial capacity themselves ­ and an improved legislative
environment will promote accountability within these organizations.

101. Subsistence farmers are most dependent on rain-fed agriculture, often adopt
unsustainable agricultural practices, and are most at risk from increased weather
variability induced by climate change. Therefore, measures to promote sustainable land
management practices and more efficient and extensive use of small-scale irrigation
schemes will be of direct benefit.

102. Although not specifically an element of the current policy matrix, the
magnitude of the fertilizer subsidy in the Government's program warrants special
attention. The government is committed to scale up the program while improving its
efficiency. If successful, the program has the potential to provide real benefits to small-
holders through improved productivity in key food staples. (These programs typically do
not help the extreme poor who are unable to access even subsidized fertilizer and/ or those
unable to farm.) However, as discussed below, the risk of poor targeting and displacement
of resources from genuine pro-poor interventions because of escalating costs of the
subsidy is real.

       B.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
103. Public Financial Management Analytical Work: Ghana's fiduciary environment
is considered adequate for development policy lending. The 2009 draft ERPFM carried out
                                           41
by the World Bank, together with some of the other development partners that contribute
to the MDBS, confirmed the findings from earlier reports (including a 2006 PEFA Report)
that Ghana has a solid legal and regulatory framework for public financial management
that performs at an average level and occasionally above-average standards. A summary
assessment of the country's budget credibility and the quality of financial reporting is
found in Box 2.

Box 2: Ghana's Public Financial Management System: Key Findings
The key findings of the 2009 draft ERPFM assessment against six core PFM objectives are as follows:
Credibility of the Budget. Aggregate expenditure and revenue outturns broadly matched the budget plans,
but credibility was diminished by variance across budget heads, reflecting weaknesses in budget formulation
and the treatment of contingencies.
Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget. This improved considerably over the period 2004-
2008, through the incorporation in the Budget Statement of information on internally generated funds, direct
donor disbursements, HIPC and statutory funds. However, in-year reporting was less comprehensive,
hampering overall budget scrutiny and management.
Policy-based Budget. While budgets have become more policy-based in recent years, performance is held
back by limited ability to cost strategies, the lack of effective wage bill planning, and the absence of a
transparent link between planned and executed budget activities.
Predictability and Control in Budget Execution. GoG has improved commitment and other internal
controls, but recognizes weaknesses in management and oversight of control systems.
Accounting, Recording and Reporting. This is predominantly a paper-based system, resulting in delays and
data errors. Analytical and technical capacity constraints hamper MoFEP and line ministry efforts to monitor
and analyze budget performance.
External Scrutiny and Audit. There are now more timely completed accounts and financial statements and
timely submitted audit reports to the legislature, which in turn is more actively scrutinizing both budget and
accounts. However, effective follow-up has only just begun, with the Parliament's Public Accounts
Committee active in overseeing the accounts of line ministries of the Central Government by carrying out
public hearings based on the Auditor General's reports spanning 2002 to 2005. For those accounts where
there was found to be wrongdoing, the Public Accounts Committee submitted their report to the courts for
the prosecution led by the Attorney General.



104. Credibility of the Budget. Reducing the deviation between budgeted and actual
expenditures is essential to improve budget credibility according to the draft 2009
ERPFM. Table 9 shows that total budget deviation has improved since 2004, when actual
expenditure exceeded budget by 12.4 percent, to only 3.2 percent in 2007. Budget
credibility at individual Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) was less
satisfactory. The budget deviation of actual expenditures at the MDA-level (when
compared to the approved budgets) increased from 15.8 percent in 2003 to 36.3 percent in
2006, and dropped to 21.0 percent in 2007. Low budget credibility of MDAs is due to
several factors, including (a) cash flow problems at the Treasury level; (b) lack of capacity
and other implementation problems at the MDA-level; and (c) changes in priorities at the
government level regarding how to allocate available resources. Strengthening budget
preparation of the MDAs through the multi-annual budgetary frameworks, including all
available resources, and better comprehensive reporting is needed, as is better budget
execution.

total (original) budgeted allocation for primary expenditure. 4. Percentage difference between expenditure
deviations and expenditure variations (previous two columns). 5. CAGD preliminary data, pending
confirmation by the Auditor-General. It is to be noted that data on total expenditures differ from those
compiled by MoFEP.

105. Treasury Realignment. To address cash flow problems, the Controller and
Accountant General Department (CAGD) has integrated treasuries into the
Finance/Accounts Division of MDAs and Metropolitan Municipal and District
Assemblies. Highlights of realignment include (a) Treasury staff to be part of MDA; (b)
day-to-day administration of Treasury functions to be within the purview of MDA
management; and (c) CAGD will continue to be responsible for the recruitment and
posting of accounting staff to the MDAs and Metropolitan Municipal and District
Assemblies.

Disbursements and Auditing
106. Borrower and Credit Amount. The Borrower is the Republic of Ghana and this
operation is a single-tranche IDA Credit of SDR 16.5 million ($25 million equivalent) that
would be made available upon effectiveness. Repayment will be in US Dollars.

Disbursements
107. Borrower and credit amount. This operation is a single-tranche IDA Credit of
SDR 16.5 million ($25 million equivalent) that would be made available upon Credit
effectiveness, based on the completion of policy actions supported by this loan/ credit as
discussed elsewhere in this Program Document.

108. Disbursement arrangements and use of funds. The Credit disbursement will
follow the standard Bank procedures for Development Policy Lending. The Credit amount
will be disbursed into a foreign currency account of the Borrower at Bank of Ghana that
forms part of Republic of Ghana's official foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent
Cedis amount will immediately be transferred to the Consolidated Fund of Treasury
account of the Borrower that is used to finance budgeted expenditures, and an equivalent
amount credited to an account of the government available to finance budgeted
expenditures. The Borrower will provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this
transfer has been completed within two working days, and provide to the Bank any other
relevant information relating to these matters that the Bank may reasonably request. The
Government of Ghana will acknowledge receipt to IDA of the money into the foreign
reserve account and the crediting of this amount in local currency to the Ghana

                                                      43
Government Main Cash Account. It is expected that the confirmation of receipt will be
countersigned by the Controller and Accountant General.

109. Disbursements of the Credit will not be linked to any specific purchases and no
procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the Borrower is required to
comply with the standard negative list of excluded items that may not be financed with
Bank Credit proceeds. In the event that the proceeds of the Credit are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, the equivalent amount of Credit will be
cancelled and the Borrower will be required to refund an amount equal to the amount of
the said payment. The administration of this Credit will be the responsibility of the
Ministry of Finance. Ongoing discussions with the Government on the overall reform
program being supported by this operation will form the basis for reporting on substantive
policy issues. Fiduciary aspects and risks of this operation are discussed elsewhere in this
document. The Bank will retain the option to seek an audit of the disbursement if
considered necessary.

110. Auditing. Financial resources provided as budget support become part of the
Consolidated Fund of the Treasury. The Association reserves right to request, at any time,
an audit of the receipt and accounting of the disbursement in the budget management
system of the Borrower. Upon the Association's request, the Borrower shall: (i) have the
account and the recording of amounts of the Credit into the Borrower's budget
management system audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Association, in
accordance with consistently applied auditing standards acceptable to the Association; (ii)
furnish to the Association as soon as available, but in any case not later than four months
after the date of the Association's request for such audit, a certified copy of the report of
such audit by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Association shall have
reasonably requested; and (iii) furnish to the Association such other information
concerning the said account and recording of Credit amounts into the budget management
system, and the audit thereof, as the Association shall have reasonably requested.

       C.      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Implementation
111. The AgDPO 2 continues to apply the good practice principles of conditionality
(Box 3). MoFEP and MoFA will be responsible for implementing this operation on behalf
of the Government. MoFI has been abolished and responsibility merged with MoFA. Their
functions will be in line with their normal institutional mandates. Disbursements will be
released to MoFEP upon satisfactory attainment of the prior actions. It was originally
envisaged that each AgDPO in the series will be scheduled for presentation in the first
quarter of the calendar year, to enable Government to fully incorporate the DPO in the
budget before it is presented to the Parliament during the fourth quarter of the calendar
year. However, AgDPO 1 was approved at the end of the fourth quarter FY2008 and
AgDPO 2 is being presented to the Board in the fourth quarter of FY2010 because of the
additional time required to complete the prior actions and requirement of clear progress in
macro-economic stabilization.

Box 3: Good Practice Principles of Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The Government of Ghana developed the FASDEP II, on the basis of which the current AgDPO series has
been agreed to, through broad consultations on issues and challenges of promoting growth and poverty
reduction through agriculture. Ownership is strengthened through implementing the CAADP agenda at the
national level, evidenced by the Round Table and signing of the Compact in October 2009. The AgDPO is
structured explicitly as the Bank's instrument for supporting CAADP implementation further reinforcing
national ownership.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
The AgDPO is part of a concerted effort with DPs grouped around the FASDEP II and the sector investment
plan. The AgDPO aims at reducing the Government's transaction costs in dealing with development
assistance by ensuring that the support is geared towards the sector strategy and investment plan. Mutual
accountability is strengthened by the MoFA-DP JSR as the forum for reaching consensus on sector
performance and priority measures moving forward.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The proposed operation will continue to increase the share of aid provided through general budget support
while helping to deepen sector level policy dialogue. Supporting the national policy and sector plan within
the CAADP framework, diversifies accountability from a project-specific framework to one based upon
progress in achieving CAADP objectives. Notwithstanding current macroeconomic challenges, Ghana
continues to be well placed to adopt budget support instruments. By closing the series with this operation
and starting a new series thereafter, the Bank is responding strategically to changing political environment
and emerging policy agendas.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The number of critical actions in the policy matrix for AgDPO 2 being supported by this operation is 11.
These were selected jointly by GoG for their importance in achieving sector objectives, and in order to
demonstrate the importance attached to these reforms within GoG. The policy matrix for the current
operation reflects previous advice to continue to streamline and strengthen prior actions to strategic critical
measures.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
The latest MoFA-DP JSR held in June 2009 included a transparent assessment of progress against prior
actions for AgDPO 2. (More time was required to complete the prior actions; hence the Bank could not
harmonize appraisal at that time, as was originally envisaged.) It is expected that proposed future series will
be further aligned with this annual review process and in particular the next 2010 JSR, which will monitor
CAADP implementation, and will be harmonized with the performance assessment of CIDA's budgetary
support. The reviews will also draw on the MDBS/ EGPRC assessments and will be aligned as far as
possible with the timetables of these assessments.


Supervision Arrangements
112. Bank supervision will continue to be aligned with the activities of other
donors, in particular with CIDA and with the sector monitoring activities in the context of
post-CAADP monitoring. It will also be aligned the implementation of the policies being
supported by the EGPRC/ MDBS. MoFEP would be responsible for the overall
implementation of the proposed budget support, together with MoFA.

113. The actions to be monitored under the operation are extracted from
government policy documents (e.g., FASDEP II, the FY2010 budget statement and the
sector M&E matrix), ensuring this alignment and reducing the transaction costs of
managing budgetary support for the government. Reporting arrangements will continue as
laid out in AgDPO I. During the period of implementation of the program supported by
the proposed DPO, supervision would draw on: (i) monthly reports on budget expenditures
                                         45
with breakdown by MDA with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each month,
and with the breakdown for Items 1-4 of the Ghanaian budget (personnel, administration,
services, investment); (ii) quarterly reports on domestically financed poverty-related
(including financed expenditures financed by the two debt relief initiatives)67, with a lag of
no more that 6 weeks after the end of each month; (iii) sector progress reports; and (iv)
sector monitoring and evaluation reports.

Monthly reports on budget expenditures with breakdown by Ministry, Department          GoG (from EGPRC)
and Agency with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each quarter. These
reports will also present the breakdown for Items 1-4 of the Ghanaian budget.
Monthly reports on domestically financed poverty-related (including HIPC               GoG (from EGPRC)
financed expenditures), with a lag of no more that 6 weeks after the end of each
quarter. These reports would include a breakdown along main poverty-related
expenditure programmes and a breakdown for Items 1 ­ 4 of the Ghanaian budget
(personnel, administration, services, investment).

114. The Bank, with partners, will continue to support public discourse on critical
policy issues through the Development Dialogue series. The launch of the 2008 World
Development Report in Accra and Tamale signaled the Bank's re-engagement with stake-
holders on critical policy and strategy issues in the sector. More recent experience with
cross-cutting themes such as the oil and gas forum (November, 2009) reinforces the value
of Bank-sponsored events held on collaboration with Government and other stakeholders.
More recently principles of partnership were confirmed in participation in the CAADP
Round Table and will continue under this process.

Monitoring and Evaluation
115. The new sector monitoring framework will continue to serve as the basis for
monitoring sector performance and therefore the results of this operation. The
benchmarks in the proposed DPO series are aligned with the monitoring framework and
are fully consistent with FASDEP II objectives. Expenditure reporting will be obtained
from Government's submissions to CAADP as well as data from the Accountant General.
There are systemic concerns over the accuracy of agricultural statistics which feed the
M&E system. IFPRI is helping Government determine areas for improvement in the
collection of key agricultural data and it is expected that the Bank's proposed assistance to
the national statistical capability under the Ghana Statistics Development Program will
incorporate capacity building.

116. A revised Results Framework, presented in Table 11, has been incorporated,
and includes progress to date under AgDPO 1. This framework reports the policy
objectives listed under the Policy Matrix (Table 8) and several refined outcome indicators,
based on new information obtained during the implementation of AgDPO 1. For example,
in Table 11 under the objective of improved irrigation performance, as the GIDA expands
their survey to cover a greater number of informal irrigation schemes as well as formal
schemes, and land intensification ratios are obtained for both types of schemes, the
expected outcome target intensification ratios (at the end of the DPO series) have been
revised. At the time of AgDPO 1, the ratio for a representative sample of informal
schemes was not available. Under the objective of improved access to agricultural credit,
the baselines reported refer to Bank of Ghana data on formal sector credit. Once the
ongoing Baseline Survey is completed, which includes Rural and Community Banks, there
will be data regarding total formal and informal sector share of credit to agriculture. Under
Sector Objectives 4 and 5, following the completion of a new baseline survey of the
number of farmers adopting soil and water conservation technologies and other new
technologies to increase agricultural productivity, which should provide a reasonable
baseline for 2008, the DPO will refine the adoption rate outcome indicators.

       D.      ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
117. As highlighted in the previous project document for AgDPO I, FASDEP II
integrates environmental management as critical for sustainable agricultural growth.
It proposes to strengthen land and water management. Environmental impact assessments
will be carried out on MoFA's programs. Improved food hygiene and good agricultural
practices are embedded within the program and are integral to progress under CAADP.
Moreover Ghana's institutional framework continues to provide an effective and robust
oversight of environmental matters. The EPA is being strengthened to be more effective in
its role.

118. The specific measures relating to SLM and environmental assessments
contained in the current program will further strengthen environmental aspects. The
Advisory Notes produced by EPA to guide the implementation of FASDEP II provide
concrete advice on the environmental risks and opportunities from the key strategies. This
will also be reflected in the Sector Plan. EPA is also supporting a framework for
environmental and social management plan and these are being integrated into MoFA's
sector M&E arrangements to ensure they are continually monitored.

119. The possibility of negative outcomes remains and GoG will need to remain
diligent in its monitoring. The increased profitability from the increase in food prices
could encourage rapid expansion of cultivated area which is typically a quick way of
increasing production compared to (land) productivity improvements. A potential influx of
large-scale commercial investments without due environmental safeguards is a particular
concern. However, as already mentioned, the prevailing regulatory regime is reasonably
robust giving confidence that such practices will be properly managed. The environmental
impact from fertilizer use resulting from the voucher program is not expected to be
adverse because levels of use are low and the subsidy is more likely to avoid reduction in
use than to stimulate significantly increased use. Nonetheless the impact of fertilizer use
will be monitored under the environmental assessments.

120. Finally, policy measures to promote diversification into high value crops and
the integration into global markets may have negative consequences. Rapid expansion
of export-sector agriculture could potentially lead to land degradation, deforestation, and
reduction of biodiversity. Ghana's horticulture sector is driven by the demands of
                                             50
European consumers who seek confirmation of good agricultural practices. Formal
standards such as GlobalGAP are conveyed to out-growers with links to large suppliers
through technical assistance ­ certification procedures not only improve their market
access but also convey substantive environmental (and social) benefits. Formalized
arrangements require traceability and these are currently being deployed among pineapple
farmers.

       E.      RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
121. A major potential risk associated with the political transition was a significant
modification in the prevailing policy underpinning the AgDPO series. The new
Government has explicitly endorsed FASDEP II and confirmed that any revisions in
emphasis and/ or specific priorities will be articulated in the sector plan. This sector plan is
now largely complete with no major policy shifts. By submitting the sector plan as the
national strategy under CAADP, the Government is reaffirming its priorities within the
context of CAADP monitoring. The change in government, however, and commitments
under the CAADP process (both to policy and investment targets) justify truncation of the
former series and launch of a new one.

122. The major prevailing risk is an uncertain macro-economic environment. As
reported in Chapter 2, progress to correct macroeconomic imbalance is substantial, but
risks remain. These are being mitigated by Bank support to address the fiscal deficit (i.e.
the $300 million EGPRC) and through an IMF program. In the context of shrinking fiscal
space, risks of declining Government allocations to MoFA should be protected as part of
the efforts to preserve pro-poor spending (which is an EGPRC second tranche condition).
It is noteworthy that according to the Government's own classification over 80 percent of
MoFA spending is pro-poor compared to an average across all Ministries and Agencies of
just 25 percent. Furthermore, at less than 2 percent of total government spending and with
under-spending relative to objectives for agricultural growth, MoFA's allocation offers
little scope for budgetary savings.

123. Other countries that have adopted fertilizer subsidies have found that the
fiscal costs of these programs expand exponentially and dominate the sector
expenditures, and this risk is present in Ghana. At an estimated cost of $35m for 2009,
the existing program is already a substantial proportion of the anticipated budget. Political
economy factors can make it difficult to reign in coverage with the result that other equally
important interventions can be squeezed out. The Government has confirmed its intent to
scale up the program while improving its efficiency. The Bank and other development
partners are supporting technical work on specific options. This issue will be a key feature
of the proposed successor series of AgDPOs. Depending on the implementation
modalities, a large-scale subsidy can deter private sector interest in input markets. By
continuing with vouchers, rather than a state-led distribution network, private input dealers
should be encouraged to serve a growing clientele.

124. Weaknesses in PFM undermine the effectiveness of Government spending and
risk weakening the expected outcomes from sector budget support. This is a risk
across all MDAs and is being effectively mitigated by substantial support to roll-out
improved financial management systems. Annual ERPFMs provide updated diagnostics
and recommended priority reforms are incorporated in the MDBS policy framework. At
the sector level, risks are mitigated through MoFA-specific diagnostics (i.e. the PEIR),
measures to restore oversight systems (e.g. the various budget and procurement
committees, etc) and proposed technical assistance from the Government of Japan.

                                              51
125. Finally, a key objective of the AgDPO is to contribute to improved
harmonization and alignment consistent with the AAA which could be undermined
without further progress towards the SWAp. Implementation of CAADP and in particular
the holding of the Round Table and the signing of the Compact provides a clear
mechanism for improved coordination not just among donors but a wider group of
stakeholders. Post-Compact activities will include completion of the SWAp for those
development partners willing and able to commit to deeper alignment.

      ANNEX 2: ON-GOING PRIORITY GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS

Technology Generation, Dissemination and Adoption

Recent innovations in research and extension systems are showing mixed results.
Experience with RELCs have demonstrated their value in bringing together the research
and extension communities. However, long-term sustainability of this modality is
hampered by the institutional divisions between, and differing operational priorities of, the
research staff (under the CSIR) and the extension staff (under MoFA). Extension efforts
are centered on two specific approaches: (1) the one-acre demonstration plot program
provides public advice and inputs on a one-acre plot of a locally influential farmer to
demonstrate the benefits of improved technologies; (2) the block-farm approach
concentrates on larger private farms as a production center to which surrounding small-
holders can be linked to technical and material support. MoFA provides inputs and access
to output markets on credit and the scheme is expected to benefit 500,000 small-holders in
2009. In both programs, however, assessments undertaken as part of the MoFA-DP JSR
(see paragraph 57) suggested some areas of weakness including host farmer's willingness
to pay for inputs perceived to be distributed freely and the subsequent impact on
repayment rates for credit in kind. There are also a number of innovative private-sector led
programs such as the Grains Alliance which is seeking to strengthen input dealers' ability
to package technical advice with the sales of inputs. The recent PEIR undertaken by
MoFA highlighted the poor incentives facing extension staff and the low morale of front-
line staff (AEAs). Efforts to build staff capacity has not been fully effective.73 A parallel
but poor quality assessment of technology adoption provided few insights and MoFA have
pledged to follow this up given its importance.

New technologies typically require the use of improved seeds and other purchased
inputs such as fertilizer. The seed growers association report that only 10 percent of
farmers use certified seed. With support of the MCC, a new draft seed law has been
produced to replace the 1972 NRCD Decree 100. The new law upgrades the domestic
regulatory environment to be consistent with commitments under the regional economic
bloc (ECOWAS) that obliges member states to mutually recognize seeds already
registered in fellow member states (thereby reducing the costs of seed registration to the
seed industry). With support from the USAID, the West Africa Seeds Alliance, a multi-
stakeholder association including the seed industry, is training seed distributors and
retailers and supporting demonstration efforts to raise demand. Improved input dealer
networks are being supported by AGRA along with International Center for Soil Fertility
under their Ghana Agro Dealers Development project which aims to enable 2,200 local
agro-dealers to provide an estimated 850,000 potential smallholders clients with more
affordable improved inputs.

Marketing Opportunities and Financial Services

Real gains from productivity improvements require that the incremental surplus can
be efficiently and profitably marketed. In this regard, the magnitude of post-harvest
losses as documented in the recent study74 suggests a quick-win for increasing farm

incomes with better handling and storage of commodities. Specific measures will differ by
crop: food staples, for instance, typically experience high storage losses from disease and
rodents whereas high-value horticultural products suffered high rates of damage from poor
handling ­ losses of 60 percent were measured for mango, for instance. One proven
solution is to engage commercial companies in the marketing of produce through contract
farming or nucleus/ out-grower schemes. These are more common in the plantation crops
of rubber and oil palm although this approach is spreading in part driven by private sector
business needs such as that launched by Ghana Breweries to encourage sorghum
production. Existing commercial plantations of oil palm and rubber are expanding
innovative out-grower programs with neighboring small-holders. Development partners
are supporting these efforts in innovative ways, including indirectly through technical
assistance for venture capital funds (Ghana Breweries) or concessional financing to meet
the start-up costs (oil palm and rubber). Nascent large scale food crop farms are also
piloting such schemes in part to mitigate perceived risks from local resentment from
surrounding communities.

Despite a broadening of rural financial services, access to agricultural finance is
extremely limited with only 8 percent of private sector formal credit allocated to
agricultural lending. Past approaches have seen directed lending and/ or special credit
programs for rural borrowers many of which have suffered from extremely low repayment
rates associated with Government schemes. There is some evidence that this malaise
continues to afflict in-kind credit schemes associated with the provision of inputs such as
the block-farm program and a concerted effort will be required to ensure financial
sustainability of these initiatives. At the same time, MoFA and MoFEP are collaborating
on a revision of the EDIF to (i) broaden its mandate beyond just the export sector to
include import substitution sector (i.e. food staples such as rice) and (ii) revise the specific
financing instruments and eligibility of the Fund to be more attractive to agricultural
borrowers. A weather index crop insurance scheme is being piloted and there are moves to
launch a warehouse receipts system for food staples.

Organizing Farmers to Enter the Value Chain

FBOs are expected to play an increasingly important role in facilitating small-holder
participation in value chains. MoFA's recent drive to gather baseline information of
FBOs will allow MoFA to better evaluate the particular function of each FBO ­ which
range differ widely in area of focus, including water users associations to marketing
associations ­ and their potential role as a conduit for service provision. Experience with
the FBO Development Fund confirmed the benefits of autonomous farmer organizations
with control over their own resources, although it was noted that the service provider
network remains thin. However, the Fund has not been sustained in the absence of
continued donor funding, indicating that the model has not been fully internalized within
MoFA. Furthermore, FBOs require a solid legal footing if they are to mature into more
sophisticated business entities ­ as some have the potential to do. Consequently, a revised
Cooperative Bill is required that affords FBO appropriate enabling regulatory
environment.




                                              57
Improving Irrigation

Irrigation sector performance is poor with low coverage and inefficient use of
existing schemes. The land intensity ratio75 is less than one, indicative of dysfunctional
schemes and/ or schemes located in inappropriate locations. Early reforms of the state
apparatus remain partial and ineffective. A number of the large schemes were restructured
to be ostensibly self-managing business entities intended to service, for a fee, resident
farmers thereby ensuring financial and technical sustainability. However, contrary to
intentions, fiscal sustainability is yet to be achieved and public transfers continue to fund
the (sub-optimal) operation of the large schemes to the detriment of essential support for
informal sector. GIDA is gradually reforming its approach by shifting attention to the
informal schemes through (i) establishing a database of such schemes as a basic needs
assessment in order to prioritize subsequent interventions and (ii) engaging in joint
management arrangement with functional WUAs to transfer responsibility to users while
retaining technical backstopping function. Other interventions in irrigation are the
provision on credit of pumps to farmers alongside major rivers and the drilling of
boreholes for inland farmers.

Critical Cross-Cutting Themes

Small-holder production of high value horticulture crops is the focus of the
Government's Horticulture Exports Industry Initiative (HEII).76 Under this
framework, associations of small-holders were supported to meet the needs of
sophisticated export markets, including securing certification for meeting relevant
standards (known as GlobalGAP) and in negotiating supply contracts with European
distributors. HEII is continuing to support the conversion to the new varieties demanded
by the market.77 The rehabilitated cold storage facility at Tema port (Shed 9) is now on-
line, the interim management contract has been signed and the company established to
operate the facility on a not-for-profit basis. This will help the industry to reach a capacity
of 300,000mt by 2010.78 Innovative investments in new horticulture enterprises are
bedding in: for instance, the Integrated Tamale Fruit Company has begun trial exports of
fresh mango from their out-grower scheme located in northern Ghana. Collaborative
research continues to be facilitated by the Public/ Private Research Committee and a
Geographic Information System Database Management System has been established to
provide reliable and accessible data for planning.

Nevertheless, evolving global markets continue to present new challenges for
Ghana's horticulture sector. A recent assessment of trends in global horticulture
markets79 suggest that the association-based model adopted by HEII itself suffers from
agency problems and has not been fully successful in Ghana in helping the horticulture
sector achieve its potential. Rather, what is required is a structure akin to the out-grower

75
   This is the ratio of the area cropped divided by the command area of the scheme. Full utilization of the
scheme for double cropping ­ i.e. efficient use of the infrastructure ­ would yield a ratio of 2.
76
   HEII has had a strong impact on the horticulture industry and has served as a model for other programs.
The AfDB's Export Marketing and Quality Awareness Program (EMQAP); Millennium Challenge Account
(MCA) program and USAID's Trade and Investment Program for Competitive Export Economy (TIPCEE)
have drawn lessons from the HEII and the public-private partnership approach.
77
   Once the conversion is complete, smallholders who contribute over 40 percent of exported pineapple
should be able to export 23,000mt of MD2 by November 2009.
78
   In 2008 Ghana exported 36,000mt of pineapples and 46,000mt of bananas plus a further 1,000mt each of
papaya and mango.

model, involving the presence of a number of vertically integrated multinational firms
with their own farms providing inputs and output marketing services to surrounding small-
holders on a contract-farming basis. Government policy, therefore, needs to create a
supportive environment for foreign direct investment of multinationals in addition to on-
going support for small-holder production. In this regard, Government is constituting a
`task team' jointly led by MoFA and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and President's
Special Initiatives to develop a framework for out-grower type schemes based on
commercial agricultural investments in `nucleus' farms.

SLM approaches are being mainstreamed within agricultural programs. A
Sustainable Agricultural Land Management Strategy has been launched jointly by MoFA
and the EPA which has the primary mandate for SLM. As an initial step MoFA is
screening their 2009 ­ 2011 work plans to identify those projects and programs that
require full Environmental Impacts Assessments (EIAs). The Strategy maps out a range of
measures to mainstream environmental agenda into agriculture-related policies and
programs, and to ensure the promotion of environmentally sustainable new technologies.
An Environment Unit has been established within MoFA with responsibility for
environmental issues and to improve collaboration with the EPA. However, staff are yet to
be trained and previous recommendations for EIAs are not always acted upon.
Government is committed to improved SLM practices, while recognizing the complexities
of effective action because of its cross-cutting nature. A cross-sectoral coordination
mechanism co-chaired by the MoFEP and the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development provides a focal point for SLM dialogue. This committee is leading the
preparation of a Country SLM Investment Framework with technical assistance provided
by TerrAfrica.80

Rural roads are an important element of sector expenditure and evidence that
investments in road infrastructure provide real benefits to farmers.81 Yet 45 percent
of the rural population remains over 2km from an all-season road. Under Ghana's National
Transport Policy and proposed Integrated Transport Plan the focus is on ensuring adequate
maintenance of the existing road network given that only one-third of the nation's
42,000km of feeder roads are in `good' condition. The selection of feeder roads for
priority treatment includes inputs from MoFA who have developed a transparent criteria
for their selection process: (i) linking roads to areas with current or potential high crop
production; (ii) connecting marketing areas to production areas; (iii) ensuring that the
costs of spot improvements (e.g. bridges on roads to make them passable all season) does
not exceed the cost of re-gravelling or maintaining existing roads.

   TerrAfrica is a multi-stakeholder platform and World Bank's Global Partnership Program (GPP) aiming at
creating enabling conditions to increase sustainable land management in Sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana has
been actively engaged in the TerrAfrica partnership since its first framing workshop in 2004. It is currently a
member of the Executive Committee, representing West Africa, and is one of the four countries for priority
support under the TerrAfrica Work Program.

   According to an evaluation of the Rural Sector Development Program (RSDP), investments in road
infrastructure over the period 2005 ­ 2008 resulted in an increase of 23 percent in the price of maize
received by farmers. (Baseline Studies of RSDP, Ministry of Roads and Highways, 2006.)

 Ghana--Assessment Letter for the World Bank and Other Development Partners

                                     March 31, 2010

Introduction
This note provides the IMF staff assessment of recent economic developments and
prospects in Ghana. It reflects discussions with the authorities during staff missions to
Accra in October 2009 and March 2010 relating to the 2010 budget and other
macroeconomic policies covered by the first and second reviews under the IMF's
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. It is intended that these discussions, if
concluded in the coming weeks, will permit an IMF Executive Board meeting to conclude
the ECF reviews and consider the next tranche of IMF financing around late May 2010.

Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Program Performance
Growth in Ghana slowed from 7.3 percent in 2008 to about 3-4 percent in 2009 as lower
private remittances and reduced access to trade credits were accompanied by tighter fiscal
and monetary policies. The impact of the global recession was ameliorated by the strength
in the prices of the country's two main exports--cocoa and gold. The latest data suggest
that the economy started to regain strength towards the end of 2009.

On the fiscal front, the budget deficit was reduced from 14.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to
9.7 percent of GDP in 2009, close to the program target of 9.4 percent of GDP. This
deficit figure excludes, however, new domestic arrears incurred in 2009, totaling more
than 4 percent of GDP. These arrears were accumulated when cash flows were squeezed
by a shortfall in indirect tax collections on account of the weaker economy, and as
overruns were experienced in the public wage bill, investment spending, and borrowing
costs.

Monetary conditions were progressively tightened through 2008 and early 2009 under the
central bank's inflation targeting regime. By the second half of 2009, the growth rates of
liquidity and credit aggregates had slowed markedly. Private credit saw no growth, in real
terms, during 2009, after rising about one quarter in 2008. This compression would have
been sharper still, in the absence of the fiscal consolidation in 2009, which helped reduce
the crowding out associated with bank financing for the government deficit. With tighter
fiscal and monetary policies, the balance of payments improved markedly through 2009,
contributing to a stronger currency from July 2009 onwards. Reflecting these
developments, twelve-month inflation fell to 14.2 percent in February 2010, from close to
20 percent during the first half of 2009. With evidence of declining inflation, monetary
conditions were eased from end-2009, with the policy interest rate reduced in both
November 2009 and February 2010, by a cumulative 250 basis points.

The quantitative targets under the ECF arrangement were met in the second half of 2009,
except for the September 2009 ceiling on the fiscal deficit, which was narrowly missed,
and the continuous limit on external nonconcessional borrowing which was breached in
November when a state enterprise liability was taken over by the budget. The deficit
targets would have been missed by much larger margins, however, if large domestic
arrears had not been accumulated. The net international reserve target was met by a large
margin. Good progress was achieved in implementing most of the program's structural
measures, with some met ahead of time. Key achievements have been the establishment at
                                            70
end-2009 of an integrated Ghana Revenue Authority and the launch of an important
program of public finance management reforms. At the same time, progress has been slow
in computerizing public agency payrolls and a review of tax exemptions has fallen behind
schedule.

The 2010 Economic Program

The government's 2010 economic program seeks a further reduction in the fiscal deficit to
reduce pressures on inflation and reverse the deterioration in public debt indicators. The
program is underpinned by measures to strengthen the management of public finances.

The program assumes a pick-up in economic growth to the 4-5 percent range in 2010, with
new private sector spending linked to the emerging oil sector more than offsetting the
impact of continued fiscal tightening. Tighter fiscal policy and cautious monetary
management are projected to reduce inflation to single-digit rates by end-2010.

The 2010 budget

The 2010 budget approved at end-2009 targeted a fiscal deficit of 7½ percent of GDP.
Measures adopted in the 2010 budget to achieve this goal include a reimposition of import
tariffs on cereals and edible oils that had been eliminated during the 2007­08 global food
price boom; a reduction in import tariff exemptions; a significant rise in public fees and
charges; an increase in mineral royalties from 3 percent to 5 percent (still pending); a
re-introduction of ad valorem excise duties for tobacco and alcohol; and measures to
strengthen revenue collections from the communications service tax. The budget also
relies on sizeable dividend transfers from the Cocoa Board and Bank of Ghana. Subsidies
for the electricity sector will be avoided by an adjustment of tariffs toward cost recovery
levels. Recurrent spending is projected to rise in relation to GDP in 2010, partly as
statutory fund and other spending recovers from a sharp compression in 2009. Investment
spending is projected to decline slightly in relation to GDP.

With outturn fiscal data for 2009 showing weaker tax receipts than anticipated at the time
of the 2010 budget, the authorities now see the approved budget deficit target as
unattainable, and have developed an updated fiscal framework targeting a deficit of
8 percent of GDP. To achieve this goal, the authorities intend to reduce spending on both
investment and recurrent goods and services below appropriated levels.

In addition, catch-up payments to statutory funds in respect of under-funding in 2009 are
scheduled to be deferred until 2011­12. Notwithstanding this, the government intends to
remain current on revenue transfers to statutory funds accruing in 2010, generating a
marked upturn in incomes in 2010 with which to finance new infrastructure projects.
Aside from the statutory funds, a number of domestic expenditure arrears were settled in
early 2010 to ease the liquidity problems of contractors and their lending banks.
The financing plan for the 2010 budget relies less on bank financing than in 2008­09, so a
larger share of credit will be available to support private sector investment. Nonbank
financing, including corporate and other private purchases of treasury bills, is projected to
increase. A residual fiscal financing gap of $275 million for 2010 is projected to be met
through the second tranche of the World Bank budget support loan approved in June 2009
($150 million), plus new concessional support from the World Bank or other budget
support partners.
The outlook for public debt is somewhat more favorable than in earlier projections, in
large part reflecting the recent strengthening of the exchange rate, which implies smaller
                                               71
revaluation effects for external debt. Notwithstanding this, total public debt is projected at
64 percent of GDP in 2010, up from 60 percent of GDP in 2009, and a low of 42 percent
of GDP in 2006 following debt relief. A marked decline in public debt ratios is projected
only for 2011­12, with the projected reduction of the fiscal deficit to the 3­4 percent of
GDP range.
In the context of the anticipated combined first and second ECF reviews, the authorities
intend to request leeway under the ECF arrangement to contract nonconcessional external
debt for two new projects in a combined amount of $150 million, as well as scope to
contract or guarantee up to $100 million in additional nonconcessional external debt for
other high-return projects during the remainder of 2010.
Preliminary updates to the joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA) have been
developed, using the latest debt data and updated financing projections consistent with the
higher baseline for nonconcessional borrowing proposed for 2010. This DSA update
suggests a substantial increase in debt vulnerability, though Ghana would remain among
the group of countries classified as facing moderate risk of debt distress, in line with DSAs
prepared in 2008 and 2009. In the baseline projections, external debt indicators remain
below the threshold levels for debt distress. These results depend on the planned sustained
reduction of the fiscal deficit to low levels; debt dynamics based instead on the
continuation of fiscal deficits at the average levels of recent years would relatively quickly
exceed the DSA threshold levels. Stress tests also indicate that the DSA outlook is
sensitive to the economic growth and borrowing costs assumptions. The debt-to-GDP
indicator is expected to be revised downwards over the course of 2010 as a result of the
national accounts rebasing exercise which is projected to result in an upward revision to
nominal GDP. Importantly, however, this would not affect the debt service to export and
revenue ratios, which are projected to rise sharply (while still consistent with moderate
risk of debt distress) over the coming decade.

Structural policies

The government has initiated reforms aimed at strengthening public financial
management, revenue administration, and public administration.
At end-2009, the integrated Ghana Revenue Authority was established, marking a key step
in the program to strengthen revenue administration. On tax policy, a comprehensive
review is underway of zero-rate VAT items and of the nature and scope of tax exemptions
and discretionary waivers. The government completed a review of the current financial
management information system, and established a project implementation committee to
manage implementation of the upgraded system.
On civil service reforms, the government assigned responsibility to the Ministry for the
Public Sector to complete a review of subvented agencies in order to determine the future
status of these agencies. While only limited progress was made in migrating the payroll of
all subvented agencies to an integrated database, the government completed an audit of all
staff of the Ghana Education Service and has contained growth in the size of the civil
service by limiting new hiring principally to the education and health services. To avoid
risks to the budget, the administrative ceilings for petroleum product prices continue to be
subject to bi-weekly review to ensure that prices reflect trends in prevailing costs.
On the monetary side, the Bank of Ghana has launched a newly-designed website that
highlights the goal and outcomes of the inflation-targeting regime, and provides more
user-friendly access to key data and publication.

Risks and Vulnerabilities

Possible slippages in fiscal performance represent the key downside risk to the program.
                                            72
On the expenditure side, the public sector wage bill remains high in relation to both the tax
base and the size of the economy. In 2009, the wage bill exceeded budgeted levels, and,
unless carefully managed, the new "single spine" public pay structure to be phased in from
late 2010 could prove more expensive than anticipated. If planned measures to reduce the
wage burden on the budget do not achieve their intended results, Ghana's high public
administration costs could crowd out the fiscal space created by future oil revenues.
The ceiling on domestically-financed investments has been cut to a very low level in the
2010 budget, which increases the risk of over-runs. Contracting will need to be monitored
very closely to avoid breaches of budget targets.
As noted below, an increase in electricity tariffs to cost recovery level will be critical to
avoiding further large subsidies to the electricity sector. In the event that this increase is
not quickly implemented, offsetting fiscal measures would need to be adopted.
On the revenue side, Fund staff has reviewed the 2010 projections closely with the
authorities with the view to establishing a solid baseline. There are upside risks, if the
economy recovers more strongly than projected. But there are also downside risks arising
from the recently adopted and proposed taxes and fees, if these do not yield their
anticipated returns.
Overall, the authorities need to monitor budget developments closely and be ready to take
corrective fiscal measures, should conditions warrant. The smaller-than-originally-
programmed reduction of the fiscal deficit in 2010 as well as the issue of new public debt
equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP in March 2010 to repay state-owned enterprise debts to
the Ghana Commercial Bank and strengthen its liquidity has required increased
government resort to bank financing. Slippage relative to this revised fiscal path could
complicate liquidity management, with adverse implications for the effectiveness of the
inflation targeting regime.
Looking ahead to 2011, it will be important to contain expectations for public sector
spending during the transition to oil producer status. Although oil will generate important
new revenues, the available fiscal space for new projects will depend critically on the
soundness of the non-oil budget. In this connection, Ghana's fiscal deficit going into the
oil era remains large and, in the absence of other revenue or expenditure measures in 2011,
the scope for new projects will likely be relatively modest, at least in the early years of oil
production, and spending plans will need to be developed accordingly.
In the broader public sector, a number of state-owned enterprises pose risks to public
finances. Steps are underway, supported by the World Bank, to return the electricity sector
to financial viability. An early adjustment of the electricity tariff to cost recovery levels
will be critical to achieve this. At the same time, steps are needed to tackle the financial
liabilities of the oil refinery, which will likely require public funding. A common origin of
these financial problems has been under-pricing of energy products. Going forward, it will
be important to maintain the existing market-based pricing formula for petroleum
products, and implement regular reviews of the new electricity tariff structure to maintain
cost recovery.
In the monetary and financial sectors, it will be important to maintain sufficiently tight
monetary conditions to consolidate the decline in inflation. Clear communication of the
disinflation strategy will be important to rebuild credibility in the goals of the inflation
target framework. In the banking sector, the rise in nonperforming loans appears
manageable, as capital ratios remains strong. However, oversight arrangements should be
strengthened for institutions with key risk factors, such as rapid credit growth and high
funding costs.
