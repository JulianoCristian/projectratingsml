that\n            project impacts are generally positive, adequate management,\n            and low-cost mitigation should minimize negative effects.\n            The main environmental concerns are: natural resource\n            management, which in addition to forest degradation, and the\n            concomitant problems of flooding, - lower dry season flows,\n            and siltation - biodiversity may well be affected by\n            ecological disturbances in the Mekong River system; direct\n            impacts on project areas, such as the effects on soil\n            quality, and salinity risks, drainage impacts on\n            sedimentation, surface water, and water-logging, site\n            contamination due to residues, and oil spills from\n            construction works, and/or toxic chemical residues entering\n            the soil, surface and groundwater; and, impacts on health,\n            caused by increased disease vectors, and the incidence of\n            malaria and other diseases. Mitigation calls for: 1)\n            technical training to incorporate uplands conservation,\n            fisheries, and wetlands management; 2) development of\n            management guidelines to control saline soils, and\n            groundwater; 3) contract specifications, to contain worker\n            safety, site restoration, waste disposal, environmental\n            standards, and be subjected to inspections; and, 4)\n            community training, information, and education to be\n            provided on health issues, with linkages to national health\n            programs. The second volume, addresses development\n            strategies for ethnic minorities, and vulnerable groups,\n            though resettlement issues will be addressed in the Social Assessment."}, "docdt": "2000-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
