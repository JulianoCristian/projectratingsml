  follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: project design should be informed by a broad and\n            deep analysis of institutional capacities and a specific\n            capacity development strategy should be developed as part of\n            preparation. This should also include a capacity development\n            framework providing a set of proposed interventions and\n            indicators which respond to the capacity constraints\n            identified at the different levels of project implementation\n            and for the staff concerned. Project experience shows that\n            the Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) support to the Project\n            Coordination Office (PCO) should be more continuous and that\n            the CTA expertise should provide support for project and\n            program management, including financial management, planning\n            and reporting, office and contract management, and\n            experience of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems.\n            Similarly, inputs of field-based Technical Advisor (TA)\n            staff should be programmed to provide a more stable,\n            continual support for project staff. Consideration should be\n            given to instituting regular Borrower and Bank joint reviews\n            of the performance of any TA inputs provided under the credit."}, "docdt": "2009-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
