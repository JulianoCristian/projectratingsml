"The main objectives of this Hauts\n            Bassins Agricultural Development Project are to raise\n            domestic food production, increase cotton exports and\n            improve the quality of rural life. Specifically it aims to:\n            (a) encourage improved manual cultural techniques among\n            traditional farmers; (b) promote the integration of\n            livestock and agriculture, and the use of organic fertilizer\n            and animal traction; (c) promote and monitor measures which\n            may lead to cheaper alternative chemical fertilizers; (d)\n            encourage the use of inputs including selected seeds to\n            allow further production increases by more advanced farmers;\n            and (e) foster further development of village groups, and\n            test a small literacy program for some of these groups."}, "docdt": "1982-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
