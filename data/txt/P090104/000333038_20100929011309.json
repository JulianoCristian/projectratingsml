The NEDP was\n            approved by Board July 1, 2005. The project restructuring\n            and extension of the closing date was approved by the World\n            Bank Board of directors in June, 2010. The revised closing\n            date is 06/30/2012. As of August 17, 2010 the NEDP had\n            disbursed SDR 76.92 million (USD 118.94 million equivalent)\n            out of an original allocation of Special Drawing Rights\n            (SDR) 113.80 million (USD 172.17 million equivalent).
