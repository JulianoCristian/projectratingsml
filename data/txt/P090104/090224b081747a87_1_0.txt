                         NEDP implementation was concluded on schedule in June 2012. Procurement and implementation activities are competed for all contracts.

                         Concluded activities include best-practice distribution investments such as metering and roll-out of HV distribution systems (completed in Abuja suburbs Kubwa and Karu) leading to
                         improved revenue recovery (meters), enhanced quality of supply, reduced electricity theft and lower losses. HV distribution systems have also been installed in Agege, Luth and
