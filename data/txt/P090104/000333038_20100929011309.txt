The National Energy Development Project (NEDP) was approved by Board July 1, 2005. 
Level 1 project restructuring and extension of the closing date was approved by the 
World Bank Board of directors in June, 2010. Further details on the restructuring and 
extension request can be found in the NEDP restructuring paper attached to this memo. 
The revised closing date is 06/30/2012. As of August 17, 2010 the NED project had 
disbursed SDR 76.92 million (USD 118.94 million equivalent) out of an original 
allocation of SDR 113.80 million (USD 172.17 million equivalent). The project has been 
rated “Moderately Satisfactory” in the latest ISR both in terms of progress towards 
reaching project development objectives and general implementation of the project 
components.  
 
3. The proposed reallocation is necessary to accommodate the larger than expected 
disbursements on training and capacity building for PHCN as the company is going 
through major corporate restructuring and unbundling as part of the Nigerian 
government’s power sector reform agenda. The previously unallocated funds (category 6) 
are therefore proposed to be added to the initial allocation for category 4b “
Training, 
study tours and workshops, PHCN”.
