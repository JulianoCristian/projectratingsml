In addition,\n            direct technical assistance will be provided to about 300\n            export firms and supporting institutions in marketing and\n            related areas. The training component will provide a program\n            of short-term courses related to the immediate needs of 800\n            exporters and related public officials. Training of about 35\n            local trainers will also be included."}, "docdt": "1986-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
