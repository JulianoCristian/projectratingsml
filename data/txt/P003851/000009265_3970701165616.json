Under the technical\n            assistance component, the policy and institutional framework\n            to support projects will be strengthened. In addition,\n            direct technical assistance will be provided to about 300\n            export firms and supporting institutions in marketing and\n            related areas. The training component will provide a program\n            of short-term courses related to the immediate needs of 800\n            exporters and related public officials. Training of about 35\n            local trainers will also be included."}, "docdt": "1986-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
