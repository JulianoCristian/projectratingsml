                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Project now called the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) for the Republic of Togo, was approved on September 16, 2010.
                         The Grant agreement was signed on October 29, 2010 and the project became effective on January 28, 2011. The project was restructured in April 2014. The restructuring included
                         (i) new activities that are necessary to ensure the achievement of the project development objective (PDO); (ii) reallocation of funds among categories in order to take into account
                         these new activities; and (iii) an additional 6 months extension from May 31 to October 31 to allow the program targets and the overall PDO to be met. This is the last ISR as the

                         The rating for progress towards achievement of the PDO has been upgraded from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory considering that almost all PDO indicators have been met
                         following the restructuring and extension of closing date. The rating for implementation progress (IP) has been maintained Moderately Satisfactory since the implementation of all

                         activities required an extension.

                         The grant amount of US$ 45 million has been fully disbursed (100% disbursement). Activities funded by the project have been more or less completed and some targets surpassed
                         The project has successfully improved the teaching and learning environment in Togo schools. In addition to the number of schools constructed which is above the target, it has
                         provided textbooks and teachers guides to schools (almost twice the target) so that the ratio reading and mathematics textbooks will remain comfortable for the school-year 2014-15.
                         Due to the savings on textbooks, 11100 reading hoardings (panneaux de lecture) for grades 1 and 2 have been distributed to public schools. The project has also helped in (i)
                         developing competency-based curricula and new textbooks in mathematics and reading for the first grade; and (ii) preparing the introduction, on a pilot basis, of the new curricula and
                         textbooks. Moreover, about 3000 community teachers (locally referred to as " enseignants volontaires") in the process of being converted to auxiliary teachers, have benefited from
                         an in-service training (4 weeks for 1950 teachers with end of lower secondary education diploma and 2 weeks for those beyond this level). This enabled them to improve mainly their
                         subject knowledge which proved to be poor, after the evidence showed by the 2013 learning assessment which used a cross methodology: PASEC (Learning Assessment of the
                         Francophone Ministries of Education) and Service Delivery Indicators. Furthermore, grants were provided to about 80% of the public and community primary schools for quality
                         enhancement activities.

                         The project has also improved the schools' governance. The training of school-based management committees (denominated COGEPs) through part of the construction program has
                         not only empowered them to participate actively in the monitoring of school construction and maintenance, but also helped to improve the relationship between the inspectorates and
                         the communities.

                         However, out of 999 classrooms financed by the project, about 15 classrooms (in 5 schools) may not be fully completed by the closing date due to: (i) the nature of the soil in the
                         implementation of the civil works and (ii) difficulties of access in the rainy season. With regard to furniture provision for schools, as of October 15, 81% are already delivered and the
                         remaining is expected to be delivered by the end of October. The task team is closely monitoring these issues. The construction of three (3) regional Teachers Training Institutes has
                         been completed and furniture provision is on-going.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The grant amount of US$ 45 million has been fully disbursed (100% disbursement). Activities funded by the project have been more or less completed and some targets surpassed .
                         The construction of about 15 classrooms (out of 999 classrooms financed by the project) may not be fully completed by the closing date because, as of October 15, 2014, the
                         implementation rate of works was about 80%. This issue is being addressed by intensified supervision both from the project coordination unit and the Bank as well as the ministry
                         authorities. With these pressures, it is expected that the works will be fully completed shortly after the project closing date.

                         In June 2014, The GPE Board approved Togo's application for a second GPE Grant. The team is preparing the Grant Agreement and supporting the Ministry of Primary and
                         Secondary Education (MEPS) in filling out the necessary conditions agreed upon to get the Grant negotiated by end November 2014.
