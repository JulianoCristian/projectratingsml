                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been effective since January 26, 2011. The project unit is fully staffed. A Steering committee has been established. Togo has successfully organized its first annual
                         education sector joint review in July 2011. It is expected to see the implementation rhythm accelerate in order to ensure timely completion of the project and full satisfaction.
                         At this stage it is both for decision makers to play a more active role in terms of leadership and for executing bodies to show ownership and endorse a result-oriented approach. It is
                         also key to reinforce communication about the project and about the education sector plan

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project implementation has taken off. More commitment to the implementation of the education sector plan would speed up achievement of planned results. Communication on the
                         sector plan and on the project shall support this process.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
