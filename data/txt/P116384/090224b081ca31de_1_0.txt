                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is prepared as part of the Mid-term Review (MTR) of the project which took place from March 11-22, 2013. The mission reviewed the progress and outcomes after more than
                         two years of implementation, and provided recommendations that would enable the Program Development Objectives (PDO) to be fully achieved.

                         The ratings for progress towards achievement of the PDO and implementation progress (IP) are both moderately satisfactory. The status of the outcome indicators provided in the

                         last ISR has not changed because the statistical data for the 2013/14 school year are not yet available. Apart from the construction delegated to AGETUR which has experienced
                         some problems, implementation of the project activities is on track. Implementation, however, has not yet sufficient for satisfactory progress in terms of the project’s impact. During
                         the MTR, the Bank and the Ministry of Primary, Secondary Education and Literacy (MEPSA) engaged in the process of identifying solutions to accelerate implementation and agreed
                         to request a six month project extension to achieve the PDO. Below is a summary of the status of each component.

                         Component 1: Access and retention. Progress has been made in the construction in rural areas delegated to the school-based management committees (COGEP): (i) 30 out of 48
                         classrooms from the pilot phase were completed; (ii) the community bidding process for phase 1 consisting of 357 classrooms and related facilities is underway and the work will start
                         by July 2013; and (iii) the strengthening of the communities’ capacity for the implementation of phase 2 consisting of 207 classrooms and related facilities has started. In contrast,
                         schools construction delegated to AGETUR requires the attention. Significant delays have occurred because: (i) the costs of classrooms has exceeded the original grant amount
                         planned for the construction in urban areas; and (ii) the request of the tax exemption required to maintain at least the number of classrooms to be built has taken more than 3 months
                         to be approved. Consequently, the construction of classrooms in urban areas started after the MTR in April.

                         Component 2: Inputs for quality. Significant progress has been made in providing more textbooks than planned under the project (2.9 million vs. 1.6 million) to all public and
                         community schools. As a result, the ratio of textbooks to students in French and Math has exceeded the target even though it will only be reported in the official statistics once the
                         2012/13 school year data collection are finalized (planned for June 2013). Similarly, grants were given to eligible public and community schools for the 2011/12 and 2012/13 school
                         years after the school-based management committees (COGEPs) were trained on how to use the school grants. The preparation of the curricula based on the competencies-based
                         approach is underway. In contrast, the construction of the three teacher training institutes delegated to AGETUR has experienced the same delays as the classrooms in urban areas
                         and started only in May.

                         Component 3: Institutional strengthening. This component is on track to achieve the established targets since activities are being implemented according to schedule. At the
                         decentralized level, members of COGEP (2450 persons) have benefited from capacity building to implement school construction sub-projects. A time-bound implementation plan to
                         support capacity-building in the MEPSA and skills transfer from experts to the ministry staff is approved. A learning assessment and a tracer study for TVET and university graduates
                         are underway. A draft of education status report is prepared as an input for the update of the education sector plan and will be finalized in May. On the policy side a literacy policy
                         note based on a simulation model is under finalization and the administrative text reorganizing the primary cycle into three sub-cycles in order to reduce repetition has been approved
                         and disseminated to schools.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Moving forward, the following major agreements were made during the MTR: (i) the project development objective (PDO) remains valid and achievable; (ii) minor restructuring of the
                         project to include new activities (for example in-service training for teachers and retention activities) would be necessary to ensure the achievement of the PDO; (iii) reallocation of
                         funds among categories will then be necessary in order to take into account these new activities; and (iv) an additional 6 months extension would allow the program targets and the
                         overall PDO to be met.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
                         There are no related projects.
