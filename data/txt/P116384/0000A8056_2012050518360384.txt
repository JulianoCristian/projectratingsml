                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project implementation has taken off. The Bank acknowledged with appreciation the setting up of the bodies governing the Education Sector Plan (ESP) Implementation and
                         Monitoring, including the Education Permanent Technical Secretariat (STP). It is recommended tokeep the momentum and now to staff properly the STP for efficient monitoring of the
                         ESP. Attention should also be given to the implementation of the communication strategy regarding the Project and ESP, recently prepared by the Ministry of Education.
