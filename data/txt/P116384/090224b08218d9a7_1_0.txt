                         The objectives of the Project are to (i) increase coverage of and retention in basic education, (ii) support improvements in the quality of teaching, and (iii) strengthen
                         institutional and community capacity in implementation and management of the Project.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on an implementation support mission which took place in Lomé from July 29 to August 9, 2013 and subsequent developments.

                         The ratings for progress towards achievement of the PDO and implementation progress (IP) remain both moderately satisfactory. According to the Ministry's provisional data good
                         progress has been made in three (3) out of the five (5) key performance indicators: (i) primary completion rate (PCR) has increased from 71.2 in 2009/10 to 78% in 2012/13 for a

                         1.05, surpassing the end of project target. Time-bound capacity building plan is underway and has reached 55% in June 2013 for a target of 75%. In contrast, the number of direct
                         project beneficiaries which captured only the beneficiaries of school construction as defined in the project document has not significantly improved due to delays in the construction
                         component. Construction delegated to AGETUR has experienced some problems; but has gained momentum since April 2013. However, any improvements would not be sufficient to

                         fully make up for lost time. Implementation of the other project activities is on track. As of December 12, 2013, the project has disbursed US$ 32.03 million (71.2% of the total grant
                         amount) and a withdrawal application of about US$ 3.12 million is in the approval stage. The disbursement of this application will bring the disbursement rate to approximately 78%, a
                         25% increase from the last ISR. Overall implementation, however, is not yet sufficient for satisfactory progress in terms of the project's impact. The Government has requested a
                         restructuring of the project to include new activities that are necessary to ensure the achievement of the PDO and an additional 6 months extension to allow the program targets and
                         the overall PDO to be met.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following Government request based on the MTR recommendations, a restructuring package is being prepared for management approval. The restructuring includes (i) new
                         activities (for example in-service training for teachers and retention activities) that are necessary to ensure the achievement of the PDO; (ii) reallocation of funds among categories in
                         order to take into account these new activities; and (iii) an additional 6 months extension to allow the program targets and the overall PDO to be met.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
