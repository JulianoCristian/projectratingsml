                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project was recently restructured, extending the closing date to October 31, 2014 and amending the related legal documentation.

                         The PDO and components of the project remains unchanged. Changes include an amendment of the description of project components as follows:
                         Component 1: Two new activities have been added to ensure the achievement of the PDO : (i) construction of water access points in selected rural areas; and (ii) the restructuring of

                         Component 2: Two new activities have been introduced: (i) curricula review in preschool and literacy training; and (ii) in-service training for teachers in primary schools, thanks to the
                         shifts in the exchange rate which allows for the completion of the initial activities in Categories 2 and 3 at a lower cost in the local currency. On the other hand, the full curriculum

                         reform, too ambitious for a three-year project, has been reduced to the following activities based on lessons learned from other countries with regards to the development of
                         competency-based curricula and new textbooks: (i) the development of competency-based curricula and new textbooks in mathematics and reading for the first grade; and (ii) the
                         preparation of the introduction on a pilot basis of the new curricula and textbooks in the first grade.

                         The results framework has been revised to reflect the restructuring of the project sub-components. In terms of the PDO-level indicators, two indicators have been added: (i) “primary
                         retention rate” to measure retention (part of the PDO); and (ii) ''schools constructed by the school-based communities according to standardized school construction guidelines under
                         the project'' to better measure the third part of the PDO. The indicator ''time-bound capacity plan '' is now an intermediate-level indicator. The intermediate indicators have been
                         updated and these changes will allow for the proper monitoring of the project indicators and progress towards achieving the PDO based on the revised interventions.

                         The ratings for progress towards achievement of the PDO and implementation progress (IP) remain moderately satisfactory. The PDO-level indicators are on track to meet the
                         targets. Progress has been made in the implementation of all activities. Construction delegated to AGETUR which experienced some problems in the past has gained momentum
                         since April 2013 and the three teacher training institutes (TTI) have been completed and will be officially delivered by end June 2014. However, the construction of classrooms needs
                         to be closely monitored to ensure their completion by the new closing date. The development of competency-based curricula for the first grade has been completed and an
                         agreement has been reached with the Ministry to urgently set up a committee for the preparation of the new textbooks in mathematics and reading for the first grade to enable the
                         introduction on a pilot basis of these curricula and textbooks in the 2014/15 school year. As of June 1st, 2014 the project has disbursed US$43.45 million (97% of the total grant
                         amount), a 25.9% increase from the last ISR. Overall implementation, however, is not yet sufficient for satisfactory progress in terms of the project's impact.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured in April 2014. The restructuring includes (i) new activities that are necessary to ensure the achievement of the project development objective (PDO); (ii)
                         reallocation of funds among categories in order to take into account these new activities; and (iii) an additional 6 months extension to allow the program targets and the overall PDO
