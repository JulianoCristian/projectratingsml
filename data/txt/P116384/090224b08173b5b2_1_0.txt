                         Significant progress in implementation has been made for catching up with delays. Disbursement rate reached 53% (USD 23.9 million disbursed out of the USD 45 million of the
                         Grant), which is higher than the planned disbursement rate at this date (43%). 2.9 million textbooks have been delivered to schools, to be compared to a end of project target of 1.6
                         million. The training of school committees on the way to use the school grants has been achieved, the grants for the first year have been transferred to bank accounts located at
                         district levels and schools have started to disburse. The schools of the experimental first phase in rural areas (16 sites) are under construction and are planned to be delivered by

                         November 2012. Most of the indicators of the project are progressing and are on track or above the targets, in particular the PDO indicators: i) primary completion rate reached 75%
                         in 2011; ii) the capacity building plan (PIU-Civil servants skills transfer) has been completed and its implementation is satisfactory and iii) Thanks to the delivery of the 2.9 million
                         textbooks, the ratios textbooks: students -in French and Maths- have increased above the targets even if it will be reported in the official statistics only when the 2012/13 school year
                         data collection will be finalized (planned for June 2013).

                         There were also progress on the policy side with the significant improvement of the teacher posting consistency (the index (R2) has increased from 55% to 66% in two years, above
                         the end-of-project target of 60%) and the preparation of a draft administrative text for re-organizing the primary cycle in three sub-cycles and for reducing repetition. The
                         administrative text needs still to be approved and to be disseminated to all schools.
                         The two activities that deserve the most attention for implementation are i) the school buildings in urban areas; and ii) the construction of the 3 teacher training institutes (both

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project implementation is satisfactory. The Bank acknowledged with appreciation the setting up of the bodies governing the Education Sector Plan (ESP) Implementation and
                         Monitoring, including the Education Permanent Technical Secretariat (STP). It is recommended though to process with the staffing of the STP for efficient monitoring of the ESP.
                         Attention should also be given to the approval and circulation of the administrative text for re-organizing the primary cycle in three sub-cycles and for reducing repetition, recently
                         drafted by the Ministry of Education.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
