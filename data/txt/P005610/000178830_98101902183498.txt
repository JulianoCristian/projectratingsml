INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
SOCIETE TUNISIENNE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
t.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG), to be
guaranteed by the Republic of Tunisia, for the equivalent of US$12 million
to help finance the foreign exchange cost of a power project. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Tunisia has received thirteen Bank loans and eight IDA credits
amounting to, respectively, US$116.3 million and US$48.7 million, net of
cancellations and refundings. The proposed loan would bring the total to
US$177 million. About 40 percent of past Bank and IDA lending has been for
construction and improvenent of commercial ports, modernization of the rail-
way system and improvement of the highway network. This was complemented
by lending for a wide range of other activities essential to economic and
social progress on the basis of the Government's development planning and
priorities. These included aariculture (production cooperatives, agricul-
tural credit for cereal production, livestock development and date palm'
plantations, and inshore fisheries), industry and tourism through loans
to Societe Nationale d'Investissements (SNI), education (primarily for
expansion of the secondary school system), population control and water
supply.  The proposed loan would be the second Bank loan to STEG.    The
previous loan was for a natural gas pipeline project made in fiscal 1971.
3.        IFC has made investments in a fertilizer plant, a developmnent fi-
nance company, and a tourism developnent and promotion company. Its loans
and equity presently lheld in these enterprises totals US$11.4 million.   A
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IDA investments is given
in Annex I.
4.        Project performance continues to be generally satisfactory.    Fol-
lowing approval of my memorandum to the Executive Directors of August 21,
1971 (IDA/R71-57) part of the remaining proceeds of the second education
credit of 1966 (No. 94) was allocated to finance additional equipment for
a number of existing schools and technical assistance in educational plan-
ning. Procurement of this equipment is proceeding satisfactorily. An as-
sessment of the technical assistance requirements was made in late 1971,
and a mission is presently reviewing potential sources of recruitment with
the Government.



-2-
5.        The Railway project (Loan No. 606/Credit No. 150) of 1969 was ini-
tially delayed by the severe floods in late 1969, but is now expected to be
completed by the end of 1973, about one year behind the original schedule.
A matter of concern is the weak financial position of the railway company
(SNCFT), which is due in large part to the technical, financial and commer-
cial problems faced by its largest client, the Sfax/Gafsa phosphate mining
company. This firm has accumulated considerable arrears vis-a-vis SNCFT
and delays in paying freight bills are excessive. A supervision mission
due at the end of March 1972 will discuss with the Government suitable
arrangements for a short-term solution to SNCFT's problem, pending the
outcome of studies on the future of the mining company.
6.        After a transition period of nearly two years following the gen-
erally unsuccessful attempt to organize most of agriculture and commerce
into cooperatives in 1969, the Government is working out a new approach to
economic development, as discussed in Part II. In support of this approach
the strategy for future Bank Group lending to Tunisia is expected to con-
centrate to an increasing extent on three crucial development problems:
increase of efficiency in agricultural and industrial production, develop-
ment of the human resources potential, and promotion of foreign exchange
earning activities. Attendant Bank Group objectives will be to assist the
Government in implementing its new economic policies, in institution build-
ing and structural reform.
7.        A tourism infrastructure project is scheduled for presentation
to the Executive Directors before the end of the current fiscal year.
Irrigation rehabilitation and urban sewerage projects as well as a fifth
loan to SNI are in more preliminary stages of preparation. No IFC invest-
ments are presently under active consideration.
8.        The proposed project was aDpraised in October 1971.    Negotiations
were held in Washington in February 1972. The Borrower was represented by
Mr. Sadok Bahroun, President Director General of STEG, and the Government
of Tunisia, as Guarantor, by Mr. rahar Ennifer, Ministry of Planning.
PART II - XiHE ECONOMfY
9.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prosnects of
Tunisia" (EXA-38a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August
18, 1971. An economic mission is now in Tunisia and its resort is expected
to be issued by August, 1972. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
A map of Tunisia is also attached.
10.       The last economic renort stressed the crucial innortance of fol-
lowing through with the new develonment stratecy introduiced bv the Covern-
ment in November 1970. The major objectives: increased production, exports
and employment are to be achieved rmainly by encoura4ing private initiative,



and, to that end, reducing direct Government involvement in economic de-
cisions, decentralizing responsibility for the management of the economy
and relaxing administrative regulations.
11.       Production developed favorably in 1971 because of better agricul-
ture crops, due to good weather, and a very good tourist season. Real GDP
has risen by about 8 percent. Because of higher export prices for oil and
larger receipts from tourism and workers' remittances, foreign exchange
earnings were substantially higher than in 1970, preventing a further
widening of the current deficit in the balance of payments despite the
continued increase in imports. As capital inflows remained at a high level,
the improvement in reserves achieved during the last three years continued.
12.       Agriculture is still the dominant sector in the economy, provid-
ing nearly half the country's employment, a quarter of merchandise exports
and 15 percent of GDP. Food processing industries account for another 5
percent of GDP and a third of value added in manufacturing. After a period
of stagnation during the second half of the 1960's, reflecting unfavorable
weather conditions and the unsettling effects of changes in the organization
of agricultural production, agricultural output increased substantially in
1971 and is expected to grow further in 1972. Past large investments in
irrigation works, soil conservation and tree planting provide a basis for
continued expansion of production, while domestic and foreign markets could
absorb a higher level of output than is presently produced.
13.       Manufacturing contributes about 15 percent to GDP. The develop-
ment of the sector up to 1969 focused to a large extent on import substitu-
tion by state enterprises and processing of minerals for export. Because
of the small size of the domestic market and deteriorating world market
conditions for phosphates, manufacturing output has grown slowly. Govern-
ment control over the investment decisions and management of public enter-
prises, and the extensive regulation of trade, foreign exchange, investment
and prices also hindered industrial development.
14.       In recent years, good opportunities have developed for estab-
lishing export industries. The 1969 Association Agreement with the EEC
allows most Tunisian industrial exports duty-free access to the Community,
while proximity to Europe and substantial labor reserves offer scope for
foreign direct investment. Since 1969, measures have been taken to foster
competition through greater reliance on the market mechanism, and to make
industrial protection more selective in its application to individual in-
dustries. More recently, the authorities have prepared legislation provid-
ing substantial incentives for domestic and foreign firms to establish
export-oriented industries. Efforts are also being made to improve the
institutional arrangements for facilitating foreign investment. IFC will
assist the Government in developing contacts with industrial organizations
abroad.
15.       Crude oil production (primarily from the El Borma deposit in the
south) was slightly above 4 million tons in 1971. Production has tended to
level off since 1969 in the absence of new important oil discoveries.



- 4 -
Recently intensified prospecting indicates however that relatively import-
ant deposits may exist in the Sfax region and south of El Borma.
16.       Tourism started from a low level and expanded rapidly in the
1960's. It has now become a major foreign exchange earner (about $100
million in 1971, corresponding to about 25 percent of total current foreign
exchange earnings), source of employment and means of diversifying the econ-
omy. Demand is expected to expand further but hotel capacity will remain
a major constraint on increased earnings. The Government is drawing up a
master plan for tourism development through 1985, and feasibility studies
on infrastructure have been completed.
17.       To maintain an adequate rate of investment Tunisia will continue
to need substantial amounts of external assistance. The main sources of
external aid are the members of the Consultative Group for Tunisia. Over
the period 1961-70, the country received external financial assistance
in the amount of about US$780 million, 86 percent of which was granted by
bilateral donor countries and agencies (mainly USAID, Canada, France,
Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Sweden and the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development). Over the past five years, however, the proportion
of commitments from multilateral sources (primarily the Bank. Group and, to
a lesser extent, the African Development Bank), has increased to 10 percent
of the total, compared with 5 percent in the 1961-65 period. Of the aid
received, 28 percent was in the form of grants, including agricultural
commodities and technical assistance, 30 percent in the form of non-project
loans and 42 percent in project loans. The largest share of project loans
was for irrigation infrastructure (about USS1O0 million), followed by trans-
port and communications (about US$37 million) and tourism (about US$80 mil-
lion).
18.       The Consultative Group for Tunisia, which met in October 1971,
discussed the economic nosition and prospects of the country and welcomed
Tunisia's new economic policv objectives. It was avreed that Tunisia would
continue to need assistance on concessional terms for a number of years and
the members of the Group expressed their willingness to continue providing
such aid.
19.       Tunisia's foreign debt burden is relatively high:     in 1970, the
last year for which complete information is available, the debt service
ratio was about 22 percent. Restraint over the recent past in short and
medium-term borrowing and the availabilitv of foreig*n aid on favorable con-
ditions, combined with higher foreign exchange earnings, reduced this ratio
below 20 percent in 1971; with prudent debt management it should renain at
this lower level in the next few years. Tunisia's continued creditworthiness
for borrowing on commercial terms depends however on her continued ability
to attract a large proportion of new external assistance oni concessional
terms.

PART III - THE PROJECT
20.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of First Power Project,
Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz" (No. PU-84a) dated March 7,
1972 is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. A Loan
and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
21.       STEG was created in 1962 to take over the operations of seven
foreign privately-owned utility companies nationalized in that year. At
the request of the Tunisian Government and the former shareholders, the
President of the Bank acted as conciliator in the settlement of compensa-
tion and the recommendations that he made in 1968 are being implemented.
STEG is wholly owned by the Government, and is responsible for the produc-
tion, transmission and distribution of electricity and gas for public con-
sumption in the whole country. During its early years, STEG's efforts were
concentrated on integrating the seven separate systems and on filling the gaps
in supervisory and skilled manpower created when the expatriate staff of the
original companies left Tunisia.
22.       STEG's main activity is the generation, transmission and distribu-
tion of electric power; gas accounts for only 6 percent of total earnings.
In 1970, STEG had a total generating capacity of 196 .MnW and supplied 80
percent of all electric energy consumed in Tunisia. The only other power
sources are about 28 MW of captive plants serving industrial and mining
companies, which are expected to take an increasing share of their future
power requirements from STEG. Thermal plants account for 87 percent of
STEG's generating capacity, and hydroelectric plants for the remainder.
23.       STEG completed the inter-connection of the main consumer areas by
a national power grid in 1967. The system contains about 11,000 km of
transmission and distribution lines. Sales have increased annually by about
10 percent on the average, from 240 Gwh in 1961 to 577 Gwh in 1970. The
principal users of electricity are the industrial, mining and tourist sec-
tors in which 1,250 consumers in 1970 absorbed about 70 percent of total
sales. The remainder was sold to 283,000 domestic and small irrigation
customers who had a relatively low annual consumption averaging about 630
Kwh per customer. About 70 percent of STEG's power sales are in the eco-
nomically active and more densely populated northern part of the country,
including Tunis, Nabeul, Bizerte and Jendouba. So far, investment in rural
electrification has been limited, but STEG is planning to intensify its ac-
tivities in this field.
24.       During the past three years, the management of STEG, which is com-
petent and dynamic, has been able to initiate a systematic expansion of the
integrated system and turn its attention to matters of oroanization, management
and finance. It has restructured and decentralized the organization and started
to improve the accounting system, billing and collections. Considerable pro-
gress has already been made in overcoming many of the institutional and or-
ganizational problems, but would benefit from the technical assistance to be
provided under the proposed loan.



- 6 -
25.       STEG is undertaking a six-year expansion program covering the years
1971-1976 at an estimated cost of some $125 million, of which generating
plant, transmission and distribution account for about $90 million. The
principal components of the program currently under construction are a 60 MW
gas-fired steam plant at Rhennouch near Gabes in southern Tunisia, being
financed by French credits, and the gas line from El Borma which is being
financed by the February 1971 Bank loan of $7.5 million jointly with a $2.5
million loan from the Kuwait Fund. The steam plant and gas pipeline are
due for completion on schedule in October 1972. Transmission lines and
distribution have been financed under Canadian and USAID credits.
Project Description and Financing Arrangements
26.       The proposed project comprises the principal facilities under the
six-year program to be constructed during 1972-74. As indicated in Annex III,
these are the installation of two 20 M; gas turbines near the above-mentioned
steam plant at Rhennouch (fuelled by the El Borma gas pipeline which has suf-
ficient capacity for both the 60 M4 steam plant and the 40 MI gas turbines)
and the expansion of STEG's transmission and distribution systems. Consulting
services would be provided for: (i) system stability and the location of fu-
ture power plants; (ii) organization and improvement of management information
and imaplementation of improved computer procedures; (iii) reorganization of
the accounting system; (iv) inventory of transmission and distribution systems:
(v) tariffs, with a view to introducing early in 1973 a new and more rational
tariff structure; and (vi) expansion of the rural electrification program.
27.       Total cost of the project is estimated at US$16.7 million.    The
proposed loan of US$ 12.0 million would cover the estimated forei5n exchange
component and the local expenditures will be financed from STFG's internal
cash generation (see Annex III).
28.       STEG's financial position is basically sound.    The debt/equity
ratio was 31:69, as of December 31, 1970 and is expected to increase tem-
porarily to 36:64 in 1972 and 1973, the peak of the project construction
period, well well within the limit of 45:55 set in the Loan Agreement for
the Gas Pipeline project and repeated in the draft Agreement for the pro-
posed loan.
29.       STEG's operations are characterized by a higzh level of self-fi-
nancing of expansion.   In 1970 about 31 percent of capital expenditure was
financed from cash generated after debt service. Thie rate of self-financing
is expected to average about 50 percent over the period 1971 through 1976.
During the same period debt service will each year be covered at least twice
by internal cash generation. The tariff covenant under Loan No. 724 deter-
mined the required level of cash generation in relation to net fixed assets
in operation. STEG charges comparatively high rates of depreciation, and
under the draft Loan Agreement it is proposed to relate cash generation to
average gross fixed assets in order to smooth out the incidence on the re-
quired minimum ratio of the commissioning of major new assets.    STEG's op-
erating return on this basis was 8.5 percent in 1979, the minimum return
required in the draft Loan Agreenent, and is projected at not less than
9 percent through 1976.



-7-
30.       A cause for some concern has been the amount of STEG's accounts
receivable, in particular those of government departments, local authori-
ties and state-controlled autonomous enterprises, which had increased
materially in 1970. Furthermore, by the end of 1970 a number of the state-
owned enterprises had either not paid their current bills at all or were
doing so only after excessive delays.
31.       For government departments, the payment of current bills has much
improved in 1971 as a result of the application of a decree issued in late
1969 providing a satisfactory budgetary mechanism for settlement of current
utility bills, and the local authorities are now paying their current bills
as they become due. It was agreed during negotiations that electricity
bills due from both government departments and the local authorities would
continue to be settled in accordance with the provisions of the above-men-
tioned decree, or otherwise in accordance with sound commercial practices,
and that bills which became due before the end of 1969 and remain unpaid
would be settled before the end of 1972. Furthermore, arrangements have
been or are being worked out for the settlement of overdue and current
utility bills of state enterprises, with the important exception of the
Sfax/Gafsa phosphate mining company which, as mentioned in paragraph 5 above,
faces serious financial problems. The Government has initiated a detailed
study of possible remedies, and in these circumstances it was agreed during
negotiations that arrangements satisfactorv to the Bank would be made at the
latest by July 1, 1973, both for the settlement of arrears due to STEG from
the Sfax/Gafsa company (presently amounting to about US$1.4 million) and
for the regular payment of its current bills amounting to about US$1 million
a year, which is approximately 5 percent of STEC's annual revenue from the
sale of electricity.
32.       Goods to be financed from the proceeds of the proposed loan will
be procured under international competitive Didding. No domestic suppliers
exist for such goods. The power plant will be installed by the suppliers
of the equipment under a supplv-and-erect contract. The transmission and
distribution system work will be executed partly under supply-and-erect
contracts and partly by STEG's own work forces. Bids for the gas turbines
have already been invited in accordance with Bank procurement ,uidelines.
33.       Disbursements will be made against the CTF cost of imported material
and equipment, and against the foreign exchang-e cost of the erection of plant
and consulting services.
34.       TMe proposed plant will be rcquired to meet the forecast peak sys-
tem demand through 1976. A principal factor in the selection of gas tur-
bines for installation at this time is their short installation period which
will allow some of the older steam plant at Tunis to be put into reserve
with savings of almost US$4 million in operating costs from mid-1973
through 1975 from the substitution of gas (presently being flared) for im-
ported oil fuel. The short lead time for gas turbines compared to steam



- 8 -
plants will also allow STEG the time to determine its future expansion needs
and the location o,f new plants taking into account the possible favorable
results of the recently intensified exploration of Tunisia's oil resources.
35.       Alternative means of meeting the forecast system demand were
compared, and STEG's plan to install 40 MW of gas turbines proved to be the
least cost alternative. The internal financial rate of return for the
project would be in the range of 23 to 25 percent.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and STEG, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for power
projects. Particular attention is drawn to Section 3.04 of the Guarantee
Agreement, which provides that'the Guarantor shall take all appropriate
measures satisfactory to the Bank to'ensure that all Government agencies
and departments, local authorities and the state-owned enterprises shall
sett-le their current electricity bills substantially as they become due and
shall make progress satisfactory to the Bank towards determining the means
of settling their arrears of electricity bills outstanding on the date of
the Guarantee Agreement.
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
