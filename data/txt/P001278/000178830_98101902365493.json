period, assist Kenya in the training of primary and\n            secondary schools' management staff, and of the middle-\n            and higher-level technical manpower required, particularly\n            in the public sector, to carry out specific programs and\n            projects, mainly in agriculture and water resources\n            development. It would also assist in meeting the training\n            needs of skilled workers in industries, and in the\n            identification of the needs for business education in Kenya\n            and possible development of programs to meet such needs. No\n            major risks are envisaged. However, certain lessons learned\n            from past experience are addressed in the proposed project.\n            The project design is expected to help avoid a shortage of\n            qualified teaching staff for the project institutions\n            (through inclusion in the project of necessary specialist\n            services and fellowships), minimize implementation delays\n            (through strengthening the Project Implementation Unit,\n            PIU), and ensure appropriate coordination between the PIU\n            and the ministries involved in the project."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
