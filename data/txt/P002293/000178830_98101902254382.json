      developing and operating a grazing scheme on about 1.4\n            million ha of understocked grazing land in the northern part\n            of Eastern Senegal, involving principally: (i) organizing\n            some 6,500 predominantly pastoralist families into about 65\n            grazing units; (ii) constructing about one hundred wells\n            about 2,400 km of firebreaks; (iii) granting up to 300\n            credits to herders for the purchase of breeding animals, 500\n            credits for supplementary feed (cottonseed) and 30 credits\n            for oxdrawn carts and small farm equipment; (b) improving\n            animal health services; (c) providing fellowships and\n            opportunities for visits to livestock development projects\n            abroad for Senegalese graduates, project staff and pastoral\n            leaders, and providing agricultural extension workers with\n            training in livestock husbandry; and (d) monitoring
