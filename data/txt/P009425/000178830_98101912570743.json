electrification program. The project will\n            include: (i) the installation of new electricity\n            distribution networks in the seven selected areas; and (ii)\n            the rehabilitation of limited existing distribution systems\n            operated by BPDB and their integration into the new systems\n            in the above areas.

The\n            Supplemental Assistance to Selected Projects Project seeks\n            to provide the Port of Chittagong with adequate capacity for\n            handling the expected growth in general cargo and container\n            traffic through the early 1990's. This will be achieved\n            through the construction of two multipurpose berths suitable\n            for servicing general cargo as well as container vessels and\n            by improving the throughput of the existing berths by\n            providing new cargo-handling equipment and by training of\n            the port workers.
