"The proposed project is part of\n            EGAT's 1979-1986 power development program and\n            comprises: (a) preliminary works and a program for the\n            resettlement of about 2,000 families living in the proposed\n            reservoir area; (b) construction of a rockfill storage dam\n            82 meters high with a total embankment volume of about 8\n            million cubic meters; (c) construction of an open-chute type\n            spillway; (d) an intake structure with one irrigation outlet\n            and three power conduits; (e) construction of a surface\n            powerhouse with three generating units of 100 MW each and of\n            a switchyard; (f) installation of a 230 kV double-circuit\n            transmission line about 88 km long from Khao Laem to\n            Srinagarind and a 230 kV single-circuit line on double\n            circuit towers, about 108 km long on to the Ban Pong No. 2\n            substation; and (g) consultancy services for project design\n            and construction supervision and for undertaking a study of\n            organization and coordination of the electricity sector. The\n            project will help meet the country's increasing demand\n            for electricity including that engendered by the accelerated\n            program for rural electrification."}, "docdt": "1979-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
