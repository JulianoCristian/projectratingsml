KHAO LAEM HYDP.OELECTRIC PROJECT (LOAN 1770-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Completion Report for the project financed under the
sixth loan to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and the
tenth power loan to EGAT and its predecessor. The US$80 million loan which
became effective on September 17, 1980, was provided to finance approximately
46% of the foreign cost of a project consisting of a hydroelectric scheme at
Khao Laer, associated 230 KV transmission lines and a sector coordination
study. Additional financing of about US$19 million was provided under the
Power Subsector Project (Loan 2000-TH).
This report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Projects
Department, Energy Division following a project completior mission which took
place in April 1985. A first draft of the report had been prepared by the
Hydroelectric Construction Department of EGAT.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
COED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Government and the Borrower.  Comments received from thea have been
reproduced as Appendices A and B to the report.

KHAO LAEM HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT (LOAN 1770-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
A US$80 million dollar loan was made to EGAT in June 1980 to finance
part of the foreign costs of constructing the Khao Laem hydroelectric dam and
power station, the associated transmission lines, and a power sector coordina-
tion study (para. 13). The Khao Laem power station, with a total installed
capacity of 300 MW in three units, was commissioned about one year behind
schedule because additional civil works associated with the dam were
required. The power station was generating commercially before the end of
1984 (paras. 18, 32 and 55). The resettlement program and the establishment
of agricultural cooperative societies included in this project were success-
fully completed on time (paras. 21 and 54). The actual project cost
(excluding interest during construction) was about US$376 million equivalent,
about 4X above the appraisal estimate (paras. 24, 25 aud 55). It was recently
agreed that no significant coordination problems existed in the sector and the
loan was reduced by about US$100,000 - the provisional sum included in the
loan for the study (para. 22).
EGAT's peak generation rose from about 2,250 MW in 1979 to just over
3,5OO KW in 1984. EGAT's energy sales increased by about 50X (from 12,934 GWh
to 19,362 GWh) in the six year period (para. 46).
The project will reduce Thailand's needs for imported fuels, and its
ex Dost economic rate of return of 16Z, which is the same as that estimated at
appraised, confirms its economic viability (para. 48).
EGAT continues to be well managed (para. 30). After operating costs
had been seriously affected by severe drought and the oil price rises of 1979,
the Government implemented substantial tariff increases in 1980 and 1981 which
subsequently helped restore EGAT's financial viability (paras. 38-44 and 56).

I. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.        Power in Thailand is supplied principally by three government enti-
ties, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropoli-
tan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority
(PEA). EGAT is responsible for generation and high voltage transmission to
supply bulk power to MEA, PEA and a small number of large industrial consu-
mers; MEA for distribution in the greater Bangkok Metropolitan area and PEA
for distribution throughout the rest of the country and for minor generation
in certain isolated areas.
2.        EGAT's system at the end of FY84 compares with that of FY78 at
appraisal as follows:

The Borrower
3.        The Borrower was EGAT, an autonomous entity established in 1968 by a
merger of its predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA) and two
other entities. EGAT, which accounts for almost all of the electricity
generated in Thailand, is a well organized and operated utility with a
considerable degree of autonomy. Its Board of Directors consists of a Chair-
man and not more than 10 other members, including the General Manager. All
Board members who are appointed by the Council of Ministers, act in part time
capacity, with the exception of the General Manager. EGAT has four Deputy
General Managers responsible respectiryly for administration, technical
matters, construction and operations.-
4.        This was the sixth power loan to EGAT and the tenth to EGAT and its
predecessor. The loan for the first EGAT Power Project (Loan 655-TH) was made
in February 1970 to help finance the power installation (3 x 125 MW) at the
Sirikit dam and the addition of Unit No. 3 (300 MW) at the South Bangkok ther-
mal power plant. The second loan to EGAT was made in November 1971 for the
South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 790-TH). The third loan was
made in April 1974 for the first stage of the Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric
Project (Loan 977-TH). The fourth loan was made in September 1977 for the
Pattani Hydroelectric Project (Loan 1485-TH), and a fifth loan was made for
the Bang Pakong Thermal Power Project (Loan 1690-TH) in August 1979.
5.        The conclusions of the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) for
the first ECAT Power Project were that (a) the Sirikit units were implemented
a few months earlier than envisaged, with a cost overrun of 4%; (b) the South
Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 3 had a cost overrun of 3% and was completed six
months behind schedule mainly due to the need to repair the generator; (c) the
major objectives of the project had been met; and (d) EGAT complied with all
covenants and its financial performance was satisfactory.
6.        The conclusions of the PPAR for the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4
Project were that (a) the major objectives of the project had been met;
(b) the project was completed on time and within the original cost estimate;
(c) EGAT's financial performance was satisfactory; and (d) some financial
advant ge resulted from exercising an option to purchase duplicate generating
equipment provided in the contract for Unit No. 3.
7.        The conclusions of the PPAR for the third project, the first stage
of the Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric Project were that (a) the project was
executed as planned and was completed according to the original schedule but
at a cost overrun of about 30Z which was beyond the control of EGAT due to the
world fuel crisis and the resulting inflation; (b) the resettlement plan was
carried out successfully; (c) the Government succeeded in implementing tariff

responsible respectively for Thermal Power and Mine Development,
Hydropower and Transmission System Development, Power Plant Operations,
Transmission System Operations, Accounts and Finance, and Administration.



increases four times; and (d) the financial position of EGAT and the Sector as
a whole was sound. The major lessons to be learned from that Project were
.hat an International Board of Consultants (IBC), which EGAT has retained
since 1974 to advice on major hydroelectric projects, can be very effective in
ensuring adequate project desigr. and implementation, and that an effective way
to conserve energy is through an appropriate energy pricing policy.
8.        The conclusions of the Project Completion Report (Report No. 5607)
for the Pattani Hydroelectric Project were that (a) the project was completed
about two months ahead of schedule and at a cost slightly below the appraisal
estimate; (b) the resettlement plan was carried out successfully; cnd (c) the
several substantial tariff increases implemented by Government during 1980-81
helped restore the financial viability of both EGAT and the sector as a whole
but that the financial condition of both should be kept under review as the
impact of the increases declines.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION
Project Preparation and Appraisal
9.        EGAT, with assistance from the Japanese Government, carried out
investigations for developing the Quae Noi river basin in 1968. The resulting
report, which was completed in August 1970, suggested that the damsite be
located on the Quae Noi river at Ban Phu Toei.
10.       In 1972, EGAT and the Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation (SMEC),
using funds made available by the Australian Government, carried out
additional investigations which indicated very unfavorable geological
conditions at Ban Phu Toei. Their report recommended that further work should
be carried out to investigate a damsite 30 km upstream at Khao Laem.
11.       Investigations of the Khao Laem site began in November 1973 and SMEC
produced the Feasibility Report for the Khao Laem Project in October 1977.
EGAT's Board approved the project in March 1978, and the Royal Thai
Government, on February 27, 1979, gave approval for EGAT to proceed with the
project.
12.       A power sector mission which visited Thailand in September 1977
started project preparation by the Bank. The project was appraised during a
power mission to Thailand in February/March 1979.
Project Description
13.       The project is located on the Quae Noi river about 265 km northwest
of Bangkok and 70 km northwest of the existing Srinagarind (Ban Chao Wen) dam
on the Quae Yai river. The project comprises:
(a) preliminary works and resettlement;
(b)  an 82 m high rockfill dam with a total embankment volume of about
8 million cu m;



- 4 -
(c) an open-chute type spillway controlled by two radial gates;
(d) an intake structure with an irrigation outlet and three power
conduits;
(e) a surface power house with three generating units of 100 MW each;
(f) a switchyard;
(g) a 230 kV double-circuit transmission line about 88 km long from Khao
Laem to Srinagarind, and a 230 kV single-circuit line on double-
circuit towers about 108 km long from Srinagarind to the Ban Pong
No. 2 substation; and
(h) consuitancy services for project design, construction supervision,
and a study of sector coordination.
Project Role in Thailand's Development Program
14.       The project is an important part of EGAT's expansion program to meet
Thailand's rapidly growing energy and power demand for electricity. By using
an indigenous renewable er3rgy resource, the proJect reduces Thailand's
dependence on imported fuels for electricity generation. In addition, the
project has made available a reliable supply of water which will permit the
irrigation of wet and dry crops downstream of Khao Laem; increase the minimum
flow in the Mae Klong river to help reduce the concentration of industrial
pollution; and provide additional water in the Bangkok area. The project will
also help reduce, by over 40,000 ha, the areas subject to flooding each year.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Start-up
15.       Board approval of the Project took place on November 27, 1979.  The
loan was signed on June 17, 1980 and became effective on September 17, 1980.
16.       Project preparation and procurement for the major items were well
advanced by the date of Board approval. Bidding documents for the Khao Laem
civil works were issued on June 14, 1979, bids were opened on September 25,
1979 and contract award was made on February 21, 1980. Bidding documents for
generators and turbines were issued on February 7, 1980, t*e bids were opened
on July 3, 1980 and the contracts were signed on January 22, 1981.
Changes in Scope of Work
17.       The project scope remained essentially the same as described in the
Appraisal Report, but poor geological conditions led to extensive additional
civil works. It had been realized at the time of appraisal that cavernous
limestone conditions (karsts) existed below the site of the dam and in the
region of its right abutment. Substantial geological investigations, includ-



- 5 -
ing 99 drill-holes totalling 7,219 meters and 9 adits totalling 1,760 meters,
were carried out prior to Board approval. To reduce leakage it was proposed
chat a method of treatment should be used involving a concrete cut-off wall
which would be constructed down to the level of non-cavernous rocks. This
method was proposed by EGAT's consultants and accepted by the International
Board of Consultants (para. 7) who concluded that the feasibility of the
project had been established despite the limestone conditions. Bids for the
civil works had been received prior to Board approval and based on these, the
work in the area of the right abutment was estimated at about US$65 million
equivalent or 18% of the totai cost of the proposed hydroelectric project.
During the construction period it became apparent that due to the karstic
conditions, which extended more widely than had been appreciated at the time
of appraisal, dam foundations would need to be more substantial, and the
original proposal to grout to a depth of 50 meters in the immediate area of
the right abutment would be inadequate. Resulting design changes during
construction therefore included additional dam foundation excavations, extra
rock filling and larger quantities of back-fill concrete, and deepening of the
grout curtain to 250 meters for the first 800 meters of the right abutment.
Increases in the costs of civil works were kept to a minimum by reducing the
length of the lower galleries of the right abutment cut-off. The cost of the
works in the area of the right abutmer.t increased by about 19% to US$77.6
million, and the additional dam foundation works increased the cost of the
main civil works (the dam, power station and appurtenant structures) by about
9% from US$148.2 million to US$162 million equivalent.
Project Implementation
(a) Khao Laem Hydroelectric Development
18.       Main civil works for the dam, powerhouse and appurtenant structures
started in January 1980 and were completed in January 1985. Some remaining
minor works were completed by ECAT's own staff in Hay 1985. The supply and
installation of hydro-mechanical equipment including gates, power-station
crane, steel conduit and valves were executed under supply and erection con-
tracts; installation started in July 1980 and was completed in March 1985. The
installation of major electro-mectanical equipment including turbines,
generators, main transformers, pcwer-plant auxiliary equipment and switchyard
equipment was carried out by ECAT's own personnel under the technical supervi-
sion of the various related suppliers.  A summary of key dates for major works
is included in Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2. The test runs of the generating units
were performed during the period October 1984 to March 1985.
19.       Construction and installation of the 230 kV double-circuit transmis-
sion line between the Khao Laem and the Srinagarind hydroelectric plants and
the single-circuit line from Srinagarind to Ban Pong No. 2 substation was
started by the contractor in May 1981 and completed in March and June 1983
respectively (Annex 1, Table 3).
20.       The project was executed and continues to be operated with due
regard to ecological and environmental factors including those identified in
the recommendations of the Upper Quae Noi Basin Preliminary Environmental
Study Report dated September 1975, prepared for ECAT by the Applied Scientific



-6-
Research Cooperation of Thailand. Following the closure of the dam and during
the period of the initial filling of the reservoir, the consequent reduction
in the river flow had no adverse effect on irrigation because sufficient water
flow from the lower catchment area and the Srinagarind reservoir continued
downstream of the dam to maintain supplies for riparian agriculture and
domestic use.
21.       The resettlement program was carried out satisfactorily.  The infra-
structure associated with the project included the construction of 45.5 km of
main access road, 165 km of lateritic village roads, 22 kV power supply lines,
domestic water supply systems, schools, health centers, wats and Budhist resi-
dences. Compensation monies totaling B 286.38 million (U2$10.6 million equi-
valent) were paid to the affected villagers. Of a total of 1,800 families
that lived in the area flooded (about 353 sq km), 1,765 families were reset-
tled in new villages constructed under the project. Each family, which had
owned land in the reservoir area, was provided with a one rai (0.16 hectare)
home plot and a 14 rai (2.24 hectare) farm plot. Agricultural cooperative
societies were established in the resettlement villages. A total amount of
about B 18 million (US$0.7 million equivalent) was provided in loans to the
villagers on the basis of B 10,000 (US$370 equivalent) per family. Also,
agricultural promotion centers were set up in the resettlement area for
extension services. Fewer families were resettled than originally estimated
because a number of families decided to relocate to various places of their
own choice after receiving due compensation. More families than originally
anticipated chose to settle in the village of Ban Chong Ua.

(b) Power Sector Coordination Study
22.       The loan included a provision of US$100,000 for a power sector
organization and coordination study that was to be commissioned by Government
through consultants. During negotiations of the Power Subsector Project (Loan
2000-TH), it was agreed that before undertaking the study, the Government and
the Bank await the recommendations of the Energy Master Plan (EMP) study that



- 7 -
was to focus, inter alia, on the institutional issues in the energy sector.
The final report of the EMP did not consider changes in the power sector
organization that would require further studies. EGAT and the Bank have since
agreed that no significant problems of organization and coordination exist in
the power sector. The undisbursed balance of US$101,110.36 was therefore can-
celled effective February 21, 1985.
Project Completion
23.       The project was completed in March 1985 about 12 months later than
originally estimated. The delay was caused by the additional civil works
which were required (para. 17).
Project Costs
24.       The final project cost (excluding interest during construction) in
current prices was US$376.15 million equivalent, of which US$158.93 million
equivalent was the foreign exchange cost and US$217.22 million equivalent the
local cost. The appraisal estimate and the actual cost of the project are

25.       The actual project cost (excluding interest during construction) was
US$14.23 million (3.9%) higher than the appraisal estimate. The cost of the
civil works were about 17% higher than the appraisal estimate due to the addi-
tional work required in the foundations of the dam and its right abutment
(para. 17). The hydraulic and electromechanical equipment, and the trans-
mission system costs were only 74% and 56% respectively of the appraisal esti-

mates because equipment price escalation was not significant during the pro-
ject conetruction period, and plant and equipment were delivered and installed
without recourse to much of the provisions for physical contingencies.

.V. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
System Growth and Operations
29.       The growth of EGAT's systems and operations over the period FY78 to
FY84 is summarized below:

/a   Includes free-of-charge electricity supplied for street iighting.
30.       EGAT continues to be well managed.  Staff are well qualified and
competent. The working climate and staff morale are excellent. The number of
employees per megawatt installed has reduced substantially over the project
period and sales per employee have begun to rise since 1982. The number of
employees reflect the fact that EGAT carries out most of the field investiga-
tion works required for its future projects and maintains a large construction
force for plant installation. EGAT's training program is adequate.
Reservoir Filling and Plant Operation
31.       The dam was closed and reservoir filling began on June 1, 1984,
about one year later than the date estimated at the time of appraisal.
32.       Generating units No. 3, 2 and 1 were commissioned on December 5,
1984, February 7, 1985 and March 9, 1985 respectively, all about one year
behind schedule. At the commissioning date of generating unit No. 3, the
reservoir water level had reached the 142.54 m level (MSL) and was high enough
to start commercial operation. The reservoir statistics are shown in Annex 3
and summarized below:

33.       The Khao Laem hydroelectric project has been operating for less than
one year and statistics are therefore sparse. Neverthelesss the prognosis is
good. After the first three months of the first wet season the reservoir (on
August 31, 1985) had risen to the 152.08 m level, and the capacity had reached
8,860 MCM. By August 31, 1985 the station had generated 269.09 GWh.
Instrumentation and Monitoring
34.       To monitor the performance of the dam and associated structures,
instrumentation is installed as follows:
Dam instrumentation             Number               Measurement function
Foundation settlement gauges           31       Foundation settlement
Hydrostatic settlement gauges          12       Rockfill and foundation
settlement
Surface settlement points              91       Surface settlement and movement

- 12 -
35.       To monitor seepage through the dam, the following instruments were
installed in and around the dam and its right abutment:
Instrumnentation              Number               Measuring function
Dye injection and seepage points       89        Locating seepage and measuring
pressure head upstream and
downstream of dam and right
abutment cut-off
Ground water observation wells         41        Ground water level at selected
locations downstream of dam
embankment and right abutment
Seepage weirs                          15        Seepage and ground water flow
downstream of the dam and from
right abutment galleries
Temperature probe                       1        Temperature measurement in
ground water observation holes
Downhole microflow meter                1        Permeability measurement in
groundwater observation holes
36.       To measure the effects of ear:hquakes and reservoir-induced seismi-
city at the damsite, two types of instrument have been installed.
-    one short period seismograph (SPS-1) at right abutment and a series
of seven micro-seismographs at selected points within the dam and
reservoir area; and
-    four strong motion accelerometers, one each at the base and crest of
the dam, one in the spillway gallery and one in the right abutment
gallery.
37.       Statistics of measurement, from these instruments which are regu-
larly monitored, are well within the expected range and are considered very
satisfactory. The grouted curtain cut-off wall (para. 17) has proved
effective in reducing to a minimum any leakage around the dam and its
abutments.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
General
38.       Energy sales during the period FY79 to FY84 incraased at an average
annual rate of 9.0%, compared with the appraisal forecast of 12.2%. As a
result of increases in electricity prices, energy conservation measures and



- 13 -
slower economic growth, energy sales grew only at an annual rate of 6.0%
during the three-year period FY80-82. However, with higher economic growth
and stable prices, energy sales increased 14.0% in FY83 and 10.2% in FY84.
39.       Severe drought in 1979 affected hydro generation, forcing EGAT to
increase thermal generation, with corresponding increases in operating
costs. The situation deteriorated further as fuel prices increased by 115% in
1979 and EGAT was not permitted to implement adequate tariff increases. In
FY80, EGAT experienced operating losses for the first time. To help EGAT
solve its liquidity problems, the Government implemented several tariff
increases which helped restore EGAT's financial health (para. 41).
40.       EGAT's comparative income statements, balance sheets, funds flow
statements and key financial indicators are presented in Annex 4.
Financial Covenants and Operating Results
41.       Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement and Section 3.02 of the Guarantee
Agreement respectively required that EGAT and the power sector as a whole
shall produce annual rates of return of not less than 2% in FY81, and not less
than 8% as of FY82 and fiscal years thereafter, on net revalued fixed assets.
Towards this end, the Government and EGAT were to implement a Plan of Action
that was agreed at the time of negotiating Loan 1852-TH (Mae Moh Lignite
Project). Under that plan, the tariffs were to be gradually adjusted to
eliminate all oil subsidies by January 1, 1981, and EGAT and the sector were
to achieve the annual rates of return mentioned above. EGAT and the Govern-
ment have so far fully complied with this plan; oil subsidies were eliminated,
and electricity tariffs were increased in two steps (October 1980 and January
1981) by 43% at EGAT's level or 35% at sector level and further increased in
April 1981 by 20% at EGAT's level or 19% at sector level. Consequently, in
FY81 EGAT earned a rate of return of 9.2% compared to the 2% covenanted for
that year.
42.       While EGAT's tariffs remained unchanged in FY82, a small reduction
(4%) was implemented in April 1983 in line with the reduction in EGAT's
operating costs as a result of decreases in oil prices. Beginning with FY82
EGAT has been required to remit to the Ministry of Finance a portion of its
net income. The level of remittances to be made by EGAT is determined by the
Ministry of Finance on a year-to-year basis. For FY82 and FY83 EGAT made
remittances of about 5% of its historical net income for those years. The
level of remittance for FY84 was increased to 10% of net income. Despite
these remittances to the Ministry of Finance and the small tariff reduction in
April 1983, EGAT was able to earn in these three fiscal years rates of return
in excess of the 8% covenanted.
43.       While the large rate increases of FY80 and FY81 hiad gone a long way
towards restoring the financial viability of EGAT and the sector, the impact
of those increases has begun to gradually decline since FY83 as a result of
both the April 1983 price reduction and the effect of inflation. The projec-
ted self-financing ratios and rates of return on revalued assets for FY85-86
are not expected to be particularly robust. A tariff study by consultants is
being carried out for the Government. The study, which is expected to be



- 14 -
completed in 1985, is reviewing the financial prospects of the sector and is
to recommend an appropriate structure and level of tariffs.
44.       The following outlines other financial covenants in the Loan
Agreement and their compliance:
(a) EGAT would review before April 30 in each of its fiscal years the
adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirement set forth in the
revenue covenant. This covenant was modified under Loan 2000-TH
(Power Subsector Project) where ECAT is required to review quarterly
the adequacy of its tariffs. ECAT has monitored its tariffs on an
almost continuous basis;
(b)  EGAT would maintain in its tariff schedules a provision for changes
in fuel costs. This provision has been reflected since August 1,
1977 in ECAT's, PEA's and MEA's tariff schedules but its imple-
mentation has sometimes suffered delays (para. 39);
(c)  EGAT's long-term debt should not exceed 1.5 times its equity, and
its short or medium-term debt should not exceed 15X of its total
debt.  ECAT has complied every year with both these covenants; and
(d) EGAT would: (i) submit to the Bank by April 1 of each year its
audited financial statements and a report of such audit; and
(ii) continue to employ qualified and experienced financial
consultants. The financial reporting requirements have been met and
EGAT continues to employ Coopers and Lybrand as financial
consultants.
VI. PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Project Achievements
45.       The hydroelectric component of the project was executed as
planned. Reservoir filling started in June 1984 and by the commissioning of
the first generating unit in November 1984, the reservoir water level was at
141.9 m (MSL) with a storage of about 4,600 MCM, which was 6.9 m above the
minimum operating level. The plant has been functioning satisfactorily and up
to tie end of May 1985, water released from the reservoir and power generation
were 363.7 MCM and 59.9 GWh. The average volume of water required per kWh of
power generation was about 6.1 cu m.

/a   Includes free-of-charge electricity supplied for street lighting.
47.       Actual growth of peak demand and energy sales in the period
FY79-1984 was slightly lower than the appraisal estimate due mainly to oil
price increases, and the economic slowdown during the period FY80-82.
Economic Re-evaluation
48.       The internal rate of return for the Khao Laem Hydroelectric Plant,
calculated using updated information (Annexes 5 and 6) is 16%; the same value
as that calculated at the time of appraisal.
Least-cost Solution
49.       The Khao Laem Hydroelectric Plant is confirmed to be a component of
EGAT's least-cost expansion program for discount rates up to 35% (Annex 7).

VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Project Identification and Preparation
50.       During 1977 the Bank became actively involved in the proposal to
construct a multipurpose hydroelectric project at the Khao Laem site and
reviewed with EGAT the consultants' feasibility study. In 1978 and 1979 the
Bank gave substantial advice on various issues related to the, by then
ongoing, procurement process. Most of this advice was acted upon by EGAT, and
the Bank's participation in this aspect of the project helped towards the
advanced state of project preparation that existed when the loan was approved.
Loan Processing
51.       The Appraisal Report for the Khao Laem Hydroelectric project (Report
2568a-TH) was produced on October 25, 1979 and the Report and Recommendations
of the President to the Executive Directors on November 6, 1979. The loan was
guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand. The Loan and Guarantee agreements were
signed on June 17, 1980. The loan became effective on September 17, 1980.
Supervision
52.       The Bank carried out four supervision missions from March 1981 to
July 1984. Most of the supervision missions were carried out in conjunction
with supervision of other projects, or with sector or appraisal missions.
Working Relationship
53.       The working relationship of the Bank with both the Government and
EGAT continued to be very good during project preparation, loan processing,
and project implementation. Recommendations made by Bank missions were mostly
accepted or given due consideration.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
54.       The construction of the Khao Laem hydroelectric plant and associated
transmission lines was executed by EGAT essentially as planned and with due
regard to ecological and environmental factors. The resettlement program and
the establishment of agricultural cooperative societies were carried out
successfully.
55.       Appraisal cost estimates for the overall project were exceeded by
about 4%. The actual plant costs were less than had been estimated at
appraisal but the civil works costs increased by about 17%. Extensive
geological investigations, which had been carried out before loan approval,
did not reveal the full extent of the karstic conditions at the dam site --
additional civil works were required to prevent seepage around the dam,
especially in the area of the right abutment. These additional works caused
delays in power station commissioning but were contained to only about 12
months because project preparation and procurement for the major items (in
particular the preliminary civil works) were well advanced by the date of loan



- 17 -
approval. Additional geological investigations prior to commencing implemen-
tation of the project would not have reduced project costs nor advanced actual
commissioning, and the decision to proceed with construction based on the
available data has proved to be a judicious one.
56.       Several substantial tariff increases were implemented by government
during 1980-81. This helped restore the financial viability of both EGAT and
the sector as a whole, and enabled EGAT to remit to the Ministry of Finance
about 5% of its historical net income for FY82 and FY83 and 0l for FY84.
However, the financial condition of both EGAT and the sector should be kept
under review as the impact of the above-mentioned tariff increases has begun
to decline.

77  Beginning with FY83, the intracompany sales of lignite by EGAT's Lignite Mine Department to EGAT's electricity operations are based on a                  I-
transfer price which approximates the economic price of lignite and is currently in excess of its cost of production.  This lignite pricing   i I
arrangement resulted in an internal profit of B 115 million in FY83 and B 176 million in FY84.
/d  Includes net adjustment of about B 773 million between EGAT and PTT regarding price escalation/price discount for supply shortfall with
respect to natural gas supplied by PTT to EGAT up to September 30, 1983.

9.        Sequence A is the least cost program for all discount rates up to
about 35%. This demonstrates that the Khao Lacm hydroelectric project is
economically justified on a program basis when the opportunity cost of capital
is below 35X in real terms.
Sensitivity Tests
10.       Sensitivity tests for variations in fuel cost have been made and the
results are shown below:
