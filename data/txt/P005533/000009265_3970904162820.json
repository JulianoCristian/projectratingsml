Through a balanced\n            package of works, the project would expand the local\n            telephone facilities in existing telephone switching\n            centers, provide telephone service for the first time to\n            about 37 rural communities and expand domestic long distance\n            and international telephone facilities. The project\n            includes: (a) provision and installation of; (i) about\n            65,000 additional lines of local exchange equipment as well\n            as; (ii) a digital international exchange of about 600\n            lines. This component also includes provision and\n            installation of; (iii) transmission equipment to carry the\n            projected traffic loads; (iv) equipment for extension of the\n            mobile telephone network; and (v) miscellaneous equipment\n            including a computer for telephone billing and other data\n            processing applications, training equipment, equipment for\n            maritime communications, teleprinters and vehicles. This\n            project further consists of; (c) the carrying out of tariff\n            studies, establishment of an economic studies unit,\n            computerization of accounting and other functions,\n            development and implementation of technical and financial\n            training programs."}, "docdt": "1985-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
