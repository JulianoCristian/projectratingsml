SULTANATE OF OMAN
SECOND TELECCoMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      The General Telecommunication Organisation (GTO)
Guarantor:     Sultanate of Oman
Amount:        US$23.0 million equivalent
Terms:         10 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project
Objectives
and
Description:   The proposed project is designed to further strengthen
GTO as an institution to enable it to manage, by 1990,
all work in the sector and, through a balanced package
of works, expand the local telephone facilities in
existing telephone switching centres, provide telephone
service for the first time to about 37 rural communities
and expand domestic long distance and international
telephone facilities to carry the additional traffic
generated by local network expansions. The project
includes:
(a)   provisioi. and installation of (i) about 65,000
additional lines of local exchange equipment with
associated cables and subscriber plant to provide
about 62,000 subscriber connections and about 460
local/long distance public call offices; ii) a
digital international exchange of about 600 lines;
(iii) transmission equipment (including satellite
communications equipment, microwave and spur links)
to carry the projected traffic loads with acceptable
congestion standards; (iv) equipment for extension
of the mobile telephone network; (v) miscellaneous
equipment including a computer for telephone billing
and other data processing applications, training
equipment, equipment for maritime communications,
teleprinters and vehicles;
(b)  construction of exchange buildings and staff
accommodation; and
(c)  carrying out of tariff studies, establishment of an
economic studies unit, computerization of accounting
and other functions, and development and
implementation of technical and financial training
programs.



- iv -
The project is expected to benefit, directly or indirectly, sll
segments of the Oman society. The project faces no unusual risks. T-me
fundamental risk that the major institutional project objective of leaving
GTO with sufficient inhouse capabilities to manage most development and
operational work in the sector by 1990 may not be met is minimal in that
regular consultation through the supervision process should lead to
identification of appropriate measures and resources needed for timely
realization of the objective. The risk that GTO's planning and
implementation capacity may not be sufficient to execute the proposed
project is likewise minimal in light of GTO's past performance and measures
included in the project to establish an economic studies unit and train GTO
staff and GTO's intention to delineate management responsibility for
planning and project implementation.

GENERAL TELECCMUNICATIONS ORGANIZATION (GTO)
SECOND TELEC M UNICATIONS PROJECT
I. THE TELECaMHUNICATIONS SECTOR
Sector Organization
1.01      The Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones regulates the
telecommunications services within the country, allocates radio frequencies
for all services and licenses private radio installation. Under the
Ministry, the General Telecommunications Organization (GTO)-a state-owned
public enterprise-is responsible for all Public telecommunications in the
country including international telephone and telegraph services. The
Civil Aviation and Defense Departments, as well as the national oil
company, Petroleum Development Oman, Ltd. operate their own
telecommunications facilities but also lease some circuits from GTO. Oman
has no telecommunications industry.
Access, Facilities, Usage, Quality of Service and Demand
1.02      As of end 1983, Oman had an average telephone density of about
1.7 telephone lines in service per 100 inhabitants which is far below the
average of 14 lines per 100 for the other Gulf countries. Telephone
service is available in the Capital areal/ and in 18 of the 41 Wilayats
(government administrative units). The Capital area with about 14 percent
of the country's population had 65 percent of the telephone lines in
service on December 31, 1983. Nonetheless, with a density of about 7.6
lines per 100 inhabitants, Muscat ranks below other major urban centers in
the Gulf region (e.g. Kuwait 11.8, Riyadh 11.5, Abu Dhabi 14.9, Dubai
15.9). About 17 percent of the lines are in the southern city of Salalah
and the remaining 18 percent serve 19 smaller settlements. There are 57
local cum long distance public call offices, of which only 9 are located
outside the Capital area and Salalah. It is estimated that only 40 percent
of the population has access to telephone service. An automated telex
service is available to 978 subscribers, 844 in the Capital area and 134 in
Salalah. An international telegraph service is available, and a domestic
service has been recently introduced.
1.03      About 49 percent of telephone lines existing at end 1983 were
residential, 19 percent were government and 32 percent business. (In the
Capital area, about 41 percent were residential, 19 percent government and
40 percent business.) There is no available data on traffic composition,
1/ The Capital area is defined as the coastal strip of about 50 km in
length stretching from Al Bustan, a little southeast of the capital
city of Muscat, to Seeb on the west.



though the percentage due to business activity is higher than the above
data might indicate due to the use of some residential lines for business
purposes. The average telephone revenue per direct exchange line (DEL) in
1983 was approximately US$1,900. This is high by international standards,
due partly to the fact that supply of new lines has been constrained, and
existing lines sometimes have multiple users. About 85 percent of this is
call revenue, divided as 42 percent local and long distance and 58 percent
international call fees. The average revenue per telex line in 1983 was
approximately US$16,400.
1.04      At end 1983, total equipped telephone switching capacity was
30,096 lines and telex exchange capacity 2,700 lines. The percentage of
lines connected to subscribers were only 71 percent and 36 percent
respectively. The low exchange fill in the case of telephone lines is due
to delays in the past in provision of cable networks and of subscriber
connections, and in the case of telex lines, is due to the fact that
adequate capacity was provided only in 1983 to meet demand up to 1988.
Ahnex I gives basic statistics on the development of facilities over the
period 1978-84. Switching equipment in the Capital area introduced under
the first Bank project (Loan 1884-OM) is of the digital type while other
equipment in the Capital area and in the interior is mostly of the crossbar
type which had been installed within the last ten years. Telex service has
been automated and electronic since 1980. The long distance domestic
network comprises coaxial cable, microwave radio and some satellite
circuits (which provide television relay facilities between Muscat and
several inland centers to enable programs to be rebroadcast by regional
transmitters). The quality of service is generally acceptable, though
there is some congestion in the urban areas due to the heavy traffic usage
of connected lines. There is no data available on the ratio of completed
to total calls. Line outage is generally acceptable and maintenance
standards reasonable, with 13 faults per 100 lines reported in May 1984,
for example, and 78 percent of the cable faults cleared within 48 hours and
83 percent of other faults within 24 hours.
1.05      As of end 1983, lines in service met only 48 percent of the total
expressed demand for telephone service (working lines plus registered
applications for new lines), the ratio being only 42 percent outside of the
Capital area and Salalah. It is expected that most of the current
unsatisfied demand in the urban areas will be met with the commissioning of
all the new exchanges under the ongoing project. Demand for telephone
lines is expected to grow by about 16 percent p.a. from 44,800 in 1983 to
about 116,000 by the year 1990. GTO has initiated, with the help of
consultants, preparation of a new Telecommunications Master Plan to the
year 2005. The preliminary report on demand which should be available by
March 1985 will establish the timing of capacity additions to urban area
exchanges under the proposed project and produce (through outside surveys)
better estimates of distribution of prospective subscribers in the new
rural centers to be served.



-3-
Sector Background and Goals
1.06      A major increase in the rate of telecommunications sector
investment has taken place since 1982. While planned investment for the
Second Five Year Development Plan period (1981-85) was US$160 million, or
2.6 percent of total planned public Investment, actual investment for the
period is now expected to be US$287 million, because the investment
originally planned was inadequate to meet the demand for service. As this
expanded investment is utilized, the contribution of telecommunications to
Oman's GDP should rise significantly (the share of telecommunications
amounted to about 0.7 percent from 1976 to 1982).
1.07      The higher level of investment is indicative of a strong commit-
ment by the Government to the role of telecommunications in development.
Broadly, country sector goals are: (i) the provision of an effective
telecommunications service as a prerequisite of economic diversification;
and (ii) the continued development of GTO as an efficient telecommunica-
tions organization with effective technical and financial management.
Specifically, over the development period 1985-1990, total telephone
exchange capacity is planned to grow at an average rate of 28 percent p.a.
to enable 95 percent of anticipated demand to be met by 1990; the
percentage of total population with access to telephone service is to be
increased to about 65 percent with the installation of exchanges and public
call offices in additional rural townships and village communities; the
connected lines per 100 population is to be increased from 1.7 (in 1983) to
7.2 in 1990; and GTO's efficiency is to be increased through improvements
in organization and management and increased staff training.
Sector Constraints
1.08      Modern telecommunications facilities were introduced in Oman only
in 1975. Expansion of telecommunications facilities has been rapid since
then. Constraints on the sector partly reflect the fact that the sector is
essentially only 10 years old. Currently, the three main sector
constraints on telecommunications development in Oman are:
(a) the capacity of GTO to plan and manage a network expansion
on the scale envisaged;
(b) the availability of data for planning purposes; and
(c) the availability of qualified Omani staff.
Bank's Role
1.09      The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector
in Oman since 1977 through two projects-a Technical Assistance Project
(Loan 985-OM for US$2.75 million) and the First Telecommunications Project
(Loan 1884-OM for US$22.0 million) . The major const-uction works under
Loan 1884-OM have been completed and final subscriber connections are
expected to be completed by 1986. Disbursements are expected to be



-4-
completed by June 1985 in line with appraisal estimates. All covenants
have been met with the exception of that concerning accounts receivable
(para 4.02). Implementation of the project has been satisfactory.
1.10      The Bank has made significant contributions towards the
achievement of Oman's sector goals through these two loans as follows:
(a)  A Telecommunications Master Plan for the period 1979-90
that represented the first systematic effort at planning
sector development and, pending the revised Plan to the
year 2005, remains the most comprehensive planning
document available to GTO;
(b)  The establishment of GTO as an efficient, basically well
managed organization through, inter alia, the provision
of experts who are assisting GTO in the design and
introduction of management systems.
(c)  The continuing technical, financial and economic advice
tendered through regular Bank supervision missions under
both loans which has been a crucial factor in the
institutional development of GTO. For example, prior to
1980 GTO worked on cash accounts, draft accounts were
more than two years late and there were no asset
records. GTO now operates a commercial accounting system
and accounts are prepared on time with draft accounts
ready within two months of year-end. GTO also regularly
prepares financial forecasts.
1.11      The Bank's participation in the proposed project Is expected to
leave GTO, by 1990, with sufficient inhouse capabilities to manage most
development and operational work in the sector. The particular areas that
need to be tackled to remove the sector constralnts on development (para.
1.08) and achieve this goal are as follow:
(a)  strengthening GTO's planning and project implementation
organization;
(b)  supporting GTO's efforts to increase the number of
trained, qualified Omanis;
(c)  creating in-house capability for economic studies and
demand forecasting, and helping GTO establish appropriate
tariff structures in the light of the foreseen expansion
of services to rural areas; and
(d)  supporting activities (including computerization) Lo
improve the flow of financial information and increase
efficiency in the finance division.

II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
2.01      GTO's telecommunications development program for the period
1985-90 comprises the following: (a) ongoing works; (b) new works under the
proposed project; and (c) preinvestments for the post 1990 program.
2.02      The total investments under the program are estimated at
US$335.4 million with a foreign exchange component of US$218.2 million.
Annex 2 indicates the annual Investments over the program period. The
financial plan for the program is expected to be as follows:

The Project
2.03      The project, to be partly financed by the Bank, provides for a
balanced and integrated development of telecommunications services in
Oman. A major thrust of the project will be the continued institutional
development of the GTO aimed at enhancing its inhouse capabilities to
manage most work in the sector by 1990. Substantial progress has been made
under the first project towards establishing GTO as a sound, well managed
institution. However, the rapid expansion of the network under the new
project will require continued institutional improvement in planning,
project implementation, administration and finance, as GTO seeks Lo
accelerate the introduction of new lines and to expand service into rural
areas. The physical component of the project provides for: (a) expansion
of local telephone facilities in urban areas and rural townships to meet 95
percent of anticipated demand by 1990; (b) extension of telephone service
to about 37 additional rural towns and village communities; and (c)
expansion of ",mestic long distance and international telephone facilities
to carry the additional traffic generated by local network expansions and
extension of service to new areas.

Project Description
2.04      The main components of the project are:
(a) provision and installation of:
(1) about 65,000 additional lines of local exchange
equipment (36,000 in the Capital area, 10,000 in
Salalah and 19,000 in the rest of Oan) vith
associated cable and subscriber plant to provide
about 62,000 subscriber connections and about 460
local/long distance public call offices;
(ii) a digital international exchange of about 600 lines;
(iii)  equipment for upgrading one existing coaxial cable
and four microwave backbone links and for providing
two new microwave links and eight spur links;
(iv) satellite communication equipment for upgrading the
earth station at Salalah, expanding the Al Hajar
earth station and establishing additional TV receive
only stations in rural areas;
(v) equipment for extension of the mobile telephone
network;
(vi) a computer for telephone billing and other data
processing applications;
(vii)  training equipment; and
(viii) other equipment (primarily, equipment for maritime
communications, teleprinters and vehicles).
(b) construction of exchange buildings and staff
accommodation; and
(c) carrying out of tariff studies, establishment of an
economic studies unit, computerization of accounting and
other functions, and development and implementation of
technical and financial training programs.

Least Cost Solution
2.05      As in the case of any country with an existing telecommunications
network, the configuration of GTO's present network limits the number of
viable alternative solutions that could be considered to achieve the
targets proposed for extending and improving service during the 1985-90
period. The proposed project is based on standard engineering and economic
techniques, with appropriate provisioning periods for various plants. GTO
introduced digital technology into its network in the Capital area and
Salalah under the ongoing project and plans to extend this to the
international switch and to switches and transmission links in the interior
areas where it is financially viable. In general, the technological
options adopted in the project are expected to result in the least cost
solution, both with regard to initial investment and recurrent long-term
maintenance and operating costs.
Project Costs and Financing
2.06      Total project cost is estimated at about US$227.8 million
including preinvestments in 1984 of US$5.1 million. The foreign exchange
component is about US$154.8 million, or 68 percent of total project cost.
Cost of the individual components are as follows:

The project base cost estimates reflect estimated December 1984 prices, and
are based on &TO's experience with contracts related to the ongoing
project, and on experience in other countries. GTO is exempt from the
payment of customs duties on imported goods and pays no taxes on local
goods and civil works.



8
2.07      An allowance of 15 percent of local costs on project components
involving civil works, and 2 percent of total base foreign costs has been
provided as physical contingencies to cover possible increases in plant
requirements. The lower allowance for foreign costs is considered adequate
as proposed quantities of telecommunications equipment are based on
detailed designs and are not expected to change significantly. The
allowance for local costs provides for variations in quantities which could
occur in civil works and amounts to about 5 percent of total base local
costs. Price contingencies for the project amount to 16.3 percent of total
base and physical contingency costs and are based on local cost increases
of 5 percent p.a. from 1985 through 1990 and foreign cost increases of 8
percent in 1985, 9 percent p.a. from 1986 through 1988, 7.5 percent in 1989
and 6.0 percent in 1990. The lower rate of 5 percent p.a. assumed for
local costs is considered reasonable on the basis of expected future local
price trends in Oman.
2.08      GTO will finance, from its internally generated resources, full
local costs of US$73-0 million and 52 percent of foreign costs (US$83.9
million). The balance of the foreign costs will be met by the proposed
Bank loan of US$23 million and a loan of US$47.9 million from the
Government. Due to the full convertibility of the Omani rial, no problems
are foreseen in the Government and GTO being able to provide the necessary
foreign funds. Assurances were obtained dluring negotiations that the
Government will make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, to provide GTO
with funds necessary for project completion (including the $47.9 million).
While the Bank's participation in the project appears nominal in terms of
funding (about 10 percent of total project costs and less than 15 percent
of foreign exchange requirement), it is viewed as substantial by the
Government in terms of technical assistance and is in line with the Bank's
role of focusing its attention on the key objectives of manpower
development and technical assistance. A similar situation prevailed in the
First Telecommunications Project wherein the Government successfully
covered the bulk of the financing requirements and utilized the Bank loan
as the principal means to acquire needed independent technical advice and
institutional development.
Procurement and Disbursement
2-09      The procurement arrangements for the project items are summarized
in Annex 4. Equipment to be financed by the Bank totalling about US$22.0
million (including contingencies) would be procured by international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. All
Bank-financed contracts estimated to cost US$1 million equivalent or more
would be subject to prior Bank review of procurement documentation; other
contracts (e.g., off the shelf items) of less than US$1.0 million
equivalent each will be subject to selective post award review. GTO has
initiated procurement action for these goods and expects to award contracts
by July 1985. Action for selection of Bank financed consultants (total
cost of about US$1.0 million) in accordance with Bank guidelines has been



-9-
initiated and all consultants are expected to be in position by
December 31, 1985. Of the items to be financed by GTO and the Sultanare of
Oman, extensions to existing equipment totalling about US$37.8 million are
expected to be procured after negotiations with existing suppliers and
goods worth about US$80.0 million through procurement procedures which
permit competition and are satisfactory.  The proposed Bank loan of US$23.0
million would be disbursed against full normal dDcumentation for:  (a) 100
percent of foreign expenditures for goods to be procured under the loan;
and (b) 100 percent of total expenditures for consultants. A Special
Account of US$4.0 million, to be maintained in dollars in a bank acceptable
to the Bank, would be established for this loan. This amount of $4.0
million represents four months' estimated disbursements during peak
disbursement period of June 1985 to December 1987. The Special Account
would be used for disbursements against all expenditures. The estimated
schedule of Bank loan disbursements is set out in Annex 5. The loan is
expected to be closed on June 30, 1991.
Project Implementation
2.10      Based on the experience it gained under the First
Telecommunications Project and with the assistance, where necessary, of
consultants specifically recruited for the purpose, GTO would implement the
project except that installations will be carried out by contractors under
GTO's supervision. The proposed implementation schedule for the major
components is set out in Annex 6.   The project is expected to be completed
by December 31, 1990. Bid invitations for procurement of Bank financed
components of the project (viz. switching equipment, external plant,
subscriber plant and transmission equipment) are expected to issue by April
1985. Issuance of these invitations has been made a condition for
effectiveness of the loan.
III.  TEE IM4PLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization and Management
3.01      GTO will be the Borrower of the Bank loan which will be
guaranteed by the Sultanate of Oman. GTO is administered by a seven-member
Board of Directors whose Chairman is the Miuister of Posts, Telegraphs and
Telephones and Deputy Chairman is the Minister of Communications. Its
other five members-all from the Government and nominated by
decree-include the executive President of GTO. According to its charter,
GTO's Boacd of Directors has authority, subject to coordination with the
Ministry of Finance on fiscal matters, to determine GTO's development
policy, investment program, annual budget, borrowings, and organization and
staffing. Tariff proposals have, however, to be approved by the Cabinet.
GTO's day to day affairs are administered by the executive President,



- 10 -
assisted by three general managers and two advisers. Its organization
(Annex 7) is similar to that of other autonomous telecommunications
organizations and comprises eleven headquarters dlvisions (general
services, adainistration, purchase and stores, personnel, public relations,
training, customer services, finance, planning and projects, telephones and
transmission) and one regional office at Salalah, mainly for maintenance
and operations, headed by a general manager. Field activities in other
areas are directly controlled from headquarters.
3.02      GTO's management is capable of effectively administering the
present organization. The decision making structure is highly centralized,
but is generally efficient. Information flow and general coordination
between divisions had in the past been weak. Some improvements have been
realized through the development of a management information system under
Loan 1884-CM. Further assistance is, however, needed to update the system
in view of the rapid network expansion envisaged under the proposed
project. Responsibility for planning and for project implementation is
expected to be split between two managers. In addition, a unit for
economic studies wculd be established under the project to prepare regular
demand forecasts, collate economic and social data and carry out surveys
including tariff studies. The finance division w-ould be strQngthened with
the addition of a chief accountant and a systems accountant to manage the
introduction of computer systems into the division, and a training
coordinator to manage the financial training program. These organization
plans were discussed during negotiations and assurances obtained from GT0
that the accountants and the training coordinator in the finance division
will be appointed by December 31, 1985.
3.03      GT0  proposes to retain consultants, under its own financing, to
assist in project implementation. Assurances were obtained that these
consultants would have qualifi-cations, experience and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank. Consultancy services for institutional
development to be financed under the proposed loan cover tariff study,
assistance in establishing an economic studies unit, assistance (including
training) in computerization of accounting functions and development of
technical and financial training courses and programs. Assurances were
obtained that GT0 would (a) appoint such consultants no later than
December 31, 1985, in accordance with Bank guidelines and with
qualifications, experience and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank
(Annex 8); (b) furnish to the Government and the Bank, no later than
December 31, 1986, the consultants' report on the tariff study and,
after an exchange of views thereon, implement such of the recommendations
as are agreed among the Government, the Bank and GT0; (c) furnish to the
Bank by December 31, 1986, action plans for the establishment of the
economic studies unit, the computerization of accounting functions and the
implementation of the training program for the financial staff and,
thereafter, carry out such plans as shall have been agreed between GT0 and
the Bank.
Staffing and Training
3.04      As of December 31, 1983, GTO's staff totalled 1,494 to operate
about 21,500 DELs. The staff ratio of 70 per 1000 DELs is high compared to



- 11 -
that in industrialized countries where the ratio ranges from 10-20, but
compares favorably with that in most developing countries (the average for
South Asia is about 100). With the expansion of lines under the present
project, the staff ratio is expected to decrease to about 50 by end 1985,
and about 26 by 1990. About 70 percent of GTO's total staff are Omanis.
Of the top management, only the manager for finance is an expatriate.
However, there is a high proportion (about 60-70 percent) of expatriate
staff in the middle management and senior technical levels and in the
finance division (Annex 9). Government intends to move as rapidly as
possible toward the total "Omanization" of GTO personnel. However,
complete elimination of the need for expatriate staff by 1990 is not
foreseen because first, the requirements for qualified staff wiJl continue
to grow as network expansion accelerates, second, such staff are not
available locally, and third, the shortage of Omanis with the basic
qualifications for training limits the potential for upgrading lower cadre
staff to technical staff status.   A realistic objective for the period to
1990 would be to develop an extended training program to upgrade as many
Omanis as possible from operator to technical staff status on the
engineering side, and to develop Omani middle management for the finance
division. The training centre in GTO provides training for technicians and
operators but practical training is limited due to lack of laboratory
facilities. The facilities are being expanded under the proposed project
to remove this limitation and also to provide training in external plant
and line techniques. GTO has been utilizing facilities in neighboring
countries and this arrangement is expected to continue in the medium term.
Some specialized telecommunications training has been, and would continue
to be, provided by equipment suppliers. Current facilities for training of
financial and administrative staff are inadequate, though some basic
courses are given by the Institute of Public Administration. A suitable
training program in these areas will be developed through the provision of
consultants funded under the proposed loan.
Accounting and Audit
3.05      GTO changed over from cash accounting to commercial, accrual
accounting in January 1981. Improvements in budget preparation processes
and procedures for control of expenditures and withdrawals, and the
establishment of cost centre controls have also been effected.
Improvements in cash management and stores control are under
implementation. Accounts computerization as part of an ultimate intcgrated
financial reporting system is now a high priority which will be addressed
under the proposed project. The quality and coverage of the external audit
is considered satisfactory. Unaudited accounts are produced within four
months and audited accounts within six months of the end of the fiscal
year, as covenanted under Loan Agreement 1884-OM. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that GTO would continue to meet the same targets
under the new project.



-12 -
Performance Indicators
3.06      GTO's implementation, operational and financial performance will
be monitored closely through a series of indicators (Annex 10). GTO will
include these indicators in its quarterly project progress reports, except
ijor the financial indicators which will be reported in annual financial
statements. Details of the items to be included in the progress reports
were discussed during negotiations. It is expected that GTO will
progressively incorporate these performance indicators into its internal
management systems.
IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONGMIC ANALYSIS
Financial Aspects
4.01      GTO's financial performance has generally been satisfactory.  It
has met the revenue covenant under the first project (Loan 1884-0OM) though
there have been no tariff increases since 1978. The rate of return on
revalued assets was about 14 percent in 1981, 21 percent in 1982 and 31
percent in 1983. Net internal cash generation was 89 percent of investment
requirements in 1983 and is projected to cover 68 percent of new investment
requirements during the period 1985 to 1990. At end 1983, GTO's current
assets were 2.9 times current liabilities. The debt service coverage rate
has been satisfactory because long-term loans accounted for only 2 percent
of total liabilities at end 1983. Despite an expected increase in debt in
the years 1984-86, debt service coverage is expected to remain satisfactory
at about 4.0.
4.02      With accounts receivable standing at 90 days of billing at end
1984, GTO was not able to fulfill the covenant under the first project to
reduce receivables to 60 days by that date. There has, however, been a
significant improvement in performance over the past year due to new
control procedures and stricter enforcement of penalties for delinquent
payers. Accounts receivable from government subscribers, however, have yet
to be appreciably reduced. Under the proposed project, assurances were
obtained from GTO that it would bring down the level of subscriber accounts
receivable to not more than 60 days billing by December 31, 1987, and
maintain it at that level thereafter. Assurances were also obtained from
the Government that it will undertake to cause all of its agencies,no later
than December 31, 1987, to pay bills for telecommunications services
rendered by GTO within two months of the billing dates. Specifics of a
program to achieve these objectives were discussed at negotiations.
4.03      GTO's future financial performance (Annex 11) is expected to be
satisfactory. The rate of return over the project period is expected to



-13 -
average about 13 percent on revalued assets. To ensure satisfactory
financial performance, including adequate cash generation to carry out the
proposed project, assurances were obtained during negotiations that GTO
will produce an annual rate of return of not less than 10 percent in fiscal
years 1985 and 1986, 11 percent in fiscal 1987, 12 percent in fiscal 1988
and 13 percent thereafter on the average current net value of its fixed
assets in operation (10 percent was required under Loan 1884-Off). In the
period from 1988 to 1990, strong cash surpluses are projected for GTO, over
and above what would be needed to finance local and foreign investment
costs. GTO and the Government are presently studying appropriate
mechanisms for the distribution of CTO's net income. During negotiations,
GTO confirmed that it will keep the Bank informed about the results of the
study and that it plans to put into place an appropriate mechanism by
December 31, 1985. GTO is reviewing the adequacy of the methods of asset
valuation which were introduced under the First Telecommunications Project
since the impact of lower inflation and lower equipment costs due to
technology improvements have probably rendered them overly conservative.
Tariffs
4.04      There have been no changes to tariff levels or structure since
1978 and no examination has been made of the present tariff structure to
determine either the costs of various services or the economic role of such
services. The current structure (Annex 12) is based upon differential
tariffs among users for connection fees and no differential vis-a-vis
rentals. Local and long-distance calls are pulse coded with different
tariffs for day and night calls. Pulse duration is inversely related to
distance. Generally tariffs are comparable to other developing countries.
It will be necessary to determine tariff structure for certain new
services. For example, tariffs for the mobile telephone system should be
set to fully reflect the economic cost of the service and should not be
cross subsidized by other services. It will be important to review the
impact of tariff structure and level in view of the expected change in real
effective demand in the later years of the project. Provision has
therefore been made under the project to finance technical assistance to
help GTO carry out a tariff study.
Benefits
4.05      Telecommunications services benefit all sectors of Oman's
economy. Compared with alternative means of communications,
telecommunications are usually more efficient in terms of capital and
energy consumption and user time. With adequate telecommunications
facilities, the level and variety of productive communications can be
increased considerably, and activities which would otherwise not be
feasible can be realized. Telecommunications can be expected to play an
increasingly significant role in Oman as concerted efforts are made to
diversify the economy and improve social services. Major examples of
economic development that will be assisted through, inter alia, a major



- 14 -
extension of the network into underserved areas are: (a) the development
of the Musandam peninsula with fisheries potential and the Buraimi area
with agricultural potential - the Sultanate of Oman has attached high
priority to strengthening the links between these remote regions and the
existing economic centres in Oman; (b) the development of social
infrastructure, particularly schools and hospitals, in the main rural
centers; (c) the location of small artisanal industries and agricultural
marketing centers in the rural areas; (d) the planned development of
industrial estates in Sohar and Salalah.
4.06      The planned increase of line installation rates under the project
will permit an increase in the proportion of demand met by services from
about 48 percent in 1983 to about 95 percent in 1990 for the country as a
whole. The provision of exchange capacity outside the Capital area (in the
20 towns/villages which already have a limited service and 37 other
towns/villages, presently without telephone service) and installation of
about 180 public call offices in the rural areas will enable service to be
extended to smaller settlements. The upgrading of the microwave
transmission network and the addition of spur routes creates the capability
for extension of services in the future, at least cost, to new
settlements. Benefits should thus be distributed far more widely than was
possible under the first project.
Return on Investment
4.07      The internal financial rate of return on the 1985-90 investment
program, based on existing tariffs, is 16 percent (Annex 13).  There is
some cross-subsidization of the rural program by the program for the
Capital area and Salalah, because of the lower projections of revenue per
DEL in the rural areas. The economic rate of return based on existing
tariffs is identical to the financial rate of return because: (a) the Omani
rial is freely convertible; (b) the trade regime is very open, with
negligible import tariffs or other restrictions; (c) there are no major
price distortions; and (d) labor is mobile and wages reflect international
market prices, largely due to the high expatriate component in the labor
force. However, considering that the value, in real terms, of existing
tariffs declines over time, the above economic rate of return understates
the value to new subscribers of the service.
Risks
4.08      The fundamental risk is that the major institutional objective of
the proposed project, i.e., to leave GTO, by 1990, with sufficient inhouse
capabilities to manage most development and operational work in the sector
(para. 1.11), may not be met. This risk is considered minimal in that
regular consultation through the supervision process should lead to
identification of appropriate measures and resources needed for timely
realization of the objective. The specific risks are that demand may have



- 15 -
been overestimated and that GTO's planning and implementation capacity may
not be sufficient to execute the proposed project. The risk of demand
overestimation is considered manageable. More detailed assessments of
demand in each of the rural areas for which a service is planned is being
undertaken as part of the proposed new Master Plan, and this information
will be available before the rural component is finalised. The risk in the
Capital area and Salalah is manageable in that additions to existing
switches can easily be delayed if demand is not forthcoming. The risk of
planning and implementation capacity constraints is also considered
manageable in the light of GTO's past performance, and in the light of the
proposal to establish an economic studies unit and split management
responsibility for planning and project implementation.
4.09      Sensitivity analysis on the economic rate of return was performed
to study the effect of: (1) a 10 percent increase in capital and in
operating costs, together with a 10 percent decrease in revenue; and (2) a
delay in the expansion of the exchanges in the Capital area and Salalah by
2 years, together with a delay by one year in the benefits of the rural
component. In the worst case, the economic rate of return based on
existing tariffs falls to no lower than 11 percent.
Environmental and Health Aspects
4.10      The project will have no significant adverse environmental or
health aspects. Telecommunications tends to promote energy conservation
and reduce environmental pollution to the extent that it can substitute for
physical transportation. In Oman, telecommunications development is
expected to have a positive effect on health delivery and emergency care,
especially in the rural areas.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Sultanate
of Oman and GTO on the following points:
(a) The Sultanate will make arrangements, satisfactory to the
Bank, to provide GTO with funds necessary for project
completion (para 2.08);
(b) The Sultanate will undertake to cause all of its
agencies, no later than December 31, 1987, to nay bills
for telecommunications services rendered by GTO within
two months of the dates that bills are sent out (para
4.02);
(c) GTO will appoint, no later than December 31, 1985,
consultants, with qualifications, experience and terms of



- 16 -
reference satisfactory to the Bank, to assist GTO in a
tariff study, establishment of an economic studies unit,
computerization of accounting functions and development
of technical and financial training courses and
programs. GTO will also appoint consultants as and when
needed for project implementation with qualifications,
experience and terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank (para 3.03);
(d) GTO will furnish to the Government and the Bank, no later
than December 31, 1986, the consultants' report on the
tariff study and, after an exchange of views thereon,
implement such of the recommendations as are agreed among
the Government, the Bank and GTO (para 3.03);
(e) GTO will furnish to the Bank, no later than December 31,
1986, action plans for the establishment of the economic
studies unit, the computerization of accounting functions
and the implementation of the training program for the
financial staff and, thereafter, carry out such plans as
shall have been agreed between GTO and the Bank (para
3.03);
(f) GTO will furnish to the Bank its unaudited financial
statements not later than four months after the close of
each fiscal year and audited financial statements, with
auditor's report, within six months of the close of every
fiscal year (para 3.05);
(g) GTO will bring down the level of subscriber accounts
receivable to not more than 60 days billing by December
31, 1987, and maintain it at that level thereafter (para
4.02);
(h) GTO will maintain its tariff level in such a way as to
assure an annual rate of return on the average current
net value of its fixed assets in operation of at least 10
percent in years 1985 and 1986, 11 percent in 1987, 12
percent in 1988 and 13 percent every year thereafter
(para 4.03);
(i) GTO will strengthen the finance division by the
appointment, no later than December 31, 1985, of two
accountants and the training coordinator (para 3.02).
5.02      It shall be a condition of loan effectiveness that GTO shall have
invited bids for procurement of the Bank-financed switching equipment,
external plant, subscriber plant and transmission equipment (para 2.10).
5.03      Subject to the above agreements, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan to GTO (under guarantee from the Sultanate of Oman) of US$23.0
million equivalent for a term of ten years including a grace period of four
and a half years.

O M A N
GENERAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ORGANIZATION (GTO)
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Terms of Reference - Consultants
A.     Tariff Study
(1) Objective - to develop principles and procedures to guide
the formulation and implementation of appropriate structures
and levels of tariffs for telecommunications services in
Oman, apply these principles to the present structure and
level, and recommend any necessary changes.
(2) Approach - The study will have economic, technical,
organizational and financial dimensions.
(3) Main Elements
a) Demand Assessment - assess the characteristics of demand
for each of the services offered, and the sensitivity of
demand to the orices which mlght be charged, with a view
to determining the cost to consumers of doing without a
service where demand cannot be fully met and the
consumers whose demand is the least price elastic. The
work would require a review of existing records of
service applications, service quality etc, to be
supplemented by appropriately designed sample surveys;
b) Usage - carry out a complete review of usage data
including, inter alia, the business (including
Government) and residential usage patterns, traffic and
traffic congestion analyses, call rate analyses and
local, long distance and international revenue analyses.
Particular emphasis should be placed upon peak call
use. International traffic patterns should be analyzed
as international revenues make up about 50% of GTO's
total call revenue;
c) National Development and Social Considerations - a
discussion and analysis linking national economic
development plans and the interactive role of tariffs
should be made. In particular these should focus upon
tariff policies as they relate to long distance



- 26 -
ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 5
charges. Consultants should assess basis for charging
various groups of services/consumers e.g., PCOs, rural
consumers, mobile systems, to initially stimulate
socially desirable use of the service or, in case of
mobile, recover full costs;
d)  Financial Implication - a financial impact analysis
should be made linking tariff policy and the resource
mobilization capabilities of the telecommunications
sector. Consultants should ensure that tariff policy
procedures and recommendations recognize the maintenance
of GTO's financial viability to continue its operations
and adequately finance its expansion while at the same
time recognizing Oman's need for resource mobilization.
Specifically, international inpayments and outpayments
control and impact should be examined;
e) Organization - the consultants should review the
organizational aspects of tariff reviews, establishment
and membership of a review committee and the role of the
economic studies unit to be established in GTO. The
consultants should also review timing and methodology
for reviewing, obtaining and implementing tariff
increases.
(4) Results - The study should result in a recommended set of tariff
policy guidelines, together with an analysis of the relevant data
necessary as a precursor to tariff decisions. The study should also
result in a set of alternative prices for various services,
identifying the impact of these upon revenue and financial
performance of GTO. Recommendations should also be made regarding
the organizational requirements for a system to review tariffs on a
systematic and regular *-asis.
(5) Requirements - an economist/team leader, a financial analyst
and an engineer for approximately twelve months total. The
team leader should have had prior experience in carrying out
a similar study, and all three consultants should have had some
telecommunications sector exposure. The counterpart GTO
divisions would be Planning and Projects, Finance and the newly
to be formed Economic Studies unit. The consultants
should be appointed no later than December 31, 1985.
B.     Economic Studies
(1) Purpose - determination of ways and means within GTO to provide
information on present and future demand trends for telecommunica-
tions services on a regular basis; increase the economic input
into future investment planning.



- 27 -
ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 5
(2) Approach - establishment of an economic studies
unit to collect and analyse relevant information prepared by
other agencies, in Oman and overseas, and to promote studies
and surveys to be undertaken by GTO staff or GTO consultants as
necessary.
(3) Main Elements - a consultant to be hired to advise GTO on the
organization of the unit and to carry out the following tasks:
a) determline appropriate forecasting method(s) to be
employed;
b) determine appropriate timetable for review of methods
and for periodic production of demand forecasts to a
suitable degree of disaggregation;
c) determine system for collecting, collating, analysing
relevant external data sources;
d) determine requirements for adhoc studies and surveys to
be promoted by the unit;
e) determine appropriate staffing and training for unit,
and appropriate organizational arrangement, reporting
formats and relationship with other divisions of GTO.
(4) Requirements - a consultant will be required for a period of
6 months, during which he/she would work with a GTO
counterpart, identified in advance. The consultant should
ideally be an economist with sector experience. The consultant
should be appointed no later than December 31, 1985, to allow
the unit to follow and develop the work of the revised Master
Plan studies, and of the proposed tariff studies.
C.     Computerisation
(1) Purpose - to assess and implement a suitable program for the
improvement of the finance division operations.
(2) Approach - in the light of GTO's decision to purchase a
central computer facility, and in the light of the increase
in the volume of accounting transactions to be brought about
by the planned increase in network and ir numbers of subscribers,
there exists a potential opportunity for increasing the efficiency
and effectiveness of the finance division.
(3) Main Elements - consultants to be hired by GTO to attend to
the following areas. The precise tasks and the length of time
required would depend, inter alia, on the assistance to be
provided by the chosen supplier of computer hardware.

Page 4 of 5
a) review of data processing needs of finance division, in
particular of the various accounting functions;
b) review provision for computerization of billing and
collection in the context of the hardware to be
purchased, advise on appropriate software for these
applications;
c) devise strategy for computerisation of the division's
functions, with particular reference to software and
communication between the division and the rest of GTO;
d) advise a role of personal computers, in particular with
regard to financial management information systems and
financial modelling;
e) supervise implementation of system chosen in
consultation with GTO;
f) provide in-house and external training, as appropriate,
for operating staff in the finance division.
(4) Requirements - consultants' services for up to 2 person
years will be needed for a program of this importance and
magnitude, of which 6 person months would be required for
reviewing requirements and proposing action plans, 6 person
months for the supervision of the installation of the
chosen system, and up to 1 person year for training. The
key counterpart personnel would be the systems accountant to
be appointed by GTO. The early appointment of a suitably
qualified and experienced person might also lead to a
reduction in the consultency requirement. The work would
start once the central computer had been procured, and thus
should be initiated by December 31, 1985.
D.     Training
(1) Purpose - secure an increase in the quantity and quality of
training available to technical, financial and
administrative staff to help GTO cope with system expansion
and to increase the rate of Omanisation" of key posts;
(2) Approach - develop capacity and capability of GTO's in-house
training facility and develop new courses and course
material; determine requirements for external training;

Fixed Assets:  The increase in gross fixed assets is related to the transfer
from work-in-progress as assets become revenue generating. On average,
workin-progress is transferred over two succeeding years. Assets are
valued at historical cost in the accounts.

Asset Revaluation  -  For the purposes of calculating the rate of return, assets
are revalued at 4.5% per annum. The full calculation is in
the project file. The revaluation reflects the impact on
asset values of inflation which is expected to average 5.5%
per annum to 1990 (local price inflation is expected to be 5%
per annum and foreign price inflation is expected to be 6% per
annum), and the impact of technological improvements and economies
of scale in telecommunications assets. As this latter is currentl
expected to reduce asset costs on average 4% per annum, the
revaluation factor is considered to be conservative. It will
reviewed in the course of the second project.

GENERAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ORGANIZATION (GTO)
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investment
1.          Investments on which the rate of return is calculated are those
new works contained in the second telecommunications project 1985-90.
2.          The benefit period extended from 1986 to 2010, when on average
the equipment provided under the project is expected to have substantially
completed its useful life.
3.          Capital expenditure is as per the 1985-90 project, with all
price contingencies excluded. Nb residual asset values are taken into
account as by the year 2010 their discounted real value will be
negligible. Incremental revenues are based on the expected additional
telephone subscribers and the traffic increase they are expected to bring
about. No provision has been made for incremental telex revenues as no new
corresponding investment is envisaged. Incremental operating costs
excluding depreciation and interest are based on the additional staff,
costs and assets required to meet the increased traffic. All revenues and
operating costs have been deflated by 5% per annum, the expected rate of
inflation to bring them to the 1984 level to be comparable with capital
expenditure.
4.          A summary of project's cost and benefit streams at 1984 prices
is given (in RO million) below as follows:
Capital     Operating                Net
Year        Expenditure        Cost    Revenues  Benefits
1984             1.7            -           -       -1.7
1985             9.7             -          -       -9.7
1986            23.6           1.6        3.3      -21.9
1987            19.2           2.0        4.4      -16.8
1988             7.5           5.5       12.2       -0.8
1989             3.4           8.0       17.9        6.5
1990             1.6         10.2        22.9       11.1

5.          The internal economic rate of return for the above net benefits
stream is 16%. Assuming that new subscribers are prepared to pay the same
tariff in real terms as existing subscribers, a portion of consumer surplus
can be estimated. The economic rate of return with constant real tariffs
is calculated at 29 percent. No shadow pricing is necessary because of the
openness of the Oman economy, and the fact that market prices reflect
opportunity costs for most goods and services.
6.          A sensitivity analysis was performed on the economic rate of
return with the following results:
Rate of Return
(Z)
a)  10% increase In capital expenditures            15
b)  10. increase in operating costs                 15
c)  10% decrease in revenues                        13
d)  Combination of all factors                      11
7.          Additional tests were carried out on the financial rate of
return to measure the impact on project viability of particular risks
associated with this project as follows:
Rate of Return
,Z)
a) One year delay in benefits of
rural component                              14
b) One year delay of Capital area

c) Two years delay of Capital area
and Salalah program                          14
