work in the sector by 1990.  Through a balanced\n            package of works, the project would expand the local\n            telephone facilities in existing telephone switching\n            centers, provide telephone service for the first time to\n            about 37 rural communities and expand domestic long distance\n            and international telephone facilities.  The project\n            includes: (a) provision and installation of; (i) about\n            65,000 additional lines of local exchange equipment  as well\n            as; (ii) a digital international exchange of about 600\n            lines.  This component also includes provision and\n            installation of; (iii) transmission equipment to carry the\n            projected traffic loads; (iv) equipment for extension of the\n            mobile telephone network; and (v) miscellaneous equipment\n            including a computer for telephone billing and other data\n            processing applications, training equipment, equipment for\n            maritime communications, teleprinters and vehicles.
