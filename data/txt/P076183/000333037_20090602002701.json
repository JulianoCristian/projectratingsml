were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is crucial\n            to have a rigorous monitoring and evaluation plan for all\n            project activities to detect obstacles at early stages and\n            act quickly to prevent worsening of the problem and delay in\n            implementation. Furthermore, it is important to regularly\n            evaluate the quality of Technical Assistance (TA)\n            activities. Throughout the implementation of this project,\n            there was no solid and systematic evaluation of the\n            effectiveness and relevance of TA activities except for\n            contractors' final reports which contained general\n            self-assessment on their TA activities. Keeping decision\n            makers informed of project progress is critical for\n            appropriate readjustment of project scope and activities.\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) plays a key role in this\n            as it enables the effective collection and dissemination of\n            data and information to a wider group, including\n            beneficiaries. As seen with the diminished role of the\n            steering committee, the absence of M&E resulted in\n            missed opportunities to effectively guide the project as the\n            implementation environment evolved. Project re-structuring\n            should be considered at any time during project\n            implementation if substantial changes are being proposed by\n            the Borrower or additional donor resources become available\n            in an evolving environment. This project should have been\n            considered for restructuring to reflect a changing\n            government approach to reform and to re-align new objectives\n            with revised outcome indicators."}, "docdt": "2009-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
