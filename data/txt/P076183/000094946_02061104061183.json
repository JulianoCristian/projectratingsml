Higher\n            Education Learning and Innovation Project, is to assist in\n            the preparation of a higher education reform strategy, and\n            to pilot initial phases of its implementation, which, if\n            successful, would prod the development of a second,\n            medium-term phase of the reform, likely to require donor\n            support, and further Bank lending. Three main components\n            will support: 1) governance, by developing a strategy and\n            medium-term development plan for the education sector, and a\n            legislative and institutional framework, promoting improved\n            management. Activities include a participatory higher\n            education reform development, and the preparation of\n            medium-term investment program, comprising as well capacity\n            building to the Ministry of Higher Education staff, and,\n            technical training to the two universities involved, for\n            their management, and accountability assumption; 2)\n            financing of the redesign process of the universities'\n            budget structures, and procedures, to facilitate flexible\n            allocation of resources, and efficient expenditures.\n            Moreover, assistance for the development of equitable\n            funding mechanisms for universities will be provided, to\n            increase girls' education, and attendance by diverse\n            income-level groups. Information management systems, and\n            related training will be adapted to provide institutional\n            management services; and, 3) quality of education, by\n            upgrading the faculty in selected disciplines (medicine,\n            education, and commerce), and piloting strategic\n            initiatives, such as evaluation methods, and teaching\n            skills, educational programs redesign, and an information\n            communications technology network linking central, and\n            faculty libraries via intranet access to Internet resources."}, "docdt": "2002-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
