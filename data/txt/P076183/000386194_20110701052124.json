Higher Education\n            Enhancement Project for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low\n            to negligible, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Higher Education Learning and\n            Innovation Project for Yemen were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was highly unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Higher\n            Education Project for Jordan were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the introduction of a widely adopted change model\n            needs to be preceded by sufficient sector analytic work to\n            create an appreciation of the complexities (implications) of\n            the changes and of the likely sources of resistance. Such\n            analysis could help determine the parts of the model that\n            are appropriate to the context, and the pace of adoption.\n            Efforts to improve the quality of higher education need to\n            improve student learning outcomes. Standard assessment of\n            student achievement in higher education is challenging, both\n            in a technical and a political sense. Moves in that\n            direction have already begun in Egypt and Jordan.\n            Restructuring higher education courses and programs and\n            ensuring appropriate private sector participation in\n            decision-making are not in themselves sufficient to ensure\n            that reforms will result in more employable graduates.\n            Higher education systems need to systematically monitor the\n            labor market relevance of their offerings and the success of\n            their graduates."}, "docdt": "2011-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
