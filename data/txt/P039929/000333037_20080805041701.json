{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Social Investment Fund\n            and Supplemental Emergency Earthquake Rehabilitation Project\n            for Georgia were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: all aspects\n            of each micro-project, including its size, require a very\n            careful consideration; also, necessary trade-offs should be\n            taken into account, such as the objective of the\n            micro-project, its technical aspect and its cost. In several\n            cases, mostly related to rural school buildings, it was\n            observed that the size exceeded the needs of the current\n            number of students. Those schools were built in early 1950s\n            and 1960s and used to serve a much bigger number of\n            students. The student population has decreased over time\n            because of out migration and declining fertility. In the\n            cases of such micro-projects, the communities and Georgia\n            Social Investment Fund (GSIF) were facing a dilemma whether\n            to refurbish only a part of the building or entire building.\n            Whenever possible, only parts of the buildings were\n            refurbished, but with careful consideration concerning the\n            quality of learning environment and technical feasibility.\n            However, in some cases, this type of work (particularly roof\n            repairs) could not be done only partially. The percentage of\n            counterpart funds for this type of micro-projects should be\n            estimated carefully, taking into account the particular\n            circumstances of the country and the ability to contribute.\n            In this project, the lack of timely counterpart funds,\n            either from the community side (due to low ownership), or\n            from the government side (caused by the overall poor\n            macroeconomic situation), generated delays in\n            implementation, dissatisfaction among the contractors and\n            community members, or tended to temporarily shift the focus\n            from the poor to better-off communities. Smaller community\n            contribution would probably be more appropriate for a\n            country such as Georgia, where poverty is widespread\n            especially in the rural areas."}, "docdt": "2008-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
