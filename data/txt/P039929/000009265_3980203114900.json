to basic social and economic\n            services on a sustainable basis through existing\n            infrastructure. GSIF mobilizes public and private resources\n            and channels them through small investments. The\n            project's secondary objectives are to a) strengthen the\n            capacity of private, small-scale contractors and build the\n            capacity of communities; b) generate employment; and c)\n            build greater capacity for policymakers to monitor and\n            analyze poverty trends. The project has four components: 1)\n            Rehabilitating small-scale infrastructure, about 400\n            microprojects, including civil works improving water supply,\n            sanitation, solid waste management; and rehabilitating local\n            clinics, primary schools, and feeder roads; 2) Providing\n            equipment, vehicles, salaries, operating costs, training,\n            technical assistance; and financing for monitoring and\n            evaluating implementation; 3) Building the capacity of small\n            contractors to prepare bids and execute work contracts;\n            providing training and technical assistance to communities;\n            financing contracts with individuals, firms, and\n            nongovernmental organizations to provide others with\n            technical assistance; and funding regional launch workshops;\n            and 4) Financially supporting the statistics\n            department's (SDS) budget for conducting living\n            standards monitoring surveys (LSM); and offering it\n            technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1997-11-11T00:00:00Z"}
