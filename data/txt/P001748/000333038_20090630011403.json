development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) strong commitment of Government\n            is a major condition for the successful and timely\n            implementation of a program. Without Government support,\n            difficult reforms would be delayed or never implemented; 2)\n            to accelerate reforms, technical assistance should be\n            associated to a development policy loan which is able to\n            provide a high leverage to the technical assistance support;\n            3) the ownership of Government and different beneficiaries,\n            from preparation to implementation, helps increase the\n            impact of the project; 4) the Government, the implementation\n            unit and the World Bank need to share and agree on the\n            management of the monitoring and evaluation system of the\n            project from its launching; and 5) the location of a member\n            of the project team and preferably the Task Team Leader\n            (TTL) in the field contributes strongly to improving the\n            policy dialogue as well as the efficiency and timely\n            implementation of the project."}, "docdt": "2008-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
