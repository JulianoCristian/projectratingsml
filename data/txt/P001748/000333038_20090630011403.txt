F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the proposed project is to improve the soundness, performance and
competitiveness of the financial sector and enable it to support broad-based private sector
growth. This will be accomplished by (a) restructuring and privatizing viable state-owned
banks, and strengthening non-bank financial institutions, including social security and


                                                ii

retirement funds; (b) enhancing the capacity of financial institutions through training
financed on a cost-sharing basis; (c) strengthening microfinance institutions and the
Government Microfinance Supervisory Agency; and (d) helping to improve the legal and
regulatory environment affecting the financial sector.

  The government is looking to the privatization of financial institutions as a means of
improving their governance and the overall efficiency of the financial sector. The project
would provide technical assistance (TA) to help the government implement a
restructuring and privatization program which is at the core of its economic reforms
supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Achievement of
these reforms would contribute to the fulfillment of the government's macroeconomic
stability objectives.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal


1.      Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita income
estimated at about US$260 in 1997. Access to key social services, notably education,
basic health, potable water, sanitation is limited. Adult illiteracy is estimated at 68
percent, primary school enrollment rates are among the lowest in the world and the ratios
of population per physician and per nurse are below the standard World Health
Organization norms for Africa.

2.      In the late 1980s, the Government of Mali (GoM) began to change its economic
strategy from a centrally planned system towards a market-based approach, a process
which it deepened after the devaluation of the FCFA in 1994. The adjustment process
began to show results, and in 1997, the economy grew by 6.7 percent in real terms,
compared with 2.3 percent in 1994. Average consumer prices declined by 0.7 percent
compared to an increase of 24.8 percent in 1994. Efforts to improve revenue collection
and restrain expenditures resulted in significant decrease in the overall budget deficit
from 13.7 percent of GDP in 1994 to 7.8 percent in 1997. In the external sector, the
current account deficit, excluding official transfers, was reduced from 16.9 percent of
GDP in 1994 to 9.3 percent in 1997.

3.      The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Mali discussed by the World Bank
Board in 1998 sought to support the Government's reform program and gave priority to
medium term improvement in the Government budgetary performance and the promotion
of private sector growth through an increase in the availability of diversified financial
products. The project is fully consistent with the CAS objectives. The project would help
reduce macroeconomic risks associated with poor financial performance of banks and
non-bank financial institutions and encourage the development of financial intermediaries
that are responsive to private sector needs. The project was also in line with the
Government's strategy which aimed to create a more enabling environment for private
sector by improving the legal framework; strengthening microfinance; restructuring and
privatizing bank and non-bank financial institutions, and improving financial
intermediation by supporting the local branch of the regional stock exchange.

4.      In 2001, Mali's financial sector consisted of: (i) nine banks of which seven are
commercial banks, one agriculture bank and one housing bank; (ii) non-bank financial
institutions (NBFIs) that include five insurance companies, a credit institution (Crédit
Initiative) and a pension system comprised of a social security and pension fund for
private sector employees (Institut National de Prévoyance Sociale - INPS) and another
for civil servants (Caisse de Retraite du Mali - CRM); and (iii) a significant number of
micro-finance institutions supported mostly by external donors or non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs).

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.      The objective of the proposed project is to improve the soundness, performance
and competitiveness of the financial sector and enable it to support broad-based private
sector growth. This will be accomplished by: (a) restructuring and privatizing viable
state-owned banks, and strengthening non-bank financial institutions, including social
security and retirement funds; (b) enhancing the capacity of financial institutions through
training financed on a cost-sharing basis; (c) strengthening microfinance institutions and
the Government Microfinance Supervisory Agency; and (d) helping to improve the legal
and regulatory environment affecting the financial sector. The project would provide
technical assistance (TA) to help the government implement a restructuring and
privatization program which is at the core of its economic reforms supported by the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

6.      The project fits into World Bank Strategy by strengthening performance of
financial institutions and which would enable it to respond to private sector needs. The
project is also consistent with Government strategy which aimed, among others, at
creating a competitive business environment including credit facilities to support the
private sector.

7.      Project benefits would be measured through an assessment of the following:

      ·   Financial institutions comply with key prudential ratios (capital adequacy, risk
          concentration and liquidity) and substantially reduce the level of non-
          performing loans from the present level (industry-average) of 23 percent to 18
          percent by the second, 15 percent the third year and 10 percent by the end of the
          project;
      ·   Financial intermediation has been broadened by the end of the project with the
          introduction and development of new instruments as CD's, leasing and venture
          capital;
      ·   Treasury deposits will be placed with banks following a competitive basis
          process; and
      ·   Reduced Government ownership in the banking sector

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
        Indicators, and reasons/justification.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

8.      The project was expected to restore the viability of the banks, microfinance
institutions, insurance companies, and the social security and pension funds by
strengthening their institutional and operational activities. In this context, the associations
of banks, insurance companies and microfinance institutions were to receive capacity
building and benefit from project support.       The project also aimed to develop the



                                             2

institutional and operational capacity of Government bodies in charge of supervision
/control of insurance companies and microfinance institutions thus benefiting the clients
of microfinance institutions, which are generally small, and those of insurance
companies. The soundness of financial institutions would improve through enhanced
supervision, which would benefit the depositors. By addressing the constraints to the
legal framework for the financial sector, the project was designed to increase financial
intermediation and improve services of the banking sector which would ultimately
benefit the clients of banks as well as increase their number.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

9.      The project would include five components: (a) the restructuring and privatization
of the banking sector; (b) the strengthening of non-bank financial institutions including
the social security and retirement funds; (c) the strengthening of the microfinance sector;
(d) the improvement of the legal and regulatory framework affecting financial
institutions; and (e) the strengthening of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, so as to
enable it to formulate and implement economic and financial sector policies.

Component 1: Restructuring and privatization of the Commercial Banking Sector
                (US$8.8 million)

10.     At the start of the project, the banking sector in Mali was characterized by
substantial Government control or ownership; only three banks of the nine were fully
private. As part of its financial sector development strategy, the Government committed
to disengage from the sector in order to improve governance and efficiency, and promote
competition.

11.     For this purpose, under this component, the project financed: (a) the assistance of
legal advisors and privatization advisors to the Government to: evaluate the banks to be
privatized, design a privatization strategy, determine the most appropriate privatization
method, establish the list of potential investors, prepare the prospectus and bidding
documents; assist in the evaluation of bids and selection of investors; and close on the
transaction; (b) specialized bank diagnostics or audits, as needed, to support the
Government in its efforts to restructure and or privatize banks by conducting customized
analyses of selected banks prior to privatization; and (c) provide, on a cost-sharing basis,
consultant services to help banks prepare strategic business development plans, identify
needs for staff training, and implement a training program.

Assistance to the Malian Professional Bankers Association

12.     The support to the Association Professionnelle des Banques et Etablissements
Financiers (APBEF) was intended to enable it to provide, inter alia, advice and guidance
to banks and other members with respect to banking regulations and concerns common to
the industry, promote information exchange in the financial sector, and coordinate -the
implementation of activities of interest to all members. APBEF's role in facilitating
training programs for staff of commercial banks has become increasingly important as a
means to reinforce prudential regulations and supervision by the Commission Bancaire.


                                              3

The project would finance through a cost-sharing basis 50 percent paid by the
beneficiaries and 50 percent by the Government through the project): (a) consultants to
help design and implement the training of banks and non-bank financial institutions; (b)
the refurbishing of the local training center and some equipment for the APBEF; (c) the
consultancy and advisory services to design and implement modem domestic interbank
settlement system (with the Government playing only a catalytic role); and (d) training
materials.

Assistance for Capital Markets Development

13.     Although the BRVM (Regional Stock Exchange) has been established at the
regional level with local branches in each of the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU) member countries, public listings and stock market activities were still
extremely limited. This is due in part to insufficient awareness of stock market activities
and to limited staff skills of the local branches of the BRVM and of the brokerage firm.
These limitations apply also to the information available to the investor community,
where individual and institutional investors have yet to learn how a stock market operates
and what can be accomplished through it.

14.     To facilitate the privatization of financial institutions, the project would provide
financial support to the local branch of the BRVM and to the local broker (SGI) to raise
awareness to the rules of the stock market, as well as to relevant regulations and policies.
The project would also provide financial support for training of staff of the local branches
of the BRVM, local SGI as well as the general public.

15.     The results expected from implementation of the banking component are: the
restructuring of all banks to ensure that they meet the prudential requirements of the
Central Banque of West African States (Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de
l'Ouest (BCEAO)) and the privatization of those controlled by the Government; the
improvement of their services and efficiency through training of their personnel; and the
improvement of savings mobilization and provision of credit to the economy. The results
expected from implementation of the sub-component on the professional bankers
association component is the improved coordination of justified concerns of the banking
industry and dissemination of information within the financial sector, improvement of the
skill-level and professionalism in the financial industry and the facilitation of joint and
industry-wide product-development efforts, such as a well functioning local payment
system. The results expected from implementation of the sub-component on capital
market development are the facilitation of the privatization of financial institutions and a
well functioning local capital market that allows efficient mobilization of risk- and/or
long-term resources necessary to meet the needs of the individual and institutional
investors and consumers.

Component 2 - The Strengthening of Non-Bank Financial Institutions Including the
                 Social Security and Retirement Funds (US$3.7 million)

16.     The non-bank financial institutions include the social security INPS and the civil
servants retirement fund CRM and five private insurance companies (Caisse Nationale


                                              4

d'Assurance et Réassurance (CNAR)), the SUTNBNYUMAN company, LAFIA,
COLINA a subsidiary of the same company in Abidjan and Société Nouvelle
d' Assurance Vie (SONA VIE). According to the data collected by the GRSF, INPS has
an excess of liquidity: resources, which grew from about FCFA 12 billion in 1994 to
about FCFA 18 billion in 1996, while expenses grew from FCFA 10 to 15 billion. On the
other hand, CRM has a structural deficit, which grew from FCFA 1.2 billion in 1994 to
FCFA 3.1 billion in 1997. Projections show that neither CRM nor INPS is viable in the
long term. A 1996 study has shown that the former is plagued with deficits that go back
to the early1980s, while the financial holdings of the latter would be able to provide only
about a year and a third of pension expenditures, even though it has operated with annual
surpluses. Under current conditions, their future operations could put a substantial strain
on the Government budgetary resources.          Collateral Deposit Company (CDC) is
characterized by lack of transparency in its financial management and lacks operational
autonomy.

17.     Regarding the insurance sector, 1997 data show that, of the five insurance
companies surveyed by the GRSF, three are posting losses varying from FCFA 40
million to 140 million. Figures for the year1998 supplied by the Insurance Division of the
Ministry of Economy and Finance indicate that operations were profitable for all
companies, largely due to the exceptionally low rate of claims experienced on automobile
insurance business. Other shortcomings of these companies identified by a GRSF review
are: (a) the narrowness of their product base, which is made almost exclusively of car
insurance policies; as a result, their turnover amounts to about FCFA 8 billion only, as
compared to FCFA 100 billion in Côte d'Ivoire, FCFA 30 billion in Senegal and FCFA
12 billion in Burkina Faso; and (b) weak management resulting in important arrears on
the payment of insurance policies, insufficient technical reserves, and substantial losses
to the point that the net-worth of some companies is negative.

18.     The project would finance: (a) financial and institutional audits of INPS, CRM
and CDC to identify immediate measures to improve their management and limit their
losses and improve their accounting and procedures with a view to adequately prepare
actuarial studies for INPS and CRM; (b)financial and institutional audits and to prepare
action plans for insurance companies to address their shortcomings and advisory services
to promote their participation in the integrated financial sector development and capital
market; (c) management information systems and training of staff necessary to improve
the efficiency of INPS, CRM, and CDC; (d) technical assistance to implement the
recommendations of the actuarial studies; and (e) technical assistance to help insurance
companies improve their management and prepare their strategic development plans.

19.     The results expected from the implementation of this component are: (a) with
regard to the existing social security and retirement funds: the identification, through, a
financial and institutional audit, of immediate actions needed to improve their
management and financial performance; the completion of actuarial studies and the
identification of measures to be taken to ensure their long-term viability; and (b) with
regard to other institutions (insurance companies and CDC): the preparation of conditions
to ensure long-term viability and sustainable development of their activities through



                                             5

improvement of their managerial capacities, improved portfolio management, and
portfolio diversification.


Component 3 - Strengthening of the Microfinance Sector (US$20 million)

20.     The microfinance sector in Mali consists of about 30 formal Microfinance
Institutions (MFIs) with some 500 branches operating in both urban and rural areas,
including some of the most remote regions in the country.

21.     As of December 31, 1998, 24 of the largest MFIs had a total clientele of about
300,000 individuals, compared to about 230,000 in 1997. Women accounted for nearly
half of the clients. Microfinance activity has grown rapidly in recent years. Total loans
outstanding increased from FCFA 9.4 billion (approximately US$15.8 million) in 1997 to
FCFA 11.7 billion FCFA (US$19.6 million) in 1998, an increase of 24 percent. In 1998,
microfinance institutions mobilized FCFA 7.9 billion (US$13.2 million), representing a
22 percent increase over the previous year. The average loan size is FCFA 77,000
(US$117).

22.     A 1997 World Bank/GTZ review indicated that although most microfinance
institutions in Mali are experiencing rapid growth and posting high repayment rates
averaging 95 percent, the vast majority of institutions are highly dependent on donor
funding and are far from being financially sustainable. Most MFIs are characterized by
weak institutional capacity, reflected in inadequate accounting and monitoring
procedures, lack of management information systems, and poor financial management
skills. Other key issues in the microfinance sector include: (a) the lack of an appropriate
legal and regulatory framework, particularly with regard to non-mutualist institutions;
and (b) inadequate Government capacity to supervise a rapidly growing number of
microfinance institutions, in such a manner that does not hinder their development.
However, there is a consensus that the key constraint to the development of an efficient
microfinance sector in Mali is the limited capacity of MFI management.

23.     In this context, the project would focus on institution building within the
microfinance sector. It will finance technical assistance, consultancy services, and
equipment to: (a) the Government microfinance supervisory unit, to improve its capacity
to supervise and monitor MFIs; (b) to the newly created Professional Association of
Microfinance Institutions (APIM), to assist it in becoming a sustainable advocacy group
for MFIs through information sharing, dissemination of best practices, and networking;
(c) to the National Consultative Group for Microfinance to ensure coordination among
various stakeholders and monitor implementation of a supportive microfinance policy;
and (d) to provide training to microfinance institutions with the aim of improving their
financial and institutional performance.

24.     The component would contribute to the improved institutional viability of MFIs
in Mali, resulting in their capacity to deliver financial services to a large number of the
poor on a financially sustainable and long-term basis. The improved financial
performance of MFIs may also increase their ability to obtain commercial sources of


                                             6

funding, leading to closer linkages between formal and informal financial institutions,
and thus to a more integrated financial sector.



Component 4 - Legal and Regulatory Support for Financial Sector (US$3.5 million)

25.     This project sub-component finances consultancy studies and technical assistance
aimed at helping the Government identify in the regulatory framework constraints
impeding the development of financial sector operations and new financial instruments or
institutions, and effectively implement measures to remove them.

26.     This component will support better understanding of the legal requirements for
establishing valid loan/credit documents by the staff of financial entities (banks, MFIs
and others); increase the access to credit facilities for Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs) and potential rural clients; reduce the instances of intentional non-repayment of
loans/credits by SMEs and private clientele of financial institutions; enhance competition;
reduce fraud within the financial community and the judiciary, and reduce credit loss due
to unreliable registers (commerce, land title and mining).

27.     Specifically, the project will finance training for selected staff of financial
institutions, and of the legal profession, in legal matters relevant to financial transactions.
The project will also finance studies to identify weaknesses in the interface between the
banking and the judicial sectors, and propose solutions.

28.     Furthermore, the elaboration, printing and distribution of forms required for the
implementation of valid financial transactions under the regional Uniform Acts of the
Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) will be
financed, and studies to propose means to better serve SMEs and rural clientele.

29.     In particular, the following activities will be financed under the project:

* training for all staff in financial institutions on the changes brought about by the
  OHADA legislation - delivered according to the field of activity of staff;

* a study will define the regulation required to include a trained legal expert among the
  staff of every financial institution receiving training, in order to supervise and follow up
  on the application of the rules;

* studies will be carried out outlining the feasibility of: (a) establishing Islamic banking
  institutions; (b) acceptable credit approval processes, complying with all regional
  guidelines and laws, applicable to credit institutions according to loan/credit category;
  (c) establishing a mutual repayment conditionality among small business borrowers; (d)
  establishing a "quasi security" for loans/credits based on traditional values and socially
  accepted norms; (e) recruiting decentralized Government staff as agents for the
  financial institutions in collecting savings and dispensing loans/credits and identifying
  the legal requirements for such recruitment; (f) keeping accounts for selected entities in
  local languages; and (g) identifying changes required in the current regulatory or legal


                                               7

  framework, if any, to facilitate leasing; and carrying out tests of the recommendations
  of all such studies on a pilot basis;

* a review of existing anti-trust and unfair competition regulations, an assessment of their
  compatibility with the Actes Uniformes of OHADA, a proposal of the statutes for an 35
  independent anti-trust regulatory body, the establishment of such a body, and the
  training of its staff;

* a review of the needs of the Cour de Comptes to function efficiently, the establishment
  of an action plan to answer such needs and to execute said plan;

* reorganization of the court-appointed legal experts - allowing access to court only for
  members of organized professional associations; and

* assessment of the efficiency, reliability and conformity with the law of the commercial,
  land title and mining registries, and proposition of remedial action, as warranted.

Component 5 - Project Implementation and Capacity Building in the Ministry of
                  Economy and Finance (US$3.0 million)

This component was to finance two sets of activities:

* A significant portion of funds will go towards strengthening the capacity in the
  departments of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in charge of banking, insurance,
  pension funds and microfinance as well as the legal and regulatory environment for the
  financial sector. Technical assistance will be used to cover consultancy services to
  provide training to the different Ministry of Economy and Finance personnel in charge
  of banking, insurance, pension funds and microfinance issues. The main objective is to
  build capacity that will remain after the project implementation is completed in five
  years;

* The project will also finance the capacity building effort within the Ministry of
  Economy and Finance. Specifically, it will finance a Project Coordinator, Project
  Component Managers, an Accountant, an Administrative Assistant, a Driver, and one
  car assigned to the project. Necessary office equipment for the project implementation
  unit will be also financed under this component;

The result will be an effective implementation of envisaged activities to meet the specific
development objective pursued by the project.

1.6     Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7     Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)


                                              8

30.     Based on the mid-term review of July 26, 2004, the project closing date was
extended from April 2006 to April 2008. This extension was designed to allow time to
implement recommendations of several studies which had been carried out under the
project and to complete ongoing activities.

31.     In addition, the World Bank agreed with the Government's request to amend the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) by reconsidering the legal covenant related to
bringing the Government's participation in the capital of commercial banks to zero by the
end of the project (Schedule 4.9). The achievement of another covenant (Paragraph 8 of
Schedule 4) to reduce the Government's stake in banks to 20 percent would ensure
appropriate private involvement in the sector. As a result, on, the paragraph 9 of Schedule
4 to the DCA is amended to read as follows (letter of April 7, 2006):

32.     "9. By April 30, 2008, the Borrower shall have taken all measures necessary to:
(i) reduce the percentage of public shareholdings in all commercial banking institutions
(including BDM but excluding BNDA and BHM) to twenty percent (20 percent) in terms
of total shareholding by capital or voting rights; (ii) help implement CIMA's
recommendations concerning insurance companies operating on its territory; and (iii)
implement the recommendations of the financial audit pertaining to INPS pursuant to Part
B 1 (a) of the Project and caused INPS to comply, in due course, with CIPRES
regulations".

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


33.     This project was prepared at a time when the Government faced the challenge of
implementing an ambitious macroeconomic reform program supported by the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and when it sought to meet conditions for
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point in November 1999. The
restructuring and privatization program was an important part of these reforms. A
consultative body consisting of representatives of financial sector (Groupe de Reflexion
sur le Secteur Financier - GRSF) was created in August 1997 to address the specific
issues in financial sector.

34.     The design of the project drew from lessons learned from the delivery of technical
assistance and in support of financial sector reforms in many countries including Mali.
The main lesson learned from the ongoing Private Sector Assistance Project (PSAP) was
the importance of a participatory approach in the preparation, as well as in the
implementation of the project. Lack of ownership or consensus on the project's
objectives was one of the major problems of the PSAP. To avoid this problem, the
Financial Sector Development Project was prepared with the full participation of the
Consultative Group for the Financial Sector (GRSF). The working groups set up by the
GRSF, in collaboration with the Government and the Bank, defined an action plan based
on the recommendations of various studies financed with Bank assistance. The logical



                                            9

framework sessions were attended by all concerned actors and served as the vehicle to
develop a consensus on the activities to be financed under the project.

35.     The project also drew two main lessons from the experience in technical
assistance projects, namely: (i) the need to build a strong ownership as mentioned above;
and (ii) the importance of providing technical assistance on the basis of real need instead
of supply-driven programs.

36.     The risks were clearly identified during the preparation. However, some of them
were underestimated or have not been adequately mitigated. The risk linked to a weak
commitment of the Government to take unpopular measures by implementing long term
restructuring plans for the Pension Fund (Caisse de Retraite du Mali- CRM) and the
social security institute (Institut National de Sécurité Sociale ­INPS) was rated negligible
at appraisal, but the delay in the implementation of parametric reforms was due to this
weak commitment. To mitigate the risk linked to the lack of motivation of civil servants
working in the implementation of project activities, it was decided to use independent
consultants. Other options were not considered such as the alignment of the status of
staff of working on the project to those performing similar functions in the ministry of
finance (for instance the inspectors of Microfinance Supervisory Unit (CCS/SFD) with
those of other inspectors in the Ministry of Finance (inspector of tax, inspector of
Treasury).

2.2     Implementation

37.     Two phases marked the life of the project. During the first one, the project funded
many studies with little emphasis on implementation of recommendations of such studies.
Under the second phase beginning after the mid-term review and particularly since 2004,
the focus of the project changed from studies and training to clear results on the ground,
under the impetus of a new team on the World Bank side. A concise action plan and a
clear timetable were established.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38.     During preparation, a monitoring and evaluation system was designed and a
Financial Sector Policy and Advisory Unit (FSPAU) consisting of a Project Coordinator,
four Project Component Managers, an Accountant and Administrative Staff was
established. The team was to provide quarterly progress reports. Many of the key project
indicators are collected by the regional banking supervisory body and the Central Bank
which facilitated monitoring.

39.     However, in the early stages of implementation, the project faced problems to
recruit a competent Project Coordinator. Quarterly reports were not delivered regularly in
the scheduled timeframe. To strengthen the implementation unit, staff was assigned to the
unit to take charge of the monitoring and evaluation aspects.




                                              10

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

40.     As a technical assistance project the project environmental category was "C'.

41.     Regarding fiduciary compliance, audit reports were delivered in a timely manner
and their recommendations taken into account by the project implementation unit. The
financial management reports were also provided in time and their quality was generally
good.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

42.     The Government and the World Bank agreed on the need to pursue the reforms
carried out under the project, and to help financial sector development by supporting the
implementation of the action plan for microfinance and the new financial sector
development strategy prepared with support from the project.

43.     It was decided that the Mali Growth Support Project (approved in 2005) would
support key measures financing: (i) the privatization process of the Banque
Internationale pour le Mali (BIM); (ii) the costs of the validation workshop of the Code
de Procedures Civiles et Commerciales, and (iii) the costs of a validation workshop of
the feasibility study of the company which will manage the stabilization of commercial
banks portfolios mainly the housing bank (Banque de l'Habitat du Mali - BHM). To
assure the continuity of the supervision of microfinance institutions, the possibility that a
proposed rural development project will support this important activity will be explored.

44.     In the medium term, new activities included in the microfinance action plan and
the financial sector development strategy is expected to be continued under the Growth
Support Project in the framework of its planned restructuring. In addition, some
recommendations of the Rural Finance Study could be supported by the Rural
Development Project.

45.     Other donors are also expected to play an important role in the stabilization and
development of the financial sector. The Canadian-Danish Project will provide support to
reforms to the microfinance sector, and the Government has included supervision of
microfinance institutions in the 2007 budget. In addition, the component managers of the
implementation unit will be integrated into their respective departments in the public
sector to enhance the efficiency of these services.

46.     A possible technical assistance from Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening
(FIRST) could also in the future contribute to strengthen the results achieved by the
project. In addition, the future Development Policy Loans (DPLs) should be a strong
leverage to pursue the reforms in the sector.

47.     To help all these actions, the Mali Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
finalized in February 2008 brings a better and updated knowledge of Mali financial



                                             11

sector. Also, Mali has been selected as one of the pilot countries in Africa to benefit from
IMF and World Bank support to carry out a financial sector development strategy under
the Lipksy-Daboub initiative. This development adopted by the authorities will guide the
financial sector reform process in Mali by building on progress achieved under the
project. It's expected to act as a foundation to secure further assistance from development
partners for the implementation of identified reforms and make the project reforms
sustainable.



3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)


48.     The project aimed to address key problems of the Mali Financial Sector so that it
would be able to support private sector growth. The objectives of the project were and
remained relevant in the present context.

49.     The sector was fragmented with weak institutions in the banking sector as well as
in the non-bank financial sector. The banking sector was characterized by: (i) substantial
Government ownership; (ii) non-compliance with BCEAO prudential requirements on
risk concentration, portfolio structure, capital base and provisioning of non-performing
loans. In the non-bank financial sector; (i) the insurance companies did not meet Inter-
African Conference for Trade (CIMA) prudential requirements and due to the under-
development of life insurance, they were obliged to maintain a high liquid position; (ii)
the long term viability of the retirement and social security funds (CRM and INPS) were
in question; (iii) the microfinance sector had advantages because of the knowledge of the
environment and the willingness to adapt products and methodologies to client needs,
but was fragmented, had a weak management capacity, depended on donor subsidies and
was not adequately supervised by the Government agency in charge of this task because
of the agency's weakness.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)


50.     Achievement of the project development objective is rated as moderately
satisfactory even if this is a conservative rating. In fact, the project met almost all key
performance indicators and generally went beyond them. Key indicators show an
improvement of financial soundness and development, measured by the level of
compliance with the Central Bank prudential ratios, the ratio of M2 to GDP, the level of
Government intervention in the sector and the sector openness to foreign competition, the
share of bank credit to the private sector).

51.     The project helped financial institutions meet key prudential ratios (capital
adequacy, risk concentration, liquidity) and substantially reduce the level of Non
Performing Loans (NPLs). The compliance with prudential norms has improved over the


                                                12

project life as follows: (i) compliance with the minimum capital requirement (from 75
percent of banks in 2001 to 82 percent in 2007); (ii) compliance with the solvency ratio
(from 75 percent of banks in 2001 to 82 percent in 2007); (iii) compliance with the
liquidity ratio (from 22 percent of banks in 2001 to 71 percent in 2007). For the ratio of
non performing loans, all but one bank, the Bank for Housing of Mali (BHM) have NPL
ratio less than the regional average of 18.9 percent in 2007. The Ratio of gross NPL,
excluding BHM amounted to 11.97 in 2005. On a net basis all the banks but one bank
(BHM) have NPL ratio less than the regional average of 7.4 percent in 2007. For all the
banks including BHM, the ratio of NPL amounted to 9.28 percent in 2007 against 10.13
percent in 2001. About BHM, its non performing loans decreased by 20 percent between
June 30, 2006 and December 31, 2007.

52.     Financial intermediation has been broadened by the end of the project. The
number of financial institutions increased from 12 to 17 and financial depth measured by
the ratio of M2/GDP has increased above the regional average of 25 percent, from 22
percent in 2001 to 30 percent in 2007. In addition, ratio of credit to GDP increased from
15 percent in 2001 to 18 percent in 2007 and the leasing activity has increased by 146
percent from 2001 to 2007.

53.     Beyond the indicators monitored by the project, a technical assistance has been
provided to a local firm (SEMA) that raised CFA 5 billion in the regional capital market
to have a demonstration effect on availability of alternative source of funding for
corporations. Credit for productive activities developed as follow: (i) commerce and
tourism increased from 27.1 percent in 2001 to 43.7 percent in 2007; (ii)
agriculture/fishing decreased from 17.1 percent in 2001 to 7.7 percent in 2008; and (iii)
various services from 14.8 percent in 2001 to 18.3 percent in 2008.

54.     The Treasury deposits were only made with state owned banks and following a no
competitive bidding process. During the project life, the Treasury opened several
accounts in different banks, including private banks and make deposits based on
efficiency.

55.     The project helped Government to reduce its ownership in the banking sector.
With the exception of the Housing Bank (BHM), the participation of the Government is
limited at 20 percent maximum and seven of the 13 commercial banks in the country are
fully private. The privatization of Mali International Bank (BIM) supported by the project
was one of the most successful of its kind in the sub region, bringing in Mali a key
Moroccan bank, totaling a total asset of over 18 trillion CFAF.

3.3     Efficiency

56.     The Economic or financial Rate of Return (ERR) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
was not calculated at project appraisal due to the impossibility to quantify the expected
economic returns of a technical operation of this nature.       However, proceeds from
divestitures far exceeded the Credit amount, which is one indication of benefits




                                             13

exceeding costs. In terms of the time dimension of efficiency, certain reforms took
longer than planned. But, the ultimate goals were achieved.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)


Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.     The technical assistance provided by the project generally helped bank and non
bank financial institutions to strengthen their capacities through training, and assistance
in the preparation of business plans and to improve internal procedures aiming to control
their credit activities. The project also supported the successful divestiture of the
Government from State owned banks.

58.     Initially the project focused on studies and training, but the activities were not
focused on outcomes. There were delays in the restructuring and privatization of BIM,
and BHM, and in the legal and pension system reforms. After the mid-term review, a
detailed action plan focused on outcomes was agreed, and this led to a strong
commitment of all stakeholders and yielded good results. The project met substantially its
objective of improving the soundness, performance and competitiveness of the financial
sector to enable it to support broad-based private sector growth.

59.     As a result of the project, the financial system is stronger, as reflected in the
improvement of compliance with prudential ratios by the banking sector. Also, financial
services have improved.

Restructuring and Privatization of State owned banks

60.     The banking sector has been restructured and opened to foreign competition. Five
new banks have since entered the market and the sector is mostly privately owned.

61.     BIM has been fully restructured: (i) the solvability ratio increased from 5.6
percent to 8.05 percent in 2007 (above the 8 percent norm), liquidity ratio increased from
56 percent to 91 percent (required minimum of 75 percent), profitability has improved
from a loss in 2005 to a CFAF6 billion of net profit in 2007; (ii) the IT and information
systems have been upgraded in 2007; (iii) Government stake have been divested to a
strategic investor and reduced to 10.5 percent, in one of the most successful privatization
in the sub region.

Government shares in BCS has been reduced from 50 percent to 3 percent in 2004

62.     Malian Bank for Credit and Deposit (BMCD) and Development Bank of Mali
(BDM) have been merged. In 2004, Government shares have been divested to Moroccan
Bank of External Trade (BMCE), creating BDM.S.A, the 13th largest bank in WAEMU
countries. The Government share in BDM.SA (merger of BDM and BMCD) has been
reduced to 19.6 percent.



                                            14

63.     BHM has been recapitalized in October 2005 by the conversion of CFAF16
billion of Government deposits into capital. BHM improved its liquidity (FCFA 3.6
billion treasury in March 2008) and depositors have access again to their funds. New
procedures have been introduced and the IT system has been upgraded. As a step in
making the bank attractive for divesture, BHM has begun to put in place a plan to clean
up its portfolio and to this end the Government and the parliament adopted a law granting
BHM a special privilege to seed up the collection of its non performing loans, using extra
judiciary and arbitration means. In addition, BHM has put in pace a loan recovery
program with assistance from the project and expects to recover CFA 20 billion in the
next six months. BHM has resumed lending activities and 4931 new accounts were
opened in 2007 and 3845 as of July 2008. To help BHM to fully resume housing finance,
the Government has agreed to transfer social houses to BHM, worth about CFA 40
billion. Given its improved financial position, BHM is now ready to reactivate the
remainder of a credit line of CFA 1.5 billion from BOAD

Government share in all banks but BHM is below 20 percent

64.     Following the recommendations of a study financed under the project,
commercial banks have begun a process of improving the management of their credit and
loan recovery functions. The Government also started the reimbursement of Government
guaranteed debts and those due by public enterprises. To this end, it allocated CFA 3
billion in the budget. To solve this problem in the long term, the study suggested the
creation of a company charged with loan recovery but the solution adopted was the
creation of an asset management company which will be charged with both loan
collection and the management of the seized buildings.

65.     To provide alternative sources of financing to Malian enterprises, the project
supported a brokerage company, General Brokerage and Intermediation Company (SGI-
Mali), to define and put in place an action plan permitting the listing of three companies
in the regional stock market. One of them, SEMA, issued bonds of CFA 5 billions CFA
on April 2007 in the regional stock exchange. During the period, SGI Mali increased its
advisory services. For example, it was involved in the privatization process of BMCD,
BIM and Sotelma (Société Malienne de Télécommunications).

Strengthening of Social Security and Retirement Funds (CRM and INPS) and
Insurance companies

66.     CRM, the public pension scheme, has been restructured as planed. It has been
spined off from the public treasury; functions as an autonomous institution and operates
more efficiently (reduction in delay in processing claims). The project provided
institutional support which helped CRM produce reliable accounts; prepare monthly
statements and accelerate payments of pensions and to reduce 25 percent the delay of
examination of files for new retired people. Pensions and benefits are paid monthly, using
the banking system, from an inefficient quarterly cash payment. Based on the actuarial
study financed under the project and following consultations with stakeholders, a new
pension code was adopted by the Government on February 20, 2008.



                                            15

67.     INPS improved its financial management, reduced claim processing time by 50
percent, and registered a global surplus (FCFA 10.26 billion as of Dec 2006) including a
slight technical surplus in the retirement branch (FCFA 90.69 million as of Dec 2006).
INPS comply with key CIPRES prudential norms: coverage of technical expenses
(benefits) (99 percent against a minimum required ratio of 90 percent), ratio of personal
expenses to total overhead (50 percent against a required maximum of 85 percent), claim
processing time (45 days against a maximum 45 days required). Actuarial study of INPS
has been conducted and finalized. Also with the support of the project, INPS has
registered the debt due by the Government and has signed an agreement to recover this
debt (CFA 8 billion). The Government respects the agreed payment schedule.

68.     The insurance industry has improved between 2001 and 2007. (i) premium have
increased by 25 percent; the ratio of claims to premium decreased from 54 percent to 46
percent; and (iii) investments by insurance companies increased by 32,9 percent. The
National Insurance and Reimbursement Company (CNRA) which was under interim
administration by CIMA has been recapitalized in 2006; Sabunynan has been
recapitalized in 2007. Based on the institutional and financial audits of the six insurance
companies financed by the project, companies took actions to meet CIMA's
recommendations.

Strengthening microfinance institutions and the Government supervisory unit

69.     In the microfinance sector, as agreed, the activities of supervision and control and
those of promotion have been effectively separated into two institutions: CCS/SFD
(Cellule de Contrôle et de Supervision des Systèmes Financiers Décentralisés) and
CPA/SFD (Cellule de Promotion et d'Appui aux Systèmes Financiers Décentralisés)
which are now autonomous and have clearly defined functions and adequately staffed.

70.     The supervisory unit is operational, well staffed (25 persons), receives budgetary
allocations (FCFA 67 million in 2006, FCFA 150 million in 2007, FCFA 170 million in
2008) and has conducted 18 on site inspections in 2006, 35 missions in 2007 much higher
than the 9 a year missions agreed to. With 464 microfinance institutions licensed, almost
all institutions are licensed in Mali. Marginal institutions linked especially to project
including credit component remain out of the regulatory framework. The improved
capacities are expected to help in the supervision of microfinance institutions which
should ultimately result in greater protection for the clients of these institutions.

71.     APIM, the professional association of microfinance institutions, has been also
assisted to improve the harmonization of technical assistance, procedures and
management tools and the dialogue inside the microfinance sector. A joint bank and
microfinance training center was created in 2006. It's is now functional and partly
managed by the MFI association (APIM). The center provides demand driven courses in
management, credit risk assessment, banking and microfinance etc...14 courses have
been provided on financial management issues and more than 600 microfinance
institutions staff have been trained. In 2007, the association was able to finance 50



                                             16

percent of its functioning costs, and has the objective of becoming self sustaining, which
is important in strengthening the microfinance sector.


Improving Legal and Regulatory Framework

72.      The project funded on a cost sharing basis, training to commercial banks staff. At
least 36 training sessions have been provided to 1,051 persons including banks credit
staff estimated at 220 persons. The other beneficiaries are especially from Justice (judges,
lawyers, etc...). All but one bank experienced decrease in their NPL below the WAEMU
average of 18.9 percent. For the ratio of non performing loans, all but one bank (the
housing bank-BHM) have gross NPL ratio of 11.97 percent less than the regional average
of 18.9 percent in 2007. On a net basis, all banks including BHM have a ratio of NPL of
9.28 percent in 2007 against 10.13 percent in 2001.

73.      Besides the measures targeted in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the
project helped the Government in drafting a Commercial Procedures Code and a Land
Tenure code. The Government should organize a discussion of the proposed Land Tenure
Code to ensure the synergy between it and other codes regulating mine, breeding, and
water. Also a Code on Judiciary Experts' which defines standards and requirements for
better accountability and probity has been adopted by the Government. A one stop shop
for converting temporary land tiles into permanent deed has been opened and allowed the
issuance of 1,897 new land titles.



3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

74.      By strengthening the capacity of microfinance institutions and their viability, the
project has increased access of the poor to financial services, including credit.

75.      The support provided to the two pension schemes will make it easier for retired
persons to receive regular revenue in their old age. The project will also contribute to
develop the habit of using insurance products to reduce risks. By strengthening the
insurance companies, the project is assisting customers to recover the money due to them
by the companies.

76.      By helping to put in place an efficient land tenure code, the project could help to
reduce the conflict in land matters and should increase access to credit to poor people by
providing a source of collateral.




                                               17

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)


77.     The project provided considerable technical assistance to institutions associated
with it and thus strengthened their capacities, improved the technical quality of their staff
and contributed to improve their sustainability.

78.     Some actions remain to be implemented to strengthen this sustainability. It is
especially the case of CRM and INPS where the new information systems and electronic
management are not yet in place.            In addition, because of poor salaries, project
institutions tend to loose trained staff.          Institutions will have problems ensuring
sustainability unless this problem is addressed. This is especially the case of CCS/SFD,
the supervisory/control body for the microfinance institutions.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

79.     Studies and projects started after the launching of the project but part of the World
Bank strategy in support of private sector development, increase the impact of the
project. These include the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), the Diagnostic Trade
Integrated Study and the Mali Rural Finance Study carried out by the World Bank in
cooperation with the Government. The Sources of Growth project can help deepen and
extend the reforms initiated under the project.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

80.     As a result of actions already taken by the Government and the project team, the
risk is moderate.

81.     In the short term, the Sources of Growth Project will support: (i) the remaining
actions for the privatization of the BIM; (ii) the validation workshop of the commercial
code; and (iii) the validation workshop of the feasibility study of the asset management
company to be created. When the Sources of Growth project is project restructured, it
could support: (i) the development of new products of CRM; (ii) reforms aiming the
domiciliation of insurance contracts and the taxation of insurance products; (iii) the
implementation of a new CCS/SFD by the creation of a Supervision Directorate in the
ministry of finance which would help with staff retention; (iv) action plans for the
microfinance sector and in the new financial sector development strategy.

82.     The rural development project could support actions financed by the project and
those from the Mali Rural finance study.



                                                18

83.      The Government has also planned budget resources to: (i) help BHM to resume
the housing financing with CFA 40 billion allocated to it; (ii) reimburse debt from public
domain (CFA 3 billion) in the framework of debt collection by the commercial banks;
(iii) reimburse Government debt due to INPS of CFA 8 billion; (iv) ensure the financial
needs of the key institutions providing supervision and advise to microfinance
institutions (CCS/SFD and CPA/SFD) with a view to substitute progressively the project
support.

84.      Other donors are also committed to bring their support especially in the
microfinance sector with the support already planned by the Canadian-Danish Project.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1      Bank Performance

(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.      Mali was a country with a large presence of the Government in key sectors and
particularly in the financial sector. This resulted in large budgetary deficits and bad
governance. To address these problems, the Government requested the World Bank and
IMF to assist in defining a program of structural reforms. The Government efforts
enabled it to access HIPC and reach the decision point in November 1999. The project
which accompanied an adjustment operation, addressed the key issues affecting the
financial sector.

86.      Reforms in the financial sector began with studies and consultation between all
the financial sector stakeholders which were members of a consultative body. By
supporting these consultations, the World Bank helped to define the issues which would
improve financial sector performance and to design a project which addresses sector
needs. The action plan and the logical framework sessions were strongly participative and
helped develop a consensus on the activities to be financed under the project.

87.      The design of the project drew from the lessons learned from experience in
delivery technical assistance and in support of financial sectors reforms in many
countries. The risks were identified. Risks linked to weak commitment of Government to
take unpopular measures about new pension schemes was considered negligible but the
implementation has shown this risk was high and this weakness was a source of delay in
the implementation of pension schemes reforms. The measures scheduled to minimize the
risks of weak motivation of civil servants working in the project activities didn't include
other institutional possibilities like the alignment of status of CCS/SFD inspectors on the
status of other inspectors in the Ministry of Finance. Quality at entry was assessed by the

Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in 2006 which judged it satisfactory.                     The
Implementation Completion and Results Report ICR rates the quality at entry as
moderately satisfactory. In retrospect, risks in some of the project components were
underestimated and the institutional arrangements did not take into account options to
strengthen the Government structures, particularly in the area of microfinance.

(b)     Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)


Rating: Satisfactory

88.     The supervision missions were done regularly but, during the first phase of the
project, the team was slow to follow-up on the conclusions of the mission and to focus on
results. In this context, a strong team took in charge the restructuring of the project and
focused on client needs and results-orientation and supervision work improved sharply.
A quality of supervision assessment was carried out by the Quality Assurance Group in
2006 and confirmed this judgment. The QAG rated supervision highly satisfactory. The
overall quality of supervision is rated satisfactory to take into account the difficulties in
the early years of implementation.

89.     The participative process in the identification of the action plan and the system of
follow-up by the Government and the World Bank helped the project present quick
results. The presence of a project team member in Bamako has also been a major factor
in improving client orientation and the quality of supervision. Issues relating to financial
and procurement management and recommendations resulting from audits and other
evaluations were addressed in a timely manner by the team.

90.     With respect to the contract relating to portfolio audit, some commercial banks
expressed concern about the decision made by the Government with the approval of the
World Bank to have only one firm to carry out the portfolio work of all commercial
banks. The banks indicated that this presented risks with respect to the confidentiality of
the data. The Central Bank and Banking Commission are the only institutions with access
to all information.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     The project was well designed and its objective remained relevant. Some risks
were underestimated or not sufficiently mitigated. During the implementation of the
project, following problems at startup, the team took the required actions to improve its
results. The project remained an important tool for the policy dialogue on the Mali
financial sector.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

92.    During the preparation phase of the project, the Government was committed to
take actions aiming to stabilize and to develop the financial sector. It was a key member
of the identification process and helped establish a consultative group to assist in
preparing the project (GRSF).

93.    During the implementation and especially after the restructuring of the project, the
Government translated its commitment by budgeting and disbursing adequate resources
to help BHM to resume the housing financing, to reimburse its debt due to commercial
banks and INPS, and to support the functioning of the two key institutions in the
microfinance sector (CCS/SFD and CPA/SFD). It also played a major role to advice and
follow-up the implementation of reforms in the sector.

94.    However, the Government was slow to adopt new texts such as the pension
scheme code, and reform of the social security and pension systems remain to be carried
out. In addition, the land tenure code and the commercial code have not yet adopted.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

95.    The project was implemented by a unit under the overall supervision of the
Ministry of Economy and Finance -- FSPAU (Financial Sector Policy and Advisory
Unit). The unit was charged with coordinating the implementation of the various project
components and monitoring its implementation and reporting to the Minister of Economy
and Finance and to the Bank

96.    In general, the implementation unit was well run. Except for the first coordinator,
which was charged with the project during the early stages of implementation, the other
coordinators were committed to manage the project efficiently and to meet commitments
in a timely manner. Training was provided to the unit staff on the various aspects of
project management including on their role of liaison between the Government, the
project beneficiaries and the Bank.

97.    The unit has been especially proactive in the implementation of the 10
benchmarks selected after the restructuring of the project. The preparation of terms of
reference was singled out by the unit as a problem because beneficiaries had difficulties
expressing clearly their needs. This was due in part to their limited qualifications.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                            21

98.    Work by the Government and the implementation unit and their ability to develop
a strong dialogue with the beneficiaries and with the World Bank facilitated the
implementation and accomplishments of the project. However, weak Government
commitment resulted in delays in the adoption of important legislation in for the reform
of the social security system and the land tenure, and commercial codes which are
important in improving the business environment.



6.     Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

   (i)     Strong commitment of Government is a major condition for the successful and
           timely implementation of a program. Without Government support, difficult
           reforms would be delayed or never implemented.

   (ii)    Technical assistance should take into account the political constraints prior to
           planning the implementation of certain reforms. By example, experience has
           shown that pension reforms take two electoral cycles

   (iii)   To accelerate reforms, technical assistance should be associated to a
           development policy loan which is able to provide a high leverage to the
           technical assistance support.

   (iv)    The ownership of Government and different beneficiaries, from preparation to
           implementation, helps increase the impact of the project.

   (v)     The Government, the implementation unit and the World Bank need to share
           and agree on the management of the monitoring and evaluation system of the
           project from its launching.

   (vi)    The location of a member of the project team and preferably the TTL in the
           field contributes strongly to improving the policy dialogue as well as the
           efficiency and timely implementation of the project

   (vii)   Concerning the projects in the financial sector, it is important to pay attention
           to confidentiality especially in the collection of bank financial data. The banks
           associated with World Bank financed projects need to be confident that their
           data will stay confidential or they will not be committed to the project.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Restructuring and Privatization of the Commercial Banking Sector

This component aimed: (i) to help the disengagement of Government from the financial
sector by restructuring and privatizing of viable state owned banks; (ii) to strengthen the
capacity of the Malian Professional Bankers Association; and (iii) to diversify financial
products by assisting the capital market development.

Under this component, the project would finance: (i) the assistance of legal advisors and
privatization advisors to the Government; (ii) specialized bank diagnostics or audits, as
needed, to support the Government in its efforts to restructure and/or privatize banks; (iii)
provide, on cost-sharing basis, consultant services to help banks prepare strategic
business development plans, identify needs for staff training, and implement a training
program; (iv) heightening public and companies on the financial markets issues

(i) Disengagement of Government from the Financial Sector and Strengthening of
Commercial Banking Sector

With the support of the Project, BMCD and BDM have been merged. Government share
in BDM-SA (merger of BDM and BMCD) has been reduced to 19.6 percent.

The project helped Government to reduce its share in BCS from 50 percent to 3 percent

To support the restructuring of BHM, the project financed the audit of the credit
portfolio, the manual of procedures, the implementation of new business data processing
and staff training. As result, the BHM had a better knowledge of its portfolio which
permitted it to obtain support for its recapitalization by the conversion of FCFA 16 billion
of Government deposits into capital. BHM also improved its operational and financial
management by implementing new procedures in the areas of credit and internal control.
The project also helped to put in place a loan recovery program and financed the services
of consultant to supervise recovery actions.

The project also supported the restructuring and privatization of BIM by financing legal
and privatization advisors to carry out the privatization including, an assessment of the
value of the Bank; definition of a the privatization strategy; development of the list of
potential investors, preparation of the prospectus and bidding documents, the
organization of a data room, the assessment of bids and the selection of investors. In
addition, BIM befitted from support in strengthening its financial and operational
management. BIM has been fully restructured and Government stake has been reduced to
10.5 percent

In general, the project helped commercial banks increase their capacities by financing
training, the preparation of business plans and manuals of procedures, introduction of
modern management tools including business data processing which resulted in a more



                                              25

efficient corporate governance framework. An important action supported by the project
was the audit of non performing loans. As a result of the audit, the banks agreed to create
a company to continue loan recovery and manage the goods seized.

Other benefits were assistance to implement the new compensation system of the Central
Bank (SICA-UEMOA). Mali was the first country to launch this new process aiming to
reduce delays in compensation. A study on banking in Mali has been financed and helped
the banks identify the opportunities for opening new agencies.

(ii) Assistance to the Bankers Association

To improve the skills of bank and non-bank financial institution staff and to harmonize
the implementation of activities of common interest, the project helped strengthen the
capacity of the Malian Professional Bankers Association by financing materials, training
courses on a cost sharing basis (50-50), and the refurbishment of the local bank training
center. About 300 agents have attended training sessions on banking matters.

(iii) Diversifying Financial Products

The project also supported the brokerage firm (SGI Mali) by increasing its technical
capacity through training and by helping it to identify companies suitable to be listed in
the regional stock market or to issue bonds in this market. For SGI Mali as well as the
regional stock exchange branch, programs have been implemented to inform and
heighten the interest of the regional stock market. Leasing activity has also increased by
146 percent from 2001 to 2007

Component 2: Strengthening of Non-Bank Financial Institutions including the
Social Security and Retirement Funds

Under this component, the project supported activities aiming to strengthen the non-bank
financial institutions. In this framework, this component aimed: (i) to improve the
management and financial performance of the existing social security and retirement
funds and to ensure their long-tern viability; (ii) to improve the managerial capacity and
to ensure the long-term viability and the sustainable development of the activities of
insurance companies.

The project would finance: (i) financial and institutional audits of CRM, INPS and CDC
with a view to adequately prepare actuarial studies for CRM and INPS; (ii) financial and
institutional audits and action plans for insurance companies to promote their
participation in the integrated financial sector development and capital market; (iii)
management information systems and training of staff necessary to improve the
efficiency of CRM, INPS, and CDC; (iv) technical assistance to implement actuarial
studies; and (v) technical assistance to help insurance companies improve their
management and prepare their strategic development plans.




                                            26

(i) Improving the Social Security and Retirement Funds

Financial and accounting audits of CRM were carried out in 2001 and 2003 and the
accounts of the last five last years (2003-2007) have been recorded on the accounting and
financial plans. Based on the improved financial data, an actuarial study has been carried
out. To keep all stakeholders involved in the identification of parametric reforms, the
project financed the workshop hold to discuss the various scenarios. A new parameters
law for CRM has been approved by the Council of Ministers on February 20, 2008. The
project also supported the implementation of a new business data process which makes
possible monthly payments to pensioners and reduction of the time taken to process
documents. Other actions strengthening operational and financial management of CRM
covered the preparation of a manual of procedures, an annual statistical report, training,
especially on the CIPRES procedures. Some actions as the design and execution of the
communication and heighten plan and the acquisition of an integrated software package
remained not yet implemented at the closing of the project.

INPS also received support in improving its accounts and operational processes,
computerization, training and actuarial studies. These activities helped INPS to comply
with key CIPRES prudential norms.

With respect to CDC, two studies have been realized: one relative to the financial and
institutional audit of CDC and the second one on the viability of this institution. The
second study concludes that it is necessary to create a new CDC more able to collect and
transform the resources of the territorial collectivities.

(ii) Improving the Insurance Sector

The project helped to stabilize and develop the insurance sector by financing: (i)
institutional and financial audits of six companies permitting them to meet the CIMA
requirements; (ii) office automation and computer equipments; (iii) training of 150
agents; (iv) studies on the diversification of insurance products, the domiciliation of
insurance contracts and the taxation of insurance polices; (v) information programs
aiming to encourage the public to purchase insurance polices. These activities financed
by the project strengthened the financial, institutional and operational capacities of
insurance companies and improved the results of the sector in the period 2001-2006.
Insurance company: (i) premiums increased by 25 percent; and (ii) damage/premium
decreased from 54 percent to 46 percent; and (iii) the increasing of the companies
investments of 32.9 percent. Two companies, CNRA and Sabunynan, has been
recapitalized in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The project financed the institutional and
financial audits of the six insurance companies that took actions to meet CIMA's
recommendations.




                                              27

Component 3: Strengthening of the Microfinance Sector

This component sought to increase financial services delivered to the poor on a
financially sustainable and long-term basis by improving the institutional viability of
microfinance institutions. To this end, the project would finance technical assistance,
consultancy services and equipment to strengthen: (i) the Government microfinance
supervisory unit (CCS/SFD); (ii) the Government microfinance promotion unit
(CPA/SFD); (iii) the Professional Association of Microfinance Institutions (APIM- Mali),
(iv) microfinance institutions.

(i) Improving Microfinance Supervision and Promotion Units

The project helped CCS/SFD to be more efficient by strengthening its capacity. It
financed (i) an inventory of microfinance institutions; (ii) the acquisition of equipments
and computer materials including a business data system to able monitoring microfinance
institutions, (iii) supervision missions, and (iv)training.       CCS/SFD is now staffed
adequately with 25 persons and carried out 18 on-site control missions in 2006 and 35
missions in 2007, much higher than the 9 a year missions agreed to. Concerning control,
there was also an increase of the number of institutions which sent their annual reports:
from 72.7 percent in 2001 to 89.8 percent in 2006.Licenses issued by CCS/SFD increased
from 64 in 2002 to 261 in 2008. The Government supported the activities of this structure
by allocating: CFA 67 million in 2006; CFA 150 million in 2007 and CFA 170 million in
2008. With the training provided to inspectors, CCS/ SFD has increased its capacity to
carry out its mission. However, due to poor salaries, there has been some staff rotation.
The solution envisaged is to give to inspectors the same status that those of finance
inspectors or to increase the status of the supervision unit to a Directorate under the
Ministry of Finance.

Regarding the promotion unit (CPA/SFD), it is now fully staffed with six agents; the
Government funded the unit (CFA 118 million in 2006) to launch its activities
(investments and studies) and then its operations (CFA 60 million and CFA 89.6 millions
in 2007 and 2008, respectively). The unit received support from the project for (i)
equipment and furniture, (ii) 13 missions including 8 aiming especially to encourage the
grouping of microfinance institutions, (iii) 5 meetings of the National Consultative Group
for Microfinance (GCNM) to follow-up the implementation of the national microfinance
action plan, (iv) training and (v) the salaries of support staff during one year.

(ii) Professional Association of Microfinance Institutions

The project supported the Professional Association of Microfinance Institutions (APIM-
Mali), by financing its operations costs in the initial years (Executive Director, the
training coordinator and the accounting staff). This support is decreasing with the
increased financial contribution of member institutions. Member institutions financed 50
percent of APIM's operating costs in 2007. The project also helped finance: (i)
equipment and computer materials; (ii) coordination weeks, meetings of the General
Assembly and the management and workshops on studies prepared; (iii) the



                                              28

implementation of a data base on microfinance institutions and a web site; (iv) the
business plan of APIM-Mali and other studies like the computer development plan and
studies relative to the framework and the action plans of microfinance sector; (v) the
production of three quarterly news bulletins.

The joint bank and microfinance training center created in 2006, is now functional and
partly managed by APIM. The center provides demand driven courses in management,
credit risk assessment, banking and microfinance, etc.

Microfinance institutions have been supported by the project through the financing of the
design and implementation of business plans for 12 institutions, the training of more than
600 staff, the development of business information and management systems and the
rating of three institutions.

Component 4: Legal and Regulatory Support for Financial Sector

This component includes activities aiming to identify and to remove the regulatory
framework constraints impeding the development of financial sector operations and new
financial instruments or institutions. In this framework, the project supported studies and
provided training for staff in financial institutions and various ministries as those in
charge of land and justice.

Under this component, the project was to finance consultant services and technical
assistance required to prepare a new land tenure code and a new civil and commercial
code.

The new land tenure code has been prepared. Studies have been done to help with the
revision of this code. In addition, the project contributed to finance the implementation of
the urban land registry (Registre Foncier), equipment for the unit charged with the
cadastre for the district of Bamako and training relative to the cession capital gains. A
one stop shop for converting temporary land titles into permanent deed has been opened
and allowed the issuance of 1897 new land titles.

The project helped to draft a new civil and commercial code.

A national registry has been created to centralize loan guarantees. A Code on judiciary
experts has also been adopted.

In addition, the project provided: (i) a library for the magistrates; (ii) equipment and
vehicles for the Inspection of Judiciary Services to help it carry out inspection missions;
(iii) computer equipment for the National Judiciary Training Institute and the
Commercial Courts.

Component 5: Project Implementation and Capacity Building in the Ministry of
                  Economy and Finance

This component aimed to strengthen the capacity in the Coordination Unit and the
Departments of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in charge of banking, insurance,
pension funds, microfinance, legal and regulatory environment for the financial sector to
achieve an effective implementation of envisaged activities.

The project financed consultancy services, training and office equipment for the
Coordination Unit and the departments of the Ministry of Economy and Finance involved
in its implementation. In the area fiscal policy, the project helped to finance two studies:
the first one on the tax applicable to the leasing (the conclusion of this study has been
taken into account in the General Fiscal Code) and the second one on the fiscal aspects of
the costs linked to the execution of the guarantees.

The Government has indicated that it was organizing the preparation of the report by
using a consultant service. Due to the public procurement procedures, the recruitment
process of the consultant took a long time. At present, a consultant has been already
selected and he has begun his work. As today, the report is not yet achieved. The
Government has mentioned that he will send the report to the Bank as soon as it will be
finalized.
