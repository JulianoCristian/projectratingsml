Through its four main components, the project will:\n            1) finance the promotion for an increased private-public\n            supply of basic, and secondary education opportunities for\n            adults, which includes the establishment of a learning\n            assessment, and certification system for adults, as well as\n            that of new modules to encompass adult basic, and secondary\n            education along with training, and distance learning; 2)\n            finance, through a competitive Fund, vertical articulation\n            of technical secondary, with tertiary technical-professional\n            education, through the establishment of technological\n            curricular disciplines. As well, the horizontal articulation\n            of technical secondary, and tertiary education with the\n            labor market, will be constituted through regional networks\n            of educational institutions at the technical, secondary, and\n            tertiary levels. Access to, and quality of education will be\n            improved through pre- and in-service teacher training\n            institutions; 3) establish a national system of competency\n            framework, and professional-vocational pathways on selected\n            sectors of the economy, and, four proactive learning, and\n            training management information systems will be financed;\n            and, 4) finance a national Project Coordination Unit, and in\n            addition, support the strengthening of the national, and\n            regional Training and Employment Service (SENCE), by\n            financing computers, and equipment, training, and technical\n            assistance, while a continuous communication, and\n            dissemination strategy will be maintained."}, "docdt": "2002-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
