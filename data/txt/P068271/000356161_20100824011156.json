        Training Project for Chile were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: lifelong learning and training is crucial both\n            from equity and efficiency perspectives. In the context of\n            Chile's lifelong learning and training system, the\n            development of human capital is solidly grounded in the\n            country's needs to support its integration into the\n            world economy as well as its social deficit. An adequate\n            lifelong learning and training system necessarily involves\n            diverse players that are in themselves heterogeneous, both\n            in the public and private spheres. The success of Chile\n            Califica was not the result of having a strong champion with\n            high visibility within the public or private spheres who\n            advocated for the development of a lifelong learning and\n            training system. Rather, it was the result of gradually\n            introducing an overall framework that addressed many of the\n            weaknesses in the existing educational and training system\n            in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Although the\n            implementation of the project at the regional level resulted\n            in added complexity, it ensured its relevancy at the\n            regional level. While other developing countries can\n            certainly learn from this innovative project, Chile's\n            special characteristics mean that these ideas cannot be\n            exported easily or wholesale."}, "docdt": "2010-07-27T00:00:00Z"}
