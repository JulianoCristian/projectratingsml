"The Housing Project will support the\n            Government's objectives in the sector by providing\n            additional resources to the Government through the National\n            Housing Fund (NHF) for low-income housing and will assist\n            the Government in formulating a framework for housing policy\n            development and an agenda for policy reform in the sector.\n            The broad objectives for program and policy reform are to :\n            a) better target public housing assistance to the poor in\n            terms of the needs of the recipients and minimize the cost\n            of providing the assistance; and b) improve regulation of\n            the sector in order to increase the efficiency with which\n            the market provides housing services to the entire\n            population.  Over two years the project will provide : 1)\n            support for approximately 15,000 lower-income housing units\n            through targeted NHF lending programs; and 2) technical\n            assistance and training to build the institutional capacity\n            for developing further specific policy and regulatory reforms."}, "docdt": "1991-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
