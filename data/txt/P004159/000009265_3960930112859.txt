MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A HOUSING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recoumendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Korea for an amount of US$100.0 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a
15 year maturity including a grace period of five years. The proceeds of the
loan would be onlent through the National Housing Fund at 10% (variable) to low-
income households for home purchase.
2.        )aWc1g  n.  In less than a generation, Korea has become a middle-
income industrialized country with many of the obvious signs of economic success.
However, in the area of social needs, and housing in particular, the situation
has not improved in line with the rapidly increasing incomes. In fact, much of
the growing investment in housing has been taken up by escalating prices rather
than greater output. Since 1985, housing prices have been risig about a third
faster than consumer prices and urban land prices have escalated almost three
times as quickly. The result is that Koreans now live in houses more than six
times their average annual income, which is among the highest ratio observed in
any market economy. The high level of prices for housing and land and the
perceived resulting impact on wealth and income distribution are viewed as
serious social and economic problems. The Government has sought to address
housing sector problems by intervening specifically on behalf of lower income
families with targeted programs and policies and with direct measures to restrain
price increases throughout the market. The direct interventions have not worked
well and some m-%sures may actually have inadvertently pushed prices higher. The
Government has . :4 somewhat greater success in targeting the main social housing
program, the National Housing Fund (NHF), which has led to a broader rethinking
of housing policies and public programs at this time.
3.        The Ministry of Construction (MOC) through its Housing Bureau has the
main responsibility for the formulation of national housing policy and plans. 40C
prepares the section of the Five Year Plan pertaining to housing as well as the
anrual targets and goals for the sector. NOC staff, with the assistance of a
ministry-sponsored research institute, formulate all key policies and provide
most of the day-to-day regulations that govern the housing and land markets.
They exercise the policy implementation and regulatc.y functions directly as a
line ministry and indirectly through the activities of several ministry
controlled agencies such as the land and housing corporations. One important
instrument for implementing social housing policy is the HF, described more
fully in the following paragraph.
4.        HOC directly executes a portion of its low-income houslng program
through the NHF, which is the intended conduit for funds under the proposed
project. Since the establishment of the NHF in 1981, MOC has used this mechanism
to make loans for the purchase of small units and for the construction of rental
property, both for lower income households. In the case of the rental units the
benefit of low-cost financing is passed on to the tenant. For house purchase,
NHF loans carry positive interest rates.   NHF made about 70,000 loans for
purchase in 1989. It also assisted in the construction of 40,000 units of rental
housing of which there is a special shortage. Funds for NHF are primarily raised



-2 -
from tax-like instruments which are levied in a progressive manner on sales of
land and large houses. Under the Housing Finance Project (Loan No. 2853-K0) the
Government successfully improved the targeting of NHF programs by, inter alia,
reducing the maximum and average size of unit funded by more than 30%. Benefits
are progressive within its programs and NHF constitutes the most successful
element among the Government's policy instruments for aiding lower income
households.
5.        Central to preparation of the proposed project has been a dialogue with
MOC on further reform of its social housing programs as well as sector-wide
housing policies and regulations. The proposed strategy for such a policy and
program review is described in the Policy Development Statement (PDS) wherein the
Government sets new policy directions, including a hierarchy of monitorable
goals, and adopts a methodology for analyzing public sector interventions in the
housing sector and for developing detailed reform measures within that framework.
Agreement has been reached on the content of the policy and program review to
address several important sector problems, namely, high land and house prices;
high rents and levels of crowding; uncompetitive conditions resulting in high
returns to land development; and ineffective subsidies. Preliminary analysis has
identified four priority areas for reform, namely, Government housing programs,
housing sector regulation, the land supply system and ot-.her housing related
polices, such as capital gains taxation. Broad reforms are needed in all these
areas to restore efficiency and equity to the housing sector.  Progress in
carrying out the sector reform program will be monitored against five key sector
performance indicators; reductions in the ratio of average housing prices to
household income; the level of rents relative to incomes; the ratio of the price
of adjacent raw and residentially zoned land (to reflect a more elastic land
market); the ratio of market price to factor cost of new housing (to measure the
general competitiveness of the housing industry); and the rate of progress in
ssisting target households in the bottom half of the income distribution.
6.        Rtionale for Bank Inmolvement.  The Bank has played a catalytic role
in promoting ever more general approaches to issues and problems in the housing
sector. This project marks the next logical step in a series of operations
progressing from speciflc technical interventions on low-income housing types to
the development of individual institutions and now to addressing broader market
and sector topics.  The Government's request for assistance   reflects the
perception that a distorted housing market is a serious economic and social
policy issue at this time where the Bank's independent advice and analytical
approaches on the basis of its cross-country experience may help improve
Government housing policy and the sector's performance.
7.        Proiect Objegtiveg.  The project would support the Government's
objectives in the sector by providing additional resources to the Government
through NHF for lower income housing and by assisting the Government in
formulating a framework for housing policy development and an agenda for policy
reform in the sector. The Government's broad objectives for program and policy
reform are: (a) to better target public housing assistance to the poor in terms
of the needs of the recipients and to minimize the cost of providing the
assistance, and (b) to improve regulation of the sector in order to increase the
efficiency with which the market provides housing services to the entire
population.



- 3 -
8.        Proiegt Deacri2ti     The project would, over four years, provide (a)
support for an ongoing program of targeted landing through NHF for low-income
housing; and (b) technical assistance and training for institutional building in
the sector. The proceeds of the Bank loan would be channeled through lHF and
would provide end-user financing for approximately 15,000 lower-income households
who are participating in NHF's program for owner-occupied housing. The Bank loan
would finance a portion of UHF mortgages equal to the estimated Indirect forein
exchange which is valued at approximately 25% of the total value of the new
housing constructed. ill of NHF's programs are targeted to households in the
bottom half of the income distribution and the bias within that range is toward
the lower end. The onlending interest rate for NHF's owner-occupied housing loan
program is 10% p.a. at present which is now slightly positive in real tenus and
is well above NHF's cost of funds. It is, however, well above the last threo
year's consumer price average of 5.3% (1987-89) and approximately 1-2% lower than
mortgages for higher income households and loans for major comercial borrowers
under the prevailing interest rate regime in Korea. NHF's mortgage is a variable
rate instrument which can be changed at the option of the lender. During the
project period (mid-1991 - mid-1995) NHF intends to lend about US$15 billion
equivalent for about 880,00 new housing units. New low-income housing, financed
through NHF, would be procured under LCB procedures which are acceFtable to the
Bank. ICB is not proposed for the present project because the civil works under
Government housing programs are of a dispersed nature located throughout the
country and, therefore, are not attractive nor lend themselves to international
contracting. Foreign bidders are free to participate under LCB in Korea. Public
sector developers procure under LCB procedures which are acceptable to the Bank.
Private developers participating in public programs follaw standard cocercial
practices, which are acceptable to the Bank.
9.        The technical assistance is to the Ministry of Construction and is
designed to establish a reform program for housing policies and programs. As
described above, the Government has already set now policy directions in the PDS
which would be developed into reform programs and specific measures through the
studies undertaken as part of this project. The Bank would participate in key
aspects of the implementation of the PDS and would also provide technical
assistance, in the course of project supervision, on housing and land policy for
the Seventh Five Year Plan and the Third National Pbysical Land Development Plan.
A program of overseas training and participation in international research
projects will be undertaken by MOC during the project.
10.       ra&dUActosrz. The Government has adopted the PDS, and agreed to: (a)
annually review, with the Bank, progress in implementing the PDS; (b) select
subprojects for which Bank loan funds would be disbursed according to criteria
acceptable to the Bank; and (c) under TORs for studies identified in the PDS, to
select consultants satisfactory to the Bank and make results of the studies
available to the Bank by December 30, 1993, for comment.
11.       Proiject BeeIts. The main benefits of the project would be:  (a) the
15,000 additional housing units financed, (b) improvements in the effectiveness
of public housing programs as a result of retcrms, (c) reduction in the relative
price of housing due to policy changes which improve the efficiency of the
housing market, and (d) institutional strengthening in NOC and Its institutes.



-4-
The proceeds of the Bank loan would only benefit families in the bottom half of
the Income distribution and most beneficiaries will be toward the lower end of
that income group.
12.       Proiect Risks.   There are no specific risks associated with the
project. Agreement on the basic directions for policy reform as set out in the
PDS has been obtained.
13.      IZ OMnMnl Aspects. Environmental Impaet Assessmeuts are mandatory
tor the housing schemes to be constructed under the project in conformity with
established procedures, which are satisfactory. Where resettlement is required,
adequate compensation and facilities for relocation are provided and funds are
budgeted for these purposes under acceptable procedures.
14.       Recommondation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and rocommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loarn.
