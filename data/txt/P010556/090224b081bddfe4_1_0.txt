                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project aims to achieve its Development Objective through implementation of about 1,030 km of highway improvement works and essential reforms in the sector and the
                         strengthening of the National Highway Authority (NHA). Expected outcome is improved traffic flow on the network monitored through improvements in key indicators relating to: (i)
                         road network condition; (ii) travel time; and (iii) road safety. The PDO and Outcome Indicators remain relevant and on track. Major achievements to date include:

                         (a) The road network in poor/very poor condition reduced by 30% from 49% to 35% reaching the end of project (EOP) target of 35%;
                         (b) Average network-level roughness reduced by 13% from 5.4 International Roughness Index (IRI) to 4.7 IRI against an EOP target of 4.4 IRI;
                         (c) Karachi-Peshawar travel time reduced by 16% from 47 hours to 39 hours exceeding the EOP target of 42 hours; and
                         (d) Fatalities per 100 km on N-5 decreased by 63% from 107 to 39 fatalities far exceeding the EOP target of 96 fatalities.

                         Other significant achievements of the project are highlighted below:

                         (a)      NHA has introduced several technologies worthy of note: solar street lighting and vehicular/pedestrian underpasses at the Lahore-Gujranwala section and in-situ hot and
                         cold pavement recycling on National Highway N-5. Other innovations include state-of-the art structural avalanche galleries and soil bioengineering applications for slope stabilization
                         in mountainous terrain, especially in rock strata disturbed by the 2005 Earthquake. This experience is now being transferred to Timor Leste. Better management of landslides will
                         ensure more reliable operations on the recently-opened trade corridor between the Pakistani- and Indian–administered parts of Kashmir, as well as on the alternate Kaghan Valley
                         Road link to the Karakoram Highway.

                         (b)      NHA has significantly increased its direct revenues – RMA receipts have gone up from Rs 2.25 billion in FY 02-03 to Rs 15.21 billion in FY 11-12 (576% increase). In FY
                         12-13, 92% of the total RMA revenues are estimated to be attributable to tolls and NHA’s other direct receipts, and a further 8% to the Government of Pakistan (GOP) annual
                         maintenance grant. Annual Maintenance Plans (AMP) are increasingly based on detailed condition surveys and HDM-4 network-level strategy and programme analyses and are
                         focusing substantial resources on preventive maintenance activities (functional and structural overlays). The total share of AMP expenditures spent on network preservation (routine
                         maintenance, functional and structural overlays and limited rehabilitation works) has progressively improved, and is expected to account for about 69% of the proposed new
                         commitments during FY 12-13.

                         The Implementation Progress is also on track:

                         (a) Eighteen civil works contracts, currently valued at Rs 42.3 billion amounting to 100% of the total works component are at advanced stages of execution;
                         (b) Sixteen civil works contracts are substantially complete. 1,025 km (99%) of the project length is reopened to traffic. Overall physical progress of 95.4% has been achieved. Gross
                         work valued at Rs 39.6 billion has been certified. On the whole financial progress is 93.7%.
