                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) and Outcome Indicators remain relevant and on track. Major achievements to date include:
                         (a) the road network in poor/very poor condition reduced from 49% to 40.9% against an end of project (EOP) target of 35%;
                         (b) average network-level roughness reduced from 5.4 IRI to 4.2 IRI against an EOP target of 4.4 IRI ­ this 22% reduction represents about 5.0% decrease in vehicle fleet road user
                         costs;
                         (c) Karachi-Peshawar travel time reduced by 16% from 47 hours to 39 hours exceeding the EOP target of 42 hours; and
                         (d) fatalities per 100 km on N-5 decreased by 63% from 107 to 39 fatalities far exceeding the EOP target of 96 fatalities .

                         The Implementation Progress (IP) and Output Indicators are also on track:
                         (a) eighteen civil works contracts, currently valued at Rs 40.39 billion amounting to 100% of the total works component are at advanced stages of execution;
                         (b) thirteen civil works contracts are substantially complete ­ 936 km (96%) of the project length is reopened to traffic ­ and overall physical progress of 72% has been achieved; (c)
                         gross work valued at Rs 27.12 billion has been certified ­ on the whole financial progress is 67%.
