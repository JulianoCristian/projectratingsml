1     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    Sectoral Context: Pakistan’s transport sector is the fourth largest sector contributing
         12% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It accounts for over 21% of gross fixed
         capital formation. The sector constitutes 12 to 15 percent of the annual federal Public
         Sector Development Program (PSDP), and provides about 2.3 million jobs (6% of
         employed labor force). It imposes huge demand on Pakistan’s total energy supply,
         consuming about 35% of total energy annually.

1.1.2    Pakistan’s economy relies almost entirely on road transportation to carry the inland
         freight. Roads carry 96% of the inland freight annually. Pakistan’s traffic movements are
         primarily concentrated along the north-south “Peshawar-Lahore-Karachi” corridor which
         serves domestic needs, and also links the main industrial centers in Punjab and
         neighboring countries in the north-west (Afghanistan) and north (China) with
         international markets through the southern Karachi area ports. Together the ports, road
         and railways along this north-south corridor handle 96% of external trade, 65% of total
         inland freight and serve the regions of the country which contribute 80 to 85 percent of
         GDP. The total road network is about 260,000 km of which about 60% is paved, and
         primarily comprises single and two lane roads. National Highway Authority (NHA) is
         responsible for about 11,000 km long National Highways, Motorways and Strategic
         Roads System. NHA network consists of the main transport corridors which provide
         inter-provincial linkages and connections to the neighboring countries. NHA’s main
         artery along the north-south corridor is the 1760 km long National Highway N-5
         popularly known as the Grand Trunk (G. T.) Road. It serves over 80% of Pakistan’s
         urban population and carries over 60% of the country’s inter-city traffic though its length
         is less than 1% of the total road network of Pakistan. At appraisal in 2003 the following
         key challenges were being faced by the National Highway system:

         a. Poor investment prioritization and portfolio management – poorly justified
             grandiose investments, a bias towards capital constructions over asset conservation,
             and a proliferation of new start-ups without completing ongoing works. This had led
             to limited economic benefits, protracted completion delays and substantial increases
             in completion costs, as well as reduced head room for new high priority initiatives.

         b. Maintenance neglect – at appraisal, about half of NHA’s network was in poor
             condition (40% good, 11% fair and 49% poor/very poor) and NHA needed to spend
             about Rs 3.0 billion annually to simply conserve the network in its present condition.
             However, over the past decade, its maintenance spending covered less than 25% of
             stable network needs and averaged less than 6% of total expenditures. NHA
             depended almost exclusively on grossly inadequate and unpredictable transfers from
             Government’s recurrent budget to finance road maintenance. The persistent bias in
             favor of capital programs, together with the modal shift from rail to road and
             significant increases in vehicle axle loads, caused a rapid and premature deterioration
             of its road assets. The National Highway network developed a huge maintenance
             backlog, which at appraisal required an investment of the order of Rs 35 billion, to
             restore it to acceptable condition. Alternative financing arrangements were clearly
             needed to ensure that network maintenance was fully funded on a timely and
             sustainable basis.



                                                 1
           c. Weak institutional capacity of NHA – the authority was created in 1991 with Bank
               assistance, as an autonomous highway agency with a functional structure and
               decentralized implementation through regional offices at the provincial level. As it
               continued to evolve in response to emerging sectoral demands, NHA needed to
               significantly realign its staffing levels, skills mix and businesses processes, to prepare
               it as a corporatized entity.

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1      Sustainable delivery of a productive and efficient national highway network, contributing
           to lower transportation costs.

1.2.2      Expected outcome was improved traffic flow on the network monitored through
           improvements in the following key outcome indicators relating to: (a) road network
           condition; (b) travel time; and (c) road safety:

           a. Reduction in average Vehicle Operating Costs by 5% [average network-level
              roughness reduced from 5.4 IRI 5 to 4.4 IRI; NHA network in poor condition reduced
              from 49% to 35%];

           b. Reduction in travel time (growth adjusted) on National Highway N-5 (between

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1      Benefits: The project, which formed a part of NHA’s multi-year National Highway
           Improvement Program (NHIP), helped improve the condition of the national highway
           network, lowered transportation costs and travel times. The network level economic
           analysis (based on the Highway Design and Management [HDM-IV] module) indicated
           that the proposed Rs 5.0 billion/year road asset preservation program will reduce the
           average network roughness from about 5.4 IRI to 4.4 IRI, over six years, resulting in a
           5% decrease in road user costs, amounting to a savings of Rs 189 billion (over US$ 3.0
           billion) over this period.

1.4.2      Target Population: Road users and inhabitants/businesses along the densely populated
           National Highway N-5 corridor were identified as direct beneficiaries of the proposed
           investments under the project. In addition, given the competitive market structure of road
           transport in Pakistan, the benefits of lower transport costs and improved network
           operations over the entire national highway network will be passed on to the users
           (shippers and passengers) over the medium term, with benefits for the entire economy.

1.5     Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1     The Project had the following original components:

Component – I: Network Conservation – this consisted of civil works along the National
Highways N-5 and comprised:

      a. Rehabilitation and Improvement of about 550 km of highway (including structures).
      b. Resurfacing and Strengthening of 306 km of highway.
      c. Safety Improvement works at 15 - 20 locations.
      d. Resettlement & Land Acquisition.
      e. Relocation of utilities.
      f. Afforestation (tree planting) along the Project corridors for a length of about 2,500
          avenue km.
      g. Consultancy Services for design, contract administration and construction supervision.

Component – II: Policy Support and Institutional Development – this included technical
assistance, training, equipment support and incremental operating costs:

      a. to help implement improved sub-sectoral policies (Medium Term Budget Framework
          [MTBF] - to improve targeting of public sector resources; Road Maintenance Account
          [RMA] - to provide stable and secure funding for maintenance).
      b. to strengthen NHA institutional capacity, improve performance and efficiency (Corporate
          Strengthening Program: business process re-engineering, improved road asset
          management; improved road safety practices; enhanced environmental management and
          resettlement practices; sector studies and future project preparation).

1.6     Revised Components

1.6.1     The earthquake of October 8, 2005 badly damaged two national highways in the province
          of Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa (KP), namely N-15 (Kaghan Valley Road – KVR), and N-35
          (Karakoram Highway – KKH) that link the rest of Pakistan to the disaster areas. The
          earthquake also very badly damaged a highway in Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJ&K)
          called Jhelum Valley Road (JVR) that links Muzaffarabad (capital of AJ&K) with
          Chakothi at the line of control between Pakistan and India. Component III was added
          through an emergency additional financing operation in December 2005.

Component – III: Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Earthquake Damaged Roads – this
consisted of:

      a. Carrying out of civil works for reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquake damaged
          roads including:
          (i) Reconstruction of about 44 km of National Highway N-15.
          (ii) Rehabilitation of about 25 km of National Highway N-35.
          (iii)Rehabilitation of about 59 km of Jhelum Valley Road.


                                                  3
         (iv) Relocation of utilities, and resettlement and land acquisition.
      b. Provision of technical assistance for design & feasibility, environmental & social
         safeguards, contract administration and construction supervision.
      c. Incremental operating costs.
      d. Front end fee.
      e. Physical & price contingencies.

1.7     Other significant changes

1.7.1    Additional Financings: The project was approved on December 23, 2003 with a Credit
         (Cr. 3846-PK) amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 105.9 million (US$ 150.0
         million equivalent), and a Loan (Ln. 7212-PK) amount of Japanese Yen ¥ 5,605.5 million
         (US$ 50.0 million equivalent) with a Closing Date of June 30, 2009.

         a. An additional loan amount of US$ 100.0 million was approved on December 1, 2005
            for reconstruction and rehabilitation of three strategic roads of national importance
            that were damaged by the earthquake of October 8, 2005. There were no changes in
            the PDO and outcome indicators. There were no complementary changes applicable
            to the institutional arrangements, financial management, disbursement arrangements,
            implementation schedule and closing date.

         b. Another additional loan amount of US$ 65.0 million was approved on March 29,
            2006 to help finance the costs associated with cost overrun resulting from
            significantly higher than expected bid prices for phase-II civil works contracts. There
            were no changes in the project’s DO, outcome/output indicators, design and closing
            date.

         c. And, additional credit amount of SDR 85.7 million (US$ 130.0 million equivalent)
            was approved on September 28, 2010 with a Closing Date of June 30, 2012 for cost
            overrun related to unforeseen and unprecedented market price escalation 6 and repair
            of damages caused by 2010 floods (the worst flooding in over 80 years in Pakistan)
            and landslide remediation works. There were no changes in the PDO and
            outcome/output indicators.

1.7.2    Closing Date Extensions:

         a. In March 2009, the Closing Date of original Financings (Cr.3846-PK, Ln.7212-PK)
            and the first and second Additional Financings (Ln.7341-PK and Ln.7376-PK) was
            extended by 18-months to December 31, 2010.

         b. In August 2010, the Closing Date for the original Financings (Cr.3846-PK, Ln.7212-
            PK) and the first and second Additional Financings (Ln.7341-PK and Ln.7376-PK)
            was extended by five and half months from December 31, 2010 to June 15, 2011.




6
  The project significantly underestimated the price contingency (7.5% at appraisal versus 64% actual), and
this partly explained the need for additional financing.


                                                    4
           c. In April 2011, the Closing Dates of the original Financings (Cr. 3846-PK, Ln. 7212-
              PK) and the first and second Additional Financings (Ln. 7341-PK and Ln. 7376-PK)
              were made coterminous with the third Additional Financing (Cr. 4816-PK).

           d. In June 2012, the project was restructured to extend the Closing Date of the third
              Additional Financing (Cr. 4816-PK) by a period of twelve (12) months from June 30,
              2012 to June 30, 2013. This extension took the third Additional Financing (Cr. 4816-
              PK) more than 3 years beyond the original planned Closing Date. It was a Level 2
              restructuring since the PDO remained unchanged, the environmental assessment
              category of the project also remained unchanged, and no new safeguards policy was
              triggered.

2      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1      Project Preparation: The project concept was reviewed in January 1999 and the appraisal
           was completed in April/May 2003. During preparation phase, the Bank’s decision to
           “pause” preparation 7 resulted in a nearly 2-year delay and discontinuity in the project
           preparation. In spite of that, at appraisal, detailed engineering designs and environmental
           and social safeguards instruments for phase-1 civil work contracts were complete. NHA
           had received the bids for 8 phase-1 contract packages (the cost estimates in the Project
           Appraisal Document – PAD – were based on actual bid prices). NHA had also received
           the technical and financial proposals for construction supervision consultant services.

2.1.2      Design: The project design was fairly simple with manageable components and a single
           implementing agency. The design envisaged that the Bank would finance reduction of
           maintenance back-log while the Government and NHA implemented key road sector
           reforms. In specific terms, the project design sought to address the following core
           challenges, namely, (i) reduction of maintenance backlog  Network Conservation, (ii)
           sustainable financing of maintenance  Road Maintenance Account – RMA, (iii) a bias
           towards capital constructions over asset conservation, and a proliferation of new start-ups
           without completing ongoing works  Medium-Term Budget Framework – MTBF, (iv)
           progressive commercialization with a focus on network operator/service provider role 
           Corporate Strengthening Program. The identified core challenges were sought to be
           addressed through two designated project components: Component I: Network
           Conservation and Component II: Policy Support and Institutional Development. The
           early phase of project preparation took a programmatic approach to addressing the
           rehabilitation and resurfacing needs of the entire NHA network. However, the results of
           the network level economic prioritization showed that network needs were dominated by
           the requirements of National Highway N-5 by virtue of the high traffic levels along this
           north-south corridor. The project physical works were therefore restricted to the
           rehabilitation and/or improvement of specific sections of National Highway N-5 only.

2.1.3      The key lessons learned from previous highway projects, and reflected in the project
           design, included: (i) keeping project design simple and flexible; (ii) implementation
           readiness – improving project preparation to include complete detailed engineering
           designs and bid documents, contractor pre-qualification, and essential pre-construction

         activities prior to contract awards; (iii) holding the highway agency accountable for
         performance to external clients/road users to ensure institutionalization of sound
         maintenance management practices; (iv) the need for measures to minimize the adverse
         impact of vehicle overloading to sustain highway network improvements; and (v) the
         need for stronger financial systems and controls.

2.1.4    Risks Analysis: At appraisal, the project was assigned a rating of “Substantial Risk”
         based on identification and analysis of a total of six critical risks. Of these, four risks
         were rated as “Substantial”, viz, (i) absence of competent, professional management in
         NHA; failure to provide strong leadership, good governance and transparent decision
         making; (ii) no improvement in enforcement of axle-load control over network; (iii)
         GOP/NHA non-compliance with agreed MTBF & Highway Investment and Maintenance
         Program; and (iv) NHA not operating the RMA according to agreed Rules and Standard
         Operating Procedures (SOP). The remaining two risks were rated as moderate, viz, (i)
         ineffective Traffic Management and Enforcement along N-5 due to inadequate
         collaboration between NHA and National Highway and Motorway Police (NH&MP)
         Force; and (ii) lack of timely site-readiness, including land acquisition and Resettlement
         Policy Framework (RPF) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) implementation.
         In reality, there was little improvement in axle-load control over network. This risk
         should have been rated “High”. Major unforeseen risks included: (i) enormous increase in
         the road construction costs driven by sharp oil price increases in the world market; (ii)
         shortages in supply of bitumen; and (iii) adverse security situation. These could not have
         been predicted at the time of project appraisal.

2.2     Implementation

2.2.1    The project was declared effective on February 27, 2004 and notices to commence civil
         works for 8 phase-I contracts were issued during June-October 2004. Notices to
         commence civil works for 7 phase-II contracts were issued as follows: 4 contracts in
         August 2005 and the remaining 3 contracts during February-August 2006. Notices to
         commence civil works for 3 earthquake damaged roads contracts were issued in May
         2007. Implementation started on a satisfactory track but slipped into slow track due to
         cash flow problems caused by unprecedented increase in international oil prices and
         shortages of bitumen. Three contracts 8 were completed in 2006, three in 2007 and two
         each in 2008 and 2009 before the original Closing Date. The remaining eight contracts
         required extension of time. The following paragraphs summarize the major events which
         had a significant impact on implementation of the project as well as the remedial actions
         taken to mitigate these impacts:

         a. International Oil Price Hike & Increase in Road Construction Costs: There were
            enormous increases in the road construction costs driven by the unprecedented oil
            price increase in the world market – US$ 35 per barrel in 2003 peaking at US$ 148 in
            July 2008. The oil price hike had a global multiplier effect on the price of bitumen –
            an oil based binder used in the construction of asphalt concrete pavements 9 . A

 The contractors earned bonus for early completion.

 According to the State of New Jersey Department of Transportation, the price of bitumen increased by
252% from US$ 177.5 per metric ton in 2003 to US$ 625.0 per metric ton in March 2012 – US$ 447.5 per
metric ton increase over the past 11 years.

                Severe cash-flow problems necessitated insertion of price escalation clauses in
                phase-I contracts 10 and rationalization of the fixed and variable ratios in phase-II
                contracts for better alignment with the market dynamics.

           b. Shortages in Supply of Bitumen: In 2006, the two local refineries, which produce
              bitumen in Pakistan, were utilizing only about 25% of their capacity for bitumen
              production and the remaining 75% for furnace oil production for electricity
              generation (to meet the increasing energy crisis). Exports to Afghanistan further
              reduced the limited local supplies. The GOP/NHA took some pro-active measures to
              ensure un-interrupted supplies of bitumen including direct purchase of special quota
              for the Project contracts from both the refineries and facilitating the contractors to
              import bitumen. The Government reduced the Custom Duty from 25% to 5%; and
              abolished the Federal Duty of Rs 2,000 per ton to bring price of imported bitumen at
              par with the locally produced bitumen. NHA provided additional advance to the HRP
              contractors for import of bitumen. An analysis of time-overrun indicates that
              shortage of bitumen accounted for about 37% of Extensions of Time (EOT) on civil
              works contracts.

           c. Adverse Security Situation: The US/NATO led post-9/11 war against terror in
              Afghanistan also impacted the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and
              Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province. Two civil works contracts under the Project
              which were located in KP province directly suffered from the adverse security
              conditions; namely Contract 14: Peshawar-Nowshera, and Contract 15: Batgram-
              Thakot. Contract 14 was awarded to an international construction firm. Their
              expatriate staff had to be relocated to Islamabad from Peshawar for their personal
              security and they were forced to abandon their quarry site near Peshawar and had to
              transport construction materials from a quarry site near Islamabad with much longer
              haulage distance. On Contract 14, security problems accounted for about 40% of
              Extension of Time (EOT). On Contract 15, the militants blew two bridges resulting in
              additional cost and time for reconstruction. Security problems forced some expatriate
              staff of the supervision consultant (SMEC) 11 to leave Pakistan and made it difficult to
              make alternate arrangements.


   10
      NHA had experienced recurrent cost overruns on works awarded on detailed design, ad-measured, item
   rate basis due to design changes during implementation. Some contracts therefore were on design-build,
   lump-sum, fixed price basis and phase-I rehabilitation contracts were without price escalation.

2.2.2   Notwithstanding the above external events that were clearly outside the control of the
        implementing agency and the borrower and impeded the project implementation
        progress, NHA, contractors and construction supervision consultant displayed
        resilience and commitment and ensured that the works were completed with quality. As
        a result, the Implementation Progress (IP) and Output Indicators remained on track and IP
        was rated ‘Satisfactory’ almost throughout project implementation – 1,035 km (100%)
        of the project length was reopened to traffic a few months prior to the project extended
        closing date.

2.2.3   The Policy Support and Institutional Development Component was implemented
        largely along the lines envisaged at the time of appraisal.

        a. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and NHA adopted a mutually agreed Medium-
           Term Budget Framework (MTBF) to improve targeting of scarce public sector
           resources, by rationalizing allocations across construction, rehabilitation and
           maintenance. The MTBF included an indicative highway investment and
           maintenance program and prioritization criteria. Prioritization criteria required that
           there is a progressive increase in the share of expenditures on network conservation.
           The Government has managed to increase the share of total expenditure on network
           conservation to about 66% – 20% higher than the target of 55%.

        b. NHA enhanced resource mobilization through creation and operation of a
           dedicated Road Maintenance Account (RMA), financed from earmarked road user
           revenues (including enhanced tolls) to provide an adequate, secure and stable
           source of funding for maintenance of the national highway network. RMA
            receipts have gone up from Rs 3.91 billion in FY 02-03 to Rs 17.78 billion in
            FY 11-12 (a Compound Annual Growth of about 354%).

                                        RMA Receipts




        c. NHA undertook a Corporate Strengthening Program:

             (i)    A Human Resource Development (HRD) Strategy & Action Plan (inter alia
                    defining the Authority’s overall HR framework and priorities) was
                    established; intensified recruitment actions achieved some new staffing in


                                               8
                     key NHA areas; the Authority secured a combination of the ‘HRD Adviser’
                     and ‘HRD/Training program delivery’ consultancy services; a Training
                     Needs Assessment (TNA) was carried out and a special 2-year Catch-up
                     Training Program was implemented; and the rate of participation by middle
                     and senior level NHA staff in specialist external training/development
                     programs was considerably increased.

             (ii)    A Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) study was undertaken. An IT
                     consultant was hired to act as “Change Agent” in NHA for the introduction
                     of advanced Financial Management and comprehensive Management
                     Information System (MIS) facilities to support the rapidly evolving NHA
                     accounting and business management demands. However, NHA decided to
                     terminate the services of the BPR consultants, in reflection of various
                     unsatisfactory aspects of their capabilities and performance.

            (iii)    An Action Plan to improve financial management and internal controls
                     was implemented – audited 12 NHA financial statements are current and show
                     a progressive decline in the number of qualifications.

             (iv)    A modern ‘Road Asset Management System (RAMS)’ was developed and is
                     under implementation. A full-time Director (RAMS) was notified who is
                     now being supported by 1 x Deputy Director (Bridges); 4 x Assistant
                     Director (Engineering); 1 x Assistant Director (Computer Programming); 1 x
                     Data Base Officer; and 8 x Enumerators.

             (v)     A National Highway Safety Council Secretariat was set up/staffed and
                     housed in the Ministry of Communications (MOC). The Secretariat
                     developed a National Road Safety Plan. Safety Awareness Campaigns were
                     conducted in nineteen cities along the project reaches. Three road safety
                     awareness seminars were also arranged. Media Campaign was launched
                     under the Project. Driver and school children education pilots were also
                     launched. Extensive stakeholder meetings were held for the enforcement of
                     safety plan. The Project conducted road safety audits along its corridor and
                     implemented black-spot improvements. Appropriate engineering measures
                     were implemented under the project to improve safety of road sections
                     through urbanized areas and in construction/maintenance work zones.

             (vi)    The Effective Weight Control Management Study was completed, which
                     documents the extent of the overloading problem on the network - which has
                     significant implications for the overall road network condition and annual
                     maintenance funding needs. The study discusses the complex set of
                     underlying causes for this behavior and includes recommendations on
                     specific mitigation measures and their sequencing to address this challenge
                     over the medium term.




12
  At appraisal audited NHA financial statements were available up to FY 97-98 only; NHA fixed asset
accounting was incomplete/un-reconciled


                                                   9
            (vii)    The research for developing improved pavement design procedures for
                     Pakistan got underway. A state-of-the-art laboratory has been set up at the
                     Highway Research and Training Centre (HRTC) under the Project.

2.2.4    A Mid-Term Review (MTR) was conducted in December 2006. The MTR confirmed
         that the Government remained committed to the project and the PDO remained relevant
         and on track. The Project Outcome Indicators continued to be achievable. The likelihood
         that the Project would achieve its PDO was thus rated as ‘Satisfactory’. The MTR
         established that the project implementation and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
         arrangements were adequate. The Project Management Unit (PMU) at Islamabad
         continued to function well and all the Project Coordinators, Deputy Project Coordinators
         and supporting staff were in place in the regions. NHA was regularly furnishing the Bank
         with monthly progress reports and quarterly Financial Management Reports (FMRs).

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1    M&E Design: The project included performance monitoring indicators to monitor
         progress and the extent of achievement of the PDO during implementation. The project
         envisaged to monitor the achievement of the PDO through measuring the benefits to road
         users in terms of reductions in: (a) vehicle operating costs (i.e. reductions in fuel and oil
         consumption and vehicle maintenance costs due to better quality of the road network), (b)
         travel time and (c) fatal road accidents along the project corridor. The overall monitoring
         and evaluation (M&E) function was the responsibility of NHA with the assistance of
         consultants in various aspects of data collection. The institutional strengthening
         component was monitored through progress defined by consultant reports. However, the
         indicators for some of the activities under the institutional strengthening component
         could have been more precise. For example, completion of axle load management study.
         Mere occurrence of such event/output may not be a sufficient evidence of tangible
         improvement in the overload control. A more effective approach could have been to
         specify percentage reduction in overloading.

2.3.2    M&E Implementation and Utilization: The project monitored indicators for outcomes,
         intermediate results and outputs, which included baseline data at appraisal. Data on
         network-level road condition and roughness (ride quality) was collected every year while
         travel time data was collected at mid-term and at the end of the project. The PDO
         indicators were sufficiently appropriate for broad decision making and resource
         allocation purposes.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1    Environmental Aspects: Satisfactory.

         a. The project undertook an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for both phase-1
            and phase-II of the Project. The analysis therein indicated an increase in long-term
            economic activity and the improvement in the standard of life of the people as the
            major positive impacts of the proposed Project. The assessment also presented the
            negative impacts of the project, which were mostly related to the construction stage
            only and included soil erosion, air quality deterioration, improper disposal of spoil,
            contamination of soil and water, loss of vegetation, displacement of population,
            disturbance to people, disruption of traffic and some possible impacts on the health
            and safety of general public and workers. During the operation phase, the impacts


                                                 10
               included increase in greenhouse gasses emissions due mainly to the increased volume
               of traffic. Recommendations to offset these effects included planting trees along the
               road to work as carbon sinks. About 837,000 trees were planted along the project
               corridor on a length of about 2,500 roadside kilometers under the Network
               Conservation Component.

          b. In terms of implementation challenges of Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
             there were initial slippages due mainly to capacity limitations. However, the project
             put in relevant measures to address institutional capacity and implementation
             constraints to ensure compliance with the EMP. Environment focal persons were
             nominated in the Project Management Unit (PMU) as well as with the contractors.
             These measures also included conducting trainings on EMP implementation both for
             the project field staff and contractors’ environmental staff. Further, soil, air and water
             testing was carried out in the project impact zone to monitor any potential impacts.
             The project conducted a biannual third party audit to assess EMP implementation
             effectiveness and was found compliant on most parameters. NHA set up an
             Environmental Management Unit which provides environmental safeguards support
             on other non-Bank funded projects.

          c. The overall Environmental Safeguards Management for the Earthquake Damaged
             Roads Component was very challenging. The three roads which were damaged by the
             earthquake of October 8, 2005 are located in extremely in-hospitable mountainous
             terrain with very harsh weather environments. These conditions posed serious issues
             of stability of hill slopes given the immature geology of the project area. Some 100
             plus vulnerable locations prone to landslides and high erosion potential were
             identified. Disposal of landslide debris posed a significant challenge due to space
             constraints. The project introduced soil bio-engineering measures to stabilize
             mountain slopes in Pakistan and employed innovative techniques that included
             terracing slopes with plantation (trees, shrubs and grasses) and engineering measures
             (check-damming, cutoff drains, retaining walls).

2.4.2     Social Safeguards: Moderately Satisfactory.

          a. At the time of appraisal in 2003, the magnitude of land acquisition and displacement
             triggered by this project was negligible – 6 hectares of land 13 and impact on about
             350 project affected persons (PAPs). Social Impact Assessments (SIAs) were carried
             out for both phase-I and phase-II of the project accompanied by the Resettlement
             Policy Framework (RPF). Extensive stakeholder consultations were carried out while
             conducting SIA studies for the project. The key social impacts of the project included
             land acquisition, loss of trees, loss of income of the local businesses, noise and
             vibration, safety hazards and relocation of public infrastructure. All PAPs were
             eligible for compensation and rehabilitation assistance, irrespective of land
             ownership status, to ensure that those affected by the project were at least as well off,
             if not better off than they would have been without the Project. The compensation
             packages reflected replacement costs for all losses (such as lands, crops, trees,
             structures, businesses and income).




13
     Primarily, the construction works were confined within the NHA’s existing Right-of-Way (RoW).


                                                    11
        b. A grievance redressal system managed by NHA’s Project/Deputy Project
           Coordinators maintained a community complaints-management register to record
           grievances brought forward by affected communities, and ensured that those were
           timely and appropriately addressed. Limited capacity within NHA to understand and
           address social development issues was addressed through a social development
           training plan. The project achieved its Social Development Outcomes satisfactorily.
           Land was acquired following the Land Acquisition Act (LAA), 1894 and the agreed
           upon RPF ensuring payment of compensation in a fair and transparent manner.
           Livelihoods of PAPs were preserved by resettling them as quickly as possible at a
           nearby location within the Right of Way (RoW); livelihood assistance was provided
           when the relocation was delayed.

        c. However, management of social safeguards became a significant challenge once the
           Earthquake Damaged Roads Component was included in the Project. This
           Component involved acquisition of about 1,007 Kanals of land valued at about Rs
           108 million (US$ 1.1 million). Of which, Rs 76.5 million (US$ .78 million) i.e. 72%
           compensation has been paid to the PAPs. The balance amount of about Rs 31 million
           (US$ 0.32 million) is with the Land Revenue Departments (LRDs) of the province of
           KP and the state of AJ&K. This balance amount pertains to persons who died during
           the earthquake or have left the disaster areas and have moved to other parts of the
           country (and are not traceable), disputed claims in the courts, shamlat land cases (i.e.
           multiple joint land owners with entitlement amounts less than US$ 100 who are
           unwilling to open a Bank account). The court cases are unlikely to be resolved in the
           near future. However, the compensations shall eventually be paid upon settlement of
           court cases since the compensation amounts are already deposited and held in escrow
           accounts with the LRDs.

2.4.3   Procurement: Satisfactory

        a. The project had 15 civil works contracts under the Network Conservation Component
           and 3 civil works contracts under the Earthquake Damaged Roads Component. The
           15 civil works contracts under the Network Conservation Component were procured
           in accordance with the provisions of Section I of the “Guidelines for Procurement
           under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” January 1995, and revised in January and
           August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999. Eight “Rehabilitation” contracts
           were procured as lump-sum, design-build contracts on the basis of outline designs
           prepared by NHA through design consultants. One “Rehabilitation” contract which
           also involved upgrading a 50 km contract length from 4 to 6-lanes, and the six
           “Resurfacing and Recycling” contracts were procured as admeasured, item rate
           contracts on the basis of detailed design prepared by NHA through design
           consultants. The fifteen civil works contracts were procured in two phases, staggered
           by about 14-months (eight contracts in phase-1 and seven contracts in phase-2).

        b. All 3 civil works contracts under the Earthquake Damaged Roads Component were
           procured under “Direct Contracting” (DC) method – Para 3.6(e) of the Bank’s
           Procurement Guidelines – using the Bank’s standard ICB large works contract
           document 14.


14
  The permission was obtained from Vice President & Head of Network, Operations Policy and Country
Services (OPCS).


                                                12
         c. In addition, there were several packages of consultancies, some related to civil works
            (such as supervision) and the balance under the institutional strengthening component.
            Some goods were also procured under the institutional strengthening component.
            Despite some delays, the procurement aspects, in general, were effectively managed
            and made significant positive contribution to the preparation (e.g., pre-qualification
            for 8 phase-I contracts) and implementation (e.g. pro-active contract management) of
            the project. On the whole, the procurement of works, goods, and services was carried
            out in accordance with Bank guidelines and the procurement plan was updated each
            year and also as and when necessary. The procurement process was conducted in a
            fair and transparent manner. No complaints were received concerning the
            procurement process.

         d. Initial procurement plan for NHA was made keeping in mind that the packages be
            large enough to warrant response from international bidders. As the response was
            almost nil, packages were amended to widen the market base. In this round, generally
            local firms participated, but given the limited number of local contractors in road
            sector, the competition was not robust. The potentially qualified market players
            reached the ceiling of their bid capacity, leaving a smaller market to respond to the
            next round of bidding.

2.4.4    Financial Management: Satisfactory.

         a. At appraisal in 2003, NHA’s audited financial statements were available up to FY 98
            only with unverified closing balance; fixed asset accounting was
            incomplete/unreconciled; and RMA accounts not audited. To address these issues a
            “Financial Management Improvement Plan (FMIP)” was agreed with NHA. Under
            the FMIP, NHA's financial management capacity was enhanced by engaging
            qualified professional staff, the entity’s books of account for FY’s 91-98 were re-
            written, opening balance of FY 91 was verified and was incorporated in accounts of
            FY 98, accounts for the FY 99 through FY 04 were not only prepared as per
            International Accounting Standards (IAS) but also got audited by the commercial
            auditors. As a result of FMIP, commercially audited NHA agency level financial
            statements and audited RMA accounts are current.

         b. Accrual accounting was implemented with effect from July 1, 2003 to reflect the true
            position of liabilities and assets in the monthly/periodic accounts. Effective internal
            controls were introduced by adequate segregation of duties. Internal controls were
            further strengthened with the induction of accounting staff with commerce and
            accounting background. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was issued for
            processing payments to contractors and suppliers. The SOP lays down in detail the
            steps to be followed for verification and checking of bills.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1    The ICR mission discussed and agreed with NHA a post-completion sustainability plan.
         NHA is currently focussing on completion of post-construction activities such as issuance
         of Taking Over Certificates (TOCs) and Defect Liability Certificates (DLCs). The Project
         reaches/corridor(s) have been taken over by the Operations Wing of NHA. The
         Operations Wing is managing the Road Maintenance Account (RMA) and is responsible
         for Operations & Maintenance (O&M) of the NHA network. A Road Asset Management
         Directorate (RAMD) under the Operations Wing prepares Annual Maintenance Plans


                                                13
         (AMP) using a modern ‘Road Asset Management System (RAMS)’ which was
         developed under the Project. The AMPs are based on detailed condition surveys and
         HDM-4 network-level strategy and programme analyses, and allocate substantial
         resources on preventive maintenance activities (functional and structural overlays). The
         total share of AMP expenditures spent on network preservation (routine maintenance,
         functional and structural overlays) has progressively improved 15, and accounted for
         about 88% of the maintenance activities during FY 11-12.

2.5.2    NHA has also procured a multi-year slope stabilization maintenance contract for the
         three highways damaged by the 2005 earthquake. This maintenance contract shall be
         financed from RMA. Similarly, NHA has a contract with a consulting firm for
         maintenance of about 837,000 trees planted along the National Highway N-5 till 2016.

3     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1    The PAD correctly identified the key constraints and opportunities of the National
         Highway system. The PDO of sustainable delivery of a productive and efficient national
         highway network, contributing to lower transportation costs was relevant and continued
         to be valid throughout project implementation.

         a. The Government recognizes that transport and trade logistics efficiencies are a
            must for economic stabilization, sustained growth and international
            competitiveness. Supportive transport infrastructure remains one of the pre-requisites
            for sustained high economic growth. This was identified by the Government as a
            priority in the 2003-06 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-I) and confirmed in
            the PRSP-II for 2006-11 which envisaged a National Trade Corridor Improvement
            Program (NTCIP) with the objective of reducing the cost of transport and trade
            logistics and bringing services' quality to international standards in order to reduce
            the cost of doing business in Pakistan, enhance the country’s exports competitiveness,
            and accelerate its industrialization, thus contributing towards achievement of middle
            income country status by 2030. The Project is also aligned with the current
            government priorities. The new Government 16 has announced up-gradation of road
            infrastructure as one of its top priorities.

         b. At appraisal the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covered the period FY 03-06,
            and it identified three pillars of Bank assistance strategy: (i) strengthen
            macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness, (ii) improve the business
            environment for growth, and (iii) improve equity through support of pro-poor and
            pro-gender equity policies. The Project supported items (i) and (ii) of Bank
            assistance strategy. The reforms supported by the Project aimed to improve
            governance, enhance resource mobilization and improve targeting of NHA's
            considerable share of the overall public sector expenditures. The physical works

                                                 14
             financed by the Project were aimed at lowering transportation costs and improving
             traffic safety on the national highway network. Improvements in transport are
             essential to achieving Pakistan’s economic growth and poverty reduction objectives.

         c. The operation was also fully consistent with the strategic objective of the FY 06-09
            CAS to remove infrastructure bottlenecks, support sustained economic growth and
            improve competitiveness. The CAS identified the need for significant investment in
            Pakistan's infrastructure, in particular for the modernization of the National Trade
            Corridor, to support Pakistan's growth and service delivery goals.

         d. Finally, the Project was fully aligned with the current FY 10-14 Country
            Partnership Strategy (CPS), falling under Pillar 2 – ‘Improving Infrastructure to
            Promote Growth’. Under Pillar 2, the current CPS seeks to ‘improve efficiency and
            reliability of the transport and logistics network’.

         e. In view of the above, the relevance of the PDO was substantial/significant.

3.1.2    The Project design had a balanced mix of civil works and institutional strengthening
         component, which were closely aligned. The Projects results framework is found to be
         logically consistent as the selected set of outcome and output indicators provided a fair
         measure of the achievement of the overall PDO. The Project design also remained largely
         relevant throughout the life of the project, although it underwent several amendments at
         the request of the Borrower to facilitate project implementation under deteriorating
         macroeconomic and security conditions e.g. changes to disbursement percentages. The
         other amendments involved changes to the project components and extensions of the
         closing date in response to natural disasters (2005 earthquake, 2010 floods, 2011
         monsoon rains), showing an appropriate level of flexibility by the Bank. However, in
         hindsight, given the unforeseen and unprecedented international oil price hike and its
         adverse impact on road construction costs and contractors cash-flow, and resultantly
         somewhat slower than expected implementation progress, the original implementation
         period of five-and-a-half years ending in June 2009, was too short. However, given the
         fact that 1,035 km (100%) of the project length was reopened to traffic a few months
         prior to the extended closing date of the project, the overall design rating for relevance
         and implementation is Satisfactory.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1    The project achieved its objective of sustainable delivery of a productive and efficient
         national highway network, contributing to lower transportation costs, through
         improved traffic flow measured by improved ride quality (reduced vehicle operating
         costs) as well as reduced travel time between Peshawar and Karachi. The project
         achieved – and in some cases, exceeded – the targets with regard to all the four
         outcome/impact indicators as detailed below. Major achievements include:

         a. The road network in poor/very poor condition reduced from 49% to 35% against an
            end of project (EOP) target of 35%.




                                                15
           b. Average network-level roughness reduced from 5.4 IRI to 4.49 IRI 17 against an EOP
              target of 4.4 IRI – this 17% reduction represents about 5.0% decrease on the vehicle
              fleet road user costs.

           c. Peshawar-Karachi travel time reduced by 16% from 47 hours to 39 hours exceeding
              the EOP target of 42 hours.

           d. Fatalities per 100 km on N-5 decreased by 63% from 107 to 39 fatalities far
              exceeding the EOP target of 96 fatalities.

3.2.2      The first two outcomes were facilitated by increasing the: (a) share of total expenditure
           on network conservation from 38% to 66% – 20% higher than the EOP target of 55%,
           and (b) annual maintenance financing from Rs 5.0 billion in FY 02-03 to Rs 17.3 billion
           in FY 12-13 – a 247% increase.

                                          Annual Maintenance Funding




3.2.3      The last two outcomes are directly linked with rehabilitation and improvement works
           on National Highway N-5 between Peshawar and Karachi – 907 km of N-5
           rehabilitated/resurfaced/recycled.

3.2.4      The project also laid a good foundation for sustaining these outcomes as evidenced
           from 247% increase in maintenance funding. This is due to significant increase in NHA
           direct receipts. As mentioned in paragraph 2.2.3 b RMA receipts have gone up from Rs
           3.91 billion in FY 02-03 to Rs 17.78 billion in FY 11-12 (a Compound Annual Growth of
           about 354%).

3.3      Efficiency




17
     Last ISR reports IRI = 4.7 – this is based on 2012 survey. The above value is based on 2013 survey.


                                                      16
3.3.1    The efficiency in achieving the PDO is Satisfactory. The cost-benefit analysis of the 18
         civil works contracts under the Project was undertaken. The economic analysis followed
         exactly the same methodology adopted at appraisal. It was carried out using the Highway
         Development and Management Model (HDM-IV), taking into account the estimated
         economic cost, current road condition, traffic volume and its projected growth. The
         results indicate that the investment on the 18 contracts is economically justified, with the
         Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) ranging from 13% for Contract 15 and 51% for
         Contract 12D. With these rates of return, the overall economic rationale of the project
         remains strong with an overall EIRR of 26% as against the threshold of 12%.

3.3.2    EIRR at appraisal was 33%. Comparison of current EIRR with appraisal estimates
         shows a decrease of 18% in Project rate of return. However, this decrease is marginal.
         The current EIRR is 117% above the cutoff EIRR.

3.3.3    These results are in line with the sensitivity analysis/switching values at Appraisal,
         which showed that for phase-I contracts, costs would have to increase by 227 percent or
         benefits reduced by 69 percent to yield the cutoff 12% EIRR. And, for phase-II contracts,
         costs would have to increase by 191 percent or benefits reduced by 65 percent to yield an
         IRR equal to 12%. The impact of higher prices on the rates of return has been moderated
         by the significant growth in traffic volumes and a significant reduction in maintenance
         costs and traffic delays. Details are at Annex-3.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

3.4.1    The overall outcome is rated Satisfactory taking into account the substantial
         /significant relevance of the PDO and achievement of Outcome Indicators, satisfactory
         overall design rating for relevance and implementation progress notwithstanding the
         Closing Date extensions which were necessitated due to natural disasters/external
         factors outside the control of the Project (such as 2005 earthquake, 2008 international
         oil price hike, 2010 floods, adverse security environment), and satisfactory/robust
         economic efficiency in achieving the PDO.

3.4.2    The Project met all its physical targets – 1,035 km (100%) of the project length was
         reopened to traffic a few months prior to closing-out of the project. Similarly, the Project
         substantially met its policy and institutional development targets as explained in
         paragraph 2.2.3 above.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1    There was no study on poverty impacts or gender aspects undertaken during the
         preparation of the Project.

      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2    As seen in Section 2.2.3 achievement of the policy support and institutional
         development has been largely satisfactory. Notable progress was achieved in: (i) road
         asset management system, (ii) financial management improvement plan, (iii) human
         resource development strategy and action plan, (iv) road safety, and (v) environmental
         and social safeguards. All of these good practices have already been mainstreamed. There


                                                 17
         are several other notable positive directional changes, viz.; (i) widespread use of
         computers/IT systems in day-to-day working, (ii) introduction of electronic tolling (e-
         tolling) to minimize/eliminate toll leakages, (iii) a strong emphasis on environment
         friendly roads (tree plantation, soil bioengineering for slope stabilization, recycling of
         pavements, etc.), (iv) regular stakeholder consultations and reports in public domain, (v)
         dissemination of procurement-related information on NHA’s website, and (vi) increased
         use of external experts to bridge the skill/resource gaps within NHA, especially in the
         areas of detailed engineering design, traffic studies, and preparation of technical and/or
         feasibility reports.

      (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.3    There were no noticeable/irreversible negative impacts and on the positive side, at least
         three practices from the Project – namely, road safety audit/awareness campaigns &
         black-spot improvements along with commercial/day-lighted pedestrian underpasses
         (clean and safe for use by women), mainstreaming of good environmental practices, and
         private negotiations for land acquisition – have received wide recognition by road users
         and public at large.

3.5.4    In addition, NHA has introduced several technologies worthy of note: Solar and wind
         powered street lighting and vehicular underpasses at the Lahore-Gujranwala section and
         in-situ hot and cold pavement recycling on National Highway N-5. Other innovations
         include state-of-the art structural (avalanche galleries) and soil bioengineering
         applications for slope stabilization in mountainous terrain, especially in rock strata
         disturbed by the 2005 Earthquake. This experience has been transferred to Timor Leste
         under a grant from the South-South Exchange Facility. Better management of landslides
         will ensure more reliable operations on the recently-opened trade corridor between the
         Pakistani- and Indian–administered parts of Kashmir, as well as on the alternate Kaghan
         Valley Road link to the Karakoram Highway.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable.

4     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
      Rating: Moderate

4.1     The risk that the achieved development outcomes may not be sustained is Moderate.
        Note that the project formed part of the GOP’s/NHA’s National Highway Improvement
        Program (NHIP) which is aimed at increasing the quality and reliability of the national
        highways, through phased improvement of about 11,000 km national network using both
        GOP’s own, RMA and multi/bi-lateral donor resources. The Bank financed a segment of
        NHIP works.

4.2     The RMA revenues are sufficient enough to finance about 80% of stable network needs.
        In addition, other development partners (ADB, JICA and Government of China) are also
        actively supporting NHA’s network conservation and improvement efforts.

4.3     With regards to sustaining the policy and institutional reforms, the NHA appears to be
        committed as evidenced by its persistence with adopted reforms under the Project and
        senior management deep understanding of the issues. However, the risk of roll back


                                                18
        remains present, in case of significant turnover/political appointments at top management
        level. However, the risk appears to be ‘low’ given the strong commitment shown by the
        new government to good governance and strong/professional leadership.

5     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry – Satisfactory

5.1.1    The Bank’s performance during the preparatory period was satisfactory with regard to
         strategic relevance and approach, technical, financial and economic analysis, and
         paying adequate attention to fiduciary and safeguards and monitoring & evaluation
         arrangements. The team’s interaction and inputs at this phase played a significant role in
         arriving at a project design that was focused on key challenges at that time and choice of
         components that directly addressed the challenges within the project’s budget and time
         limitations. The project design was kept fairly simple with manageable components and a
         single implementing agency. In hindsight, the Policy Support and Institutional
         Strengthening component was a bit too ambitious, though very relevant to the project
         design.

5.1.2    At effectiveness, the detailed engineering designs and environmental and social
         safeguards instruments for phase-1 civil work contracts were complete. NHA had
         received the bids for 8 phase-1 contract packages. NHA had also received the technical
         and financial proposals for construction supervision consultant services. Advance
         completion of these pre-construction activities helped timely commencement of civil
         works on a satisfactory/fast track.

(b) Quality of Supervision – Satisfactory

5.1.3    The quality of the supervision is rated satisfactory. The Bank had been fully engaged
         with the client during the implementation of all planned activities, paying due attention to
         the client’s priorities and preferences as well as the Bank’s fiduciary and safeguards
         requirements. Adequate numbers of staff with requisite skills and expertise in technical
         and safeguards’ functions were engaged in supporting implementation including through
         regular monthly/bi-monthly meetings (as needed) and formal missions at regular intervals.
         In addition to in-country staff, the Bank mobilized services of reputed international
         experts in the areas of road asset management, road safety, human resource development
         and business process re-engineering. Their input was deeply appreciated by NHA. The
         team provided high-quality advice and proposed solutions to remove implementation
         bottlenecks (e.g. introduction of price adjustment clause in phase-I contracts, increase in
         price adjustment ceiling in phase-II contracts, additional advances to contractors
         secured through Joint Escrow Accounts, reduction in retention money amounts, payments
         for materials at site as secured pay items, arrangements of a special quota for bitumen
         from refineries for the project, reduction in duties and taxes on imported bitumen, taking
         over of parts etc.).

5.1.4    The mission management letters and aide-memoires suggest comprehensive attention to
         all the three components, duly highlighting the achievements as well as areas of concern,
         along with suggestions for addressing the proximate challenges. It is particularly
         noteworthy that the supervision has been fairly alert and responsive to unforeseen


                                                 19
         developments such as the need for addressing road sections damaged on account of 2005
         earthquake, 2010 floods, and 2011 monsoon rains and also to other project needs such as
         extending the closing date and additional financings. Major problem areas such as, delays
         in according approvals to design changes/variation orders and in land acquisition
         (earthquake damaged roads) were identified early on and persistently followed up
         through to their satisfactory resolution. The key issues in implementation were also
         regularly and candidly brought to the attention of the sector and country management
         through the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) and the guidance received was
         promptly acted upon. The ISR ratings assigned to the quality of implementation provide a
         fairly accurate reflection of the project’s performance in the corresponding periods, e.g.,
         safeguards rating downgrade in 2013. Overall, the Task Team showed profound
         knowledge of the client’s needs, developed goodwill and productive engagement, and
         appropriately adapted the project to ensure maximum relevance and achievement of PDO
         in light of changing macroeconomic conditions (e.g. level 2 restructuring to increase the
         Banks disbursement percentage to 100%). Finally, the level and quality of the Bank
         team’s support during the implementation was uniformly appreciated by the NHA/PMU,
         contractors and consultants. In view of this, the Bank’s performance during the
         implementation is rated as “Satisfactory.”

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

5.1.5    The Bank assisted the Borrower in the adequate preparation of the project. The Bank
         also actively addressed implementation problems through proactive and intensive
         supervision. The Bank showed responsiveness and flexibility to help adapt the project to
         changing circumstances and that resulted in substantial achievement of the PDO,
         outcome indicators and outputs.

5.1.6    Overall, Bank performance is therefore rated Satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance – Satisfactory

5.2.1    The GOP demonstrated a strong level of commitment and ownership toward the project
         design, preparation and implementation through a number of actions such as: (i) full
         agreement with the policy support and institutional development component, (ii)
         amended the NHA Act to restore central review and approval of all NHA programs and
         projects (exceeding Rs 100 million) through the Central Development Working
         Party/Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) mechanism,
         (iii) expanded the role of very successful National Highway and Motorway Police
         (NH&MP) from the Motorway System to the National Highways N-5 and M-9 –
         NH&MP teams were deployed for traffic and road safety enforcement, on about 1700 km
         of the project corridor, (iv) government agreed to take a decision regarding treatment of
         the existing stock of NHA debt and the mode of all future funding for its capital
         development program – the government agreed to on-lent World Bank financing to NHA
         as a grant; and conducted a study that identified various sustainable options for financing




                                                20
         NHA’s capital program, and (v) provided adequate counter-part funds from FY 03/04 to
         FY 07/08 during the original five year project implementation period 18.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance – Satisfactory

5.2.2    The Project was implemented by a dedicated Project Management Unit (PMU) at
         Islamabad which functioned well under the General Manager (HRP). All the Project
         Coordinators, Deputy Project Coordinators and supporting staff were in place in the
         regions. NHA regularly furnished the Bank with monthly progress reports and quarterly
         financial management reports (FMRs). The Project was exposed to ‘new’
         norms/processes for managing fiduciary and safeguards aspects as well as outline-based
         design-build, lump-sum contracts. Consequently, the NHA staff, consultants and
         contractors had to go through a rather steep learning curve. NHA’s Planning Wing
         responsible for project design and preparation performed their duties well. The
         prequalification and procurement of contractors was done in a transparent manner.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

5.2.3    Considering that the performance of both the Government and its implementing
         agency is satisfactory, overall performance of the Borrower is rated as Satisfactory.

6     Lessons Learned

6.1     The main lessons from the HRP include:

6.1.1    Lump-Sum contracts were a success

         a. Ad-measured, item-rate civil works contracts frequently encountered major cost
            over-runs, due to significant variations in final work quantities and delays in project
            implementation. To minimize this risk and benefit from contractor innovation and
            efficiencies during construction, rehabilitation contracts under the Project were
            invited on a “lump-sum” basis using outline designs provided by NHA, which
            prescribed a minimum pavement thickness.

         b. This approach shifted some of the construction phase risks to the contractor, where
            they can be better managed. Overall construction completion costs remained much
            lower (see Table below) – only 5% increase in cost compared to 17% increase in the
            traditional item-rate contracts – even though bid prices were on average about 11%
            higher than the Engineer’s Cost Estimate.




18
   In 2008, macro-economic condition of the country starting deteriorating resulting in budgetary cuts, that,
in turn, caused some delays in release of counter-part funds.

6.1.2   The HRP experience shows that addressing sector policy reforms in investment
        operations is a rather difficult undertaking

        a. Successful implementation of reforms requires a long term government commitment
           and ownership and cannot be achieved through ‘dated legal covenants.

        b. Since its establishment as an authority in the early 1990s, GOP has been providing
           loans to NHA to finance its capital program. As NHA’s own revenue base (primarily
           tolls) is barely sufficient to cover the costs of operations and maintenance of the
           existing road network, it has built up a huge and growing stock of debt to GOP. This
           practice is clearly unsustainable, and undermines NHA’s financial standing. To help
           address this problem (i) World Bank financing for the project was provided by GOP
           to NHA as a grant; and (ii) a study was completed under the project to identify
           sustainable options for financing NHA’s capital program, and several options were
           discussed. However, the government’s resolution of this issue was delayed and
           remains outstanding. The delay stemmed from government concerns about the
           implications of any decision in terms of the budget, as well as the precedent it would
           create for the treatment of government debt to similarly established authorities in
           other sectors.

        c. This legal covenant was waived in May 2012 through a Level 2 restructuring of the
           project.

6.1.3   Inadequate price adjustment mechanism

        a. The omission of price escalation clause in phase-I contracts critically impacted the
           cash-flow and implementation progress of the civil works contractors. The situation
           was somewhat rectified by introduction of this clause in phase-I contracts in 2005.

        b. The NHA and Bank agreed to enhance the price adjustable portion (Factor C) from
           40% to 55% in phase-II contracts. However, this enhancement was arbitrary. The
           Factor C is a percentage of the total contract price representing the sum of the
           estimated proportion of each specified cost element; therefore, the price adjustable
           portion should have been different for HRP contracts since proportions of specified
           cost elements varied from contract to contract. As a result of this flaw, the contractors
           were not properly compensated for increases in price of inputs.

6.1.4    Construction industry constraints

         a. The local contractors’ capacity is heavily overstretched – there are only about 15
            medium sized firms and about 3 large contractors in highway sector in Pakistan.

         b. Number of bids received generally decreased from phase-I to phase-II contracts due
            to: (1) reduced interest of foreign contractors caused by security and law and order
            concerns and what they perceived as unfavorable business environment; and (2)
            number of qualified domestic contractors was limited and there were other
            contracting opportunities in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

         c. There is a dire need to: (i) create an enabling environment that can attract
            international contractors to shake poorly performing local contracting industry, and
            (ii) implement the recommendations of the World Bank Report No. 41630-PK
            entitled “Infrastructure Implementation Capacity Assessment (PIICA)” dated
            November 22, 2007.

6.1.5    South-South technology transfer

         Green slope stabilization and management technologies utilizing soil bioengineering
         developed and applied under this project were transferred to Timor Leste under a South-
         South Exchange Facility Grant. Where a project successfully introduces innovation in
         project design and implementation, there is significant scope for transferring such
         innovation to other Bank borrower countries. The project’s experience in soil
         bioengineering has been also reviewed and documented in the National Cooperative
         Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Synthesis 430, “Cost Effective and Sustainable
         Road Slope Stabilization and Erosion Control”, a report of NCHRP of the Transport
         Research Board of the US National Academy of Engineering.

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Cost-benefit analyses were undertaken for the 18 civil works contracts under the Project.
The economic analysis followed exactly the same methodology adopted at appraisal. It was
carried out using the most recent version of Highway Development and Management Model
(HDM-IV), which simulates highway life cycle and vehicle operating conditions and costs for
multiple road design and maintenance alternatives.

2.      The table below summarizes the results of the economic analysis. The results indicate
that the investments are economically justified, with the Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) ranging from 13% for Contract 15, to 51% for Contract 12D.With these rates of return,
the project as a whole continues to remain economically viable.

                                                                     Investment          NPV

3.       The above results are consistent with switching value analysis conducted at appraisal,
which showed that for phase-I contracts, costs would have to increase by 227 percent or benefits
reduced by 69 percent to yield the cutoff 12% EIRR. Phase-2 analysis showed that costs would
have to increase by 191 percent or benefits reduced by 65 percent to yield the cut-off 12 percent
EIRR. Total increase in cost due to design changes 27 is Rs 5.16 billion 28 (US$ 48.1 million) i.e.
26% much below the calculated switching value. High rates of return are maintained on account
of two factors: (a) increased cost of vehicle input parameters (e.g. 409% increase in cost of diesel)
resulting in higher vehicle operating costs savings, and (b) current traffic being much higher than
estimated at appraisal resulting in, at least, proportionately higher vehicle operating costs savings.

4.       Traffic has grown at much higher rates than forecast at appraisal due to strong economic
growth in recent years. In FY 04 the economy grew at 6.4%, and in FY 07 the GDP growth
reached 7.0%. Another reason for higher traffic is the introduction of car leasing schemes in
Pakistan resulting in a large increase in the number of small and mid-size cars. Comparison of
traffic estimates used in the appraisal and current economic analysis is as follows:

                         PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
                                   BACKGROUND

1. The NHA under the Federal Ministry of Communications (MOC) is responsible for about
12000 km long National Highway and Motorway network which carries 75 to 80 % of Pakistan's
total commercial traffic. The national highways were inherited from provincial departments in the
form of poorly maintained, low capacity surface treated roads. The poor road condition coupled
with maintenance neglect due to inadequate resources, and significant increase in axle loads
caused rapid deterioration of the roads leading to a colossal maintenance backlog which required
huge investment to restore it to acceptable conditions.

2. NHA initiated a multiyear, National Highway Improvement Program in 2002, to enhance the
efficiency of the network, covering rehabilitation, resurfacing and improvement of 2700 km of
the national highway network based on a comprehensive condition survey and network
prioritization study. The program is being financed through GOP PSDP, NHA’s toll revenue and
multi-lateral financial institutions. The World Bank agreed to finance segment of the national
highway improvement program focusing on N-5 / M-9 by virtue of the high traffic levels along
this north south corridor. In the aftermath of the earthquake of October 8, 2005, the rehabilitation
& reconstruction of four severely damaged roads was also included in the scope of the project.

                             DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

3. Assessment of the Project Design. The project included (i) an investment component for
rehabilitation and resurfacing of key sections of the Karachi – Lahore – Peshawar corridor of N-
5/M-9 and earthquake damaged roads and (ii) a comprehensive package of institutional
strengthening measures, to build capacity of NHA in the development, management and
maintenance of highways with enhanced performance and improved governance. The project was
well designed to ensure the achievement of the development objective.

10. Components. The project has following components:

    a. Network Conservation Component. This component consisted of civil works along the
       national highway N-5 and earthquake damaged roads as tabulated below. The table also
       indicates the cost at appraisal and completion. The detail of contract packages is attached
       as appendix 1.

5. Financing of the Project. The total project cost was estimated at US$ 261.40 million. The
project cost was to be shared in the ratio of 76:24% by World Bank and GOP respectively. Out of
GOP share of 24%, 14% was to be allocated out of PSDP and 10% out of RMA of NHA. Initially
World Bank provided US $ 200 million. The details of additional financing are as follow;

    a. First Additional Financing. In the aftermath of earthquake of October 8, 2005, the
       GOP requested World Bank to finance the damaged roads in N.W.F.P and Azad Jammu
       & Kashmir. The World Bank agreed to finance the roads at a cost of US$ 100 million as
       part of the ongoing Highway Rehab Project. The loan agreement for US$ 100 million
       was signed which became effective on 23rd January 2006.

     b. Second Additional Financing. The Procurement for the Phase I & Phase II civil works
        contracts was completed in September 2005. The bids prices of each contract
        substantially exceeded the engineer estimates. The increase in cost was mainly due to,
        outdated cost estimates based on CSR-2000, unprecedented price hike of oil related
        products & other construction material, and changes in design. The World Bank was
        requested to share the increased cost in the same ratio of 76:24 %. The World Bank
        approved an additional loan of US$ 65 million in May 2006.

     c. Third Additional Financing.

             1) The project experienced an unanticipated increase in cost primarily due to the
                enormous raise in the amount of price escalation being paid to the contractors
                resulting from the swelling cost of the road construction material driven by the
                unprecedented increase in the oil prices.

             2) The majority of the area affected by the earthquake became unstable due to
                2010 floods. Slides continued to remain active during the construction and the
                clearing of these slides to maintain access not only to enable road works to
                progress, but also to ensure rehabilitation works, resulted in additional costs
                with extended treatment works.

             3) The World Bank agreed to provide an additional financing of US$ 130 million
                to meet the cost overruns and repair of damages caused by the floods of 2010.

             4) The total cost of the loan / credit is US$ 495 million.

6. Duration of the Project. The project was originally designed for completion by December
2009. However for reasons of change in scope of work, rains/ floods and delays in


                                                40
implementation of civil works contract the duration of the project was extended up to 30th June
2013.

Development Objective

7. The project development objective is “the sustainable delivery of a productive and efficient
national highway network contributing to lower transportation cost.” The achievement of
development objective is to be judged on the basis of performance indicators.

8. Output Indicators. The output indicators specified for the projects have been achieved, as
discussed below;

    a. 550 km of N-5/ M-9 corridor has been rehabilitated.
    b. 128 km of earthquake damaged roads have been completed.
    c. 393 km of N-5 length has been resurfaced.

9. Impact Indicators. The specified impact indicators have been satisfactorily achieved as
follow;

    a. The road network in poor condition was reduced from 49% to 35% against a target of
       35%. However 793 km of national highway network was extensively damaged due to
       super floods of 2010, which is now being rehabilitated under ADB loan and Chinese
       grant.

    b. Average network-level roughness is reduced from 5.4 IRI to 4.49 IRI against the target of
       4.4.

    c. The travel time on N-5 has been reduced by 16% from 47 hours against targeted
       reduction of 10% of 42 hours.

    d. Fatalities on N-5 have been reduced by 63% against targeted reduction of 10%.

10. Achievement of Development Objective. The status of the above achievement of the
performance indicators shows that the development objective has been satisfactorily achieved.

                         IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT

Overview

11. Investment Component.

    a. The initial scope of civil works for rehabilitation and resurfacing was simple and straight
       forward as it did not involve any land acquisition and major resettlement or relocation of
       utilities. However the works were spread over a distance of 1700 km requiring a
       dedicated organization for monitoring and supervision. The only complexity of the
       project in the original scope was visualized to be compliance with the environmental &
       social safeguard, as this was the first project subjected to the World Bank Operational
       policies.

    b. The complexity of the project was compounded by the inclusion of reconstruction of
       earthquake damaged road which not only involved reconstruction but also the traffic had


                                               41
        to be kept open for the relief and reconstruction of the affected population. The
        environmental and social safeguard became more intricate as the reconstruction involved
        land acquisition and slope stability measures and disposal of surplus material.

    c. The implementation became more challenging in the wake of unforeseen rise in the cost
       of construction material and limited financial and management capability of the
       contractor.

12. Institutional Strengthening Component. The project included multifaceted policy reforms,
institutional strengthening, and capacity building measures which were to be implemented with
the limited institutional capacity for which it was designed to improve. Hence from hindsight this
institutional development program proved ambitious and unrealistic.

13. Implementation. The vast scope of the project for investment component comprising of 18
civil works contracts and multifaceted institutional strengthening was very comprehensive and
rather than a project should have been named as a program. This program has been implemented
with good results in challenging environments. The challenges and measures to overcome are
discussed in this report.

Project Preparatory Activities

14. Establishment of PMU. A dedicated project management unit under a General Manager
was established at Islamabad. The PMU was adequately staffed. Experienced Project
Coordinators at the regional level and Deputy Project Coordinators for each contract were
appointed. The PMU functioned well and effectively monitored the wide range of construction
and institutional strengthening activities. The PMU acted as Secretariat to the Project Steering
Committee. The PMU satisfactorily performed its functions.

15. Engineering Designs. The rehabilitation and resurfacing of various sections was based on
proven engineering specifications and construction techniques, which were well within the
capability of NHA and the contractors. NHA acquired the services of National Consultants for
designs and technical specifications. The rehabilitation works were procured on the basis of
outline designs prepared by the consultants, specifying the minimum thicknesses. This was done
with a view to shift some of the construction phase risks to the contractor.

16. Procurement.

    a. Bid documents. The bid documents were prepared by well experienced Consultants,
       following the Bank’s Standard Bidding Documents for ICB contracts for Rehabilitation
       and World Bank sample bidding documents for small works NCB contracts. 10 contracts
       for rehabilitation works were procured on the basis of lump sum fixed price contracts,
       and the 6 x resurfacing packages as measured contracts. Bid packages were suitably sized
       for NCB as well ICB contracts to allow adequate participation of the national and
       international firms.

    b. Procurement. The procurement of works, services and goods was carried out in
       accordance with World Bank Procurement Guidelines. For the Earthquake Damaged
       Roads the World Bank allowed direct contracting of works to Frontier works
       Organization and services to SMEC through a variation order. The prequalification and
       the bidding process was conducted in a fair / transparent manner and was well done.
       Procurement arrangements were well defined, contract packaging was straight forward


                                               42
        and no significant problem was encountered. Overall the procurement processes were
        well managed and no major delay occurred in the award of works and services.

17. Preparation of detailed engineering design by the Contractors.

    a. The rehabilitation contracts for both phases were procured on the basis of a hybrid
       Design & Build concept. An outline design was prepared by the consultants specifying
       the pavement thicknesses and geometric design criterion. The contractor’s responsibility,
       design requirements & methodology and liability were not well defined in the contract
       agreement.

    b. The contractors were required to acquire the services of design consultants for
       topographic survey and preparation of plan & profile drawings and obtain the approval of
       NHA through the design review consultants, within four months of the agreement. Most
       of the contractor acquired the services of consultants who did not demonstrate enough
       capacity to complete the designs within the prescribed time of four months, leading to
       design by parts. In some cases the contractors were unable to fulfill the design obligations
       till the completion of the project.

    c. The design for Recycling Contracts and specifications was carried out by the local
       consultants, which required recycling of pavement up to 30 cm depth. The consultants
       ignored the capability of the available recycling machine and requirement of heavy
       rollers to compact 30 cm deep layers. This design and specification posed problem in
       implementation, for which fresh designing was carried out through international
       consultants, thus delaying the execution. However the works were satisfactorily executed.

18. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Impact Assessments. NHA prepared the
EIA and SIA for rehabilitation & resurfacing contracts through consultants and obtained
regulatory clearance from the EPA. EMP was evolved to mitigate the adverse environmental
impact. The EMP was made part of the civil works contract, based on which the contractors
developed site specific mitigation plans. The supervision consultants were responsible for
monitoring the implementation of EMP. A Resettlement Policy Framework was agreed with the
Bank to compensate the PAPS for mitigation of the impacts. This was the first ever project in the
road sector subjected to the environmental & social safeguard policies.

Civil Works Implementation

19. Capacity of Construction Industry. The contract award demonstrated limited in country
capacity of the construction industry. The total 18 contracts were awarded to four national
contractors (i) Husnain Cotex Limited – 7 (ii) Saad Ullah Khan & Brothers -3 (iii) Lilley
International -3 (iv) Frontier Works Organization -3, through direct contracting (v) SAMBU -1
and (vi) Put Sarajevo -1. The international contractors did not participate due to perceived
security situation in the country. The non-participation of the international contractors in the
bidding and limited number of local contractors not only restricted the competition but also led to
delays in the execution of the projects. The shortage of qualified contractors also inhibited NHA
to impose penalties or terminating the contracts for re-bidding with consequences of higher cost
and not necessarily better new contractors.

20. Contractor’s capacity. The rehabilitation and resurfacing works were based on construction
techniques which were well within the capability of the contractors. The contractors mobilized
adequate equipment for the execution of the sub projects including acquisition of new asphalt


                                                43
plants, concrete batching plants, earth work equipment, pavers and cold recycling machines.
However most of the contractors demonstrated poor management capacity in (i) timely
preparation and revision of work programs (ii) inadequate submission on contractual issues to the
engineer and (iii) management of cash flows, which resulted in the implementation delays.

21. Price Adjustment. The rehabilitation works were procured as Fixed Price Lump Sum
contracts, with no provision for price adjustment. In 2005 unprecedented hike occurred in prices
of crude oil in the international market and the Government withdrew subsidy on the diesel oil.
The prices of fuel, bitumen, labor and other construction input increased manifold, which
adversely impacted on the cash flow of the contractor posing great risk for the completion of the
projects. With a view to ensure timely completion of the projects amendment to the contracts was
incorporated introducing price adjustment. Though the introduction of the price adjustment
considerably impacted the cost of the project, but helped in timely completion of most of the
contracts.

22. Rationalization of Adjustable Portion of Contract. Pakistan Engineering Council has
issued the Document Standard procedure & Formula for Price Adjustment” Aug 2002 revised
Nov 2005. The stated objectives of this document are to make price adjustment as real as possible,
set out a simple procedure, and make the contracts equitable. The document specifies typical
elements for price adjustment for Highway Projects as Cement, Steel, POL, and skilled /
unskilled Labor & Bitumen. The coefficient for each specified item is required to be calculated
proportionate to its ratio in the contract value and given in the bid document. The sum of all
coefficients shall form the adjustable portion of the contract or factor C. The adjustable portion
of the contract shall generally be fixed between 35% - 65%, depending on the nature of project.
However the adjustable portion on the contracts was arbitrarily fixed as 40%. The contractors
raised the disputes that since escalation is paid on specified items only, the price adjustment
provisions have become inequitable in case of unprecedented rise in prices of the cost element
like fuel which shall have a spiraling effect on the non-recoverable escalation. Resultantly Factor-
C was rationalized number of times by the Engineer, Dispute Resolution Expert and Arbitrator,
leading to delays on the projects. It is therefore important that the adjustable portion is accurately
worked out to ensure equitable payment of escalation.

23. Shortage of bitumen. There are primarily two oil refineries (i) Attock Refinery Limited
Private at Rawalpindi and (ii) state owned National Refinery Limited at Karachi producing
bitumen in Pakistan. In 2005 the government privatized the National Refinery Limited which was
purchased by the Attock Group of Industries resulting in a virtual monopoly in the field. The
demand for bitumen increased manifold due to the government’s ambitious program of
construction of infrastructure coupled with the reconstruction of Afghanistan. The refineries
preferred to supply the bitumen to the Afghan market over the local market, resulting in immense
shortage in Pakistan. The shortage not only increased the prices but also led to delay in the
implementation of the projects and time extension had to be notified on all contracts. NHA
adopted extra contractual measure of directly purchasing bitumen for supply to the contractors,
with a view to minimize delays. However the impact could not be adequately mitigated. The
shortage of bitumen remained a major cause of delay and higher escalation.

24. Time & Cost Overruns. Time and cost overruns are the two macro issues on development
projects in the country. NHA and the bank were aware of the two factors and therefore introduced
the concept of Design, Build and Lump sum, fixed price contracts. However, the objective to
control time and cost overruns could not be overcome. The project scheduled for completion in 5
years and initial cost of US $361.00 million (261 for original HRP and 100 for earthquake



                                                 44
damaged roads) almost doubled leading to the final completion period of 10 years and cost of
US$ 495 million. The time and cost overruns occurred due to following reasons;

   a. Engineer Estimates. The Engineer’s cost estimates at the time of project preparation
      were based on NHA composite Schedule of rates (CSR) -2000 and thus were 4-5 years
      outdated. Whereas the Phase-I bids were slightly lower than the Engineer Estimates the
      Phase-2 bids were substantially higher leading to a substantial increase in project cost by
      US$ 85 million, at the conclusion of bidding prices. These cost estimates should have
      been updated by NHA at the market rates prior to appraisal of the project.

   b. Increase in Oil Prices. Due to increase in prices of oil in the international market in
      2005, considerable escalation in key materials resulted. The escalation was so exorbitant
      that the contractors were unable to absorb the impact risking the completion of the project.
      Resultantly the concept of fixed price contract was not only modified and price
      adjustment provisions were introduced through contract amendment, but the provisions
      were repeatedly rationalized through revision of Factor-C. The escalation was so high
      that the initial amount earmarked for price contingencies proved inadequate. It clearly
      indicates that adequate contingencies must be built into the engineer estimates at the time
      of project preparation.

   c. Time Extensions. Contracts 1, 2A, 2B, 5, 7, 10, 12A, 12C and 12D were almost
      completed as scheduled within the original completion period of the project. However
      the time for contracts 3, 8, 14,11B, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were repeatedly extended due
      to following reasons;

       1)   Limited financial capacity of the contractor exacerbated by unusual increase in
            prices, and over extended on more than one project.

       2)   Shortage of bitumen in the country.

       3)   Major revision in scope of work through design changes and floods of 2010
            especially on EDR contracts.

       4)   Delay in finalization of design.

       5)   Nonpayment of GOP counterpart funds.

       6)   Frequent landslides due to instable slopes on the earthquake damaged roads.

       7)   Law & Order situation in the country.

   d. Based on the above factors it is concluded that the objective of controlling the time and
      cost overruns have not been achieved as the project was implemented in difficult physical
      environments of unusual increase in prices of material and factors which could not be
      forecasted at appraisal. There is a requirement to reduce the gestation period between
      project preparation and implementation, preparation of proper engineers estimates,
      allocation of realistic contingencies and stricter prequalification of contractors to
      minimize the over commitment on projects under concurrent execution.




                                               45
25. Taking over of completed projects.

   a. The contract through an amendment allowed the taking over of substantially completed
      works by NHA, after which the contractor retained the responsibility of defect liability
      and completion of ancillary works as per punch list but was not responsible for the
      routine maintenance of the works. These provisions of contract were not understood by
      NHA operations wing and became a major controversy which not only resulted in the
      taking over of project sections after the expiry of the defect liability period but also
      became a major factor for maintenance neglect.

   b. A committee was constituted under the provision of contract for taking over of the
      contract section. The committee comprised of the NHA project staff, the representative
      of the Operation Wing (DD Maintenance concerned) and the Engineer’s & Contractor’s
      representatives. After the detailed inspection the Engineer issues the taking over
      certificates, along with the Punch List for balanced ancillary works. As per NHA’s SOP,
      the works were once again inspected by NHA inspection Wing on completion of the
      defect liability period often with a time gap of over 5 year after issuing of the Taking
      over certificates. The inspection team conducted inspections as for initial taking over of
      section rather than focusing to observe if there have been any defects due to quality of
      work or the design failures. This practice as per NHA, SOP is clearly a violation of the
      contract provisions. Considerable time was wasted in resolving this issue.

   c. The contractors often delayed / failed to execute the ancillary works as per punch list. At
      times the punch list included major works like extension of culverts, surface treating of
      shoulders, construction of service roads, and plantation of grass for erosion control,
      pedestrian bridges and catch water drains. There is a requirement that appropriately
      define the “substantial completion” and “scope of ancillary works”.

26. Contract Management.

   a. The concept and powers of the Engineer and Dispute Adjudication Expert were not
      well understood. NHA’s processes and procedures for many aspects of the contract
      management were in contradiction to the FIDIC based contracts. NHA at many times
      intervened in contract administration and technical matters which eventually place the
      responsibility on the Client which resultantly weakened the position of The Engineer.

   b. The processing of the variation orders, extension of time, designs and processing of the
      Engineer’s / DRE decisions were often delayed causing retardation on the progress of
      projects. Prompt response to design changes and timely decisions, avoiding bureaucratic
      channels for EOT / VOs and processing of IPCs are essential for good contract
      management.

   c. Due to poor management of contractors NHA adopted extra contractual measures to
      successfully complete the contracts on the most important heavily trafficked highway of
      the country. NHA issued number of amendments to the contract for, payment procedure
      for lump sum contracts, payment of additional mobilization advances, establishing of
      escrow accounts, reduction in amount of retention money, inclusion of price adjustment,
      direct purchase of bitumen from the refineries for supply to the contractor and revision
      of Factor-C, with a view to successfully complete the projects. These measures did help
      to accomplish the objective except few contracts where the performance of the
      contractor remained poor.


                                               46
27. Dispute Resolution.

   a. The contracts provided the mechanism for dispute resolution through adjudication and
      arbitration. Many of the “Engineer’s” determinations and decisions were referred to the
      Dispute Resolution Expert (DRE) / Adjudicator by the contractors and few by
      Employer. A large number of the disputes were decided by the DRE in favour of
      contractors. The employer perceived the DRE’s decisions to be contractor’s biased.

   b. Despite the fact that the DRE’s decisions were contractually binding, the Employer did
      not implement these in accordance with the provision of contract due to the fear of audit
      objections. These decisions were either referred to arbitration without implementation or
      the contractor was asked to provide irrevocable bank guarantee for payment arising out
      of the DRE’s decisions as a safeguard in case of reversal through arbitration.

   c. This practice not only prolonged the resolution of disputes but at times adversely
      affected the contractor’s cash flow leading to delays on site. There is a requirement for
      the audit authorities to understand the contractual provision and amicable settlement of
      disputes. Also the DRE’ must be selected on the basis of credibility and experience.

28. Performance of Pavement.

   a. NHA is seriously concerned on rutting of asphalt pavement due to heavy axle loads.
      In order to minimise the occurrence of rutting NHA adopted coarser gradation for
      aggregate with reduced optimum bitumen content in the mix design for wearing
      course and use of polymer modified bitumen.

   b. The coarser gradation of aggregate for wearing course resulted in porous asphalt which
      developed cracks in the pavement leading to failure particularly on Nowshera –
      Peshawar contract. Also the use of polymer modified bitumen resulted in more brittle
      mix and resulted in hairline cracks on many other contracts which were to be sealed.

   c. The asphalt technologist and international lead material engineer of the supervision
      consultant failed to foresee that the use of coarser aggregate will affect the sealing
      function of the wearing course and result in failures. The failures not only lead to
      contractual disputes but also caused embarrassment to the organization.

   d. The pavement has now sustained traffic for the past 5 -7 years and although some
      localised distress is evident, the pavement performance is judged, to be in overall
      satisfactory condition. The pavement on many sections is now due for periodic
      maintenance for which NHA needs to initiate a program.

29. Financial management.

   a. The Project. The PMU was established as a self-accounting unit with its own finance
      staff. The staff was well experienced in the financial management of the foreign funded
      projects. Therefore the financial management of the project remained satisfactory
      throughout the implementation period. The financial statements and audit reports were
      generally timely and unqualified.

   b. Entity Level Accounts. A financial management improvement action plan was agreed
      between the bank and NHA. The plan has mostly been implemented. NHA’s entity level


                                              47
        accounts have been prepared. The accrual accounting system has been adopted. Fixed
        assets registers duly valued has been prepared and maintained. The internal controls have
        been strengthened. Signed audited financial statements are regularly prepared. The
        numbers of audit qualifications have reduced and the qualifications are being addressed.

30. Tree Plantation.

   a. A well-conceived plan was evolved for the compensatory tree plantation along the project
      corridor. NHA initially considered awarding the tree plantation to the respective
      Provincial Forest Departments. A SOP and MOU were drafted with participation of the
      regional forest departments. The World Bank agreed to NHA proposal but suggested to
      implement a pilot project through private sector. The scrutiny of the detailed proposals of
      the forest departments were considered very costly and NHA decided to implement the
      afforestation program through private sector. This considerably delayed the
      implementation.

   b. A total of 12 contracts with implementation period of 5 plus years amounting to Rs 432
      million for plantation of 800,000 trees of indigenous trees and exported species, were
      awarded during December 2009 – March 2010. For initial period of 8 months NHA
      supervised the implementation through integral qualified staff of forest range officer.
      However sensing the complications particularly of intimate monitoring & evaluation of
      survival, replacement and payment NHA procured the services of Supervision
      Consultants. The contracts were effectively implemented.

   c. The major success has been achieved along the Karachi – Hyderabad highway. This road
      section lies in an arid zone with low water table and scanty water sources. Here even the
      bushes do not survive. The exported species of Conocarpous was introduced along this
      reach. 180,000 trees were planted which has survived and are blooming. This is
      considered an accomplishment.

   d. The survival rate at the end of the project is 87% with most of the trees from 2-3 years
      age. The maintenance of the trees will be carried out till 2016.

31. Environmental and Social Safeguards Management.

   a.    Training. The HRP is considered as the pilot project in the road sector subjected to
        environmental & social safeguard policies of the bank. It was therefore essential that an
        adequate level of awareness was to be created among all the stakeholders. For this
        purpose the services of Leads Pakistan were acquired to conduct trainings through
        seminars, workshops, case studies and field visits for the contractors, consultants and
        NHA staff in the identifications and mitigations of environmental and social issues. The
        training was well conducted and not only sensitized the participants but helped in
        development of basic skills on monitoring and reporting of the safeguard issues
        management.

   b. Environmental issues Management. The EMP was made part of the civil works
      contract agreement. The compliance with EMP in the initial stages remained problematic.
      Difficulties were encountered in translating the EMP to the site specific mitigation plans
      for establishment of camps, sanitation & hygiene within the camps, siting of asphalt
      plants & dust control, disposal of debris and monitoring of environmental parameters.
      However substantial improvements were brought in through strict monitoring by the


                                               48
    NHA Director Environment and Supervision Consultant Staff. The contractors employed
    qualified environmental staff for preparation and implementation of the site specific
    mitigation plans and regularly submitted the monitoring reports. The environmental
    audits were regularly carried out quarterly/ half yearly by NHA staff and the lead
    environmental engineer of the supervision consultants, which showed gradual
    improvement. However the restoration of borrow pits posed a challenge, which were not
    satisfactorily managed due to the agreement between contractor and owners.

c. Although EMP were part of the contract but the agreement did not define the penalty
   mechanism for any non-compliance. Resultantly there were violations in the initial stages.

d. Land acquisition & Social safeguards

    1)   N- 5 Corridor. The rehabilitation and improvement along N-5/ corridor did not
         involve any land acquisition except at Mitiari Bypass. The land at Mitiari bypass
         measuring about five acres was acquired through private negotiation on the
         prevailing market rate. However the NHA ROW was encroached for road side
         businesses by vendors and squatters. Depending on the number of affected persons
         RAPS were prepared in accordance with agreed Resettlement Policy Framework
         and satisfactorily implemented. The RAP implementation posed considerable
         challenge in the urban centers along Gujranwala – Lahore contract. The Deputy
         Project Coordinators demonstrated considerable understanding of the social issues,
         conducted regular stakeholder consultations, redressed the grievances and resolve
         the issues to the satisfaction of the affected persons.

    2)   Earthquake Damaged Roads. The earthquake damaged roads were required to be
         upgraded to national standards, which involved land acquisition. Due to emergency
         nature of the reconstruction, World Bank demonstrated great flexibility by relaxing
         operational policy and allowed land acquisition under the urgency clause of the
         Land Acquisition Act – 1894. The land acquisition was delayed beyond proportion
         to the extent of risking the suspension of disbursement due to following reasons;

             a) Delay in releasing of funds by NHA despite the fact that the land acquisition
                was financed by the Bank.

             b) Utilization of funds by AJ&K government for other purposes rather than
                disbursement to affected persons.

             c) Non posting of the required staff and lukewarm response by the provincial
                revenue departments.

             d) Destruction of revenue record in the earthquake and outdated records.

e. Relocation of utilities. The relocation usually commences after the mobilization of
   contractor and hence is a major factor in impeding the progress and causing
   implementation delays. There were large number of utilities along Gujranwala – Lahore
   contract which included LT/ HT electric poles, water pipelines, sewerage lines, high
   pressure gas lines and domestic gas distribution lines. The quantum was enormous and
   posed a serious challenge for relocation. NHA recognized the challenge at an early stage
   and commenced efforts for relocations. However the urgency was not realized by the
   utility departments as the construction activities were not visible on ground. To overcome


                                           49
        the issue NHA created a cell under a Project Coordinator and employed retired personnel
        from WAPDA, SUI Gas department and Telephone department. This cell worked round
        the clock and successfully relocated the utilities in accordance with the contractor’s work
        program by ensuring that these do not become impediments.

   f.   Institutional Arrangements. An important aspect of the project has been to create and
        maintain safeguard management capacity in NHA and mainstream these processes in all
        NHA’s business. This posed a serious challenge as adequately qualified staff was not
        available. In 2008 NHA took a major step by reorganizing the “Land Management &
        Infra structure Section” into an “Environment, Afforestation, Land & Social safeguards
        (EALS) Section”. The section has been organized under a General Manager with two
        directors (i) Director Environment and (ii) Director Land & Social. Qualified staff has
        been recruited and posted. This section is now responsible for the management of
        safeguards on all NHA projects and operations. The section has yet to assume the leading
        role and build adequate capacity.

32. Slope Stability through bio engineering solutions. The earthquake of 2005 severely jolted
the sections along Battal – Batgram, Balakot – Naran and Muzaffarabad – Chakothi Roads,
resulting into shallow and deep slides. The slides were persistently active and became serious
impediments in keeping the road open to traffic. Numbers of civil engineering solutions were
considered which were very cost intensive for shallow slides. With the technical assistance of
UNDP, Bio-Engineering solutions were evolved. These methods envisage the root systems to be
developed as anchors to control slides. A wide range of solutions including grassing, vegetated
check damming, sowing of trees & plants, hedge layering, and semi dead fences with live hedge
have been successfully implemented. The measures have proved effective, however to be
sustainable would require specialized maintenance which has to be ensured by NHA through the
forest department.

33. Contract Administration & Supervision’s Consultants.

   a. The services of SMEC International & Louis Burger in association with a consortium of
      local consultants were acquired for design review, contract administration and
      construction supervision of the project. The consultant’s team comprised a core team of
      international experts located at Islamabad and the supervision staff led by a resident
      engineer at the project site. SMEC as a lead firm was designated as the Engineer which
      further delegated the powers of The Engineer and designated the Chief Resident
      Engineer/ Team leader as the Engineer’s Representative. The services of supervision staff
      for earthquake damaged road were acquired through a variation order in the original
      contract.

   b. The consultants were selected on QCBS system under the World Bank guidelines. SMEC
      international was adjudged at second ranking in the technical evaluation due to fewer
      man months and leaner organization. However, based on the low financial proposal
      secured first position in the combined evaluation. The lower remuneration for the local
      staff, subsequently led to engagement of average quality of supervision staff on site.

   c.    The Team Leader, Contract Specialist, the Deputy Team leader, and the Environment
        Specialist were well experienced and played a proactive role contributing positively to
        the successful implementation of the project. However the performance of the Lead
        material Engineer and Lead Asphalt Technologist was not satisfactory as is evident from
        the failure of pavement due to inconsistent quality control.

   d. The consultants commenced the services with good zeal. SMEC produced three manuals
      of (i) Contract Administration (ii) Construction Quality Control Manual and (iii)
      Laboratory Management manual. A reasonably well quality Control system was put in
      place with acceptable level of implementation. The consultants also prepared reasonably
      good documentation for contract administration.

   e. However, as the work load increased the performance of the core team started declining
      particularly with reference to the contract administration and design reviews often
      delaying the Engineer’s decisions/ determination.

   f.   The local associates mostly proved as supplier of human resource and did not provide
        much of the needed institutional support to the lead firm. These firms could not attract
        good quality staff due to low financial proposal with consequences of low salaries
        charging high overheads.

   g. A large number of the Engineer’s determination were disputed by both the Employer and
      the contractor giving perception of partiality as he was involved in the day to day
      management of the project.

   h. The supervision consultant’s play a pivotal role in the efficient contract management and
      quality control of the works through intimate construction supervision. Highest
      weightage must be accorded to the technical proposal to ensure good quality staff and
      efficient organization. The engineer should be a person other than the team leader to
      ensure proper contract management.

Policy Reforms & Institutional Development

34. Policy Reforms and Institutional Strengthening Component. Although the need for
implementing institutional strengthening measures cannot be overstated the project design
ambitiously, given the known weaknesses in capacity called for rapid expansion of the
institutional capacity in line with the scheduled pace of project implementation. The institutional
development assignments under the project required the procurement of specialized consultants in
a variety of subjects. These services were procured in accordance with Bank’s guidelines in time.
The procurement was satisfactory. However difficulty was encountered in detailing the dedicated
counterpart staff for supervising and vetting the consultant’s work, which did not prove very
effective. The comments and feedback on consultant’s report was often delayed and of lower
quality. The difficulties faced and the impact achieved is briefly discussed below;

    a. Resolution of Cash Development Loan – Legal Covenant. Since establishment the
       GOP is financing NHA’s capital development program through loans. NHA does not
       have a revenue base to repay these loans. The project included a legal covenant related to
       sustainable financing of NHA’s capital development program through (i) resolution of
       the existing debt stock (ii) financing of NHA.s future program through grant funding. A
       study was conducted in coordination with MOF for resolution of the issue. The study
       recommended equity mechanism, which has been under discussion with MOF. MOF
       agreed with this mechanism but could not be adopted due to difficulty in maintaining the
       books of account. The covenant could not be compiled with since it was beyond the
       control of NHA. As such the legal covenant was dropped by World Bank.

    b. Business Process Reengineering.

        1)   The assignment was aimed at creating an integrated and effective IT enabled
             environment covering all core functions of NHA for corporate governance and
             enhanced performance. The services of a national chartered accountancy consulting
             firm were acquired for assignment. The team included an international expert of
             BPR, an international highway engineer and national experts in accounting and
             finance.

        2)   The firm commenced its assignment but immediately went astray in recognizing the
             role, mission, and the core functions of NHA. Considerable efforts were made by
             NHA to steer the firm towards the objective of the assignment, however the firm
             could not understand the difference between the core and support functions of NHA
             and concentrated more on the Finance & Accounting Functions of NHA being a
             chartered accountancy firm.

        3)   The firm submitted the midterm report which was jointly reviewed by NHA with the
             World Bank Experts. The report was considered far below the acceptable level.
             Despite repeated hard work by the World Bank BPR expert with the firm, the
             consultants failed to improve. Resultantly the contract was terminated.

    c. Effective Weight Control Management.

        1)   The study documenting the extent of the overloading problem and recommendations
             on specific mitigation measures was assigned to FINROAD. The firm mobilized an
             energetic and effective team leader who worked with NHA counterpart staff as a
             team and completed the assignment in scheduled time.


                                                52
        2)   Although the weight control regime has been strengthened through establishment of
             large number of weigh bridges at strategic locations on the network the
             recommendations of the study could not be fully implemented for socio – politico
             factors. The overloading continues to be a menace for NHA network.

        3)   There is a need for NHA to revisit the study and develop an action plan for the
             implementation of the recommendations under a phased program in coordination
             and consultation with other Government agencies.

   d. Road Asset Management System.

        1)   Since 1999 NHA has implemented “the fee for service concept” on NHA network
             and significantly increased its toll revenue. NHA established a dedicated Road
             Assets Management Directorate for maintenance and operational management of its
             network. There was a requirement to evolve a modern road assets management
             system and implement it on the network.

        2)   The services of FINROAD were acquired for crystallizing the concept of the system
             and implement it on ground, imparting on the job training to the NHA staff for
             sustainable implementation. The firm mobilized an effective team for the
             assignment. The assignment though suffered delays due to non-availability of
             adequate counterpart staff and reduced man months of the consultant’s staff, but was
             successfully implemented. The World Bank provided specialized input through
             mobilization of RAMS experts as part of the missions, who contributed significantly
             towards the achievement of the objective.

        3)   A modern Road Assets Management System has been developed under the project
             which is now being implemented. Comprehensive network condition surveys are
             carried out and annual maintenance plans are developed on the basis of HDM-4
             analysis. This has greatly optimized the network maintenance expenditure.

   e. Improved Pavement Standards. The empirical AASHTO specifications for design of
      pavements are incapable of providing reliable designs for the extreme weather and
      loading conditions in Pakistan. The project included research on pavement to arrive at
      Pakistan specific standards for design. A laboratory has been established at National
      Highway Research Centre under the project.

   f.   Human Resource Development. A large number of NHA staff has been trained under
        the project in country and international courses/ workshops and seminars. A HRD
        strategy based on Training Need Assessment has been prepared which is now being
        implemented.

35.      Various segments of the institutional development component were implemented
concurrently tying large number of counterpart staff from NHA. The input from the counterpart
staff was often delayed due to their involvement in the performance of their day to day work. A
better way would have been to sequentially implement the assignments which would have ensured
better delivery of higher standard.




                                               53
Performance of the World Bank Staff

36. The World Bank regularly fielded implementation support mission which were always of
very high professional standards and were very beneficial for the implementation of the project.
The Task Leader along with the support staff always provided timely input and prompt response
for resolution of issues. The input provided by the World Bank’s RAMS Expert, HR Expert and
BPR Expert was commendable. The Bank’s staff worked as effective team members with NHA
staff towards the achievement of the common goal and objectives of the project.

Assessment of Borrowers Own Performance

37. The assessment of the NHA’s performance is outlined below;

   a. Project preparation. The project was well prepared. However, problems were
      encountered during the implementation of the Design Built lump sum contracts being
      introduced for the first time. The outline design for Rehabilitation Lump Sum Fix price
      contract could be improved and the ambiguity arising out of specifying the pavement
      thickness could be avoided.

   b. Procurement. The prequalification and procurement was carried out in transparent and
      satisfactory manner in scheduled time.

   c. Implementation of Civil works. A dedicated PMU was established which was well
      staffed. Although frequent turnover of staff occurred the continuity was ensured. The
      PMU functioned well and played an effective role in the monitoring, evaluation and
      reporting of the project.

   d. Contract management. Frequent delays occurred in obtaining of financial concurrence
      of contractual issues like variations, extension of time and implementation, of the
      Engineer’s / DRE’s decisions. This could be improved with better understanding of the
      FIDIC based contracts.

   e. Financial management. The financial management of the project has been good. At
      entity account level the performance has been acceptable.

38. Given to the above mentioned factors, the overall performance of the borrower can be
rated as Good.

Lessons Learnt

39. The following lessons were learnt from the implementation of the project which needs to be
incorporated in the future program;

   a. Engineer’s estimates. The time gap between the project preparation and implementation
      must be avoided to reduce the likely hood of financing gaps and bid prices. The engineers
      estimates must be updated at the market value at the time of appraisal and adequate
      premium be allowed to cover for the procurement delays.

   b. Adequate Allocation for Price Contingencies. Unanticipated price hikes due to market
      dynamics particularly in developing countries like Pakistan must be expected and



                                              54
     adequate allocation for price contingencies must be built into the budget. At least 15% of
     contingencies should be allocated to cover the escalation.

c. Rationalized Price adjustment Provision. The adjustable portion of the contract should
   be realistically worked out on the basis of specified input and not fixed arbitrarily. The
   design consultants must support the working out of Factor-C with detailed calculations
   which should be submitted to NHA.

d. Construction Industry. The local contractors have demonstrated poor financial and
   management capacity in the implementation of the project. The international contractors
   are inhibited to participate mostly due to perceived security situation and business
   environment in the country. The contract packaging may be suitably enlarged to attract
   the international contractor.

e. Contract Management.

     1)   The adoption of extra contractual measures practiced in this project must not
          become the routine processes. The contractual remedies for poor performance must
          be implemented to curb the tendency.

     2)   The role of the Engineer/ DRE must be understood. Special training of contract
          management may be imparted to the audit and finance staff to minimize delays in
          processing contractual issues and audit observations.

     3)   The Team leader/ CRE should not be appointed as the Engineer as he is involved in
          the day to day management of the project and give way to a compromised role as the
          engineer.

f.   Design Variations. Major design variations in the scope of contract must be avoided to
     minimize the time and cost overruns.

g. Consultants Selection. The weightage for technical proposal be enhanced to ensure
   better quality of manpower of the consultants. The consultants should not be allowed to
   make frequent changes to the proposed staff. The quality of the replacement staff must be
   ensured.

h. Institutional strengthening. The quality of institutional strengthening assignment is also
   dependent on the quality of counterpart staff. Ambitious program must be avoided and
   the program must be implemented sequentially with a view not to compound the capacity
   constraint.
