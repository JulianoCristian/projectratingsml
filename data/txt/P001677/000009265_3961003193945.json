This will\n            be done by corporatizing and converting the Smallholder\n            Agricultural Credit Administration (SACA) into a limited\n            liability finance company, thus eliminating its heavy\n            dependence on government support, as a first step to its\n            subsequent conversion into a private bank.  The project will\n            also assist the government toward improving the policy and\n            institutional framework for rural financial intermediation\n            by supporting the development of linkages between the formal\n            and informal financial sectors, and strengthening related\n            non-financial institutions serving the rural sector.  The\n            project has three main components. The first component,\n            institution-building, will support:  (a) the corporatization\n            and conversion of SACA, which is currently a government\n            department, into a limited liability finance company with\n            publicly held shares and capable of providing a full range\n            of financial services (for farm and non-farm activities) to\n            the rural population on a commercial basis; and (b) use of\n            Development of Malawi Trades Trust (DEMATT) to assist in\n            preparing investment proposals for agricultural and micro-,\n            small- and medium-scale enterprises, and to provide related\n            training and advisory services. The second component, line\n            of credit, will finance primarily short term loan\n            requirements of farm and non-farm rural activities.  The\n            third component, pilot program, will support further\n            initiatives to test innovative approaches for providing\n            financial services to women entrepreneurs engaged in\n            income-generating activities in the rural sector."}, "docdt": "1993-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
