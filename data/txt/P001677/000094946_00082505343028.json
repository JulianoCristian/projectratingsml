substantial. However, lessons indicate that when\n            the project was extended, foreseeing that the capacity of\n            the Malawi Rural Finance Company (MRFC) was not attainable\n            as a private bank, the project should have instead been\n            restructured, in line with current conditions, and allow for\n            an opportunity to assist the Government in pursuing improved\n            policy, and institutional frameworks. Furthermore, since the\n            issue of rural finance, in an agriculturally-based economy\n            as Malawi's is a highly political one, efforts to\n            strengthen relations among the Government, its agencies,\n            donors ant the private sector at large, need to be pursued,\n            since MRFC activities were seen only as a Bank project. This\n            would in turn enable macroeconomic stability, and develop\n            commercial financial institutions, viable to financial\n            services, that include both savings, and credit facilities\n            to the rural population. But the capacity of rural financial\n            institutions needs to be revisited, focusing on issues of\n            loan recovery mechanisms, efficient marketing systems,\n            subsidy elements, and furthermore, financial institutions\n            lending for agricultural purposes, need to create reserves\n            for default, resulting from the risks of macroeconomic\n            instability. Licensing these institutions under the\n            country's banking legislation, would enable supervision accordingly."}, "docdt": "2000-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
