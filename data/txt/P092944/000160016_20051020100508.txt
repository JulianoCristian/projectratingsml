Description    The operation i s designed to assist the Government o f Rwanda (GoR) in implementing key
               policy actions outlined inits July 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which focuses
               on (a) creating a favorable private sector investment climate that would promote macroeconomic
               stability and sustained economic growth; (b) improving quality, coverage, and equity o f basic
               service delivery through improved expenditure efficiency;           and (c)    supporting overall
               improvement o f     public expenditure management and governance, with an emphasis on
               transparency and accountability to citizens' voice and participation. Inline with this agenda, the
               proposed PRSG I1continues and deepens support to the GoR as it implements the next steps in
               its reform program supported by PRSC I. includes (a) maintaining a stable macroeconomic
                                                           This
               framework, creating a strong basis for private sector-led economic growth, driven by agricultural
               transformation, promotion o f exports, and deepening o f the financial sector; (b) strengthening
               the results orientation o f its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and associated
               sectoral MTEFs, particularly in education, health, water, and energy, strengthening the linkages
               between MTEF priorities and the budget, and expanding performance-based contracting o f
               services; and (c) continued strengthening o f governance and transparency, particularly through
               further improvements to the fiduciary framework and empowerment o f local-communities. At
               the GoR's request, given the important linkages to the growth agenda including agricultural
               transformation and export promotion, policy dialogue in the transport sector has been added
               under PRSG 11, though this sector will also continue to benefit from investment support.
Benefits       This programmatic operation would continue support for the implementationo f a PRSP that was
               prepared ina participatory manner, with strong country ownership. Benefits would accrue to the
               population overall, with a particular focus on poor people in both rural and urban areas. By
               supporting GoR efforts to promote a favorable private sector investment climate to foster
               growth, and efforts to improve the fiduciary framework and transparency and accountability, the
               proposed PRSG would continue to strengthen the ability o f central and local government to
               improve delivery and increase equitable access to basic services (health, education, water,
               energy), with a view to improving human development and achieving Millennium Development
               Goals. Successes in human development sectors under PRSC Ithat PRSG I1builds on include
               the transfer o f capitation grants in education and the performance-based contracting o f high-
               impact health services via local health centers. The PRSG preparation process has served to
               strengthen donor coordination, with the GoR now taking the lead in coordinating donors around
               budget support programs.
               Though international and regional efforts to mitigate instability are in place, the risk o f flare ups
               between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo i s not negligible. The Bank supports
               these efforts aimed at fostering peace and security among Rwanda and its neighbors. Internally:
               Rwanda's security and political situation remains stable. Donors recognize the riskposed by the
               unpredictability o f donor financing, particularly timing o f disbursements, and are working
               together with the GoR to mitigate it. Risks associated with weaknesses in the country's
               fiduciary framework are being addressed through concerted work by the GoR, with support from
               donor partners, based on extensive analysis and recommendations on the way forward. Risks
               associated with Rwanda's weak institutional and human capacity are being addressed througk
               the GoR's comprehensive civil service reform program, which includes the recently establishec
               Human Resources Institutional Development Agency to coordinate capacity building needs
               including from the Bank's Public Sector Capacity Building Project, which was developed tc
               accompany the PRSCs, and the Bank's Decentralization and Community Development Project
               which addresses capacity at the local level

       POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT GRANT                              TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA

                                                    I.Introduction

1.       The second Rwanda Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSG 11) i s designed to build on
progress under PRSC I,continuing assistance to the Government o f Rwanda (GoR) to achieve the goals
outlined inits July 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and to progress toward achievement o f
MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) related to PRSP objectives.' Following on and consistent with
the PRSP, the December 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda highlighted the need to
move progressively from project-based approaches to sector-wide approaches (SWAPS) and budget
support, envisaging a series o f PRSCs in the base case lending scenario. PRSC I(USSSO million grant
and US$15 million credit), the first in this series, was approved by the Bank's Executive Directors on
October 21, 2004. This program document lays out the context, case, and areas o f policy emphasis for
PRSG 11, inthe amount o f a US$55 million grant.

2.       The PRSG series focuses on assisting the GoR to reduce poverty by strengthening the
macroeconomic situation to foster sustainable delivery o f basic services. The framework for the PRSC
series addresses growth and human development through a holistic, cross-sectoral approach, in line with
the GoR's PRSP. Each PRSC/G in the series aims to support implementation o f key policy measures and
expenditure programs aimed at (a) creating a favorable private sector investment climate that would
promote macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth; (b) improving the quality, coverage,
and equity o f basic human development services delivery, and increasing expenditure efficiency; and (c)
enhancing overall public expenditure management and governance, with an emphasis on expanding the
voice and participation o f citizens.

3.       Ensuringthat Rwanda remains on a path o f economic and social progress is key to sustaining
achievements since the 1994 genocide and increasing the stability o f the Great Lakes region. Rwanda's
transition from conflict to peace and development and its ability to implement its PRSP require
substantial development assistance. The PRSC series builds on significant achievements in good
governance-including       public expenditure management reform, fiduciary transparency, service delivery
performance, and reconciliation and unity-made             by Rwanda since 1994. Grant financing is essential for
Rwanda to sustain its economic and social recovery and develop its economy, including expanding
exports to address debt sustainability and reduce dependence on foreign aid.

4.       Key achievements under PRSC Iare summarized in Box 1, highlighting the GoR's already
significant progress in implementing its reformprogram. PRSG I1would continue to assist the GoR as it
implements the next steps inthis program, which focuses on (a) creating a strong basis for private sector-
led economic growth, driven by agricultural transformation, promotion o f exports, and deepening o f the
financial sector; (b) strengthening the results orientation o f its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) and associated sectoral MTEFs, particularly in education, health, water, and energy,
strengthening the linkages between MTEF priorities and the budget, and expanding performance-based
contracting o f services; and (c) continued strengthening of governance and transparency, particularly
through further improvements to the fiduciary framework and empowerment o f local communities. At the
GoR's request, given the important linkages to the growth agenda including agncultural transformation
and export promotion, policy dialogue in the transport sector has been added to the program under PRSG
11,to complement ongoing andplannedinvestment activities.

' Rwanda's PRSP and its implementationis fully owned and driven by the GoR. Following publicationof its PRSP in 2002, the
  GoR worked to develop a more action-orientedPRSP policy matrix during 2003 and 2004, with further refinement in2005 as
  part of the PRSP annual progress report exercise. This was done in close collaboration with development partners, including
  those providing budget support (the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), the European
  Union (EU), the African DevelopmentBank (AfDB), Sweden (SIDA), and the World Bank), and partners providing support
  throughsector investmentiprogramapproaches andprojects(Belgium, Germany, USAID, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA).

                 11.Recent EconomicDevelopments andMacroeconomicOutlook

A. Country Context

5.         Rwanda i s a small, landlocked country with a population o f approximately 8.2 million and per
capita GDP o f approximately US$230. Its population density, at about 340 inhabitants per square
kilometer, i s one o f the highest inthe world, with approximately 85 percent o f the population living in
rural areas. The economy is based on agriculture, which i s estimated to account for about 41 percent o f
GDP, while services account for about 38 percent and consist mainly o f wholesale and resale trade in
various products, transportation, and public administration. Industry accounts for 21percent o f GDP,
of which manufacturing accounts for 8 percent and construction 11percent.

6.         Though Rwanda has made a remarkable transition from reconstruction to development in the
eleven years since the genocide-in        which close to one million people were lulled, two million people
were driven into exile, over one hundredthousand people were put inprison, and thousands o f people
were handicapped physically and mentally-the            legacy remains and the country i s likely to depend on
significant levels o f external assistance for years to come, even in light o f recent agreements on debt
forgiveness. Domestically, Rwanda continues to make good progress on reconciliation, carrying out
demobilization, reintegration, and professionalization o f the army and police force. The disamament,
demobilization, and reintegrationo f former combatants has created space for re-balancing security and
social concerns, with military expenditures decreasing from 3.4 percent o f GDP in2000 to 2.3 percent
in2004, and social expenditures increasing from 3.8 to 4.8 percent over the same period. Over 2004-
2005 Rwanda also accelerated the holding o f community-based hearings (i.e,, Gacaca') of the
genocide accused.

7.         Corruption i s neither widespread nor entrenched in Rwanda, with the commitment to good
governance coming from the highest levels o f government.                    Following the adoption o f a new
Constitution and presidential and legislative elections in 2003, the GoR continues to demonstrate this
~ommitment.~The country was one o f the first to volunteer for and submit a national self assessment
report to the Africa Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) under the New Partnership for Africa's
Development (NEPAD), which largely focuses on g~vernance.~The NEPAD Secretariat has
conducted its assessment, on which it reported favorably in June 2005. InNovember 2005, the GoR
plans to host the Africa Governance Forum, which will take up the topic o f the APRM, with
discussion on the case of Rwanda and other countries that have gone or are preparing to go through the
process. The GoR also continues to make steady progress on instituting a sound public financial
management system based on an action plan developed in close collaboration between the GoR and
donor partners. In 2005, a much lauded measure demonstrating the GoR's commitment to good
governance included the impounding and auctioning o f f o f all vehicles with engines over 2,500 cc
(i.e., 4x4's) used by govemment officials in central and local administration and in all government
projects, replacing them with smaller, less costly vehicles. The GoR i s also completing successfully a
comprehensive civil service reform program (with support from DFID), to streamline and upgrade the
functioning o f goxemment administration. This i s being done in conjunction with the development o f
a comprehensive and coherent capacity building strategy to be supported by the wider donor
community, focusing on human resources, the legal environment, organizational effectiveness, and
public-private partnerships. This i s expected to result in fewer but more qualified civil servants.

8.         Internationally, tensions in the Great Lakes region increased in November 2004 when
President Kagame indicated that he would consider sending troops to disarm paramilitary groups


   Literally "Justice on the Grass"
   In 2004, a minister in charge of good governance was appointed, the Office of the Ombudsman was established, and
   electionsof mediators and national women councilors were successfully completed.
   The APRM four focus areas are democracy and good political governance; economic govemance and management;
   corporategovernance; and socio-economic development.
                                                                                                                 3

based inside the Democratic Republic o f Congo (DRC). Although the deployment o f troops was never
confirmed by the United Nations (UN), the statement caused a delay in some programmed donor
disbursements and caused the UN Security Council to demand in December 2004 that Rwanda pull
out any military forces across the border. Tensions eased with the establishment o f a joint verification
mechanism between Rwanda and the DRC to resolve border disputes. Moreover, the African Union
agreed inprinciple to send troops to the DRC to disarm paramilitary groups.

B.       Recent Economic Developments

9.       Despite major electricity shortages, real GDP growth recovered from 0.9 percent in 2003 to 4
percent in 2004, drivenby strong activity in construction, transport, and communications. Due to poor
climatic conditions, agriculture in general saw no growth; however exports crops saw an increase in
2004, with coffee exports 107 percent higher inU.S. dollar value and 77 percent higher involume than
in 2003 because of an increase in exports of fully-washed coffee and the pruning cycle. Rice
production increased by 64 percent, while roots, tubers, fruits, and vegetables saw a decline. The
manufacturing industrydeclined by 4 percent, though performance varied within the sector following
the energy crisis. Construction grew by 7.5 percent. Overall, services grew 9.7 percent, with the
finance sub-sector growing by 11.5 percent and transport by 17 percent, while commerce sub-sector
growth was modest at 2.6 percent. The food and beverage sub-sector, led by beer and lemonades,
grew by 5.6 percent. By contrast, the electricity, gas, and water sub-sector declined by 22 percent. The
consumer price index recorded an inflation rate o f 12 percent in 20045, compared to 7.4 percent in
2003. This was driven by inflation in the food and drinks sub-sector (16.4 percent) and the utilities
sub-sector (18.2 percent) due to energy and fuel cost rises.

10.      The country's balance o f payments improved markedly in 2004 compared to 2003. Following
a doubling o f coffee exports, from US$15 million in 2003 to US$31 million in 2004, and volume and
price increases for metals such as cassiterite and colton, exports rose from US$63 million to US$97
million in2004, an increase o f 54 percent. However, Rwanda continues to suffer from a narrow export
base. Annual exports per capita amount to just US$22 compared to an average o f US$145 in Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA). Highvolatility o f prices for coffee and metals continue to cause major volatility
in the external accounts. The terms of trade index in 2004 was 65 compared to 100 in 1995. With
heavy demand for imports o f consumer, energy, and capital goods, the current account deficit as a
share o f GDP has been high at about 16-19 percent in recent years (18 percent in 2004; 19 percent in
2003).

11.      Owing to the disbursement o f PRSC Iin December 2004, gross official reserves rose to 5.7
months o f imports from five months in 2003. N e t foreign exchange reserves rose by US$97 million to
US$315 million in 2004. Reflecting these developments, and in light o f the U.S. dollar depreciation,
the Rwandan Franc (RwF) nominal exchange rate appreciated by 10 percent. The increase inreserves
was offset by a sharp decline in net domestic assets, following a fall in net credit to the GoR with a
large net repayment (after receipt o f budget support funds) o f government banking debt. Credit to the
private sector increased by 10.2 percent in nominal terms but, given the inflation rate, there was no
real increase. Broad money and deposits rose by 12 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively, while
reserve money grew by 13.5 percent to US$99 million. Currency in circulation, which represented 64
percent o f reserve money in 2002, rose to 69 percent in 2003, and stood at 68 percent at end-2004.
This was due to a strong increase in private sector credit seemingly resultant from an unusually early
financing o f the coffee harvest; an improvement in the financial position o f banks; and lingering
effects o f the loosening o f monetary policy earlier in the year. Inaddition, there i s anecdotal evidence
o f an increasing monetization o f the economy and the resultant demand for cash and expansion in
activities o f non-bank financial institutions, with a large number o f informal microfinance institutions



  End of year inflation rate.
                                                                                                         4

  having reported to the Central Bank that they provide savings and credit6. To keep reserve money at a
  level targeted under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program, the National Bank
  o f Rwanda (Le., the central bank) issued a large amount o f Treasury Bills to the non-bank sector,
  which kept interest rates high. (Table 1)

  12.       In 2004, total domestic revenue amounted to US$256 million, representing 14 percent o f
  GDP, compared to a budgeted amount o f US$233 million. The higher than expected performance was
  due to improved collection o f personal income tax following a more complete audit o f companies'
  books, higher collections o f non-tax revenue due to administrative improvements, an increased
  consumption tax, and better value-added tax (VAT) performance due to a shift imports composition
  from raw materials to finished goods, which are taxed at a higher rate.' Total expenditures in 2004
  amounted to US$478 million, or 26.1 percent o f GDP, US$10.2 million over the budgeted amount.
  The total included US$315 million on recurrent expenditure, US$156 million on capital expenditure,
  and US$38 million on net lending. There was a US$31.3 million difference between actual and
  budgeted expenditure on net lending, explained by the repayment to the PreferentialTrade Area Bank
  o f a government-guaranteed loan to Prime Holdings in the amount o f US$10 million; repayment o f
  arrears; the purchase o f generators worth US$6 million for Electrogaz to address the energy crisis; and
  the replacement o f strategic stocks o f fuel o f US$2.4 million.

C. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

  13.        Given low agriculture productivity and the continuing energy shortage, the economy i s
  expected to perform at less than the desirable growth rate o f 6 percent per annum-a                     PRSP baseline


   This data comes from information collected during the central bank's exercise to register microfinance institutions, thereby
  ' facilitating monitoring and supervisionof these institutions.
    VAT and consumption taxes are calculated on the sum of the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) value and imports duties. The
    latter are higher for finished goods.
                                                                                                                             5

scenario-over the medium term. GDP growth i s expected to be about 5 percent in 2005-2006, with
inflation decreasing from 10.2 percent in 2004 to 6 percent by end 2005 and 3-5 percent over the
medium term. Revenues are expected to remain at around 14 percent o f GDP, and total expenditures
are expected to be around 27 percent of GDP. The deficit (excluding grants) would remain about 12
percent o f GDP if budgetary financing (which would be mostly in the form o f grants) materializes as
programmedand the monetary program remains on track.

14.      At the same time, to improve the quality o f public spending and provide support to sectoral
strategies, priority spending could increase by up to 1.7 percent o f GDP (depending on the release o f
contingent funds). In particular, authorities plan to augment budgetary allocations in support o f
agriculture, export promotion, rural roads, and water; social spending in health and education i s
projected to increase by 0.3 percent o f GDP. Higher budgetary allocations would go toward the tea,
coffee, and tourism sectors to facilitate structural reforms. Additional measures would also include
strengthening the role o f the Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency (RIEPA) and
improvements in infrastructure, customs administration, and access to financing. The Bank i s
conductinga diagnostic trade study under the Integrated Framework, which will be completed in2005.
The study includes recommended actions to increase and diversify exports and remove constraints for
trade with regional and international markets-Rwanda           is now a full member o f the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).

15.      There will be a lag before results from the above measures begin to take shape. In the
meantime, export earnings are expected to decline slightly in 2005 after the exceptionally strong
performance in 2004. Imports are projected to increase, reflecting continuing project-related import
demand from rehabilitation o f the electricity sector as well as increase o f international oil price. Price
increases over the past months have led to an increase in the current account deficit o f 1% o f GDP.
Overall increased cost o f energy would widen the external current account balance to 22 percent o f
GDP in 2005. As a result, the GoR has planned to increasereserves to roughly six months o f imports,
to protect the planned increase in growth-enhancing priority expenditures. Specifically, the GoR i s
concerned about the predictability in disbursements from budget support donors in light o f last year's
experience, in which several budget support donors unexpectedly suspended disbursements in the
fourth quarter o f Rwanda's fiscal year, leading to lower than programmed expenditure on priority
programs. The authorities are therefore emphasizing predictability o f financing over the coming
period, to accommodate necessary increases in expenditures and import demand. To achieve this and
minimize the impacts o f any potential shortfalls in grants, the authorities have determinedthat a higher
level o f reserves would be prudent. The financing gap associated with this scenario, which i s expected
to be covered by the PRSG I1and budget support from other donors, i s shown inTable 2.

16.      High external debt levels remain a concern. The net present value (NPV) o f external debt to
exports i s around 300 percent. Projections indicate that, given current debt levels and the narrow
export base, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio would remain above the 150 percent threshold over a
twenty-year horizon even if full debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and additional bilateral
assistance were delivered. However, macro performance i s on track, with the completion o f the Fifth
Review o f the PRGF on August 26, 2005.         *  All buttwo performance criteria for the fifthreview were
met, for which waivers were granted. Rwanda met its HIPC Completion Point on April 12, 2005.
Achievement o f the HIPC Completion point along with additional debt forgiveness by the G-8
countries has greatly improved Rwanda's debt indicators, though exactly how this will impact
Rwanda, including through IDA'Sgrant allocation framework, will need to be worked out in the
coming months, which may entail undertaking another full debt sustainability analysis. However,


* The IMF completed its fourth review o f the PRGF in February 2005. As a result, Rwanda will be eligible to draw an
  amount equivalentto SDR 0.57 million (about US$SOO,OOO),bringing the total amount disbursedunder the arrangement to
  SDR 3.43 million (about US$5.1 million). Rwanda's PRGF arrangement was approved on August 12, 2002, for the
  amount o f SDR4 million; the secondandthird reviewswere satisfactorilycompletedin June 2004.
                                                                                                                   6

Rwanda's low export base implies that grant financing will continue to be necessary for the
foreseeable future.

17.        With support from its development partners, Rwanda could meet its poverty reduction targets
by developing stronger and more sustainable growth at rates higher than those expected. It i s clear
that given the existing structure o f production and supply response, the period o f consistently high
growth rates (averaging 10 percent annually between 1995 and 2002) associated with post-genocide
reconstruction is over. Going forward, Rwanda's main challenges are to achieve a sustained growth
rate o f minimum 6 percent to achieve its poverty reduction and MDG targets. To this end, the GoR
recognizes that these targets are achievable only if strong productivity-enhancing strategies,
particularly in agriculture and exports are immediately put into place. As a result, GoR recently
completed an agriculture strategy, and with support from donors has put increased emphasis on
implementation. Financing for productive activities in Africa i s severely constrained by a perception
of high political risk in the region as a whole, and also in individual countries. Ln the medium- to
long-term, the GoR should, with support from donors, aggressively pursue improved regional
integration through further development o f economic ties with neighboring countries, as well as
through reforms that involve private sector-led growth and increased domestic and foreign private
investment in key sectors. Such measures should serve to reinforce political and macroeconomic
stability. Grants from donors to finance investments will remain key to promoting growth (see Box 2).

      Box 2. Sources of Growth

Agriculture. Agnculture i s a key pillar o f the PRSP. It currently accounts for about 41 percent o f GDP and about 50
percent o f export revenue, employng about 90 percent of the active labor force, and the majonty o f poor people.
Rwanda's production base is predominantly smallholder (average land holding is 0.7ha), rain-fed, and female, with up
to 97 percent o f the active female population engaged in the sector. Thus, this IS a key area impacting poverty
reduction. Agnculture was expected to grow at 6.6 percent in 2004 (following average growth of 7.1 percent over
1999-2003), but due to rainfall vanability and, to a lesser extent, the energy cnsis, which affected exports, the sector
expenenced virtually no growth.         To improve agnculture growth going forward, including diversification into
horticultural products, such as fruits and vegetables (which generate greater revenue than staple crops), pyrethrum,
hides and sluns, the GoR finalized its Strategic Plan for Agricultural Transformation in October 2004. It highlights
four program areas and 17 subprograms, from which Cabinet has endorsed 24 prionty actions. In December 2004,
Rwanda's export promotion strategy and action were adopted by Cabinet, and the Rwanda Investment Promotion
Agency was transformedinto the Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency. The GoR's plan i s to continue to
increase public investments in the agnculture sector dunng the first "pnmary growth phase" from 2002-2006, and to
have the pnvate sector play a major role in investment dunngthe second "consolidation phase" from 2006-2010.

Coffee and Tea. In2004, coffee and tea exports accounted for 58 percent o f goods exported. As a result o f policy and
institutional reforms o f 2003104, coffee production increased to 30,000 tons in 2004, or 38 percent over 2003 figures.
The GoR's strategy is to focus on fully washed, premiumcoffee, the average pnce for which i s about twice that o f
traditional beans. Donors such as USAID are playing an active role in providing financing, training, fertilizer, and
washing stations. Rwanda's tea, the leading traditional export commodity, is considered to be o f the highest quality
and prices are three times that for non-premium tea. Pnces have been relatively stable and production is expected to
double by 2010, from the 2003 level o f 14,300 tons. Ongoing pnvatization o f tea factories i s expected to improve
production and exports, though financing remains a major constraint to production. A recently completed Financial
Sector Assessment Programwill feed into the GoR's action plan to address this.

Services. The service sector will continue to be a strong driver o f growth inthe medium term. Activities inthis sector
consist of banlung and financial services (8 percent), transport, storage and communication (18 percent), trading (24
percent), rental property (25 percent), and public administration (25 percent). Activihes related to deepening the
financial sector, particularly micro-finance, have the greatest potential to contribute to growth. Measures initiated to
increase tourism and information communications technology penetration are expected to stimulate service sector
growth.

       ruction. Construction activities will remain a key driver o f growth, inturn stimulating investment and trade. The
        as simultaneously launched initiatives in labor intensive public works to rebuild and generate employment in
       and rural areas. This work will complement the GoRs plan to improve the road networks (particularly rural
       ,which hasbeen identified as a major constraint to trade and competitiveness bythe Integrated Framework

         a1 Integration. Increasing trade both within the region and globally i s crucial to achieving pnvate-sector led
          in the medium- to long-term, and there is great potential for Rwanda. For example, measures to improve
      nda's ability to respond to the transformation o f food procurement systems around the world, as illustratedb y the
     dnse o fregional and international supermarkets, could be a potential growth area for Rwandan exports and trade.

            standards, and access to lower-cost inputs (resulting from economies o f scale). Training in market
                 and business management, to promote high value production and trade could also be provided. To
                ign investment, the GoR will continue to facilitate intra-African trade and enhance ongoing regonal
                fforts. Political nsk bamers to trade will be addressed through the IDA-financed Regional Trade

                              11.        Rwanda's Poverty Reduction Strategy

A. Poverty Situation and MDGs

18.      Rwanda's PRSP provides a comprehensive diagnosis o f the causes o f poverty and outlines the
key objectives and actions required for reducing it. A calculation o f poverty before the genocide,
which useda poverty line based on the 1985 household budget survey, estimated that 50 percent o f the
rural population was poor in 1990.9 Poverty dramatically increased following the genocide, reaching
78 percent o f the population, including 82 percent inrural areas and 28 percent in urban areas. Annex
5 provides a table with indicators o f Rwanda's likelihood o f meeting the MDGs.

19.      By 2000, the proportion o f poor people had declined to 64 percent. In 1999, a new definition
o f poverty was established and a new poverty line created from the national rapid poverty assessments
and the household living standards survey (HLSS), establishing the headcount index at 60.3 percent
below the poverty line, including 65.7 percent in rural areas and 14.3 percent in urban areas. The
HLSS showed a significant change inincome inequality, with the Gini-coefficient rising to 0.455 from
the 0.270 in the 1985 HLSS (a figure that has a very narrow empirical base), and with urban
populations much better off than rural. In2000, the Gini index ranged from roughly 0.32 in Gitarama
and Kibuye (largely rural areas) to 0.43 in Butare, Cyangugu, and Kigali City (urban areas). Seventy
five percent o f households inKigali were in the highest expenditure quintile, compared to 9 percent in
Kibuye. The increase inurban to rural inequality reflects the relative neglect o f rural areas inthe post-
conflict reconstruction process as external funding provided development and employment
opportunities for urban dwellers, but primarily humanitarian relief to rural communities. Currently,
Kigali i s undergoing a visible phase o f construction and modernization. Duringthis process, caution i s
warranted to guard against urban development becoming a liability for urban poor people, for example
through the uprooting o f small houses and small businesses.

20.      The 2004 Poverty Assessment, discussed in a workshop inRwanda inMarch 2005, shows that
long-term growth was heavily affected by the 1994 genocide. Had the genocide not occurred, GDP i s
estimated to be 30 percent higher than today and, all other factors equal, poverty would be
considerably lower. In addition, Rwanda's GDP, in per capita terms, i s hampered by rapid
demographic growth and geography (i.e., the fact that the country is landlocked). The Poverty
Assessment shows that geographic location, household structure, and occupation significantly
determine a household's poverty status. Rwanda's south-westem provinces o f Butare, Gikongoro, and
Kibuye are poorer compared to other provinces. Female-headed households have a higher incidence o f
poverty than male-headed households. Households worlung in agriculture, and especially agncultural
wage laborers, are poorer than others.

21.      The Poverty Assessment also notes that an additional child decreases household per capita
consumption by 20 percent, and that female-headed households have 20 percent less consumption in
urban areas and 8 percent less in rural areas, compared to male-headed households. The head of
household's level o f education has a strong impact on household members' consumption level. When
the head o f household completed primary education, household consumption levels were 24 percent
higher in rural areas and 29 percent higher in urban areas compared to a household without such
education. These figures double to 54 percent and 69 percent, respectively, when the head o f
household had completed secondary education. This points to large gains in consumption from
education. Estimates tabulated from the 2001 household data indicate that widows head about 22
percent o f all households in Rwanda and these households constitute one o f the poorest groups. The
rate o f extreme poverty in these households i s 49 percent, second only to the poverty rate in


  This estimate was based on a limited number of householdsilocations. It seems low given the then state of the economy.
  Bank staff is currently revising its pre-genocidepoverty estimate upward, usingrecently available household surveys.
                                                                                                                       9

households headed by divorced women. Households headed by elderly widows who care for their
orphaned grandchildren may constitute one o f the most vulnerable sub-groups. The high level o f
poverty among widows suggests that they may have lost their rights to retain control o f their land and
economic assets.

22.       A simulation analysis in the Poverty Assessment (based on extensive poverty and social
impact analysis) also shows that increased use o f fertilizer would significantly decrease poverty. This
i s not only because fertilizer increases production, but because the level o f fertilizer use in Rwanda i s
currently very low. The use o f fertilizer at an optimal level, according to the simulation, could
decrease the incidence o f rural poverty by 12 percent. The GoR i s also carrying out a new poverty
survey (with DFIDsupport) as abasis for its second PRSP.

B. PRSPand ImplementationProgress

23.       Rwanda's PRSP, discussed by the Bank and Fund Boards on August 12, 2002, sets out the
GoR's vision for achieving the MDGs, including reducing poverty by half by 2015. It articulates a
medium-term program (2002-2007) as a first step toward the GoR's "Vision 2020."                           The PRSP
preparation process integrated traditional problem-solving (such as Gacaca)              lointo the national poverty
reduction program, which has broadened the GoR's legitimacy to take action. The PRSP
implementation process i s underpinned by decentralization o f government administration and grants
for community-based development schemes channeled through a Common Development Fund
(established by the GoR in May 2002). Development partners strongly supported Rwanda's PRSP
process and have universally commended the GoR for the consultative manner through which the
PRSP was developed.

24.       The PRSP articulates five basic building blocks and six priority action areas. Figure 1
illustrates Bank support to Rwanda's PRSP.

                                                     Good governance

25.       The GoR's first PRSP annual progress report (APR) covered implementation through June
2003 and the second through June 2004. The GoR also provided a supplement to the second APR,
covering progress on PRSP policy-related actions through end-2004 and early 2005. APR preparation
was strongly participatory, involving not only development partners (as was the case for the 2003
APR), but also local government authorities, parliamentarians, nongovemmental organizations
(NGOs), and other civil society stakeholders. The APR incorporated the results o f a participatory
survey undertaken to gauge the satisfaction o f grassroots groups with public services and private
initiatives targeted at poverty reduction."           For the second APR, line ministries, rather than the
coordinating group in the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN), took
responsibility for writing their respective APR inputs. Though at the time it published the second



lo Community tribunals, literally "Justice on the Grass"
" In  2002, MINECOFIN established the Strategic Planning and Poverty Reduction Monitoring Department (now the
   Strategic Planningand Poverty Monitoring Unit) to coordinate the implementationof the PRSP's core programs, including
   a monitoring and evaluation function.
                                                                                                                     10

APR the GoR was planning to update its PRSP over 2005 for publication in 2006, it subsequently
decided that continued concentration on policy implementation over 2005 was warranted, and thus
plans to publish its second PRSP in mid-2007. As such, the GoR i s in the process o f finalizing its
third APR.

26.      The second APR provides a candid review o f PRSP implementation. It analyzes key PRSP
elements, including the participatory approach; priority public actions; monitoring and evaluation;
institutional and governance issues; and donor coordination. The APR discusses the slower than
expected progress on agricultural transformation and rural development and on the development and
implementation o f a strategy for export-led growth. It highlights progress in the area o f public
financial management, while outlining remaining challenges, and discusses the significant
achievements in human development, particularly in the education and health sectors. It also outlines
the vision o f further strengthening sector strategies and the links between them, the sectoral and
overall MTEFs, the budget, and the GoR's poverty reduction strategy. The Joint Staff Advisory Note
(JSAN) commends the GoR for its frankness about achievements and shortfalls, and highlightsareas
for more focus going forward: creation o f an overarching macroeconomic framework, including debt
sustainability analysis; costing and prioritizing sector strategies; creating an enabling environment for
private sector development and implementing productivity-enhancing strategies, particularly in
agriculture and export promotion; and further improving the delivery o f public services through pay
reform and better targeting toward the poor.

27.      The GoR continues to pursue decentralization, both to deconcentrate central authority and to
devolve the decision-making and budget implementation process to authorities who are in closer touch
with communities' needs. A newly adopted "Territorial Reform establishes four "deconcentrated"
provinces and 30 district governments -from 106 before the reform-.I2 It i s to these districts that most
o f the responsibility for decisions and budget implementation for service delivery are being devolved.
However, capacity at the district level i s often insufficient to effectively deliver services. Thus, while
the Bank-supported Decentralization and Community Development Project i s helping communities to
lead their own development, with PRSG support the districts have been piloting private contracting of
services, most notably inthe health and water sectors, with block grants from the center playing a role.
Based on successful pilots, support from PRSG I1would help to further this approach. At the same
time, the GoR is reviewing the administrative map o f the country to reduce the number o f districts and
i s preparing a series o f laws to provide a clear framework to govern the relationships between central
and decentralized authorities.

28.      Overall budget management has improved over 2004 and 2005, and the 2005 budget i s closely
linked with PRSP priorities. Both recurrent and capital expenditures are rising, representing 28.4
percent o f GDP versus 26 percent in 2004 and 24.4 in 2003. The increase in expenditure levels i s
largely driven by (a) the implementation o f fee-free primary education; (b) fuel and energy; (c) salary
increases, in line with the GoR's civil service reform program; (d) increased police recruitment and
promotion; (e) increased access to health services for the poorest people; and (0 infrastructure
programs, mainly for electricity and agriculture. Exceptional expenditures, which are mostly
transitional expenditures, have been declining, representing 13 percent o f the 2005 budget versus 17
percent in2004.

29.       Priority expenditure allocations for 2005 have increased by 27.8 percent compared to 2004.
Most priority expenditures are in social sectors such as health and education. The total priority budget
for education increased by 12 percent compared to 2004, accounting for 49 percent o f priority
expenditures in 2005. The increase i s mainly meant for primary education, to continue implementation
o f the GoR's fee-free education policy. The highshare o f tertiary education priority programs, such as
domestic and intemational scholarships, has been reduced in the 2005 budget, in line with the GoR's
commitment to cap and gradually decrease public spending on tertiary education. The health sector
continues to receive the second highest priority allocation, with 14.4 percent of the total 2005 budget.
The most important program in this category i s for decentralization o f health services. Following
health, other priority areas include the national police force (to improve internal security), local
administration (to support Rwanda's decentralization program), electricity, infrastructure, and
agriculture (see Table 3).

30.       The budget execution rate for the 2004 recurrent budget was 82 percent (excluding debt
payments). However, the executionrates for priority programs have been consistently higher. In2004,
the recurrent education budget was executed at 102 percent; agnculture at 92.4 percent; and health at
91 percent. Although overall priority expenditures were executed at 100percent in 2004, some priority
programs under-spent their budget due mainly to unforeseen energy needs, coupled with delays in
grant disbursements in 2004. This included programs in agriculture, export promotion, provinces and
districts, community services works, and public works.

31.       Going forward, the GoR plans to redefine priority expenditures (which currently account for
over half of total budget expenditures) in the format o f poverty reduction expenditures, aligning this
redefinition with the exercise o f preparing its second PRSP. The objective would be to match PRSP

                                                                                                      13

objectives to poverty reduction expenditures, which in turn would be reflected in sectoral MTEFs and
ultimately translated into budgetprograms.


                 IV. Bank Supportto Rwanda's PovertyReductionStrategy

A. Link to CAS and Other BankOperations

32.      The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda was discussed by the Board in
December 2002, following the PRSP. Consistent with PRSP priorities, the CAS articulates a Bank
program o f support around four themes (a) revitalization o f the rural economy; (b) private sector
development and employment creation; (c) human and social development; and (d) improvement in
governance and effectiveness o f public sector actions. The CAS highlights the need to move
progressively from project-based approaches to SWAPS and budget support, envisaging the PRSC
program in the base case lending scenario. The CAS also proposed greater emphasis on economic and
sector work, recognizing Rwanda's need for a sound analytic base for strategic planning. The new
CAS will be prepared in line with the GoR's second PRSP and would be presented to the Board
following the Board's discussion o f Rwanda's second PRSP.

33.      While PRSG support incorporates sector dialogue and policy and institutional reform actions,
the nine active Bankprojects inRwandacomplementpolicy dialogue andreformbyproviding focused
investment assistance. Sectoral projects complementing PRSG actions include a Rural Sector Support
Project, a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, an Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project, a
Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project, a Regional Trade Facility Project, an
HIV/AIDS MAP, and a Human Resources Development Project in education (the latter will close in
June 2006). Cross-sectoral projects directly reinforcing PRSG aims include the Decentralization and
Community Development Project, effective since December 2004, to help empower local
communities to develop and implement projects and programs meeting their development needs, and
the recently effective Public Sector Capacity Building Project, designed to provide targeted capacity
building in PRSC areas. It will collaborate with the GoR's recently created Human Resources and
InstitutionalDevelopment Agency (HIDA), which i s responsible for coordinating government requests
for capacity building. The Bank i s also supporting a Demobilization and Reintegration Project in the
context o f the Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program.

34.      The lessons learned from the Bank's past experience in implementing projects and
development policy operations in Rwanda outlined in the PRSC I program document remain valid:
previous operations have tended to be characterized by overly complex project design, an
uncoordinated approach among the various Bank interventions in different sectors, and insufficient
attention to service delivery for the poorest. The Bank has taken these lessons into account in its
current approach, using the PRSG program as the overall umbrella for Bank support and policy
dialogue-in   line with the GoR's development priorities-with    project support aimed to complement
PRSG objectives. Lessons from current experience continue to point to the public sector's acute need
for human capacity development, particularly now that the country's reconstruction phase has ended,
so that the GoR can implement its ambitious reform program in the timeframe envisaged. While the
GoR should be commended for the successful way in which it has camed out the first phase o f its
comprehensive civil service reform program, including large retrenchments, in the short-term it has
further diminishedthe already taxed capacity of central and local government ministriedagencies To
support the GoR in the second phase as it recruits, hires, and trains competitive candidates for newly-
defined, open positions, the GoR and its donor partners are discussing how best to coordinate capacity
buildingactivities inline with HIDA's mandate.

C.      Analytic Work Program

35.     An extensive set o f analytic and advisory activities is informing the PRSCiG program.
Building on analysis conducted to underpin PRSC I,major ongoing and completed analysis
underpinning PRSG I1 i s summarized in Table 4. It includes the finalization, in 2005, o f a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (which built on the joint GoWdonor Financial Accountability
Review and Action Plan that informed PRSC I)       and a Financial Sector Assessment Progradeview
o f Observance of Standards and Codes (FSAPROSC). In addition, the GoR plans to fund annual
sectoral public expenditure reviews from its budget starting in 2006. And, given its importance, a
Multi-sectoral Rural Development Strategy Study for medium- to long-term development o f the rural
economy will be undertaken. Donors will continue to jointly carry out and share analytic work.

C. Donor Coordination,Harmonization, and Alignment

36.     Rwanda's donor partners, particularly those partners providing budget support (Le.' AfDB,
DFID, EU, SIDA, the World Bank and, going forward, the Dutch) have endorsed Rwanda's PRSP as
the framework around which to channel their support. Following the Rome Declaration on aid
harmonization, the GoR and budget support donors at the time signed, in November 2003, a

                                                                                                       15

Partnership Framework for harmonization and alignment. It aims to improve donor alignment with
the GoR's PRSP and budget cycle, strengthen donor coordination, decrease overlap and duplication,
and reduce transaction costs for the GoR in dealing with donors and managing development
assistance. It established the Budget Support Harmonization Group, and has served to enhance the
level o f collaboration among budget support donors, inparticular in dialoguing with the GoR and each
other on planned support.

37.      PRSC Iwas the first budget support operation prepared under this Partnership Framework,
and preparation o f PRSG I1 built on the experience. This time, the GoR firmly took the lead in
coordinating donors. As part o f a reorganization o f MINECOFIN, the External Financing Unit was
given the responsibility for handling donor relations, and it implemented the calendar agreed by the
GoR and donor partners (see Annex 6), introducing the following processes over the last year, which
facilitatedpreparation o f PRSG 11:

  Joint Budget Execution Review. The GoR invited budget support partners to joint budget
  execution reviews in March and July 2005, to discuss sectoral and sub-sectoral budget allocations
  and expenditures at the national and district levels, in view o f the links to PRSP growth, poverty
  reduction, and human development outcomes. Review objectives included (a)                    improving
  predictability o f expected resource flows; (b) improving information on actual allocation and
  expenditure o f resources and adequacy o f spending in light o f intended outcomes; and (c) providing
  better information on fiscal aggregates and how they are financed, to better inform macro-level
  discussions.

  Joint Public Financial Management Review. In Februaryhiarch 2005, the GoR invited budget
  support partners to ajoint public financial management review. The review carried on the process o f
  collaboration among the GoR and donors to document Rwanda's significant progress in public
  financial management reforms, identify gaps, and determine a roadmap o f actions going forward.
  The review fed into the finalization o f the Country Financial Accountability Assessment.

  Sector Reviews. Building on and feeding into the joint budget execution and public financial
  management reviews, the GoR invited budget support donors to review priority sectors (including
  education, health, water, and energy) in preparation for joint budget execution reviews. The sector
  reviews also fed into the PRSP APR preparation and validation process and the budget preparation
  process. The assessment o f sector indicators and the update/preparation o f sectoral MTEFs were
  undertaken as part o f the sector reviews. Sectoral "cluster" groups, first established in 2002,
  underpin the process. Each major sector has a cluster around which input from relevant government
  agencies, donors, and other stakeholders i s organized. A lead government agency and lead donor
  coordinate the cluster's activities. The GoR and donor partners recognize that, in practice, certain
  cluster groups have been more active/effective than others. The GoR i s encouraging clusters to
  clearly define their goals and objectives, and i s cognizant o f the need to ensure that timing o f sector
  reviews i s fully aligned with PRSP and budget cycles. So that the groups do not proliferate out o f
  control, the GoR and donor partners have agreed that, going forward, a new cluster must be formally
  recognizedby Cabinet before it can officially be recognizedas a cluster.

38.      The overarching donor coordination body in Rwanda is the Development Partners'
Coordination Group, which meets monthly and i s co-chaired by the GoR and UN Resident
Coordinator. A sub-group on Harmonization and Alignment in Rwanda for Projects and Programs is
comprised o f the GoR and non-budget support donors (with a secretariat hosted by the UnitedNations
Development Program). Interms o f harmonization, much progress has been achieved over the past
few years. SWAps with harmonized features are emerging in several sectors. Bilateral donors are
engaged in delegated cooperation agreements at sector level. Joint sector reviews, joint or shared
analytic work are common practice. Annex 8 offers more details on recent progress in terms o f
harmonization and alignment. However, despite the progress, given the multiple donor coordination

                                                                                                         16

mechanisms and sources o f aid, the GoR (led by MINECOFIN's External Financing Unit) i s
developing an Aid Policy Document, to clearly define what Rwanda wants to achieve with its external
assistance, what sort o f aid to accept, and how it can be most efficiently managed. The document i s
expected to be presented at the November 2005 Rwanda Development Partners Meeting (Rwanda's
annual donor conference). Having reviewed the experience under the 2003 Partnership Framework,
under which both the GoR and budget support donors have successfully implemented some
commitments but failed to implement others, signatories agreed to consider the best way forward,
whether it be through an updated Partnership Framework or other means, in the context o f the Aid
Policy Document.

39.      As with PRSC I,the PRSG I1 policy matrix is completely aligned with the GoR's
PRSP/medium-term reform program, being a subset o f measures taken directly from the PRSP matrix.
The PRSP (and thus the PRSC) matrix i s dynamic from year to year; the GoR and donor partners,
including the World Bank, review its content as part o f the process outlined above, and any updates to
the PRSP matrix are reflected in the PRSP APR. During the review process, the Bank, in close
collaboration with the GoR, assess whether the measures selected from the PRSP matrix as PRSC
prior actions and triggers (a) continue to reflect the most important dimensions o f the program; and (b)
have progressed as expected. Though all donors are invited to participate in this process, only the
World Bank, AfDB and, going forward, the Dutch use a common Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF). In the spirit o f furthering harmonization, discussions between the GoR and all
budget support donors are ongoing regarding the pros, cons, and feasibility o f moving to a PAF shared
by all.

40.      Like PRSC I,PRSG I1 disbursements would be aligned with the GoR's budget cycle. As
agreed under the current Partnership Framework, all budget support donors are attempting to move to
frontloading o f disbursements in the first quarter o f the calendar year (corresponding to the first
quarter o f Rwanda's fiscal year), to reduce volatility o f aid flows, which affects the GoR's capacity to
plan and budget effectively. Five donors-CIDA,       DFID, SIDA, the Swiss, andthe Netherlands-have
also put inplace a basket fund in support of improved aid management and efficiency. In2004, three
major budget support donors unexpectedly suspended disbursements during the fourth quarter; as a
result the Bank increased the amount o f budget support planned for 2004 by US$15 million to fill the
gap and help the GoR avoid defaulting on major commitments. Similarly, PRSG I1i s expected to
disburse before end-2005 so that funds may be available to the GoR for January 2006, but also to
provide flexibility for the GoR to use a portion o f the funds infiscal 2005 if necessary.



                  V. Proposed Second PovertyReductionSupport Operation

A. Overview

41.      PRSG I1would continue Bank support to the GoR to implement its PRSP. As discussed inthe
PRSC Iprogram document, the PRSG program focuses on a set o f policies and reforms intendedto (a)
create a favorable private sector investment climate that would promote macroeconomic stability and
sustained economic growth; (b) improve quality, coverage, and equity of basic service delivery
through improved expenditure efficiency; and (c) support overall improvement o f public expenditure
management and govemance, with an emphasis on transparency and accountability to citizens' voice
and participation. The broad outcomes expected at the end o f the first PRSCiG series (i.e., PRSC/Gs I,
11, and 111)include (Table 5):

  Continued macroeconomic stability, maintenance o f low number o f days to open a business, and
  increased exports to GDP ratio.
  A monitorable, increasedproportion o f children having completed primary school.
  Measurable reduction o f under-five mortality and impact of communicable disease.

                                                                                                       17

   Measurable increased access to clean water and sanitation facilities.
   A clear regulatory framework for the energy sector, including a transparent regulatory tariff setting
   mechanism.

43.      PRSG I1prior actions are set out in Table 7 (they are the bolded items from the PRSG policy
matrix in Annex 2) along with the PRSP aredobjective to which they relate. Reflecting the GoR's
highly ambitious nature, there are (as with PRSC I)13 prior actions, in some cases with sub-actions
embedded therein. Table 7 also explains the evolution o f PRSG I1prior actions as envisaged at the
time o f PRSC I.While many PRSG I1prior actions have not changed from what was envisaged at the
time o f PRSC I,in a few instances the GoR underestimated the time Parliament would spend
reviewing legislation or was over ambitious in what it projected it could achieve in the time period,
particularly in light o f the civil service reform program carried out over 2004-05, which diminished
the GoR's capacity to implement its reform agenda in the short run. Overall, however, Rwanda has
made steady progress in implementing its policy reform agenda, and the reform program i s judged to
be on track.

B. PRSGI1ReformProgram

45.      PRSGI1would continue to focus on and assist the GoR as it implements the next steps in its
reform program supported under PRSC I,including (a) creating a strong basis for private sector-led
economic growth, driven by agricultural transformation, promotion o f exports, and deepening o f the
financial sector; (b) strengthening the results orientation o f its MTEF and associated sectoral MTEFs,
particularly in education, health, water, and energy, strengthening the linkages between MTEF
priorities and the budget, and expanding performance-based contracting o f services; and (c) continued
strengthening o f governance and transparency, particularly through further improvements to the
fiduciary framework and empowerment o f local communities. At the GoR's request, given the
important linkages to the growth agenda, policy dialogue and preparatory work on a detailed, output-
oriented MTEF linked to planning and budgetinginthe transport sector has been added to the program
under PRSG11,to complement ongoing and planned investment activities.

     i. PrivateSector-Led GrowthandAgriculturalTransformation forPoverty
         Reduction

46.      Current Issues. Highgrowth scenarios as envisaged in the PRSP to meet MDGs and generate
income and employment are only possible with private sector development. Inaddition, a key part o f
Rwanda's growth strategy in the short- to medium-term i s agricultural transformation, since the
economy remains largely agrarian. Linkedto this, and to the longer term growth strategy, the GoR is
focusing on diversifying the economy, promoting exports, furthering regional integration and
investment, expanding tourism, introducing information communications technology (ICT), and
continuing improvements inthe bankinglfinancial sector.

47.      Inthe first instance, improving returns to farming is fundamental to rural development and
poverty reduction since the majority o f the poorest people in Rwanda are subsistence farmers. In
addition, the GoR recognizes the link between agnculture growth and social stability. Studies such as
the HLSS show that farmers involved in the production o f cash crops have higher income or
consumption compared to subsistence farmers, and those involved in non-farm activities have even
higher incomes. Thus, the GoR has designed several initiatives to improve apcultural productivity
and diversify the economy.         Some, such as investment in high-quality coffee production and
construction o f coffee washing stations, have yielded encouraging results. Studies analyzing the tea
sector conclude that privatization will increase productivity, positively impacting GDP growth and
poverty reduction by increasing export revenues and the livelihoods o f the mainly small-holder
farmers that work the plantations. At the same time, the economy remains vulnerable to commodity
prices for coffee and tea and to climatic conditions for agriculture production. Over-reliance o f
agriculture on rainfall i s risky, unsustainable, and results in poor productivity. Promoting the use o f
fertilizers and optimal water use for agriculture production, extension services, availability o f inputs,
and capacity buildingfor small-holders i s needed. Lack o f financial intermediation in the rural sector
i s an issue, with only 2.3 percent o f bank credit going to finance activities in the agricultural sector;
highnominal interest rates and lack of formally registered collateral, such as land and property that
can be used as security, i s also a major constraint on borrowing. In addition, the overall budgetary
allocation to the agriculture sector remains low, and the linkages between the new sector strategy
(which itself i s linked to initiatives in the water, energy, and transport sectors), the MTEF, and the
budget need strengthening.

48.      Expanding its export base and diversification beyond agriculture are priorities, but given its
limited domestic market and distance to key ports, improvements in the country's transport and
infrastructure sectors will be crucial for Rwanda's exports to be competitive. Addressing energy
needs will also be necessary to foster private investment. The GoR i s moving forward with
privatization o f state-owned assets, though in some cases privatizationhas not moved as quickly as the
GoR would like because o f difficulties in attracting (domestic and foreign) investors. The GoR i s also
committed to deepening the financial sector. Banks continue to focus on short-term financing to
established customers and make only limited credit available to finance medium- and long-term
investments. While administrative barriers are not an issue, tax burden, customs procedures, and
transport costs are seen by the private sector as the major constraints to doing business in Rwanda.
New legislation to address contracts, bankruptcy, and competition i s needed.

49.      Rwanda embraces the principles o f free market economy and i s committed to furthering
regional integration. Since 1994, the GoR has embarked on a comprehensive liberalization o f its
economy, initiated legislative reforms, promoted free trade, and pursued regional integration targets
determined through the Cross-Border Initiative and COMESA protocols. In line with the regional
integration agenda, Rwanda reduced its tariff rates and eliminated all export taxes and other non-tariff
barriers and, as a result, Rwanda's trade regime i s now considered as one o f the most open in SSA. In
2004, the country joined the COMESA Free Trade Area, which provides duty- and quota-free access
to a market o f nearly 380 million consumers with a combined GDP o f approximately US$170 billion.

                                                                                                        22

Even with these commitments and efforts, Rwanda remains relatively closed to international trade,
both in absolute terms (US$306.8 million total revenue from international trade only duringthe period
1992-2002) and relative terms (17.3 percent o f GDP duringthe same period). Rwanda's trade balance
since 1994 has averaged a deficit equivalent to 20 percent o f GDP compared with an average o f 6
percent for all HIPC countries. Export performance has also been low.

50.       Government Strategyhzplementation Progress. Progress in agricultural transformation has
been slower than expected. The conflict and genocide devastated the sector, and it was not until 1998
that production reached pre-genocide levels. After launching the strategic planning process in the
context o f the Rural Sector Support Project and with assistance under PRSC I,                the GoR has prepared,
in consultation with districts and provinces, a Strategic Plan for Agncultural Transformation (PSTA),
a key milestone for PRSG 11. The PSTA's ultimate objective i s to contribute to national economic
growth, improve food security and the population's nutntional status, and increase rural households'
revenue. Its four priority programs are (a) intensification and development o f sustainable production
systems; (b) support to professionalization o f farmers; (c) promotion o f commodity chains and
development o f agribusiness; and (d) institutional development. The focus in 2005 has been on
refining and costing the plan, developing a more focused MTEF, and realigning projects and programs
inthe sector. This work is progressing well and is underpinnedby the Agriculture Policy Note that is
focusing on a set o f policy and institutional reforms to be implemented over the next year. Reflecting
the strides in sector strategy development, the PRSG matrix (Annex 2) includes much more robust
actions in the agnculture/growth area than was the case under PRSC I.Progress on the critical but
sensitive issue o f land reform remains slow, but the new Land Law, which guarantees tenurial security
and potentially permits the development o f a land market, has been approved by the Lower Chamber
o f Parliament and i s awaiting ratification.

51.       Simultaneously, the GoR-with          the Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency taking
an active role-began        to implement its export promotion strategy (developed with PRSG support)
over the past year. The strategy identified short-term measures for the coffee and tea sectors aimed at
improving access o f growers to input factors and building an international marketing presence for
Rwandan tea and coffee and, as a result, coffee production increased substantially in 2004.
RWANDEX, the major coffee exporter, i s currently undergoing privatization. The export promotion
strategy also identifies horticulture, including passion fruit, apples, bananas, cut flowers, houseplants,
and cape gooseberries, as an area with strong potential for expanding Rwanda's export base. However,
lack o f institutional capacity i s a constraint, and the Rwanda Bureau o f Standards has little capacity to
assist producers in meeting international standards. To further diversify the export base, create
employment, and promote self-sustaining growth, the GoR has designated an area close to Kigali
airport as an Export Processing Zone (EPZ). Tax and other incentives to attract foreign investors to the
EPZ, which have already begun to express interest, are being offered. The EPZ i s part o f the strategy
for expandingregional and international trade.

52.      The GoR has made considerable advances in reforming the business environment and putting
in place the regulatory framework for private sector investment. Rwanda was rated among the top
twenty reformers globally inthe 2006 Doing Business Report. Substantial progress has been made in
reducing the time to establishing a business and improving the overall legal framework and contract
enforcement. The report also ranks Rwanda among the top performers intrade reforms, and mentions
Rwanda as one o f the few developing countries which make available comprehensive consumer credit
reports. Furtherreforms will need to focus on reducing the costs o f business start up (which currently
averages 280% o fper capita income).           l4


14In general, Rwandahas implementedsubstantialreforms in contract enforcementand trade and was ratedamongthe top 10
reformers in this area in2004, accordingto the Doing BusinessReport. Creditregistrywas improved and customs
streamlined. Governmentnow distributescomprehensive consumer creditreports. Judicialprocedureswere also simplified,
by streamlining appeals and imposingtime limits on their filing, speeding up contractenforcement. The resulting time and
cost saved have been substantial,allowing more businessesto use the courts. Average time to resolve disputes has been

                                                                                                                       23

53.      There has also been increased effort to stimulate increased investment. In addition to the
adoption in 1998 o f an investment code in line with that o f a liberal market economy, more recently
the GoR has enhanced the justice and legal system, establishing functional commercial courts and
arbitration centers; created over 1,000 web pages o f hard investor information; modernized investment
procedures, established RIEPA as a one-stop-shop to assist potential investors and deliver required
approvals, certificates, and work permits for new investments projects. Foreign direct investment
inflows, which averaged US$lO million annually during the pre-war period o f 1985-1994 and US$6
million per annum between 2000 and 2003, increased from US$60 million in 2003 to US$227 million
in 2004 (registered and approved projects). The Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency (RURA) was
created to oversee the regulatory framework in key areas, such as water, electricity, and
telecommunications, related to private investment. The GoR's privatization program, an integral part
o f its private sector development strategy, identified 72 state-owned companies for privatization.
These companies operate in all sectors, including agro-business, banks, public utilities, and financial
services, mining, hotels, and tourism. While the privatization strategy has been successful in certain
sectors (53 companies have so far been privatized), it i s progressing more slowly than the GoR would
like. The process o f privatization o f tea factories, for example, has been more difficult than the GoR
envisaged. It i s now reviewing experience with the two factories privatized last year to incorporate
lessons leamed as it goes forward with privatization o f the remaining factories.

54.      Information communications technology (ICT) i s expected to play a role in development and
poverty reduction, increasing opportunities for marginalized groups, especially women, reducing
transaction costs, and increasing productivity. The GoR has already launched implementation of the
ICT strategy, which includes a vision for computers in every classroom, laying o f fiber optic cable,
and installation o f wireless capability (all o f which have begun with private participation), and the
strategy i s already having an impact. While small, the ICT sector experienced double digit growth in
2004. Key initiatives going forward include setting up public information kiosks (to serve as public
access points for information), community electronic information kiosks, and a land records
information system.         For the I C T strategy to succeed, significant improvements in Rwanda's
telecommunications infrastructurewill be necessary as will increased private sector investment inICT.
The recent privatization o f         RWANDATEL, the state-owned telecoms company, should further
facilitate implementationo f the ICT strategy.

55.      A tourism working group has developed a strategy for the sector that envisions tourist arrivals
increasing from 15,000 in 2003 to 70,000 in2010; the number o f days per visit increasing from four to
seven; and the amount spent per day increasing to US$200. Such developments would increase
tourism revenue four-fold. Tourism development i s expected to have an impact on a broad range o f
business opportunities, including hotels, restaurants, retail stores, handicrafts, tour agencies, tour
operators, and so on. The main obstacles to robust tourism growth include continuing to transform
Rwanda's image, developing human resource capacity, promoting marketing, and upgrading physical
infrastructure (including establishing air links to major centers). With the success o f the film Hotel
Rwanda and other publicity related to the 10' anniversary o f the genocide in 2004, tourist arrivals
have increased, standing at 27,000 in2004, with the expectation that 2005 numbers will be higher.

56.      Considerable progress has been made in improving the banking sector, and efforts to
modernize the legal and regulatory framework for commercial and financial transactions are also
underway. Banking sector regulation and supervision have been strengthened; a regulatory framework
for microfinance has been created; a new independent regulator for the insurance industry was


reduced by 22% and this has ledto a 15% fall in attomey fees. In addition, Rwanda's court and legal reform provides for
specializedchambersin trial courts for litigation related to business, financial and tax matters.Moreover, 1 professional
judge now presidesover such cases, assisted by 2 layjudges. Previously, a 3-judge jury was required. Interms of trade
reforms, Rwanda came second inthe 2006 Doing Business Report. Pre-shipment inspection is no longer required. The
customs declarationcan be done electronically, although hardcopies are still inspectedwhen picking the cargo up.

                                                                                                                         24

established; an electronic card payments system has been rolled out; a School o f Finance and Banking
i s operational; forceful judicial reform has been implemented; the public credit information system has
been upgraded; and land titling reform has been undertaken. Five o f six major banks have been
privatized, and the GoR i s expected to sell its shares in the remaining Bank o f Kigali during 2005.
Conventionalmeasures such as liquidityratio and the solvency ratio also attest to the improving health
o f the banking sector, with the share o f non-performing loans, while still high, having declined from
40 percent in 2002 to 27 percent in 2004. Entrepreneurs and small businesses still do not have access
to sufficient credit, and nominal interest rates are often high, at 16-18 percent for most businesses. The
recently completed FSAPIROSC, undertaken by the Bank and IMF in close collaboration with GoR
authorities, outlines actions for the financial sector reformprogram inthe near- and medium-term.

57.      Goingforward, with support from PRSGI1the focus will beonthe following areas:

     Continued improvement in the business environment. Even though the Government has made
     substantial progress in improving the business climate, further work is needed to reduce the
     barriers to creating and operating a business such as registration, access to credit, and the need to
     improve capacity in business shlls. Actions needed to provide further impetus to private sector
     growth include operationalizing the One-Stop-Window, and deepening reforms inthe banking and
     financial sector. The recently finished Financial Sector Action Plan (FSAP) and Diagnostic Trade
     and Integration Study (DTIS), which were prepared in close collaboration with the government,
     have specific actions for further improvements in the financial sector and trade integration and
     export promotion. Based on these recommendations, the government has initiated actions to
     strengthen micro credit intermediation, supervision, and regulation. These actions will contribute
     significantly toward reducing the cost o f setting up a business and also reduce the transaction costs
     which have hindered foreign investment.

     Export promotion, trade and regional integration. The Government recognizes that this will be a
     key area for growth and poverty reduction. As a result, increased focus will be on developing an
     Export Promotion Action Plan with clear time bound and monitorable indicators, based on the
     results o f the DTIS. In addition, the Government will focus on issues o f trade facilitation that
     have hampered trade, with a focus on support to strengthening infrastructure and transport.
     Rwanda will also focus on strengthening its ties to regional trade arrangements and integration.
     The country has initiated discussions to join the East African Community to improve regional
     trade links and to gain internationalmarkets.

     Improved agricultural productivity. Inorder to improve incomes for the vast majority o f people
     who live in rural areas, the focus will be on implementing measures to increase agriculture
     productivity and facilitate transformation from a subsistence economy to one that i s geared to
     production for the market. The focus will be on ensuring increased access to improved inputs
     while providing increased capacity support to farmers inthe use o f these inputs,and strengthening
     rural infrastructure 4.e. roads, water, energy. In addition, further analytical work will be
     undertaken to understand the commodity specific constraints along the supply chain and use this
     to inform provision o f extension service and training.

     Increased diversification of the Economy. As a part o f the diversification o f the economy, the
     government has viewed ICT, EPZ and tourism as major sectors for growth. The focus will be on
     development of the necessary infrastructure and provision o f the necessary training to support
     these sectors.   These sectors not only have the potential to generate significant employment
     opportunities, but also stimulate growth in hotels, restaurants, real estate, retail stores, and other
     businesses. In addition, there will be increased focus on research and training related to non-
     traditional exports inthe agnculture sector, such as horticulture and hides and skins.



                                                                                                        25

    ii. ImprovingServiceDeliveryfor the Poor: Education, Health, Water, Energy, and
         Transport

         a. Education Services

58.      Current Issues. While high in proportion to GDP (5.5 percent compared with an average o f
three to four percent in SSA), public spending on education remains low in absolute terms, which
constrains the GoR in its efforts simultaneously to restore and modernize the education system. Since
even in the high-case scenario economic growth will not be rapid enough to yield the necessary
resources, substantial extemal assistance in the sector will be needed for several years to come. The
GoR focused on ensuring the broadest possible access to education, especially primary education, as
part o f reconciliation and unity. As a result, enrollment has increased rapidly while quality has not
kept pace. This is evidenced by high teachedpupil ratios (even with double shifts), short supply o f
pedagogical materials, lack o f teacher qualifications, and high repetition rates (now capped at 20
percent, though underlying issues remain). Primary and particularly secondary education curricula are
outdated, and although primary enrollment i s now almost universal, only 15 percent o f children attend
secondary school, largely because o f distance and perceived irrelevance o f content. Vocational
education programs are needed to provide a skilled labor force, while disproportionately highspending
on higher education needs to be curtailed. The PRSP considers youth and adult literacy, especially for
girls and women, a critical development priority, and a draft policy will be presented to GoR for
approval. However, resources for the implementation of the policy are not currently available. In the
wake o f civil service reform, institutional and human resource needs should be re-assessed and the
roles and responsibilities o f central, provincial, district, and school body decision-makers (such as
PTAsand Boards o f Governors) clearly defined and utilizedto the maximumeffect.

59.      In the near- to medium-term, the GoR's three broad, poverty-related objectives in the
education sector are (a) improving the quality o f education services; (b) universalizing nine years o f
fee-free basic education; (c) decentralization; and (d) increasing the proportion o f poor students and
female students in public secondary schools. Progress toward these objectives requires adherence to a
fiscally viable, long-term education sector development plan, transfer o f public resources to schools,
and accountability for results interms o f access and quality o f services.

60.      Government Strategy/lmplementation Progress. The GoR and donors continue the sector-
wide approach, meeting regularly to review issues and discuss the sector plan with the GoR, with a
formal, annual joint review conducted with all stakeholders. With PRSC support, the Ministry o f
Education (MINEDUC) has made significant progress in refining its Education Sector Strategic Plan
(ESSP) and related MTEF. The challenge now is to move to the next level, improving the link
between the two and ensuring adherence to a fiscally sustainable sector development strategy that i s
consistently reflected in the annual MTEF update and annual budget, along with accountability for
outputs inline with planninghheMTEF.

61,      Fulfilling the GoR's commitment to universalize nine years o f fee-free basic education has
been a key focus of the strategy development process. Implementationbegan with the introduction o f
fee-free primary education in 2003-04, and the net primary school enrollment rate now stands at 93
percent, with gross enrollment at 131 percent (reflecting the enrollment o f over-age pupils).Different
financing scenarios and implementation structures were developed with support from PRSC Iand
DFID as a basis for MINEDUC to carry out the nine-year basic education policy. However, the
various scenarios imply very difficult policy choices. Financial resources are available if MINEDUC's
eventual proposal sets realistic targets and strategies for investment in improved quality (i.e., teacher
development, provision o f leaming materials, monitoring leaming achievement) and capacity and
avoids new, high-cost public investments in vocational, technical, and science and technology
education, and ICT. While the latter are PRSP priorities, they were elaborated before the GoR's

                                                                                                      26

commitment on nine year basic education was introduced. Recognizing the scarcity o f resources for
the latter, in the process o f developing its science, technology, and I C T policy, MINEDUC i s
attempting to attract co-financing from domestic and international business.

62.      Universalizing nine-year, fee-free basic education implies the need to set sustainable limits on
public financing o fhigher education. To this end, MINEDUC needs to implement the higher education
financing framework it endorsed in late 2001. Several core elements o f the framework are starting to
be addressed, reinforced by Parliament's approval o f the Higher Education Law in March 2005.
MINEDUC's aim i s to reduce high unit costs o f tertiary education by introducing formula funding,
reducing annual student loans over time, and widening the resource base with encouragement for
public higher leaming institutions to seek private funding. With the new law, key planning and
implementation institutions, such as the National Council for Higher Education and the Student
Financing Agency o f Rwanda, can now be established (each requires a specific law). The GoR, with
donor assistance, i s also actively trying to address the lack o fvocational education programs.

63.      For the 2003-04 school year, capitation grants in the amount o f RwF300 per capita were
successfully transferred from the central government via districts to primary schools to cover the loss
in fee income from the introduction of fee-free primary education. MINECOFIN's flash report and
spot-checks at the school level attest that the transfer process was transparent, funds were deposited in
schools' bank accounts, and funds were accounted for. The key issue going forward i s to leverage this
experience so that schools' additionalneeds can be met. For example, facility capacity and the number
o f instructors have not kept pace with the increased enrollment that resulted from the introduction o f
fee-free primary education. Access shock was manifest in the 2004 budget flash report, which
recorded 473 primary school classrooms operating under trees and 204 in plastic sheeting; many
primary schools are also operating double shifts, with student-teacher ratios as high as one to 60-80 in
primary. MINEDUC increased capitation grants duringthe 2005 school year by more than three-fold,
to RwF1,OOO per capita, and i s considering gradually increasing the amount further and revising the
guidelines so that schools can spend the grants as best meets their needs. PTAs and district inspectors
provide the checks and balances, ensuring that grants are spent inline with guidelines.

64.      Going forward, with support from PRSG 11,the focus i s on:

  Investments in Improved Quality. The main actions, endorsed at the third annual Joint Education
  Sector Review in April 2005 are to (a) continue increasing, gradually, the capitation grant for
  primary schools and link it to quality assurance and accountability through school-based
  management; (b) develop a minimum quality standards package for primary school; and (c)
  professionalize teaching through a new teacher development and management policy (TDMP). The
  latter would restructure training under a new national institute o f education. Taken together, these
  actions address the efficiency gains that must be made inprimary education, inorder for enrollments
  in secondary education to expand. The remaining low completion rate in primary (47 percent) and
  small population base (18 percent gross enrollment) for effective transition to the first year o f
  secondary mean that the latter cannot expand unless there i s greater efficiency at the primary level in
  greater retention o f pupils. The costs o f these actions need to be factored into the education sector
  financing strategy, along with the progressive elimination o f double-shift and a reduction in pupil-
  teacher ratios foreseen by the TDMP.

   Universalizing Nine-year Basic Education. The program elements for universalizing nine years o f
  basic education have been integrated into the ESSP, and MIhTEDUC i s updating the financial
  implications. The main challenges are facility capacity, the number o f instructors needed, and
  improvement in the training and career structure o f teachers. The situation of teachers i s covered in
  the TDMP being prepared for presentation to GoR, but salaries are an issue and also have to be
  examined in the broader civil service perspective. Cost o f the teacher compensation package and
  costs o f revising the teacher training system and the curricula for nine-year basic education are

                                                                                                       27

  presently unknown, but will need to be added to the recurrent cost projections o f the ESSP. As far as
  constructioni s concerned, the ESSP estimates this at 11,000 new classrooms by 2010.

  Decentralization. It i s clear that districts are now the locus o f service delivery, and MINEDUC i s
  systematically liaising with these decentralized authorities. As mentioned, the capitation grant i s
  already being transferred to school level. The amount o f this grant will be increased to FrRw2500
  per student in 2006. The TDMP would further shift weight to the school level through schools'
  management o f school-based teacher training in partnership with district administration, inspectors,
  and the national institute o f education. The momentum in this direction may eventually serve as a
  lever for the local hire o f teachers. However the existing norms for decentralized action remain
  unclear. Nor i s the devolution o f funding articulated to permit schools to take on the more significant
  responsibility o f hiring teachers. A teacher sub-committee has been proposed to look into the
  Constitutional framework to define responsibilities for the local level.

  Increasing Proportion of Poor and Female Students in Post-primary. MINEDUC i s committed to
  increasing efforts for alternative delivery systems to educate hard-to-reach children, to doing more
  for orphans and vulnerable children, and to sharpen its girls' education policy. All are slated to be
  costed into the 2007-2009 MTEF. Yet, research i s already showing that achieving universal fee-free
  secondary education i s beyond the GoR's affordability. The fiscally viable way forward may be for
  the GoR to increase provision in rural areas while the private sector concentrates on provision in
  urban areas, where more students can afford to pay full fees. Appropriately crafted, this could offset
  the risk that private entrepreneurs would continue to operate schools mostly to capture the fee
  income from vulnerable segments o f the population who qualify for state-funded scholarships. This
  phenomenon today results in the larger proportion o f females (60 percent compared to 32 percent o f
  boys) who study in private secondary schools, which are far less resourced and which do not offer
  rigorous academic programs, with implications for inequality ingirls' career opportunities.

         c. Health Services

65.      Current Issues. In line with the PRSP, the main objective o f the GoR's health program i s to
reduce under-five mortality and maternal mortality rates and improve other health indicators through
increased utilization o f evidence-based interventions, increased access to these interventions by poor
people, improved health system accountability and efficiency, and fiscal sustainability o f budget
support. Following progress under PRSC I,in which performance-based payment schemes for high
impact health services (i.e., immunization and assisted deliveries) were piloted, the main issues that
the health sector is now focusing on include (a) continued support o f the basic health program under
implementation (e.g., immunization, payment o f civil servants, and basic supplies inhealth centers and
hospitals) within the Ministry o f Health's (MINISANTE) budget ceilings; (b) introduction o f
conditional contracts for the purchase o f specific health service packages through a new line item
(`Transfers Conditional Grants/Contracts') in the MINISANTE budget; and (c) maintenance o f a
coordinated and balanced approach to the implementation o f vertical programs directed at major
diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Regarding (a), the maintenance of budget
ceilings for the basic health program implies that additional hiring o f staff, staff incentives, and other
improvements at the health center and referral levels would have to be done directly by these
institutions and financed from the resources obtained through performance-based contracts. Regarding
(b), four packages o f services-community           health center services, community health schemes,
mutuelles (local insurance mechanisms), and obstetrical care through district hospitals-are      envisaged
to be purchased through conditional grants and the contracting mechanism.          Regarding (c), the GoR
will continue to harmonize donors active in such programs to ensure that vertical efforts are in line
with its planned development o f the health system.

66.      Government Strategvdmplementation Progress. To meet its commitment to improving the
health o f its population and achieving the MDGs, over the past three years the GoR, with the

                                                                                                         28

assistance o f development partners, has improved the quality o f its health centers and the availability
o f drugs, and created incentives among health staff to increase the availability o f human resources in
the rural areas. To finance these efforts, the GoR budget allocation to health has increased
substantially showing almost a two-fold nominal increase (185 percent) between 2002 and 2004.
However, the proportion of total GoR budget (recurrent and development) allocated to health in 2004
was 6.2 percent, which amounts to roughly 1.6 percent o f GDP (equivalent to approximately US$3.1
per capita). The 2005 budget contemplates a large increase in the proportion o f budget allocated to
health, to 9 percent, due mostly to an increase in donor financing directed toward the fight against
specific diseases (leading to a doubling of the 2005 development budget over 2004 figures). The
recurrent budget i s expected to remain at about 5.5 percent o f total GoR recurrent budget in 2005, but
contemplates an increase to about 8 percent in 2006, to finance contractual schemes. The overall GoR
total health budget is expected to be about 2.4 percent o f GDP in2006.

67.      Going forward, with PRSG I1 support, MINISANTE is focusing on implementing four
contractual schemes through the transfer o f conditional grants from the center to the administrative
district or province. The strategy for each scheme i s describedbelow. The GoR and donors are takmg
a sector-wide approach, meeting regularly and conducting joint reviews o f the GoR's progress and
sector plan.

  Health Center Services. This program, piloted intwo provinces (Butare and Cyangugu) with support
  from PRSC I,    transfers conditional grants from the central government to provinces for the purchase
  o f a basic package o f essential services from community health centers. The provincial government
  requires the engagement o f the health center on the basis a performance-based contract. Drafting and
  supervision o f such contracts requires capacity and community participation that, in the case o f the
  pilots, has been developed with the participation and financing from donors and NGOs. The
  intention is to scale-up the program to other provinces gradually, to incorporate lessons fi-om the
  pilots, and to institutionalize achievements o f the pilots by increasing budget allocations to the
  schemes in these two provinces. A similar mechanismto the capitation grant inthe education sector
  may be used going forward, to transfer the program fully to the GoR's budget and more directly link
  service delivery, results, and payment. MINISANTE and MINECOFIN agree that funds should be
  transferred directly to the health center upon request o f the oversight body, which i s the provincial
  steering committee. Funds transferred could cover the package o f services as well as small
  equipment and motivational incentives for personnel to achieve results, depending on health center
  needs. Services delivered are based on GoR policy priorities, starting with a limited number of
  indicatorsto make monitoring and evaluation at the outset simple.

  Community Health Schemes. This package transfers resources from the central government to the
  district to engage, via performance-based contract, community-based institutions, NGOs, animateurs
  de sa&      (local health care workers), or others as relevant to deliver essential services at the
  household or community level. Compared to services delivered under the community health center
  scheme, the services delivered in this approach are simpler and less technical, focusing on
  preventative services that can be delivered at home (e.g., distribution o f bednets, handwashing, use
  o f safe water systems). To develop local district actors' capacity to deliver such services, guidelines,
  instructions, and booklets with clear examples of implementation mechanisms and activities are to
  be developed and shared. The scheme i s being operationalized in several districts over 2005, with
  the introduction o f additional services over time as opposed to all at once to permit the development
  o f appropriate capacity and to take into account budgetary concerns.

  Mutuelles (local health insurance schemes). Mutuelles, which have been piloted over the last four to
  five years, now cover about 27 percent o f the population, with about RwF103 million of the GoR's
  budget allocated to the schemes. Mutuelles pool funds from community members to cover a package
  o f basic health services provided at the health center level and for the transfer o f patients, when
  needed, to referral hospitals. Some o f the mutuelles have also experimented to include clinical care.

                                                                                                        29

  The objective is to smooth the cost o f health services for members, eliminating the hardship o f
  making payment for health services out o f pocket. Mutuelles play an important role in
  intermediating between health centers, district hospitals, and the population. Evaluations show that
  mutuelles are more effective when they have strong community participation in their governance
  structures and make payments to the health centers on a capitated basis, essentially transferring all
  risk to health centers. Mutuelles have not traditionally covered the poorest people, because they
  cannot afford the premium. The intention i s to have the GoR transfer funds to cover premiums for
  the poorest people in the community. The focus in 2005 is on building administrative and
  management support and technical capacity, including training and development o f appropriate
  tools. No new transfers to mutuelles are being affected in 2005 so that a clear policy, management
  capacity, and guidelines can be developed and lessons from the pilot phase fully incorporated.
  Additional direct transfers to mutuelles would not take place untilthey have standard accounting and
  reporting capacity.


e Obstetric Care through District Hospitals. This program would pilot the purchasing o f essential
  obstetrical services from district hospitals, with the aim o f making progress on decreasing maternal
  and infant mortality. The pilot i s important to develop capacity at the hospital level to respond to
  appropriate incentive and accountability mechanisms. The purchasing would initially be performed
  throughperformance-based contracts underwrittenbetween MINISANTE and the hospitals.

        d. Water Services

68.      Current Issues. Lack o f access to clean drinking water and inadequate hygiene result in
diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, which are main causes o f morbidity and mortality inRwanda.
Integrated water resources management (IWFW) i s also a crucial element for development in sectors
such as agriculture, water, energy, tourism, education, health, and the environment. While IWRM
policies have been drafted, key issues in the sector include inter alia (a) inadequate framework
legislation and regulations governing water resources planning and management; (b) insufficient
technical professional staff at national, provincial, and district levels; (c) an incomplete inventory o f
water resources and absence o f a water information system; (d) increasing industrial pollution and a
lack o f adequate waste water treatment facilities; (e) inadequate watershed management and a high
level o f soil erosion; and   (0  pollution o f water courses and lakes, especially by water hyacinth.
Inadequate management o f available water resources constrains the country's development and its
possibilities for reaching the MDGs.

69.      Rural access to safe drinking water officially stood at 57 percent in 2004, though effective
rural access was only about 40 percent due to inadequate maintenance o f systems and poor cost
recovery. Overall, the sector's development prospects are constrained by insufficient financial
resources, poor maintenance o f existing systems, poor budgeting and investment planning, lack o f
monitoring and evaluation capacity, and poor donor coordination (GermanyiKFW, the EU, Belgium,
Austria, AfDB, and the World Bank are the main donors in the sector). The GoR supports a shift
toward the efficient management o f water supply systems through private operators. The
decentralization process transfers responsibilities and ownership o f rural water supply systems to
distncts, but the transfer o f financial resources to the districts still needs to be improved. Inaddition,
the technical capacity at the provincial level i s not adequate for assisting the districts in planning,
executing, and managing water supply and sanitation systems at the community and district levels.
The sector's weaknesses are being addressed with PRSC support through the establishment o f an
operational framework to help districts financially and technically to plan, execute, and manage water
supply and sanitation systems, and to implement water resources management activities at the
community and district levels.

70.      Urban water supply stood at 73 percent o f households in 2004, but 40 percent o f the gross
supply was unaccounted for, partially due to old distribution networks. Urban water systems remain

                                                                                                        30

with Electrogaz (the water and energy utility), operating under a private management contract with
Lahmeyer International. As a short-term solution, additional groundwater wells will be developed near
the Nyabarongo River to alleviate Kigali's water supply deficit, which exceeds 50 percent. Detailed
feasibility studies for long-term solutions, including the use o f Nyabarongo river water and Mutobo
springs inRuhengeriprovince, are under preparation.

71.      Government StrategyLmplementation Progress. The water sector strategy in Rwanda i s pro-
poor and in full coherence with GoR objectives as outlined inthe PRSP and with the MDGs. Given its
importance to human development and in the effort to meet relevant MDGs, the GoR i s focusing on
increasing access, particularly inrural areas where the majority o f the population resides. The ministry
incharge of water and naturalresources (MINITERE) and the water directorate (DEA)have initiated
a sector-wide approach for scaling-up reform and investment, to increase access to reliable, affordable,
and sustainable water services inthe rural area, inter alia through:

  A strategic thrust toward accelerated decentralization, increased financing, community participation
  incapital cost and inmaintenance cost, and privatization of the management of rural water supply
  services so that by 2010 an additional 1.5 to 2 million people in rural areas are provided with safe
  water supply and sanitation services through increased functionality and coverage rates.
  Establishing an operational framework with donors and other stakeholders for policy dialogue,
  coordination o f interventions, andjoint annual sector reviews.
  The preparation o f MTEFs on the basis o f prioritized and costed water and sanitation programs, and
  linkingo f financing options to key results; the 2005-2007 MTEF follows this format and, based on
  it,MINECOFINhas allocated a higher budget ceiling for MINITEREin2006.
  Providing districts with technical support and financial assistance through the Common
  Development Fund, to shift to an efficient private management model so that in 2007 the target o f
  10percent o frural water supply systems are being managed by local private operators.

72.      Draft legislation to govem the water sector has been presented to the GoR and stakeholders
before submission to Cabinet, and complementary rules and regulations are also being processed for
promulgation, including the law on marshlands and sewerage and wastewater regulations. It i s
expected that in 2006 some well-identified water and sanitation projects will be financed from the
national budget and executed at the decentralized level, as a first step to test the mechanism o f
channeling funds directly from the central level to the districts in the sector, in conformity with the
decentralization policy and the newly adopted sectoral strategic development framework.
MINITEREDEA will support the development of a more efficient management o f existing water
supply systems by promotingbest management practices inall districts (based on the experience o f the
Bymba province), by involving local operators contracted by district authorities, and by supportingthe
implementation o f private management contracts. To accelerate the decentralization o f water and
sanitation services, DEA will create a technical support unit for reinforcing the capacity at district
level. Substantial efforts have been made to establish an adequate and simple monitoring and
evaluation system to measure progress and cost efficiency. A computerized database allows for the
extraction o f sectoral achievements (on a semi-annual basis), and information available from past
budget execution reports informs strategic resource allocation.

73.      To complement support provided under PRSG 11, the GoR, with Bank assistance and
cofinancing from the Nordic Development Fund (NDF), is preparing a National Water Resources
Management Project. It will, in conjunction with the PRSG, focus on promoting economic growth
through IWRM and related investments (`Waterfor Growth'),including:

  Promoting economic growth through the development o f mini-hydropower for rural development;
  watershed management and erosion control; groundwater development; and investments in
  conjunction with the upcoming Kagera Basin Multi-Purpose Development and Rusumo Falls Hydro-
  Electric Power Projects.

  Assistingwith implementation o f a new policy, legal, regulatory and institutional framework.
  Strengthening o f the country's environmental and water resources management capacity, through
  institutional reform, development o f human resources, and building o f a comprehensive water
  information system.


      e. Energy Services

74.      Current Issues. Rwanda i s facing three serious energy issues. The first i s a recurrent
shortage o f power, brought on by strong demand growth coupled with rising oil prices, unexpectedly
low hydropower reservoir levels, high transmission and distribution losses, and the unreliability o f
Electrogaz's dilapidated network. These supply shortages have raised the cost o f doing business and
weakened the prospects o f attracting new investments. Power shortages, and the associated load
shedding, also diminishes the prospects for effective rural electrification. The second issue i s a
potential wood-fuel shortage, exacerbated by an increasing population. Rwandans almost universally
use either wood (in rural areas) or charcoal (in urban areas) for cooking. Given that it takes nine
kilograms o f wood to make one lulogram o f charcoal, the increasing urban population has a marked
impact on wood-fuel usage. Already charcoal prices are at record high levels, and the GoR has
accorded a very highpriority to resolving this issue before it reaches a crisis point. The third issue i s
the high cost of petroleum fuels. With a small economy, landlocked Rwanda must import fuel on
tanker trucks, resulting in significant fuel transport costs. In addition, recent record high oil prices
have hit Rwanda hard not only in the direct cost o f hel, but also in the cost o f electricity, which i s
now partly producedwith diesel generators.

75.      Government Strategy/lmplementation Progress. As an emergency response to the electricity
shortage, the GoR provided finance for Electrogaz to purchase 12.5 megawatts o f new diesel
generation capacity and Cabinet approved a temporary duty waiver on diesel fuel used by Electrogaz
for power generation. To cover the additional costs associated with the relatively expensive diesel-
based generators, a tariff revision incorporating the cost o f fuel was announced and implemented as o f
January 1,2005. The increase was a stop-gap measure to limit fiscal.costs; the GoR also seeks to adopt
a revised tariff structure and an automatic tariff update mechanism to ensure that cost changes,
especially fuel costs, are passed on to consumers. While the tariff increase i s large, its social and
poverty impacts are expected to be limited since consumers with access to electricity are not in the
poorest segment o f the population. PRSG I1support would catalyze the GoR to address further tariff
reform issues. I t will emphasize implementation o f a new tariff structure to replace the flat tariff in
place since 1998, and it will support the GoR's adoption o f a baseline for the performance indicators
for Lahmeyer International, the private management company for Electrogaz, under the terms o f its
2003 contract with the GoR (the baseline was not agreed at contract negotiation because o f poor
reliability o f Electrogaz data at the time). Regarding wood-fuel and potential shortages, the informal
nature o f the market poses a different set o f challenges. It calls for organization and capacity building
in a widely disbursed supply network, along with education of consumers about more efficient
coolung stoves and methods. Some initial preparatory work in this area has commenced, but
considerably more effort and funding will be needed. The GoR i s also implementing reforestation
programs to address the deforestation issue and, in the longer term, i s seeking alternatives to wood-
fuel coolung. Near-term strategies for mitigating the petroleum price shocks focus on conservation
measures and development o f a strategic fuel reserve. In the longer term, the GoR i s seeking to
establish an oil pipeline to reduce transport costs.

76.      Additional work completed in the PRSC Iperiod includes a survey o f charcoal producers and
sellers; Cabinet adoption o f an Energy Sector Policy Paper, which includes rural electrification;
Electrogaz preparation o f a draft near-term investment plan, including a network rehabilitation plan;
fuel procurement and temporary storage arrangements for new Electrogaz generators; and preparation


                                                                                                         32

o f pre-feasibility studies o f prospective micro-hydro stations, with detailed technical and business
plans to be developed.

77.      Over the medium-term, investments in the energy sector are being supported by a team o f
donors, including the AfDB, the Arab Bank for Economic Development, Belgium, the Netherlands,
the NDF, and the World Bank. The recently approved Bank/NDF-financed Urgent Electricity
Rehabilitation Project will support urgent rehabilitation works on the transmission and distribution
system, installation o f about 12 megawatts o f medium speed diesel generators, and technical
assistance and capacity building to key sector actors such as the ministry in charge o f energy
(MINNRA),Electrogaz, and RUM. An Environmental and Social Management Framework is
guidingthe analysis and mitigation o f environmental and social impacts under the project. The GoR i s
also pursuingextraction o f methane gas from Lake Kivu, through a recently signed contract with a
foreign consortium. The Bank has agreed to consider a guarantee for this transaction, and IFC has also
been requested to join the financing plan. Studies financed under a previous Bank project have
established that gas exploitation could be technically feasible, environmentally safe, and economically
attractive. An ongoing Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment o f Power Development
Options for Rwanda, Burundi and western Tanzania has concluded that power generation from Kivu
gas i s competitive with comparable hydroelectric options. The GoR i s committed to expediting Kivu
gas development-initially    for power generation-with   private sector participation.

         J: Transport

78.      Current Issues. As a landlocked country to which the nearest seaport i s close to 2,000
kilometers away, Rwanda faces high transport costs-representing       close to 40 percent o f export and
import values. The cost o f transporting coffee and tea exports to the port inMombassa, Kenya, where
the trade market for these commodities i s largest, accounts for 51 percent o f their trade value.
Furthermore, while it costs about US$80 per ton for goods to be transported from the United States to
Mombassa, it costs about US$250 per ton to transport goods from Mombassa to Rwanda, and the
average price for international goods i s three times more expensive in Kigali than in Nairobi, Kenya.
The PRSP recognizes that the country's weak international road links impose high costs on
intemationally traded goods, and that the rural transport network's poor state equally inhibits internal
trade. The GoR i s workmg with the Bank and other external partners on investment projects in the
sector, but because o f the importance o f transport to the GoR's growth, agricultural transformation,
export promotion strategy, the GoR has requested that the sector-particularly       actions related to the
overall policy and regulatory framework-be      included under PRSG 11. This is reflected in the PRSC
matrix (Annex 2), which now includes elements of the transport portion o f the GoR's PRSP matrix.

79.      With Rwanda's mountainous terrain and excessive rain fall, erosion o f the road network i s
particularly severe, and maintenance costs are twice that o f most SSA countries. The country's road
network o f 14,000 kilometers is spread over barely 27,000 square kilometers o f national temtory, one
o f the densest in SSA, which far exceeds Rwanda's human and financial capacity for maintenance.
Recent sector surveys, conducted with EU assistance, concluded that only 23 percent o f Rwanda's
asphalted network i s in good condition, while barely 5 percent and 2 percent o f the secondary and
communal networks are in good condition, respectively. Eighty-five percent o f the 1,100 kilometers
o f asphalted network requires heavy rehabilitation or periodic maintenance, and most of the secondary
and communal network has not been maintainedfor over a decade.

80.      Government StrategyJmplementation Progress. The PRSP identifies transport infrastructure
development as the GoR's second priority after agricultural development. It spells out a medium-term
priority agenda for the sector, including maintenance o f selected roads inbadrepair and the upgrade o f
some strategic roads. The overall policy framework in transport i s under review, though the GoR's
main policy objectives with respect to road transportation are to (a) enhance Rwanda's integration into
the regional economy and to make Rwanda a regional trade and transit center; (b) focus transport

                                                                                                        33

sector investment on expanding and improving road safety; (c) institute a policy framework for the
accelerated development o f the road sub-sector; (d) finance road maintenance works through the road
maintenance fund, which i s financed through the budget, a direct levy on fuel, a cross-border charge,
and various penalty charges; (e) encourage community participation in road maintenance through the
district development committees; (f) improve the ability and quality o f local road infrastructure,
thereby enabling the rural community to market its crops; and (g) create an environment conducive to
the encouragement o f private sector participation in rehabilitating, maintaining, and developing road
infrastructure.

81.     The GoR has requested that policy dialogue inthe transport sector be included inPRSG11,to
lay the ground work for the investment program. This includes assistance to develop a detailed,
output-oriented MTEF that i s linkedto planning and budgeting in the sector and aspects related to the
overall policy and regulatory framework, derived from a new transport policy that i s under
development, with a focus on measures related to improving and sustaining the maintenance o f
Rwanda's priority road network. The Bank i s working with the GoR and other development partners,
most notably the EU and AfDB, on an investment program that would contribute to PRSP objectives,
help implement a new sector policy aimed at promoting overall transport efficiency, and contnbute to
building a strong and functional link between sector strategies and macroeconomic growth. The
ongoing preparation work on the investment program includes social and environmental impact
assessments and related mitigation measures.           The program would complement other regional
interventions, notably the East Africa Community Transport Facilitation Project, whose key objective
for Rwanda i s to facilitate the latter's integration into the East African Community, and contribute to
the efficiency o f the country's corridor transport to and from the ports o f Mombassa in Kenya and
Dar -Es-Sa1aam inTanzania.

    iii.PublicSectorUnderpinningsforImprovedServiceDelivery

         a. Public Expenditure Management

82.      Current Issues. The GoR has made good progress in strengthening its management o f public
finances, though the challenges it faces going forward are becoming starker. They include (a)
strengthening the linkage between national strategic planning, the MTEF, and resource allocation
through the annual budget; (b) addressing weaknesses in the financial accounting and auditing
systems, including the ability to attract and retain technically trained and qualified financial
management personnel; (c) increasing capacity o f budget agencies so that they are able to prepare
adequate financial information, including cash plans and financial statements, and to meet the
constitutional obligation o f preparing a consolidated set o f financial statements for submission to the
Office o f the Auditor General; and (d) fulfilling the commitment to integrate the recurrent and
development budgets.

83.      The GoR's public financial management reform program i s based on the Financial
Accountability Review and Action Plan (FARAP), with the review prepared in close collaboration
between the GoR, DFID and the World Bank, and the subsequent Action Plan supported by the EU.
Pulling together the information in the FARAF', work realized by the IMF and EU, and other existing
analysis on Rwanda's public financial management system, a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) was completed in 2005. It synthesizes the analysis and outlines the action plan
for the public financial management reformprogram going forward.

84.      Government Strategyhzplementation Progress.              The submission to Parliament of the
Organic L a w o f State Finances and Assets (i.e., the Organic Budget Law) and accompanyingFinancial
Instructions,  continuing efforts to adapt the GoR's institutional arrangements to budget
implementation, and the appointment o f an Accountant General are strong indications o f the GoR's
resolve to achieve a modem public financial management system. The Office o f the Auditor General

                                                                                                       34

prepared its 2003 report and submitted it to Parliament, and the GoR i s acting to address issues
identified inprevious reports. The budget preparation process is much more structured than inthe past,
with increased levels o f stakeholder participation, particularly by civil society and development
partners. The GoR intends to continue the revision o f the regulatory framework and to prepare
guidance to facilitate the implementation o f the new legal framework. This will entail the preparation
o f manuals containing specific guidance on implementation o f the provisions o f the new law and
regulations. These are planned for the budget preparation process, public accounting, and internal
audit.

85.      The introduction o f the MTEF represents an important improvement to Rwandan public
financial management. However, although the many central and line ministries have now developed
MTEFs, the absence or inadequacies that exist incertain sectors inregard to the preparationo f sector
plans hinders the realization o f the benefits o f the MTEF and mitigates the enormous strides made in
budget preparation. Strategic Issues Papers (SIPS), which are used to inform the budget process,
should be underpinnedby sectoral MTEFs, but this i s not yet the case inall sectors. As such, the link
between planning/MTEFs and budgeting remains weak. To address these shortcomings, the GoR will
continue its efforts to improve and simplifybudget formats through a revised economic and functional
classification, and a revision o f program and sub-program structures for all ministries and agencies to
bring them more in line with planning. Efforts to reinforce strategic planning and budgeting will be
boosted through the recruitment o f a budget adviser and the piloting, in selected ministries, o f the
proposed simplification and harmonization o f budget classifications and integration with the MTEF
process. This pilot would also address the GoR's intention to deepen outcome-oriented characteristics
in its budget preparation process. Following MINECOFIN's reorganization, the Budget Department
includes a monitoring and reporting division that will work closely with MINECOFIN's poverty
reduction strategy monitoring and evaluation team. This i s intended to improve the monitoring and
reporting o f budget expenditures so as to establish a system o f performance monitoring and integration
o f budget execution data into planning, budget preparation, and policy making.

86.      Responsibilities o f the newly created and appointed Office o f the Accountant General include
oversight o f the current and future functions o f the Treasury, Public Accounts, and Internal Audit
Units.The Accountant General is also expected to provide leadership in the coordination o f reforms
intended to strengthenpublic accounting. To this end, the GoR has adopted Intemational Public Sector
Accounting Standards for financial reporting. The efforts to reinforce the public accounting technical
slulls available to government, and the preparation o f a Public Accounting Manual, are expected to
assist the GoR in its efforts to move toward fully consolidated financial statements, as required by its
law. Inthe short term, to progress toward this goal, the GoR will pilot the consolidation o f government
accounts in selected ministries. Additional line ministries, local government entities, and semi-
autonomous institutions will be incorporatedbased on lessons learned inthe pilot phase.

87.      The GoR has also continued its efforts to clarify the roles o f audit institutions. The Organic
Budget Law defines the principles underlying the role and responsibilities o f the internal audit
function within government. An Audit Unit within MINECOFIN will ensure the coordination and
guidance of this cadre. The Office o f the Accountant General i s continuing to implement its strategy
for reinforcement, with reasonable strides being made in the recruitment and training o f personnel.
The GoR appointed a fully qualified professional accountant as the Auditor General, and will soon
present an Audit Bill, which aims to grant the Office o f the Auditor General more institutional
independence incompliance with the principles laid down inthe Constitution.

88.      The above measures, and the deconcentration o f accounting and internal audit tasks within
central and local governments and clarification o f the role o f institutions o f state control, have
generated a need for skilled accountants and auditors. Though recruitment o f such positions for each
o f the government budget agencies has commenced, there i s a scarcity o f suitably qualified
professionals. In addition, current civil service pay levels are a fraction o f those in the private sector,

                                                                                                         35

thus the GoR is generally not able to compete favorably for the best talent. The GoR is addressing
salary issues through its civil service reform program and, with the aid o f an EU-fundedinternational
consultancy, i s conducting a needs assessment that i s expected to result in the definition o f a training
curriculum and recruitment plan for accountants and intemal auditors, and a strategy to promote
institutions that can deliver appropriate training to public sector accountants. It i s likely that with the
adoption o f the results o f the needs assessment, the GoR will establish a support team o f accounting
professionals and graduate interns to assist central and local government accounting and internal audit
functions. This team will be supervised by the Advisor on Public Accounts, working under the aegis o f
the Accountant General.

89.      The GoR has also established a Treasury Management Committee with responsibility for
determining liquidity management policy and reviewing and agreeing the consolidated income and
expenditure Treasury plans. It has established a Cash Management Unit to focus on collecting,
validating, and analyzing periodic cash flow projections and to facilitate the work o f the Treasury
Management Committee. This will contribute to the production o f realistic annual work plans. The
GoR i s moving toward the creation o f zero balanced drawing accounts for budget users, and
eventually to a Single Treasury Account. To this end, it has closed all redundant bank accounts and
reinforced its rules on the opening and maintenance o fnew ones.

90.      Finally, the Organic BudgetLaw provides for the integration o f the recurrent and development
budgets. Expected benefits include more accurate identification o f the capital investment and recurrent
proportion o f government expenditures and better alignment o f budget spending with policy priorities
between and within sectors. The responsibility for the preparation o f the development budget has been
transferred to the Budget Department to remove administrative impediments to aligning budgets and
strategies. The GoR has decided to proceed with budget integration in a phased manner, starting in
2006, with full integration expected by 2008. As a first step, the GoR i s piloting upgraded, integrated
fiscal management system software (SIBET II),        which will create a database linlung the recurrent and
development budgets, local government entities, and semi-autonomous agencies. It will also enable
linkages to the revenue, public debt, payroll management, and treasury functions. The phased
implementation o f the components o f this system will facilitate the preparation and consolidation o f
governments accounts.

         b. Transparency and Accountability

91.      Current Issues. According to the PRSP, key challenges to good governance in Rwanda
include national reconciliation; political legitimacy with popular political participation; justice and
human rights; and transparency and accountability in public actions. The PRSP states that without an
end to the mentality o f exclusion and impunity, and an acceptance by all social groups that
development i s possible only if all work together toward common goals, good governance would be
out o f the question. Thus, while corruption i s not considered a major problem inRwanda, transparency
o f and accountability for action i s a strategic priority.

92.      Government Strategylmpplementation Progress. Government institutions were strengthened
after the adoption o f the new Constitution and the successful presidential and legislative elections in
2003. Rwanda further strengthened government institutions by formally separating the judiciary from
the executive and legislativebranches, and creating the Supreme Court and Office o fthe Ombudsman.
The GoR drafted a strategic plan to combat corruption and further liberalized the media.
Decentralization, a key priority to reform governance and improve public service delivery, also
continued to progress, with about 95 percent o f local governments having put together a five-year
development     plan,   the    National    Decentralization Steering Committee          and the     National
Decentralization Implementation Secretariat established, and decentralization support units established
in all ministries and provinces, with clear definition of roles and responsibilities at the national,
provincial, local, and grass-roots government levels.

                                                                                                          36

93.       Successful implementation o f the GoR's public sector agenda depends on sound public
financial management, as described above. This will be complemented by a modern Public
Procurement Law, which has also been submitted to Parliament. To complete the procurement code, a
draft law outlining the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for public procurement, including
review, sanction, and complaint mechanisms, will accompany the Public Procurement Law. The latter
would reinforce the role o f the National Tender Board, establishing it as a regulatory body rather than
a procurement execution agency, which will be the responsibility o f local procurement officials. To
ensure that local officials have the necessary capacity, the GoR will formulate a national capacity
buildingaction plan and, subsequently, a trainingprogram. Tools such as standard biddingdocuments
and guidelines will also be developed and issued once the procurement laws are adopted.

94.       Regardingvoice and accountability, the Gacaca l5(community tribunals) process for those that
committed acts duringthe genocide was fully underway over 2004-05. The GoR, with assistance from
the National University o f Rwanda, also drafted and piloted the use o f citizen report cards. The pilot
surveyed citizens on the use o f identity cards and drivers' licenses. During 2005, the GoR carried out
citizen report cards inthe education and health sectors.

       c. Monitoring

95.       Current Issues. The GoR's chapeau report on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) o f its
poverty reduction programs i s the PRSP APR. T o produce this and other assessments o f progress, the
GoR realizes the importance o f an M&E system that i s able to serve the needs o f govemment, donors,
and other stakeholders alike, and MINECOFIN i s taking the lead in designing such a system. This
includes a holistic approach to improving linkages between the PRSP, strategic plans, and the MTEF,
which forms the basis for M&E. The GoR's monitoring instruments include strategic plans, SIPs,
budget prioritization, and formula for local govemment disbursements. A key priority for the GoR i s
to strengthen these instruments to create a logical flow from PRSP goals to strategic plan objectives,
from strategic plan objectives to MTEFs and budget requests in SIPs, and from MTEFs and SIPs to
budgetprioritization, taking into account lessons learned from studies and evaluations.

96.       The five core pillars o f the GoR's PRSP M&E framework are (a) monitoring of priority
programs' performance; (b) monitoring o f poverty/household living conditions (outcomes and impacts
o f the PRSP); (c) promotion o f participatory M&E at all levels; (d) the APR; and (e) aid
harmonization. The information generated from these pillars feeds into policy review and revisions.
For this to work well, MJNECOFIN recognizes the need, in the first instance, for key performance
indicators for all sectors that are linkedto performance assessment and can be monitored at the central
and decentralized levels, with clear feedback mechanisms to policies and budget allocation. Special
emphasis i s placed on the review o f current sector objectives and indicators; capacity building in
districts for planning, budgeting and M&E; indicators as basis for performance assessment; and
linking performance assessment to budget prioritization through incentives. The need for capacity
buildinginplanning, budgeting, and M&Eat decentralized levels is recognized, and capacity building
i s required in line-ministries and districts to support and develop sound management information
systems, and to develop the capacity o f the Rwanda National Institute o f Statistics for macro level
analysis. Given that routine data collection through a management information system i s in an
embryonic stage, surveys (e.g., PETS, citizen report cards, household living standards surveys) have
been used to fill the gap, but the GoR would like to move to a system where surveys supplement
regular reporting, rather than substitute for it.

97.       Government Strategydmplementation Progress. MINECOFIN was reorganized as part o f
the service reform program and the restructured and redefined departments' roles and responsibilities


15 "Justice on the grass"

                                                                                                       37

better reflect the various stages o f the public expenditure cycle (i.e., strategic planning, budget
preparation, budget execution, accounting and monitoring, reporting and audit, and policy review).
While recognizing the gaps inthis cycle, MINECOFINi s now better organized to address them, and to
incorporate M&E so that it eventually results in better policies for growth and poverty reduction,
which is the GoR's ultimate goal. The team that i s largely responsible for monitoring PRSP
implementation i s the poverty reduction strategy M&E team in MINECOFIN, which replaces the
Poverty Obsewatoire and i s located within the Strategic Planning and Poverty Monitoring Unit
(SPPMU). The SPPMU's work i s complemented by the new Budget Monitoring and Reporting Team
located in the Budget Department, who are working to clarify and strengthen budget monitoring so
that it better feeds into the PRSP and sector planningkhe MTEFprocess.

98.       Building on the experience with the 2005 APR, line ministries at the national level are
working to select and refine key perfonnance indicators. Monitoring indicators are also being
developed at the decentralized level, and the two will need to be reconciled to ensure that local
priorities are being addressed. MINECOFIN i s also implementinga monitoring reporting system
(SmartGov). The plan i s to develop a system capable o f producing reports that provide financial data
on inputs and outputs, with data feeding into a simple spreadsheet that will also be populatedwith the
relevant objectives, indicators, and targets. Data collection at the decentralized level will feed into
spreadsheets at the district level, and national and district level spreadsheets will be linkedmaking it
possible to aggregate upward or downward. Drawing on Rwanda's strong reporting culture, the
Ubedehe system o f data collection, which utilizes community leaders to collect data, i s being
considered as an effective method to enhance data collection at the local level. Reporting requirements
among different ministries and government agencies will needto be harmonized.

99.       With Bank support, the M&E team in MINECOFIN has articulated a framework for a
comprehensive M&E system that will satisfy GoR and donor reporting requirements; assist in the
finalization o f key performance indicators, ensuring consistency between the central and decentralized
levels; design the SmatrtGov reports; and set up the decentralized database. The framework stresses
the importance o f embedding the system in the PRSP process, and notes that significant technical
assistance from donors will be needed to implement it. Discussions are ongoing between the GoR and
donor partners on this, and PRSG I1support will be usedto helpthe GoR reach its objectives.

                                                  VI. Implementation

A. Environmentaland Social Aspects

100.      Environmental and Social Analysis. This operation i s governed by Operational Policy (OP)
8.60, Development Policy Lending, and therefore i s not subject to OP 4.01, Environmental
Assessment. However, PRSC Iwas governed by Operational Directive 8.60, Adjustment Lending
Policy, deemed a sector adjustment operation, subject to OP 4.01, and classified category B for
purposes o f environmental assessment. As such, extensive Environmental Assessment and Social
Analysis was undertaken during the preparation o f PRSC Ito identify possible positive and negative
linkages between PRSC support and environmental and social impacts, including examining the
Bank's safeguards definition o f social impacts in regard to involuntary resettlement, indigenous
peoples, and cultural property.I6 It also took into account the widespread environmental and social


l6Note that in context of Rwanda's history, particularly inthe aftermath ofthe 1994 genocide, the term `indigenous peoples'
  i s extremely ambiguous as it implies that some ethnic groups were establishedin Rwanda before others. The basis of this
  assumption was widely used to justify the genocide i s therefore extremely sensitive. The GoR's current policy, as part of
  the national unity and reconciliation process, is based on equal rights for all without distinguishing between ethnic or
  regional affiliations in the country. The new Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law and shall enjoy,
  without any discrimination, equal protection of the law. Inthat context, the GoR has made it clear to donors that it will not
  accept funding that will directly or indirectly encourage Rwandans to identify themselves along ethnic lines.


                                                                                                                            38

analysis undertaken for other Bank operations. While PRSC support i s not expected to have any direct
negative environmental or social impacts, the analysis focused on the environmental and social issues
facing Rwanda and the capacity of national and local public sector agencies' roles and responsibilities
to manage them.

101.     PRSG I1continues to draw on the Environmental Assessment and Social Analysis undertaken
for PRSC Ito help the GoR establish the regulatory, administrative, and technical capacity to identify,
mitigate, and monitor environmental and social issues in a sustainable manner. PRSG I1 would
continue to support the GoR's capacity building o f its Rwanda Environment Management Authority
(REMA), which was newly established under PRSC I,to implement the new Environment Law and
complete guidelines on environmental impact assessments. Budget has been allocated for REMA's
management in 2005 and 2006. Any potential environmental and social impacts associated with sector
specific investment operations in complement to PRSG I1 support (e.g., in water, energy, and
transport) will be addressed in the context of ongoing and planned environmental and social analysis
undertaken as part o f preparation for those operations. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis has been
undertaken inthe tea sector and on the use of fertilizer, both o f which are relevant to reducingpoverty
in rural areas. Also, in 2004, the President fulfilled his promise to appoint a representative of the
Batwa to the Senate.

102.     Gender. Traditionally, women in Rwanda focused on agricultural activities at home, while
men dominated the public sphere. However, the genocide affected a shift in attitudes toward gender
roles since women constituted approximately 70 percent o f the population after the genocide. They
were seen as critical to reconciliation, unity, and the governing o f the country, since women
perpetrators o f the genocide were limited. The 2003 Constitution establishes that 30 percent o f posts in
decision-making organizations be filled by women and that 30 percent o f the seats in each house o f
Parliament be occupied by women. Followingthe 2003 election, women account for 49 percent o f the
seats inParliament, the highest level o f female parliamentary representation inthe world. The National
Women's Council, also enshrined inthe Constitution and working under the leadership o f the Ministry
of Gender and Family Promotion, was originally created in 1996 to engender change in girls'
education, reproductive health, poverty reduction, and civic and legal issues. Women identify policy
and budget priorities at the local level and voice them up through the channels o f government. The
planning officer responsible for gender i s mandated to ensure that all budget development at the
central level integrates certain "cross-cutting'' issues, including gender. For example, the Women's
Council lobbied for the elimination o f primary school fees and the establishment o f particular fiscal
priorities within the central government budget. This has led to a narrowing o f the disparity inprimary
school enrollment across gender, locality, and income. As described inthe PRSC Iprogram document,
the GoR also launched a Gender Budget Initiative, adopted a National Gender Plan o f Action (2000-
2005), and has a Comprehensive Legal Action Plan for the elimination o f gender disparities.

B. Administrationof Operation


103.     An assessment intended to provide reasonable assurance that the Banque Nationale du
Rwanda's (BNR) control, accounting, reporting and auditing systems are adequate to ensure the
integrity o f operations was carried out in early 2003. It noted encouraging efforts of the BNR to
rebuild and strengthen its safeguards and controls. It identified some weaknesses relating to the
external audit mechanism and the then newly established internal audit department. Since then, many
o f these weaknesses have been addressed in a plan o f actions most o f which were to be implemented
in2003, with additional staff hired for the internal audit department, and extemal audits beingcarried
out on an annual basis by an international firm o f auditors appointed by the Board o f Directors.

104.     A single-tranche grant of SDR37.6 million (US$55 million equivalent) would be made
available upon effectiveness, which i s expected inNovember 2005. The proposed grant will follow the

                                                                                                        39

Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy operations. Grant proceeds will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and not tied to any specific
purchases or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the grant i s approved by the Board and
becomes effective, the proceeds o f the grant will be disbursedin compliance with the stipulated single
tranche release conditions. Once the Bank`s Board approves the grant and at the request o f the
Recipient, IDA will disburse the proceeds o f the grant into an account designatedby the Recipientthat
forms a part o f the country foreign exchange reserves account at the Banque Nationale du Rwanda.
The Recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the grant into said account, an equivalent amount i s
credited in the Recipient's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to IDA. The Recipient
will report to IDA on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local
currency to the budget management system. If the proceeds o f grant are used for ineligible purposes
(i.e. to finance goods or services on the standard negative list), as defined in the Development Grant
Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount
equal to the amount o f said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be
cancelled. The administration o f this grant will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Finance and
Economic Planning.

C. Monitoring and Evaluation

105.      MINECOFIN i s responsible for implementing the proposed PRSG and for coordinating the
completion o f actions. As discussed above, MINEC0FI"s                 poverty reduction M&E team i s
responsible for overall monitoring o f the GoR's poverty reduction programs and the Bank will
continue to work closely with it on the implementation o f its M&E system. Along with this team,
MINEC0FI"s       would rely on its poverty reduction strategy M&E team, workmg closely with the
Budget Monitoring and Reporting Team i s responsible for ensuring that component sector spending
plans developed with PRSG support are incorporated into the national MTEF and subsequent budget
and, as such, will play a major role in helping the Bank to track progress on PRSPPRSG
implementation. Annex 7 contains a list o f monitoring indicators for Rwanda's PRSP, which will also
be the basis for monitoring and evaluating progress on implementation o f the PRSG.

D. Risks andRiskMitigation

106.      The Bank recognizes that risks in Rwanda remain high. However, the GoR continues to
demonstrate its dedication and strong commitment to pursing the goals outlined inits PRSP. The Bank
i s equally committed to working with the GoR to support its development efforts. Rwanda's stability,
through successful development, i s critical to the stability o f the Great Lakes region. The main risks to
achievement o f PRSP goals and the PRSC program are outlined below.

107.      Country/RegionalRisk. Rwanda's history and location inthe unstable central African region
pose a potential threat to the GoR in achieving its development objectives. However, Rwanda's
internal security and political situation have been stable in follow-up to the 2003 elections. Though
tensions inthe Great Lakes region increased inNovember 2004 when President Kagame indicated that
he would consider sending troops to disarm paramilitary groups based inside the Democratic Republic
o f Congo (DRC), the deployment o f troops was never confirmed and tensions have eased with a joint
verification mechanism between Rwanda and the DRC to resolve border disputes. Moreover, the
African Union has agreed in principle to send troops to the DRC to disarm paramilitary groups. In
addition, following a March 2005 agreement between the GoR and the last rebel group (operating out
o f the DRC), up to 15,000 former rebels are expected to return to Rwanda with their dependents
(possibly up to 25,000 people). The GoR has moved with strong determination to put in place the
financing needed to support the reinsertion and reintegrationprocess, however the eventual success o f
reintegration will depend on accelerating economic growth, equipping former combatants with skills,
and creating job opportunities across the country. In general, and through the country-specific
operation under the Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Program, the Bank supports

                                                                                                        40

international and regional efforts aimed at fostering peace within and between Rwanda and its
neighbors.

108.    Program Risk. Risks to the Bank's program in Rwanda continue to revolve around
predictability o f donor funding, the GoR's ability to mobilize grant financing, and debt sustainability
(under IDA 14, the GoR i s eligible for grant financing). The exiting Partnership Framework between
the GoR and donor partners, particularly donor partners providing budget support, specifically aims to
address the issue o fpredictability, and donors are fully cognizant o f past failures inthis area, aiming to
redesign their programs to disburse during the first quarter o f Rwanda's fiscal year. This frontloading
should go a long way to increasing the predictability o f funding and, as such, the GoR's ability to plan
and implement its budget in a more sustainable manner. Over the long-term, the GoR's goal o f
reducing dependency on foreign aid will depend on its success inimplementingits growth strategy.

109.     Operation Risk. The main risks to successful implementation o f the proposed operation
include weak capacity and the need to continue strengthening aspects o f the fiduciary framework. The
GoR i s committed to addressing these issues, as evidenced by the implementation o f its ambitious
public financial management reform program. The comprehensive analysis and roadmap provide a
clear path for areas to be strengthened going forward, and the laws regarding public procurement will
establish a modem procurement code. Regarding capacity building, the Bank and other donors are
cognizant o f the need for a harmonized approach and are working closely together with the GoR to
move from ad-hoc provision o f technical assistance to a more sustainable, integrated approach,
coordinated with HIDA, that will better meet the GoR's needs.

                                       April 11,2005


        Executive Directors commended the Rwandese authorities for strengthening the
implementation of policies in 2004 and keeping their economic program broadly on track,
despite exogenous shocks such as an electricity crisis and rising fuel prices. They welcomed,
in particular, the authorities' use of expenditure restraint in response to a temporary aid
shortfall in2004. As a result, macroeconomic stability has largely been achieved.

        Directors emphasized that the key medium-termchallenge will beto strengthen
growth while preserving macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, in order to reduce
poverty and advance toward the Millennium Development Goals. They recognized that
meeting this challenge will be complicated by Rwanda's low savings rate and very high
extemal debt burden. It will require a steadfast commitment to reform, with emphasis on
productivity-enhancing strategies, especially in agriculture and exports; managing large donor
inflows so as to preserve export competitiveness; and strengtheningthe economy's capacity to
cope with shocks, including through the mobilization o f domestic revenue and maintenance o f
adequate international reserves.

        Directors welcomed the reallocationo fresources to priority needs inline with the
PRSP, as envisaged inthe 2005 budget.They agreed that additional spending o f about
2 percent o f GDP could be allowed, provided that it is financed by extemal budgetary support
and that the monetary program i s kept on track. They considered that the contingent nature o f
this spendingwill help ensure that fiscal policies are consistent with the authorities' inflation
objective. Looking beyond 2006, Directors encouraged the authorities to further reduce
nonessential spending, and to avoid directed lending.

        Directors commended the recent progress inreforming the fiscal framework, including
the passage o f the organic budget law, the overhaul o f the tax system, and the improvements
to tax administration. They encouraged further progress in these and in other areas. In
particular, they noted that continued capacity building in line ministries and local
governments, especially inpublic expenditure management and accountability, will be crucial
for successful implementation o f the organic budget law and the poverty reduction strategy.
Directors stressed the importance o f intensifying efforts to mobilize domestic revenue, and
urged the authorities to develop new revenue measures for the 2006 budget, including by
limitingtax exemptions.

                                                                                               60

        Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to lower inflation while allowing an
expansion o f credit to the private sector. They underscored that some nominal appreciation o f
the exchange rate may become necessary in managing the domestic impact o f large aid
inflows. In this regard, they urged the authorities to step up sales o f foreign exchange as
needed to keep reserve money growth on track, rather than relying entirely on the issuance o f
costly treasury bills, while ensuring that a prudent level o f international reserves i s
maintained. Directors observed that interest rates should not be lowered before a clear
downward trend ininflation i s established.

        Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to limit external borrowing and
accelerate their export promotion efforts in order to maintain debt sustainability. They urged
the authorities to move forcefully to implement the export promotion strategy, stimulate
agricultural production, address structural bottlenecks to trade and growth, and strengthen the
environment for private investmentby improving governance and the rule o f law. This would
enhance the competitiveness o f the export sector even if the real exchange rate were to
appreciate. Directors supported the authorities' intention to seek extemal financing mostly or
entirely inthe form o f grants.

        Directors welcomed the authorities' efforts to strengthen the financial sector. They
urged continued timely implementation o f the recommendations of the ongoing Financial
Sector Assessment Program, with particular emphasis on enhancing financial sector
supervision.

        Directors welcomed the completion o f the second annual progress report o f the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper through a broad-based consultativeprocess. They
commended the considerable advances made in the health and education sectors. However,
they recommended development of an overarching macroeconomic framework-with              greater
emphasis on private sector-led development, particularly in agriculture and exports-and
increased orientation o fpublic service delivery toward poverty reduction.

        Directors agreed that Rwandahas met the conditions for reaching the completion
point under the enhanced Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. They concurred
that sufficient assurances have been given by Rwanda's other creditors to justify Fund
commitment o f enhanced HIPC hitiative resources to Rwanda. A t the same time, Directors
encouraged the authorities to push ahead with efforts to secure the participation of non-Paris
Club creditors inthe HIPC Initiative for Rwanda.

        Directors expressed concern that based on the updated debt sustainability analysis
(DSA), Rwanda's debt will remain above the HIPC threshold for debt sustainability for a
prolonged period, even after HIPC debt relief and additional bilateral assistance. Most
Directors agreed that the deteriorationindebt sustainability since the decision point i s
attributable primarily to exogenous factors-namely,    changes in export prices, cross-currency
exchange rates, lower-than-expected concessionality of new financing, and the decline in
discount rates-that   have fundamentally changed Rwanda's economic circumstances. A few
Directors questioned whether the decline in the discount rate contributed to a fundamental
change in Rwanda's economic circumstances. Moreover, most Directors noted that the
increase in import prices compared with the decision point projections i s expected to have a
lasting negative impact on Rwanda's terms-of trade and, consequently, on its capacity to

                                                                                             61

repay its debt. On the basis, Directors agreed that additional HIPC Initiatives assistance
should be granted to Rwanda, over and above that committed at the decision point, in order to
bring the ratio of the net present value o f the debt to exports down to the HIPC Initiative
threshold o f 150 percent.

        Directors noted that Rwanda's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and
expenditure tracking system provide assurances that enhanced HIPC Initiative and other
resources will be used toward poverty reduction. Directors also observed that, even with
topping-up assistance, Rwanda's debt burden will remain heavy. They therefore urged the
authorities to give priority to the improvement o f debt management and to pursue a cautious
borrowing policy, and called on the donor community to provide support mostly in the form
o f grants.

        On August 26, 2005, the Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
completed the fifth review o f Rwanda's economic performance under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, on a lapse of time basis. Rwanda's PRGF
arrangement was approved on August 12, 2002 (see Press Release No. 02/36), for SDR 4
million (about US$5.9 million).

                       Annex 8: Rwanda Harmonizationand Alignment


Rwanda does not have a long history of receiving long-term development assistance. Most
assistance until 1997 was humanitarian aid. The country's major donors during the `90s were
Germany, UK, US, The Netherlands, Belgium, EU, The World Bank, The IMF, and The
AfDB.
The donor response to the crisis was hardly coordinated and aid delivery was delayed.
Despite the lack o f coordinated political, military, or humanitarian strategy or framework, the
donor community allocated substantial resources for rehabilitation. Nevertheless, even during
the period immediately following the '94 crisis considerable delays in the delivery o f donor
assistance were observed. In the aftermath o f the Genocide Rwanda's development partners
were neither equipped nor coordinated enough to properly respond to the country's post-crisis
needs. The usual commitment-disbursementgap remained.
The country's aid coordination weaknesses on both government's and donors' side are the
main challenge to harmonization.          The Government still lacks the required capacity to
effectively manage development assistance and lead the donor coordination process. Before the
Genocide and during the post-genocide emergency period The World Bank and UNDP
coordinated assistance through a Donor Round Table mechanism, co-chaired by the
Government o f Rwanda and UNDP. Inthe aftermath o f the genocide due to the lack o f a fully
staffed World Bank country office, as well as factors such as UNDP's lesser comparative
advantage in the area o f macroeconomic management, a defacto division o f labor emerged
between the two agencies, with the World Bank coordinating donors for macroeconomic and
debt-related matters.
MINECOFIN and the UN Resident Coordinator eo-chair monthly Development Partners
Coordination Group (DPCG) meetings. It is the largest donor coordination body. It has been
effective primarily on information sharing and general contacts with Government, and
increasingly on issues relatedto NEPAD and global issues relevant to Rwanda.
Government officials within MINECOFIN as well as in line ministries have repeatedly voiced
their dissatisfaction indealingwith donors' procedures and requirements and identified a range
o f difficulties that only exhaust their already limited capacity to manage development
assistance.
Rwanda is one of three early budget support harmonization pilots initiated by the SPA in
2002. Rwanda's harmonization process was launched, shortly after the country completed
its PRSP. The initiative resulted in a Partnership Framework on Harmonization and
Alignmentbetweenthe Government and its budget support donors formalized through an M o U
inNovember 2003. Broadly stated the framework declares that donors agree to harmonize and
align their practices in regard to: (a) process and timing with the Government's annual Poverty
Reduction Strategy cycle; (b) criteria for evaluating macroeconomic performance; and (c)
requirements for public financial management and governmental fiduciary arrangements.
The budget support harmonization process led to the government's requests to expand
harmonization efforts beyond budget support, as approximately 50 percent o f assistance is
being provided though projects, using parallel deliver mechanisms and donor procedures, and
representing highaid management transaction costs for the government.
The request was expressed in October 2003, shortly before the identification o f the Bank's first
PRSC, inthe hope that the multi-sector feature and required underpinningso f the PRSC would
serve as vehicle for promotingharmonization at sector and project levels. As a result the PRSC



                                                                                              69

preparation process, was not only prepared in compliance with the budget support partnership
agreement, but mobilizedresources to create the momentum for broader harmonization agenda.
The Bank's PRSCl was the first budget support operation prepared after the signing o f the
budget support harmonization and alignment MOU. The programmatic multi-sector feature o f
the PRSC preparationprocess and its required underpinnings provided a unique opportunity for
Government and donors to jump-start the broader harmonizationprocess.
To allow closer engagement o f non-budget support donors in the PRSC preparation process,
particularly in the development o f sector strategies, but also other analytic underpinnings o f
PRSP implementation, the Government and the World Bank invited all donors to participate in
the preparation o f the operation.    Donors and government worked in partnership on the
development o f sector strategies and MTEFs, which are expected to lead to SWAps with
harmonized features.
The PRSC generated momentum led to a government-proposed menu of actions to initiate
donor dialogue on a more comprehensive harmonization framework, and to a calendar for
aligning future donor reviews and support with the Government's PRSP and Budgetcycles.
These products provided further impetusto the harmonizationprocess translating into dialogue
and peer pressure, and new harmonization initiatives such as:
    The creation of a government-donor non-budget support harmonization body -The
    Harmonization and Alignment in Rwanda for Projects and Programs (HARPP), and its
    secretariat hostedby UNDP.
    DFID and the World Bank have initiated dialogue on working towards a joint/
    coordinated country assistance strategy.         There remains a proliferation o f donors'
    assistance strategies each o f which requires design, negotiation, implementation, and
    evaluation missions which tax administrative capacity o f the Government.
    Donors are increasingly aware of the benefits of joint analytic work The Financial
    Accountability Review and Action Plan (FARAP) carried out jointly by the Government,
    DFIDand EUwas initiated as part ofthe Public ExpenditureManagement Review (PEMR)
    process supported by DFID, EU, World Bank, and other donors. Wliile a full CFAA i s one
    o f the required underpinnings o f the World Bank PRSCs, the World Bank decided to rely
    on the FARAP and its action plan supplemented by other available diagnostic work.
    Shared Analytic Work. While recognizing the benefits o f joint analytic and diagnostic
    work, donors also recognize that relying on one donor i s sometimes a more efficient for all
    interested parties, provided there i s sufficient donor consultation throughout the process.
    This is the case for the 2004 CPAR, where donors instead of mobilizing resources to carry
    out a joint CPAR, preferred to rely on the World Bank's comparative advantage in this
    area, on donor consultations duringthe assessmentprocess, and on sharing o f final results.
    Delegated cooperation between DFID and SIDA in the education sector, with SIDA as
    silent partner, served as good practice example, and new delegated cooperation initiatives
    are being considered among bilateral donors, e.g. The Netherlands and DFID, with The
    Netherlands as silent partner.
    Joint reviews are now commonpractice in the education and health sectors, where donor
    coordination is strong. Joint reviews have been facilitated by the Harmonization and
    Alignment Calendar finalized and adhered to duringPRSC1preparation.
    Government and donors are making progress in harmonizing capacity building
    initiatives.  The Government developed the Multi-Sector Capacity Building Program
    (MSCBP), a national program on capacity building in public, private and civil society


                                                                                             70

 sectors. The program outlines a common framework and identifies capacity building needs
 with the aim o f pooling donor resources. To further facilitate harmonization of capacity
 building assistance, the Government has decided to establish an autonomous body, the
 Human Resource and Institutional Development Agency (HIDA) to coordinate, harmonize,
 monitor and evaluate all capacity building efforts in the country under the MSCBP.
 Separately, DFID i s leading a review of donor-supported capacity building activities with
 MINECOFIN to propose a harmonized approach at Ministry level. The Education Sector

.Donors Group i s considering pooled funding o f capacity building activities as the next step
 towards an education SWAP with harmonized features.
 Donors are looking into ways of reducing transaction costs associated with their
 procurement practices. For example, the World Bank financed Multi-sector HIV/AIDS
 project (MAP) and the Global Aids Fund are using the same project implementation unit
 and MAP now has harmonized its anti-retroviral procurement procedures with those o f the
 National Tender Board and the Global Fundunit.
 SWAPS with harmonizedfeatures are emerging in the education, health and agriculture
 sectors. Rwanda's education sector SWAP is the most advanced and its donor group is
 Zed by DflD. The Government has voiced its preference for donors to move towards a
 common aid delivery approaches at sector level, relying to the extent possible o n
 Govemment processes and systems, i.e., gradually shifting away from fragmented project
 approach through the use of common systems for negotiating, planning, implementing, and
 monitoring, arguing that this transition would reduce aid transaction costs for both
 Govemment and donors, and facilitate the transition towards budget support.
