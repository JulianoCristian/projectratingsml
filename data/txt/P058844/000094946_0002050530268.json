Negative\n            environmental impacts will be mitigated as follows: to\n            control traffic noise, entrances to facilities will be built\n            to avoid facing roads and fences alongside the road will be\n            raised. Borrow pits filled with solid wastes will be located\n            in wastelands or abandoned land whenever possible. Land will\n            be cleared and recovered as soon as construction is\n            completed. Temporary drains will prevent any surface runoff.\n            Central lime soil mixing plants will be distanced from\n            residential areas, earth roads will be watered, hauling\n            trucks will be covered, and plant operators will wear\n            protective gauze masks and goggles to reduce the impact of\n            dust. Equipment delivering asphalt will be sealed and worker\n            exposure to this substance will be reduced. Operators will\n            be equipped with earplugs and construction activity will be\n            regulated to reduce noise. Sewage will be treated before\n            discharge, seepage controls employed, and refuse removed\n            regularly. Cultural relics will be protected if unearthed.\n            Exhaust gas will be monitored periodically. Slope protection\n            works will be provided with grass planted to prevent\n            instability and soil erosion."}, "docdt": "1999-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
