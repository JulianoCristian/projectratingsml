I. General
In order to matching the construction of Zhumadian-Xinyang Expressway and based
on the requirement of the World Bank, a Rural Roads Improvement Plan was drawn
up in May 1999. The rural roads within the area where the Zhumadian-Xinyang
Expressway will get through are carefully screened during the preparing of the plan.
According to this plan, the work shall be focus on the rural roads improving project
and highway network project of badly need improved in Zhumadian Prefecture and
Xinyang City. The selection of the projects to be improved have taken the provincial's
"9"' five-year-plan for highway network development" into consideration. The
implementation of such projects shall greatly advance the regional economical
development and the traffic capacity on the existed highway network, and shall
quicken the space for construction of rural roads. Nine systems with total length of
392km shall be included in this plan, which the estimated cost shall be 224.10 million
Yuan (RMB). Seven impoverished counties 'in Zhumadian and Xinyang
Prefecture/City shall be involved in this improvement project. In the said counties, the
impoverished people are relatively concentrated, the highway traffic is far below, and
the productive and living condition for the local people are very bad.
In this plan, there are 7 highway networks and 9 sections of rural roads included, the
details are shown in the addendum.
It is anticipated that the completion of the improvement projects shall significantly
enhance the traffic capacity in the highway networks, relax traffic congestion, save
runaround expenses of the vehicles and promote the economical development of the
areas affected. Therefore, the natural resources in the poor areas shall be utilized
thoroughly, and the better productive and living conditions shall be created to the
local people. The local govermnents and the local people are looking forward to the
implementation of those projects.
Generally, there is'no land requisition needed for rural road projects.
All of the rural road projects in Henan Province belong to improvement of the old
roads. Since each year, the county/township goverrunents shall arrange the civilian
laborers working on public projects, the subgrade'of all the existed rural roads are
already formed. In order to carry out the principle and requirements for_land_
requisition and resettlement made by the World Bank, and to carry out -the,  -:
requirements -of protecting cultivated land 'anrd'environment given in Lanid
Management Law,; we made this'plari for improvement of the rural roads. According
to the functions and characteristic of the rural roads, the rural roads are built to meet
the requirement of agricultural vehicles' and the trip of local people. The requifed 16ad
and traffic volume are not heavy, the required travelling speed is slow, the technical
standard required is relatively low, no alignment design are requested compulsorily.
Therefore, the rural road improvement projects in the third package of Henan



Province shall be conducted in such way that to laid asphalt concrete course on the
existed roads, no land requisition and resettlement shall be involved.
If there is requirements for land requisition and removal, the resettlement shall be
made according to the principle below:
