3.6 Ecological environment
The road project area is mainly plain and light hilly with a little of mountains,
where there are small animals of rats, hairs, frogs and ordinary birds and dominated by
domestic animal and fowl. There is no endangered and protected animal.
There are small tract wood land of poplar and locust tree along the road project
area with great amount of planted tress sporadically distributed around the area. There
are a few natural forest in the hilly and mountain area with most being secondary forest
or man made wood land. The forest cover rate in the Zhumadian area is 19.51% and that
in the Xinyang area is 19.6%.
The highway project is located in the transition area from the subtropical zone to
the north temperate zone. The main type of soils include yellow soil, brown soil. paddy
soil, wet soil and sajong soil. To get the background Pb content in the soil, two
monitoring spots were established, one at Xingzhuang of Zhumadian area. and one at
Yangjiagang of Xinyang area. The monitored results is  that the Pb content in the soil
is far less than the standard limits of 250mg/I and 300mg/l, which shows that along the
road area there is no soil contamination by lead.
The area along the road is alluvial flood plain of the Huaihe river. According to the
classification for the Zhumdian area, the road area belongs to the area with 'no
conspicuous erosion". The same is for the Xinyang area, and the mountain area in the
southern of the Huaihe river belongs to the area with "slight erosion". Table 3.3-10
shows the soil erosion conditions by the road sections.
3.7 Current status of water environment
The water quality momitoring results show that the water quality of Shahe river is up
to the Class V standard; and that the Zhentouhe river and the Huaihe river. both of
which are up to the Class IV standard, Yanghe river is up to the Class III standard.
6



3.8 Current status of acoustic environment
According to the measured results at 7 monitor spots along the proposed project area.
the noise levels in the daytime and night were all below the State standard level. except
for that at individual spot. which shows the good condition of acoustic enviroment.
3.9 Current status of the ambient air quality
The CO and NOx concentrations are low o ver the proposed road area vwith great
environmental capacity. There are exceeding of TSP concentration over the standard
limit in the ambient air. owing to the consecutive 150 dry days and the clay pavement.
According to the long term monitoring record. the TSP concentration in the proposed
road area is not high and the ambient air quality in the area is good.
4. Expected Environmental Impact
4.1 Societal and economic impact assessment
(1) The impact on demographic structure of labour force
Highway development will have certain impact on the demographic structure of
labour force in the area directly affected by the proposed road project. The road project
will promote development of local tourism industry and tertiary industry and there wvill
be more floating population in the area.
(2) The impact on the local economy
The proposed road project will greatlv ease the traffic load on the existing national
trunk road No. 107 and will promote the local areas economic development. The
proposed road project will promote the areas' economic development along the whole
route. as vell as the provincial economic development.
The economic development will help more investment in the public utility facilities.
energy, telecommunications. education, public health, cultural and entertainment. and
etc.. contributing to the well-being of the people.
(3) Partition impact caused by the expressway
Since the proposed road project is an expressway which will have full access
control and vill have partition impact for the local community. To minimize the impact.
1 56 underpasses. 4 overpassages have been included in the engineering design. with one
passage every 590m for convenience for the local residents.
(4) The impact on the cultural relics. scenic spots and historic sites
The Zhumadian area and Xinyang area have a long history with rich tourism
resources and natural scenic spots, which are within the proposed road project area and
'ill benefit from the road project. Since these cultural relics and historic sites are far
away from the road. no damage will caused by the road project.
7



(5) Safety
The safety, impact in the construction period maly be in connection with the
construction workers and the ordinary people. For the construction workers, the main
unsafe factor is the bridge construction. During the bidding process of the project. strict
examination should be made of the eligibility, of the bidder for the bridge project and the
road section with great amount of cutting work. Safety operation and construction
measures should be included in the contract to ensure safety work for the construction
workers.
The newl built Zhumadian-Xinyang expressway by passing the urban and
towAnship resident area will reduce the traffic accident due to the better road conditions.
so that economic loss caused b) the traffic accident will be reduced. According to the
forecast of the risk of the hazardous goods road transport accident, the probability of the
road accident involved with chemical materials (including oil, chemical fertillizers and
agricultural chemicals) over the road section in water area in the year of 2003 will be
0.69 per year and for the whole road section it is 2.3 19 per year, which is small.
(6) The impact on the mineral area
There are large coal mine (Wuguiqiao) and non-metal mine (Shangtianti) along the
road project area. The propose expressway will pass by along the west side of the
mineral area with little impact on the mining area.
(7) Land acquisition and resettlement
The total length of the expressway will be 95.15km and the width of the right-of-
wav is 32-70m. including the permanent land occupation of toll plaza. service and rest
areas. interchange area, and the buildings for road maintenance. The total land
acquisition is 8.054 mu . In addition to the permanent land occupation. there are
temporary land of 1.384mu to be used in the construction period for earth borrowing,
road construction machinery maintenance, parking and etc.. The population affected by
the land acquisition is about 4,829 persons, of which 396 persons in Runan county.
2.,015 persons in Queshan county. 2,418 persons in Xinyang county.
The total resettlement compensation cost will be CNY 176.881 million, of wlhich
CNY25.659 million are resettlement cost. CNY129.766 are for land acquisition
(borrowing), CNY8.593 million are for cultivated land occupation. CNY4.662 million
are for management of the resettlement, CNY8.201 million are unforeseen cost.
4.2 Ecological environmental impact
(1) The impact on agricultural production
The permanent occupation of farm land is 7,461 mu for the proposed road project.
Given the average annual output per mu land is 400kg of grain, the total loss of grain
8



per year will be 2.984,400 kg. about CNY4. 178.200 (CNY1 .4/kg), accountinC for
0. 14% of the total output. However, the total farm land occupation only accounts for
0.23% of the total farm land in the three counties. therefore the impact on the
agricultural production caused by the farm land occupation is small. But for some of the
villages and farmers. the farm land loss will have conspicuous impact. which can be
settled by proper arrangement .
In addition to the above mentioned permanent land occupation, there are 1.384mu
land to be temporarily occupied during the road construction period. After completion
of the road project, these lands will be turned back to the land owner used for
agricultural production or for aquatic breeding or fruit plantation.
The impact on the existing irrigation system has been taken into account in the
road engineering design, with a total of 68 culverts having been designed, to keep the
layout and capacity of existing irrigation system basically unchanged.
(2) Analysis of the impact on animals and plants
During the road construction period, there will be damages to the cover plants and
spoil the habitat of the wild life in the cutting and filling areas. Most road sections in the
plain area beyond north of the Huaihe river are built on filled-up ground with filling
height of 4.0m. The filling materials are to be taken from the land area on both sides of
the road, which have been included in the temporary land occupation. The cover plants
on these area will also be damaged in the construction period. But can be recovered after
the construction work is completed.
(3) Forecast of soil erosion impact
The soil erosion in the road construction period will be 6,08 times as much as that
before the construction. For ordinary road after it has been in operation period for 3 -5
years. the severity soil erosion conditions would be back to the previous level before thie
construction period.
(4) Preliminary forecast of the earth borrowing and the spoils or wastes and the
borrowing and spoil disposal sites
According to the engineering feasibility study report, the earth borrowinl and
spoils or wastes and the borrowing and spoils disposal sites have been selected
preliminarilynt. Totle of the earth borrowing site are 15,and totle of the spoils disposal
sites are 6.
(5) Road sections with poor geological conditions
The road sections with poor geological conditions are mainly located in the areas
with rivers and lakes, which need to be treated wvith special measures with a total lengtth
of 27,200m.

4.3 The impact on surface *water environment
(I) Impact in the construction period
Great amount of silts and wastes will be produced during the bridge construction
period. which will cause water pollution (increase of SS and DS). if these wastes are
discharged directly into the river.The leakage of oil and lubricant from the construction
machine directly into the water body will also cause pollution.
Given the average number of the workers working on the construction site is 160.
the daily produced sewage would be 12.8 ton, with 6.4kg CODcr , 2.82k-g BOD, and
2.82kg SS, i.e. 4.672 ton sewage, 2.336 ton CODcr, 1.03 ton BOD, and 1.03 ton SS per
year. If the sewage are discharged directlyr into the water body without any treatment,
there will have great impact of pollution.
(2) The impact in the operation period
Puhuisi Service area will be set for the road section at k29+300, including parkin-
area. fueling station. cafe, toilet, motel and vehicle maintenance workshop.
The untreated sewage from the service area have the major pollutants
concentrations as follows: BOD5 11 0-400mg/L, CODcr 250(- 1,OOOmg/L. SS I 00-
350mg/L and TOC 80-290mg/L; those in the waste water from vehicle washing: pH
6.5 -8.5. CODcr 25 -200mg/L. oil 10-~30mg/L, SS 500-4,000mg/L.
(3) Possible impact caused by dangerous goods traffic
The accident probability for the road sections over the rivers is small. which is
0.208/year for the year of 2010, 0.314/'year for the year of 2020: of which for the Huaihe
river section, it is 0.037/year for the vear of 2010. and 0.057/year for the vear of 2020:
and for the Yanghe river section, it is 0.013/year and 0.01 8/year respectively.
4.4 The impact on ambient air quality
(I) The CO and NOx concentrations are relatively low along the proposed road
area with certain environmental capacity. Since the road area is in the north with dry
weather, the TSP concentration tends to be high, exceeding the standard limit. On the
whole the ambient air quality is good.
(2) In the operation period by the y ear of 2020. the CO concentration in the areas
on both sides of the road will not exceed the Class II standard limit: and the NOx
concentration will also be up to the Class II standard in terms of daily average. for
individual spot, the peak hour concentration will have some exceeding over the standard
limit. On the whole, the impact caused by the proposed road project on the ambient air
quality is small.
(3) The dusts and the bitumen smoke arising from the road construction work site
will have conspicuous impact on the ambient air quality, and it is necessary to take
effective protective measures to minimize the impact.

4.5 Assessment of the noise impact
(1) The noise in the construction period
The machine noise is detrimental to the construction workers particularly the
machine operators. In the construction period, particular attention should be paid to the
sensitive areas and follow the "Industrial Enterprise Noise Sanitary Standard". by such
effective measures as reasonable arrangement of the work time schedules, to reduce the
time period for the operators to be exposed to the noise environment. and alteration of
working shift for them to have time to recover their hearing ability. Meanwhile to keep
the machines well maintained and operated carefully shall also be-important to keep the
noise level minimum possible.
(2) Operation period traffic noise forecast
The forecasted noise level in different stages of the operation period at these
sensitive spots are listed in Table 4-1.
According to the noise forecast the noise level exceeding can be find out as shown
in Table 4-1.

It can be seen from Table 4-1 that in the operation period schools will be the major
concern bv dav and the resident areas will be the major concern by night: therefore
effective measures shall be taken to mitigate the noise impact on these sensitive spots of
schools. resident areas and the chicken farmn.
5. Environmental Protection Measures
5.1 Design period
(1) Alignment in harmony with the urban and township development program.
Design of the road alignment should follow the principle of "close to but not getting
into and to be away from but not too far from" the urban and township areas. to reduce
resettlement, to leave more room for urban and township development, to facilitate
12



coinection between cities and minimize the impact of traffic emission noise on the
resident, e.g. the starting point of the expressway is to the east by north of Zhumadian
5km away from the downtown area. and the expressway is 1.200m from thei eastern rinc
road of the city.
(2) Design of passages to mitigate the severance impact
Since there will be severance impact arising from full] controlled access of the
expressway, 156 underpasses and 4 flyover passages have been designed for local
people's communication, with average of every 0.59km one passage and more densitv
of passages in village areas being passed through by the expressway.
(3) In the design stage the road alignment has been optimized by adjustment of the
longitudinal gradient to reduce filling height and cutting depth to be away from village
and school as far as possible and to minimize farm land occupation. Reasonable
selection of earth borrowing and spoils disposal sites with particular attention to such
impacts as soil erosion, dust flying and the impact on the sensitive spots of resident
areas, school and etc..
(4) Air pollution: proper selection of quarry, earth borrowing, spoil disposal area.
mixing plant location to be away from sensitive spots.
(5) Water pollution: design of waste water treatment facility in rest area, subgrade
drainage system.
(6) Noise mitigation: a total of I 00Gm long and 3m high noise barriers for primarn
schools of Xingzhuang, Zhendian and Sanlihe are to be provided.
(7) Cultural relics protection
Where important protected cultural relics are involved in highwav project. it is
imperative to follow the procedures as specified under the "Cultural Relics Protection
Law of the People's Republic of China'" for examination and approval.
(8) Landscape design
Grass protection for areas with gentle slope. For not too high cutting areas with
deep slope, more cutting/filling work might be carried out to make the slope gentle. then
to adopt grass protection.
(9) Hazards spillage: in sensitive areas to provide collision prevention wall and
effective drainage sytem for sewage to be discharged into less sensitive area or storage
pool to cope with emergency situation.
5.2 The construction period
(I) Protection measures for the ecological environment
Farm land occupation should be reduced as much as possible. For the road section
with high output farm lands on both sides, earth retaining wall shall be adopted as
13



subgrade protection to minimize land occupation by road subgrade. To minimized farm
land occupation for service and rest area. road maintenance division and administration
building areas. Once the construction work- is over, the temporary used land shall be
returned back for agricultural production in time.
To protect the wood land in the land acquisition area, particularly the wood land
along the bank of rivers..
Turf should be planted on the side slope of the embankment. Both engineering
protection and plantation protection should be used for the cutting slope. The plantation
in the median area should have anti-glare function with l.m high evergreen or flowering
shrub.
Special greening design should be made for the interchanges, with particular
features for each of the interchanges, including different types or patterns of design. to
form multiple dimensional greening landscape. The greening of the service and rest area
should be in harmony with the overall planning of the area planted with grass and
flowers.
(2) Protection measures for surface water and water conservancy engineering
The sewage, garbage, excrement and urine from the labour camp should not be
discharged directly into the water body and should be treated before discharged. Septic
tank and garbage tank should be provided in the labour camp to collect the treated
sewage which might be used as fertilizer.
During the construction period of the bridges, such engineering measures as boring
pile construction process could be adopted for under water pier construction, which
could significantly reduce the impact on the water quality caused by the substrate silt
resuspension . The waste silt generated by drilling should be disposed at a designated
site bv barge, so that the water pollution caused by the silt might be reduced to the
minimum.
While permanent irrigation system is being built, some temporary irrigation and
drainage svstems should be built.
(3) Protection measures for ambient air
The materials storage site should be away from the resident area, with measures of
coverage and water sprinkle to be taken. It is proposed that water sprinkle at least once
per day should be included in the bidding document.
Great amount of bitumen concrete will be produced used for the expressway
pavement construction. It is better to use stationary mixing plant with fully airtight
mixing equipment. To prevent environmental pollution, it is necessary to properly select
the mixing plant work site, with no resident area in the leeward direction in area 500m
from the work site.
14



(4) Measures to prevent noise impact
It is recommended that no construction work should be arranged by night (22:00-
6:00) for road sections with sensitive spots in areas 200m from the work site.
There are measures to reduce the noise level produced by the machine. such as to
select low noise equipment. careful maintenance of the construction machine. and
proper operation of the machine. and etc..
(5) Traffic guidance to ensure safety
During the construction period, it is necessary to set up traffic mangement team to
guide the existing road traffic to ensure smooth traffic flow and safety. For the
intersection area, detour road should be built first for convenience of the existing road
vehicle and pedestrain traffic.
Safety watcher should be arranged at intersections and the road sections close to
densely populated areas and shcools, villages.
(6) Cultural relics protection
During the construction period, once there is any cultural relics discovered. the
construction work should stopped immediately and the site should be protected properly
and the project owner and the engineering supervision department should be informed
of the discovery in time. The construction work should not proceed until the site is
excavated and properly disposed by the cultural relics protection department.
(7) Vibration monitoring
Where strong vibratory machine operation exists, such as piling of bridge pier.
vibratory roller operation. vibration monitoring should be conducted for the near-bv
buildings, to prevent accident. For the vulnerab;le buildings to be affected by the
vibration. necessary effective re-inforcement measures should be taken.
(8) Engineering measures to prevent soil erosion
Before commencement of subgrade cutting work, drainage pipes should be set first
for discharge of the surface run-off; and once the subgrade construction is accomplished.
engineering protection work should be carried cn immediately. to minimize soil erosion.
Plantation of shrubs or arbors should be done in the road land area on both sides of
the road and the road land area of the intersections and the road area close to local
residential areas.
On the side slope of the subgrade and cutting section, plantation of grass should be
carried out. On the permanent spoils disposal site, in addition to the soil retaining wall
to be built. compaction should be made with the surface covered with soil and the cover
plants.
The recommended cover plants include the arbor of Chinese scholartree, poplar.
tung. elm. masson pine, fir, oak tree; and the ground cover plants of cogongrass,

Japanese clover. carex callitrichos. Bermuda grass and etc..,
5.3 Environmental protection measures in the operation period
(I ) The measures to prevent water pollution
Septic tanks should be provided in the toll collection areas ( a total of 8 toll
collection areas) for treatment of the excrements and the garbage collection and disposal
measures, as well as the treatment facility for the waste water from washing and
cleaning.
Sewage treatment facility should be provided in the service and rest area to
discharge the sewage in accordance with the Class II standard a specified in the State
Standard of "Comprehensive Sewage Discharge Standard'" (GB8978-96). It is
recommended that the two-stage biological method is used for the treatment. wvith proc
The solid wastes from the service-tt-irest area should be disposed to desiginate
place.
(2) Measures in response to dangerous goods traffic incident and/or accident
A emergency response steering group and emergency response team should be
established under the leadership of the Henan Provincial High Grade Highway
Management Bureau and the Henan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau. to
deal with the traffic incident or accident, and shall be established by the road project
owner and the Hienan provincial EPB with emergency response and first aid progrram to
deal with dangerous goods spillage incidents;
The expressway management organ should establish an emergency response
system for traffic incident and/or accident, with one emergency response vehicle and
necessary firefighting. and cleaning equipment, so as to minimize the impact arising
from the traffic incident and /or accident.
(3) Acoustic environmental protection measures in the operation period
There will be noise impact on the sensitive spots along the road area in the
operation period. The protection measures for the sensitive spots along the road area
have been designed based on the areas and the distance of the sensitive spots from the
road side. Table 5-1 shows the summary of the acoustic environmental protection
measures for the sensitive spots.
Increase resettlement to 50m from the road , because the mitigation measures of
enclosing wall and insulation windows are useless within 50m. The area of one familv
which increasing resettlement is about 80m2,and the compensation condenser is about
CNY 20.000.
The cost of heighten enclosing wall which can reduce 6-8dB is CNY 1.000 each
familv (the area is about 20m2).
16



The cost' of sound insulation windows which can reduce 10- I 2dB is CNY 2.000
each familv(the area is about m'2).
The cost of sound barrier is CNY 1500 each meter long.
For the interests of the public health, it is recommended that no school. and
hospital should be newlIN built in the areas 220m from the road side. and the newly built
shop, depot and other buildings should be in the areas I OOm away from the road side
and the interchange area.
To strengthen traffic management, by ehforcement of vehicle regulations. to ban
unroadworthiness vehicles and vehicles with emissions and noise level over the standard
limits driving on road.
To strengthen road maintenance and greening plantation to mitigate noise impact.

5.4 Summarn of cost estimation of the protection measures
The summary of the cost estimation of the environ-mental protection measures and
the cost-benefit analvsis are shown in Table 5-2.
It can be seen in the Table that the total investment for the environmental
protection measures is CNY22.55 million, accounting for 0.91 % of the total
construction investment of CNY2.458.77 million, and the societal benefit cf the
investnient will be very conspicuous.

6. Comparison of Alternative Schemes
The proposed expressway of Zhumadian-Xinyang (provincial border) section
(1 32.9km) starts from the end point of Leihe-Zhumadian expressway, and ends at
Jiuliguan the provincial border area. The connecting point with the expressway section
in Hubei province was decided through consultation between Henan and Hubei
provinces in October 1994. This section (95.15;km) is within the southern part of the
Zhumadian-Xinyang section, with its end point being 37.8km from the province border.
Therefore there is basically no alternative scheme in terms of the overall alignment. The
general alignment can only be arranged on the east side of the Beijing-Guangzhou
railway. However due to some of the control factors along the alignment, there is one
19



local alternative scheme worthy to be considered.
In point view of environmental factors. the East Scheme and the West Scheme
have little difference in terms Qf soil erosion. engineering land occupation. water
environmental impact. socio-economic impact and ambient air quality impact: whereas.
the East Scheme has conspicuouslv more impact in terms of resettlement and acoustic
impact. Therefore the West Scheme is proposed as the recommended scheme.
7. Public Participation
To fully understand the public opinions on the proposed road project, to protect the
interests of the people to be affected bv the proposed road and to protect the living
environment of the local residents, the project owner and the EIA working group
conducted public participation and solicit comments from the public on a number of the
issues concerning the proposed road project by wav of different forms in December
1998 and in Januarv and February 1999.    Table 7-1 shows the statistics results of the

world and promote the local area's economic development. to be beneficial to the
improvement of the livinc environment and the livino standard with great significance
for the State and the local area.
8. Environmental monitoring
To mitigate pollution to supervise implernentation of environmental forecast and
to timely modify environment protection measures based on monitoring. results during
he construction and operation period, an environmental monitoring plan has been set
forth for this project. According to the monitoring plan, monitor of noise, air
environment and water quality during the construction and operation and operation
period shall be contracted out by the local EPA., for road sections with possible overage
of the standard limits particularly for the sensitive spots. The details of the monitor plan
are listed in Appendix I Environmnental monitoring.
9. Environmental management organization and Training

10. Summarv
So long as the Environmental Action Plan (EAP) is implemented. the minntiation
or elimination of the various negative impacts can be achieved.
The proposed road project will greatly promote the economic development of tlle
areas along the proposed road and the economic development of the wvhole province and
improve the living standard of the local people.
Land acquisition and resettlement will be arranged with average about ;58 times
of every mu of land output value for each of mu of the land occupation to be provided as
compensation, together with proper arrangement of the land and building facilities for
relocation and resettlement.
The permanent land occupation account for 0.23% of the total area of the three
counties of Nunan, Queshan and Xinvang, therefore the impact on agriculture
production is not great. The projected road keep the original irrigation intact and
minimize the impact on the river system.
According the engineering feasibility' study report, there will be one livinig service
area and the sewage from the living service area will be treated before to be discharge
into the water body and the garbage to be disposed to the designated place: therefore the
impact will be small.
The impact on the ambient air quality is small.
According to the forecast. there wvill be greater impact of the traffic noise on the
sensitive spots along the road area in the operation period, with exceeding of the noise
level over the standard limit in different extent in the long term operation period:
measures will be taken to mitigate the impact.
The proposed road project will play -an important role in the integration of the
transport network, improvement of the investment environment and the promotion of
the local areas' tourism and economic development. Meanwhile there wvill be negatiVe
impact on the area along the road in terms of reduction of the land resource. damage of
the cover plant and deterioration of the environmental qualityv; but effective protection
measures might be taken to mitigate or eliminate the impact so that the negative impact
could be accepted: therefore the proposed road project is feasible.

3 Soil erosion.   - The sewage. garbage, excremeni and unne from the labour cam: should not be discharged
water pollutior    directil into the water body and should be tcated before discharged
- Dunng the bridge construction penod. the construction machine and ships should be inspected
carefulls to prevent oil leakage and to prohibit discharge waste oil and other wastes into the
,5ater bodg
- The construction matenals such as bitumen, oil, chemicals shcould not be storcd close to the
drinking water source area
- plantation on side siope and along the road area. umely restoration of damaged drainage &
imgation system, with temporaty drainage & imgation system wben nccessary:discharge wastes
at designated place.
4 Noise pollution - abide by the industrial noise standard, to take protection measures for worker.
- stop machine work at night when there is resident area in 200m, form 22-00 to
6 00 next morning,
- strengthening maintenance of vehicle & machine to minimize noise level.
5 Ecological       - i ducation should be strcngthened to protect the cover plants in ths construction period
environment       To protect the wood hand in the lnd actquisition area, particularly the wood land along the bank
of rivers
- In the temporary land use area tones should be preserved, parniculariy the trees planted for soil
retention and nver bank protection   The labour camp should not be set in wood land area - no
earth botrowing in wood land area,
- to avoid earth borrowing on farm land, and if it is needed the surface soil should
be set aside preserved and to be put back when the borre-wing is finished to
minimize negative impact,
- strengthening education and training of the workers to be conscious of protection
of wild iife and cover plant, and hunting is prohibited,
- spoil disposal should not damage to farm land and other farm facilities and the
disposal site be selected in consultation with the local El'B
6 Cultural relics  - in case any relics to be discovered, it should be reported immediately to the
cultural reiics protection department and the construction should stop and not
proceed until proper treatment having been done by the archaeological
professionals, for cultural relics area one expert should supervise the work.
7 Plantation of    - Plantation of green belt should be designed according to the environmental and landscape
green belt          featu-es of each of the road sections
- The plantation on both sides of the road should ake into account of not only the subgradc
protection. but also the landscape and environmental protection, such as soil retention, noise
mitigation and ambient air protection, to increase the width of the planted green belt as much as
possible when the conditions being allowed Evergreen bush or flowering bush should be planted
from the foot of side slope to the drainage ditch with arbor and shrub combination from the
drainage ditch to the road side and to be harmnonized with the local protective green belt
- Turf should be pilnted on Ihe side slope of the enibankment; and when earth retaining wall is
built for the high embankment, it shall be combine with cover plart protcction
- Both engineering protection and plantation protection should be uised for the cuning slope. i.e
.hen the caning siope is higher than am. the foot of the slope shoulid be protected by mortar
