Project aims at providing a more efficient and effective\n            transport infrastructure in support of social and economic\n            development in Henan Province. To meet this development\n            objective, the project will produce the following outputs:\n            reduced traffic and enhanced mobility, improved access to\n            the poor areas in the province, and increased efficiency and\n            effectiveness in public sector management of the road\n            network while preparing the sector for commercialization\n            opportunities. The project has three components. The first\n            increases capacity by constructing an expressway; linking\n            roads to maximize the impact of the expressway; and\n            providing buildings/services areas, traffic engineering and\n            equipment for operations and maintenance. The second\n            component improves or rehabilitates roads with priority\n            given to rural road segments that explicitly enable local\n            people to have an easier access to education, health, and\n            other social activities and facilitates production and\n            business operations and benefits the local environment. The\n            third component includes three sub-components which 1) build\n            the capacity of the communications department, and provide\n            extensive training programs in the areas of environmental\n            protection, construction and maintenance technology and\n            management, highway network planning, and operations\n            management for senior professionals; 2) supply technical\n            assistance for studies in road management improvement; and\n            3) provide specialized equipment"}, "docdt": "2000-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
