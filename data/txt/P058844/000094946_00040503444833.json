The living standard,\n            productive ability and income of projected affected persons\n            (PAPs) will be restored to original levels. Removed\n            buildings such as residences will be compensated according\n            to reconstruction price. New houses for PAPs should be ready\n            before demolition of their old houses and a removal expense\n            paid. Transition costs will be supplied wherever needed.\n            Requisitioned arable land (including vegetable plots,\n            orchards, fish ponds, lotus ponds, and tea gardens in city\n            suburbs under direct provincial administration, will be\n            compensated according to annual output value. Annual output\n            value will also be used to compensate land in industry and\n            mining areas under direct administration of the county and\n            land located elsewhere. Compensation for young crops will be\n            made according to the output value of one harvest. Crop\n            by-products (vegetables excluded) will be compensated by\n            15-20 percent of the output they mainly produce. Land used\n            for residence and collective land used for public\n            facilities, commonwealth benefits, or used for individual\n            business will be compensated as arable land and a removal\n            subsidy will be given to land users.
