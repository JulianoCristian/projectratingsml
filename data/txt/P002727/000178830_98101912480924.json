production of pyrethrum in the highlands of the Mbeya\n            and Iringa Regions of Southern Tanzania. Therefore, the\n            project will finance: (a) a program to increase smallholder\n            pyrethrum production; (b) a program to strengthen pyrethrum\n            research in Tanzania; (c) the strengthening of TPB's\n            organization and infrastructure; and (d) the improvement and\n            maintenance of district and feeder roads. A risk faced by\n            the Project will be a future collapse of pyrethrum export\n            prices as a result of the development of new substitutes.\n            However, current research is aimed mostly towards developing\n            agricultural chemicals which will not compete with\n            pyrethrum. Also the costs of licensing new insecticides\n            protects pyrethrum's market position."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
