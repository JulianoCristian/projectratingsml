sector, thereby strengthening the market economy in\n            Hungary. The program has three main components: (i) the\n            rapid privatization of SEs through a multi-track approach\n            with appropriate oversight, and with the target of reducing\n            the share of SEs to less than 50 percent of the assets of\n            the competitive sector by the end of 1994; (ii) the rapid\n            transformation of all SEs into corporate form under\n            Hungary's company law, thereby placing them on the same\n            legal basis as private enterprises, and specific measures to\n            strengthen corporate governance; and (iii) support and\n            encouragement for restructuring processes, together with an\n            improved bankruptcy and liquidation framework."}, "docdt": "1992-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
