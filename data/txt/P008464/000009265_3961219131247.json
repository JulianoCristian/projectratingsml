Enterprise Reform Loan (ERL) in\n            Hungary.  The government's enterprise reform program\n            which was supported by ERL had two principal Objectives:\n            first, it sought to establish effective ownership for all\n            enterprises, either through rapid privatization or through\n            the establishment of effective corporate governance by the\n            state;and second, it sought to encourage decisive\n            restructuring in order to speed up adjustment o new market\n            realities and productivity growth. The Bank's\n            performance in all aspects of the project cycle was\n            satisfactory. The overall performance of the Borrower was\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the project were as\n            follows: (i) in the case of publicly-owned enterprises,\n            privatization is the preferred means of forcing adjustment\n            and maximizing the probability of the enterprise returning\n            to profitability; (ii) work-out of troubled enterprises\n            proved to be more difficult than expected; (iii) the\n            development of the regulatory regime for natural monopolies\n            should be addressed as early as possible; (iv) another\n            important lesson that emerged from the design of this\n            project is the difficulty in establishing targets that could\n            be monitored effectively, when unclear definitional and\n            measurement problems exist, accompanied by unexpected\n            magnitude of changes, and exacerbated by lack of financial\n            records and inadequate accounting systems."}, "docdt": "1996-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
