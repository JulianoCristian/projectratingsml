Firstly, the technical and\n            professional expertise of BADR management will be improved\n            through the provision of a training program and the\n            installation of a management information system (MIS).\n            Secondly, a framework will be established to ensure\n            BADR's future financial viability, and a medium term\n            action plan developed to provide future direction for\n            development. Finally, sub-borrowers access to medium and\n            long-term finance will be enhanced through the provision of\n            funds for 21,000 on-farm investments and also for private\n            investments in small-scale agro-industry."}, "docdt": "1988-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
