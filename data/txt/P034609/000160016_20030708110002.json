The overall performances\n            of both the Bank and the Borrower is rated satisfactory. As\n            in the first Private Sector Development Project (PSD1), the\n            main lessons learned from the PSD II relate to measures that\n            could be adopted at project design to strengthen project\n            implementation. They include recommendations regarding: (i)\n            the inclusion of technical assistance components in credit\n            lines approved in transition economies if long-term lending\n            skills are largely underdeveloped in their banking systems;\n            (ii) the establishment of independent implementation units\n            with a formal agency arrangement; and (iii) choosing prudent\n            banks capable of offering their clients a range of\n            good-quality products and services. The selection criteria\n            should rely largely on the sovereign prudential requirements\n            as long as these have been deemed acceptable to the Bank.\n            Other points elaborated in this ICR include: 1) The Bank\n            should have a clear position on the level of interest rates\n            to be offered to the financial intermediaries and final\n            borrowers on its credit line funds. This position needs to\n            take into account the fact that, in many countries which\n            take out financial intermediary loans from the Bank, there\n            are very few, if any, long-term funding sources in the\n            financial system and no yield curves to speak of, thus\n            rendering the pricing of such loans a discretionary matter\n            agreed between the Bank and the Borrower (usually the\n            Ministry of Finance). As a development institution, the Bank\n            should consider passing along its low borrowing costs, not\n            only to the official Borrowers but as an incentive also to\n            the private sector participants. Continued availability of\n            these long-term funds would catalyze the provision of\n            medium- and long-term credits to private sector enterprises\n            at reasonable rates, which would contribute to private\n            sector-led growth. 2) Arrangements for usage of the repaid\n            (revolving) funds after a project's formal closure\n            should be agreed up front and ideally allow the funds to\n            flow back into the participating financial intermediaries\n            (PFIs) without strict conditions attached. 3) With regard to\n            the conditions for using the funds during the project,\n            procurement procedures continue to be perceived as too\n            cumbersome by private sector enterprises. To this end,\n            although the Bank has made substantial progress in\n            simplifying it's procurement guidelines for private\n            sector beneficiaries, attempts should be made to further\n            streamline these procedures for the private sector without\n            undermining the fiduciary responsibilities of the Bank."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
