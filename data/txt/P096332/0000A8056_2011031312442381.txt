                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Good progress persists with most program activities completed and most KPI's met or surpassed. Notably, the mission verified that the Restructuring Plan and the Citizen's Repot
                         Card that were lagging behind are now showing a good performance. Especially, the Restructuring Plan that is a trigger has been completed and is reflected in the new structure
                         approved by the Municipal Assembly. The only critical activity of the program is the full development of a Financial Management System (IFMIS) that still presents important delays.
