workers, paticularly in rural areas\n            of the country. To accomplish these objectives, the Project\n            provides for: (a) construction and furnishing of about 150\n            primary school classrooms; (b) provision of about 1,900,000\n            primary school level textbooks and workbooks in the three\n            core subjects (Lesotho, English and mathematics); (c)\n            provision of permanent facilities for about 110 trainees at\n            the Thaba-Tseka Vocational Training Center; (d) provision of\n            permanent facilities for about 125 trainees at the Lesotho\n            Opportunities Industrialization Center (Maseru); (e)\n            provision of about 13 man-years of specialists services\n            consisting of an architect, a construction supervisor, a\n            procurement officer and a textbook specialist; and (f)\n            assistance to the Ministry of Education to improve and\n            strengthen its Planning Division and Statistics Unit and\n            preinvestment funds for the preparation of future education projects."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
