MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$184.0 million equivalent to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with a 20-
year term, including a five-year grace period and would help finance transport
sector investments and maintenance.
2.        Background.  Although Pakistan's basic transport infrastructure is
adequate, transport costs are high. This is because the system is not
operated as efficiently as it should, and because infrastructure has not
always been maintained adequately. National roads designed and built more
than 20 years ago have experienced traffic growth averaging 8X p.a. since
construction, and periodic maintenance has not received the same priority as
new construction. Poor road conditions combined with a fleet of mostly small
trucks make road transport costs unduly high.  While the gge_raphy of Pakistan
is favorable to rail transport -- most of the population and economic
activities are in a single corridor, stretching 1700 km from Karachi to
Peshawar -- Pakistan Railways (PR) is not capable of carrying the available
traffic because of capacity and operational constraints. As a result, some
traffic has been diverted to more costly road transport. Trade logistics in
general remain tradition bound, and modern methods of management and
communications have yet to be introduced. Environmental issues in the
transport sector have so far received little attention.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has assisted the sector
with a number of modal projects in the railway, highway and port sub-sactors.
These have made important contributions to the developaent of the transport
infrastructure and expansion of the system's capacity. T.here was, however,
less success with policy measures to improve productivity and efficiency. The
proposed project is desigred to address these and other major sectoral issues,
and major actions have been taken to increase budgetary resources for
improving road and rail infrastructure, to restructure the railways and
increase resource mobilization from road and rail users. Since 1986, when a
Transport Sector Report was prepared, the Bank has assisted the Government to
develop a coherent and achievable sector reform program. Such a program is
now ready for implementation. In particular, the Government is prepared to
strengthen the National Highways Board (NHB) and restructure PR. Regarding
the latter, comprehensive recommendations to make PR an efficient and viable
organization have been drafted with Bank's assistance and approved by the
Cabinet. A first Corporate Plan has been prepared by PR and submitted to
Parliament. GOP has agreed to reimburse PR for the losses incurred in
operation of uneconomic services and this will be shown as a revenue item in
PR's budget. PR has already taken measures which would effectively increase



- 2 -
its revenues by 101 in 1990/91. The Bank's involvement in this process has
been instrumental in focussing on the essential issues in the sector, and must
remain strong during the critical phase of implementing an action program to
deal with outstanding mattmrs.
4.        Project Obiectives.  The main objective of the project is to assist
the Government in implementing sectoral reforms to improve overall transport
efficiency and to meet future transport demand. The emphasis of the project
is on road an' rail, the two key subsectors in Pakistan's transport system.
The major policy reforms to be implemented are: rationalizing the highway and
railway investment and maintenance programs; strengthening the NHB;
restructuring the railways; increasing resource mobilization in the sector;
modernizing the trucking industry; improving trade logistics; beginning to
address environmental issues in the sector; and strengthening transport
coordination and planning.
5.        Pro1ect DescriRtion.  The project would include (i) training,
stud'es and technical assistance needed for Highway Board strengthening and
for implementing railway restructuring; (ii) technical assistance for
effective implementation of the sectoral reform program; (iii) rehabilitation,
resurfacing and strengthening of 800 kms of the National Highway;
(iv) measures for improving railway operations (converting 15,000 freight
wagons to roller bearing axles, UHF and VMF equipment to provide for improved
train control, and introducing a management information system); and
(v) replenishment of spare parts inventories in order to improve locomotive
utilization. The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$300.7 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$176.3 million (591). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8611-PAK
dated June 11, 1990, is being distributed separately.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government and its agencies, NHB and PR, have
agreed to:
(a) implement detailed plans and timetables for: (i) a transport
sector reform program, (ii) an action plan for NHB 
institutional strengthening and maintenance program, and (iii)
an action plan for railway restructuring, business development
and operational improvements; annual implementation reviews
would be held with the Bank by March 31 of each year beginning
in 1991;
(b) implement a Core Investment and Maintenance Program for the
sector and its financing plan for 1990/91 to 1992/93 and to
have annual reviews with the Bank by March 31 of each year
beginning in 1991;



(c)  form a Transport Review Committee by October 31, 1990 to ensure
effective implementation of the transport sector reform
program;
(d) select periodic and routine maintenance programs according to
NHB's maintenance intervention system; and to decide the
Maintenance Backlog Reduction Programs (MBRP) and Resurfacing
and Strengthening Program (RSP) annually in consultation with
the Bank;
(e) provide funds for civil works contracts to be signed after June
30, 1991 in a satisfactory manner at the beginning of each
year's program;
(f) cause PR to submit a separate budget accompanied by PR's
Corporate Plan to Parliament for fiscal year 1991/92 and for
each year thereafter;
(g) make foreign exchange funds available to PR so that appropriate
levels of expenditures would be maintained for locomotive
spares;
(h)  maintain separate Special Accounts for NHB and PR and to have
these and other project accounts audited annually;
(i) make PR's audited accounts available to the Bank within nine
months of the end of its fiscal year;
(j) cause PR initially to estimate and subsequently prepare
accounts separated into different traffic streams, Public
Service Obligations (PSO) and manufacturing units beginning for
the year 1991-92;
(k) allow PR to reduce staff throug,i attrition, failing which it
'ruld be reimbursed the cost of carrying redundant staff under
P'SO; and
(1) ensure that PR tariff increases are above the inflation rat, in
Pakistan, would progressively reduce PR deficits and enable PR
starting no later than FY94/95, to either pay dividends or to
finance a reasonable portion of its capital development
expenditures.
Conditions for effectiveness of the loan are that:
(a) GOP has issued a Gazette notification that the Railway Board
has become a policy and review board and that PR's General
Manager has executive powers;



(b) PR's General Manager has issued orders establishing a Business
Department and has appointed an additional general manager
(Business);
(c) ECMEC has approved PC-is for the highway and railway
components, and funds have been provided for the first year of
the project; and
(d) Tender documents, approved by the Bank, have been issued for
(i) at least US$25 million for locomotive spare parts, unit
exchange assemblies and traction motors combined, and (iij for
roller bearings.
7.        Benefits. The main benefits expected from the project are lower
transport costs for freight and passengers, travel time savings and reduced
accident rates. Benefits accruing to truck and bus owners will be passed on
to users, as the road industry is competitive. For the rail mode, the benefits
of restoring the full capacity of the existing motive power and rolling stock
will be in terms of reduced transport costs which will benefit the economy at
large, since railways remain economic for long distance freight and passenger
services. Based on total project costs and the benefi-s described above, the
overall internal economic rate of return is 39X.
8.        Risks. There is a possible risk ot delay in implementing sectoral
reforms, some of which need formal legal actions. In order to minimize thiis
risk, policy reform programs have been prepared carefully and their
implementation programs are realistically phased. Key initial actions have
been taken, and implementation of other key items have been made conditions
for effectiveness. On the implementation of investment components, delays
could also occur because of shortage of local counterpart funds. In order to
minimize this risk, GOP is required to make funds available at the start
each fiscal year.
9.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would c.ply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Execvt-4ve
Directors approve the proposed loan.
