The measures to be\n            implemented are : a) rationalizing the highway and railway\n            investment and maintenance programs in order to compensate\n            for past neglect of transport infrastructure; b)\n            strengthening the National Highways Board; c) restructuring\n            the railways; d) increasing resource mobilization in the\n            sector; e) modernizing the trucking industry; f) improving\n            trade logistics; g) beginning to address environmental\n            issues in the sector; and h) strengthening transport\n            coordination and planning.  The project will include : i)\n            training, studies and technical assistance needed for\n            Highways Board strengthening; ii) technical assistance for\n            effective implementation of the sector reform program; iii)\n            rehabilitation, resurfacing and strengthening of 800 kms of\n            the National Highway; iv) measures for improving railway\n            operations (converting 15,000 freight wagons to roller\n            bearing axles, UHF and VHF equipment for improved train\n            control and monitoring, and introducing a management\n            information system); and v) replenishement of spare part\n            inventories in order to improve locomotive utilization."}, "docdt": "1990-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
