MX Access to Land for Young Farmers


Background                                                     Financing
In the last decade, Mexico has undertaken major                Total cost : US$130.2 million
efforts to transform its rural and agricultural sectors,
and to make the rural social sector in particular part         IBRD loan amount: US$100 million
of a more dynamic economic environment. The
                                                               Ministry of Finance & Public Credit:
rural social sector consists of “ejidos” and                   US$22.3 million
“communal lands” that represent half the country’s
land. This is where nearly 70% of the rural                    Beneficiaries: US$7.9 million
population live and where poverty rates are the
                                                               Implementation period: Expected
highest.                                                       January 2006- June 2010

Mexico’s efforts, however, have been limited by                Geographical area: States of Guanajuato,
legal and administrative restrictions, and a lack of           Aguascalientes, Guerrero, Michoacán,
economic incentives. In the “ejidos”, most land                Oaxaca, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa, Sonora,
                                                               Yucatán and Zacatecas
rights belong to older people, many of whom are
unable to use their land efficiently. Meanwhile,               Implementing agency:Secretariat of
young households, headed by more educated and                  Agrarian Reform
potentially more innovative farmers, suffer from land
shortages or insecure land tenure. As a result, the            More details
rural social sector is getting older and young

States.                                                     

Project objective                                           

To support access for young farmers with                    
entrepreneurial potential to land and other
                                                            
productive assets within selected states, by
establishing an efficient model for land transactions,      
while helping older landholders access social
welfare schemes.                                            

Project Design                                              

The project aims to provide young farmers with the          
knowledge and skills they need to develop and
carry out productive projects related to the land.          
The support will be given as credits and grants,
and will include technical assistance. As this is a
project pilot, special attention will be paid to
                                                            
monitoring and evaluating results.

Expected impact:

       Young rural entrepreneurs will receive
       training and technical assistance. They will
       also receive credits and grants that will
       enable them to buy or rent underused and
       potentially productive land, and to implement
       productive on- and off-farm investment
       projects that are environmentally sustainable
       and increase their income and welfare.
       Older farmers who transfer their lands will
       be able to access social welfare schemes.
