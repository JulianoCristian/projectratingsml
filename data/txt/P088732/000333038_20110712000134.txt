F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to support the access of young rural sujetos agrarios
with entrepreneurial potential to land and other productive assets within selected states,


                                                   ii
through the establishment of a beneficiary-driven, efficient land transaction model, while
at the same time facilitating the access of senior landholders to social welfare schemes.

  To achieve this, the project will support the GOM in piloting mechanisms that will:

  (i) on the one hand, allow landless young rural entrepreneurs to receive training and
technical assistance, to acquire or rent underutilized and potentially more productive
land, and implement productive and environmentally sustainable on- and off-farm
investment projects that significantly increase their income and welfare, and
  (ii) on the other hand, help older ejiduturios or comuneros who transfer their lands to
access social welfare schemes.

  Once these mechanisms have been successfully piloted and refined throughout project
implementation, they will be scaled up to reach a broader group of beneficiaries in the
social sector.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Sector background and government strategy. Agrarian reform in Mexico dates back to
the early 20th century. While it made major changes in redistribution of rural lands, its impact on
poverty reduction has been mixed. By the year 2000, about 53 percent of the national population
suffered from income poverty.1 In 2002, 35 percent of the rural population (between 8 and 10
million people) was extremely poor. The “social sector”2 is home to 70 percent of the rural
population and faces the highest rate of poverty as well as a significant aging problem.3 In the late
1990s and early 2000s several reforms were implemented, including: (i) the 1992 constitutional
and legal reforms, which allowed land rentals and sales within the ejidos; and (ii) the advanced
stage of the land titling program PROCEDE, which increased tenure security especially for de
facto right holders within ejidos (e.g., avecindados, posesionarios). Nevertheless, as pointed out
by the Borrower in its completion report, “the mobility of social lands was a preoccupation from
the standpoint of public policy, despite the possibility of legally transferring ejido and communal
lands, these transactions were not taking place.” Inheritance remained the main form of
permanent access to land, generally occurring around the age of 40, with very few acquisitions of
land through sales. The dominant inheritance pattern was transfer of the entire parcel, first to the
spouse and eventually to one child, usually a son. Since women accessed land as ejidatarias
mainly after the death of their husbands, most ejidatarias consisted of elderly widows who often
lacked the physical capacity and working capital to farm their land.

2.      Analytical work carried out by the Bank in 2001 pointed to the situation in the land
markets as a constraint to the development of the social sector.4 The study noted that previous
major efforts by the Government of Mexico (GOM) to transform the social sector had been
limited due to low investment levels, unsustainable resource use, atomization of land parcels, and
excessive rigidity in the ejidos, where most land rights belonged to senior farmers, many of
whom were unable to make efficient use of their land. Conversely, young households, who were
more educated and potentially more innovative farmers, suffered from significant land shortages

  Income poverty is defined as a per capita consumption level below that which is needed to meet basic
food and non-food needs.
2
  The social sector includes lands classified as ejidos and indigenous communal lands, and comprises half
of Mexico’s land. This was a result of the massive land redistribution process following the Mexican
revolution and the 1917 Constitution, under which indigenous and non-indigenous beneficiaries received
rights to a house plot, sole usufruct rights for a parcel of land, and access to communal lands subject to
collective management decisions. Ejidos are those social lands whose tenure regime is regulated by the
Agrarian Law, while “communal lands” are lands regulated by customary-based land tenure regimes. The
population living in ejidos and comunidades includes ejidatarios and comuneros (those with clear usufruct
rights over a parcel of land, access to communal land, and the right to a house plot), posesionarios (those
with possession of plots but no other rights), avecindados (members of the community who have lived in
the ejido urban area for more than a year and are so recognized by the ejido assembly, along with their
children and spouses). With a 75 percent majority, the ejido assembly can decide which community lands
may be parceled out to individuals and whether landholders can move toward full private ownership.
3
  Data from PROCEDE (National Certification Program of Ejido Rights and Urban Lots) show that in 2001
58.5 percent of ejidatarios were above the age of 50 and 27.6 percent above the age of 65. Only 22.7
percent of ejidatarios were below the age of 40.

     or highly insecure land tenure. The study recommended increased access to land by younger
     farmers, accompanied by complementary investments and technical assistance.

3.           In this context, the GOM saw the need to create a program targeted to the more dynamic
     segment of the rural population that would promote the intergenerational transfer of land, making
     the land more productive, and reducing the high rate of migration out of rural areas. Thus, in early
     2004 the Young Rural Entrepreneur and Land Fund Program (Programa del Joven Emprendedor
     Rural y Fondo de Tierras, PJERFT), the “Program,” was launched by the Government. Shortly
     thereafter, the Bank appraised (April 2005) and approved (July 2005) an Access to Land for
     Young Farmers Pilot Project, the “Project,” through a four-year US$100 million investment loan
     (Loan 7323-ME), to partially support the Government’s wider Program. The Project became
     effective in January 2006.

4.           Country Partnership Strategy. The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) at the
     time (Document No. 28141-ME, dated March 14, 2004) focused on reducing poverty and
     inequality, increasing competitiveness, strengthening institutions, and promoting environmental
     sustainability. It included support for Government programs in rural areas, mentioned the need
     for a more integrated rural strategy, and identified the improvement of land markets and access to
     land as key pillars for reducing rural poverty and inequality. The project was consistent with this
     framework.

5.           Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank was uniquely positioned to assist the GOM
     in addressing the social sector challenges, given its experience in similar land reform programs in
     Brazil, Guatemala and Honduras. The Project was the natural continuation of the Bank’s
     involvement in land and rural poverty reduction in Mexico, which started long before the 1992
     Constitutional reforms. Further, the conditions in Mexico at that time represented a historic
     window of opportunity to address a long-neglected set of issues. Although the Bank had some
     reservations about certain features of the newly established PJERFT program (e.g., high cost per
     beneficiary, high debt-to-equity ratios, rigid implementation rules – see following sections), it
     nevertheless decided to support the Program (as a “pilot” project) with the aim of influencing and
     improving significantly over time its operational modalities and outcomes. At appraisal, the
     Project’s risks were rated Moderate to High. This approach exemplified the type of assistance that
     the Government valued from the Bank and reflected the new engagement strategy with Mexico,
     which underscored its maturity as a MIC country to establish its own development course and
     receive advanced Bank support in the implementation of its development strategy.

6.           Land Acquisition Committee’s endorsement. Since the Project involved use of Bank
     loan funds for land acquisition, allowed under the recently approved Bank disbursement policy,
     the operation required the review and endorsement of the Land Acquisition Committee, which
     took place in March 2005.

     1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.          The Project Development Objective as stated in the PAD was to support the access of
     young rural sujetos agrarios5 with entrepreneurial potential to land and other productive assets
     within selected states6, through the establishment of a beneficiary-driven, efficient land
     5
       Defined as Ejidatarios, Avecindados, Posesionarios and Comuneros, (i.e., dwellers in ejidos, rural towns,
     those with usufruct land rights and community residents) including indigenous peoples.

     6
         This is the PDO in the PAD; the GOM prefers to use the term “participating” instead of “selected” states.

      transaction model, while at the same time facilitating the access of senior landholders to social
      welfare schemes.

      Key performance indicators as approved were:

      •   Number of young rural entrepreneurs benefited by capacity building (10,000 to 15,000);
      •   Minimum number of young rural entrepreneurs benefited by land fund (6,000);
      •   Increase in land fund beneficiaries’ income (20% as measured against baseline);
      •   10% of the transactions made between sellers and buyers with an age difference of at least 20
          years in ejidos and comunidades agrarias covered by the Program.

      1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
      reasons/justification

8.            The PDO was not revised during Project implementation.

      1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.            The project targeted selected young individual sujetos agrarios (ranging from 18 to 39
      years of age), with entrepreneurial potential and limited access to land, living in ejidos and
      comunidades in 10 participating states (San Luis Potosí, Guerrero, Michoacán, Aguascalientes,
      Guanajuato, Sinaloa, Oaxaca, Sonora, Yucatán, and Zacatecas). About 808 ejidos were selected
      for participation in the Project. Specifically, the target group included: (a) young people with
      clear usufruct rights over a parcel of land, access to communal land, and the right to a house plot
      (ejidatarios and comuneros); (b) young people with possession of plots but no other rights
      (posesionarios); and (c) members of the community who had lived in the ejido urban area for
      more than a year and were so recognized by the community assembly, along with their children
      and spouses (avecindados).

      1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.           The project had three components:

      (a)      Component 1: Capacity Building of Young Rural Entrepreneurs and Assistance to
      Senior Landholders (US$38.6 million, 29.7 percent of total project cost) was to provide the
      young beneficiaries with the knowledge and abilities required to elaborate and carry out a land-
      related productive project, and technical assistance on access to social welfare schemes for senior
      landholders. The component financed activities related to promotion, capacity building, and
      elaboration of productive subprojects.

      (b)     Component 2: Land Transactions and Productive Projects (US$86.4 million, 66.4
      percent of total cost) was to support access to land by qualified young rural entrepreneurs and the
      design and implementation of productive projects. Support would be provided in the form of a
      combination of loans and grants and would include technical assistance. The Component would
      also promote the inclusion of senior landholders in social welfare programs offered by the GOM.
      It would finance activities related to legal advice for land transactions, selection of beneficiaries,
      technical assistance and promotion of social welfare programs linked to land transactions.

      (c)    Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
      (US$4.1 million, 3.5 percent of total cost) was to finance project management, including: (i)


                                                        3
      inter-institutional coordination; (ii) the creation of a Monitoring & Evaluation system so as to
      develop a results-based improvement mechanism; and (iii) the development of mentoring
      mechanisms to better accompany the young rural entrepreneurs in the identification and
      implementation of their productive projects and to ensure their participation in the Project.
      Additionally, this component was to finance the main staff of the Project Coordination Unit
      (PCU).

      1.6 Revised Components

      Project components were not revised during implementation.

11.             Project scope versus wider Government Program. The Project was designed as a pilot
      operation in support of a wider Government Program and it must be evaluated in that context. It
      financed most aspects of the Program in the ten selected pilot states. Later, in 2006, the GOM
      decided to expand the Program’s coverage to a total of 30 states, which it did with its own funds.
      In addition to the geographical coverage, the main area of divergence of the Project from the
      Government Program concerned the financing of land transactions and productive subprojects. In
      its initial stages (2004-2006), the Government Program included support for the purchase or
      rental of a parcel of land and the development of a productive subproject through loans issued by
      Fideicomiso Fondo Nacional para el Fomento Ejidal (FIFONAFE) directly to the beneficiaries
      (issuance of such loans started in January 2006). These were covered by the Bank Loan. Starting
      in 2007, the Program adopted a new financing scheme, formalized through a cooperation
      agreement between SRA and Financiera Rural (FR), which provided that: (i) loans for productive
      subprojects were to be financed directly by FR with its own funds; and (ii) SRA would make
      deposits into a guarantee fund equivalent to (initially) 30 percent of the loans made by FR. The
      Bank insisted that subprojects be financed through loans following market conditions, which
      encouraged the GOM to engage FR. However, given that some terms of the new financing
      scheme were not acceptable to the Bank, these expenditures were not eligible for financing under
      the Loan and hence these were covered by the Government Program.

12.            Originally, implementation of activities was limited to the ten selected states. Once
      successfully piloted and refined through implementation, the Project could be scaled up to reach a
      broader group of beneficiaries in the social sector. Furthermore, additional states would be added
      only after appropriate diagnostic work, similar to what was carried out for the original ten states,
      had been completed. However, shortly after the Project became effective, the GOM decided to
      quickly expand the coverage of the Program with its own funds. Since incorporation of new states
      required prior environmental and social evaluations, and these were completed, the Bank
      identified this rapid expansion of the Program as highly risky and declined the Government’s
      request to finance part of this expansion from the Loan. After 2006, the Government reduced the
      Program from 30 states to 15 states in 2007, 12 in 2008, and 8 in 2009. These reductions were
      done in order to prioritize the accumulated pipeline of productive subproject requests.

13.           Implementation arrangements. During the first two years (2006-2007), the Project was
      implemented through the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform (SRA), with the assistance of
      FIFONAFE. Technical assistance to beneficiaries was provided by FIFONAFE and private
      contractors. Loans for land acquisition were channeled through FIFONAFE. Starting in 2007,
      Government engaged FR as financing agent to replace FIFONAFE to channel its own resources




                                                       4
      to offer loans for land acquisition and productive subprojects to Program beneficiaries.
      FIFONAFE’s responsibility was then to supervise the 2004-2006 portafolio.

14.            Reallocation of loan funds. At the request of the Borrower, loan proceeds were
      reallocated among categories twice, in November 2007 and August 2008. The first reallocation of
      funds in the amount of US$6 million was to respond to a faster implementation of Project
      activities related to the financing of productive subprojects (Component 2). This consisted of an
      increase in the allocation to Category 4 (grants for productive subprojects) by transferring funds
      from Category 5 (unallocated). The second reallocation of funds in the amount of US$7 million
      consisted of increasing the allocation to Category 4 by transferring the funds from Category 1
      (demonstration subprojects grants, subproject preparation TA grants, goods, consultants’ services,
      training, non-consultant services and operational costs).

      2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

      2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15.           Soundness of the background analysis. Project preparation benefitted from a body of
      analytical work carried out by the Bank in Mexico, including: (i) a 2001 Land Policy study; (ii)
      an international conference held in December 2003 to review experiences with access to land in
      different countries; (iii) a 2004 technical study based on field work in selected ejidos and
      indigenous communities to better understand barriers to functioning land markets and incentives
      for improving access to land; (iv) a review of rural poverty in Mexico as part of a programmatic
      study carried out under the 2005-2008 CPS; and (v) reviews of the national agrarian legal
      framework carried out by consultants financed by a project preparation grant. Several preparatory
      studies were also carried out, including a baseline survey, a 2001 land market diagnostic (done by
      SRA), and case studies to assess the willingness of senior ejidatarios to sell their land and that of
      young ejidatarios to buy land to develop a productive activity. The considerable amount of
      background analysis provided a solid justification for Bank support for the PJERFT Program.

16.            Assessment of project design. Projects involving access to land are inherently complex.
      Although some lessons from other similar projects in the Region were incorporated (e.g., land
      acquisition is better handled through loans, supported by strong technical assistance and
      complementary investment funds through matching grants), not all of the key practical lessons
      could be built into Project design. The PJERFT Program was launched based on the Operation
      Rules for 2005 before the Project was appraised in mid-2005.7

17.          Mexico is a sophisticated client with firm rules and institutional processes for
      implementing its own federal programs. Moreover, in Mexico, financing from a Bank loan is
      “non-additional” to the implementing agency’s budget, which is determined by the Mexican
      Congress. The Project design introduced as many modifications upfront as was possible. It was

      7
        Programs in Mexico operate under Operation Rules (Reglas de Operación), which are approved every
      year by the Ministry of Finance, validated by COFEMER (Comisión Federal de Mejora Regulatoria) and
      published in the Official Gazette. The Operation Rules determine the general principles under which the
      Program operates. Agreement was reached at appraisal with the GOM to begin the Bank-assisted operation
      on the basis of the Operation Rules published on February 18, 2005, but to include further improvements
      resulting from Project preparation into the Operation Rules for 2006. It was also agreed that, given the pilot
      nature of the Project, the Operation Rules would be improved every year (2006-2009) to further include
      lessons learned during Project implementation (see later sections).



                                                            5
      agreed that further adjustments would be introduced during the implementation phase through
      changes in the Operation Rules of the Program, following a “learning and improving by doing”
      approach (see Section 2.2 below for more details about changes to Operation Rules).

18.            Project design issues. Overall, considering the restrictions mentioned above and the
      flexibility introduced to address them, Project design was sound. However, it underestimated
      some aspects and presented some deficiencies:

      •   Project design focused heavily on ensuring access to land with a view to promoting a more
          dynamic land market within the social sector and facilitating the intergenerational transfer of
          land among rural producers. However, developing a credit culture in poor rural areas in
          Mexico proved to be very difficult. At appraisal more attention should have been given to the
          financial and economic aspects of the Project, particularly those related to the promotion of
          entrepreneurship by young farmers. Several challenges were underestimated: (i) the time
          required for productive projects to become viable, considering the high cost of land in
          Mexico; (ii) the difficulty of delivering and monitoring effective technical assistance and
          training; (iii) the identification of productive chains; (iv) the ability of FIFONAFE to follow
          up and monitor subproject implementation, including the recovery of loans; and (v) the
          restrictions imposed by agrarian legislation.

      •   Project design did not sufficiently emphasize the focus on piloting and learning by clearly
          defining key indicators that would measure success in piloting the new program. Rather, the
          Project supported more general indicators related to the viability of productive subprojects.

19.            Objectives and components. The overall thrust of the PDO was to establish a
      mechanism for beneficiary-driven and efficient land transactions. Emphasis was on piloting the
      “establishment” of a mechanism for accessing productive assets, including land. However, in
      practice, the Project paid more attention to the establishment of “niche” (i.e., difficult to replicate
      on a large scale) capital-intensive agro-enterprises.

20.           Institutional arrangements and capacity. The weak institutional capacity to implement
      the Project was flagged since appraisal. The institutional assessment at the time noted that there
      were risks in working with FIFONAFE, an entity regulated by the agrarian legislation, especially
      with regard to its ability to appraise productive subprojects and to eventually collect loan
      repayments.

21.           The Project called for the participation of collaborating partner organizations and private
      service providers in order to complement Project activities. Furthermore, it was agreed that over
      time more experienced financial service providers would be brought on board. The eventual
      participation of FR thus was considered desirable at the time.

22.            That said, the advantages of working with FR may have been overestimated. Although it
      is a stronger financial institution than FIFONAFE, it was a relatively new rural financial
      institution, with limited experience in lending to the social sector. Also, the financial terms
      offered by FR to Program beneficiaries starting in 2007 were less favorable than those offered by
      FIFONAFE during 2004 to 2006. The main advantage of channeling resources through FR was
      that it had a more rigorous subproject appraisal process that would allow successful young
      farmers to develop a credible credit history with FR.




                                                        6
23.           The design also underestimated the lack of capacity on the part of SRA. It also lacked
      prior experience in working with Bank-financed projects in general and in particular in promoting
      innovative productive subprojects to be financed through loans.8

24.           Adequacy of Government commitment. Government commitment to the Program was
      very strong during preparation and continued through implementation.

25.           Assessment of risks. The appraisal correctly identified eight critical risks, three of which
      were rated as high and five as medium. Several of these risks materialized during implementation,
      including: (i) limited viability of some productive subprojects; (ii) unwillingness of farmers to
      pay back loans; and (iii) SRA’s and FIFONAFE’s weak capacity to implement the Project.
      Although some mitigation measures were incorporated at the design stage, the most important
      mitigation measures were to be implemented through changes in the Program’s Operation Rules
      during Project implementation. However, the Bank’s leverage to mitigate risks in a MIC country
      like Mexico was overestimated, and, as discussed in more detail in the next section, not all
      suggested changes were incorporated. In addition, two other factors that worked against Project
      success were not properly assessed as risky:

      •   Change in the Government’s strategy and long-term commitment to the Project. The Program
          was prematurely expanded to many more states, despite a strong recommendation by the
          Bank to the contrary. This compromised the supervision capacity of the implementing
          agencies and the pilot character of the Project, and clearly had negative effects on the quality
          of subproject selection, training and technical assistance.

      •   The internal pressure within SRA to disburse its annual federal allocation. Since its
          inception, the PJERFT Program was conceived as a public policy tool to fight poverty. Funds
          allocated annually to the SRA for the Program had to be fully used. This pressure prompted
          FIFONAFE and SRA, particularly in the early years, to finance productive subproject
          proposals of questionable viability. In hindsight, Project design could have better assessed the
          potential impact of the GOM’s annual budget planning process on the productive subproject
          cycle which typically took longer than one year.

26.            Quality at Entry. The Project had two Quality at Entry reviews. The first review was
      part of the Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP-1 in September 2008) and it rated the
      overall quality of design as unsatisfactory, based on the following considerations: (i) the Project
      was too ambitious in scale and complicated in design; (ii) the preparation team accepted an
      ongoing Government program in the expectation that changes to the Operation Rules would be
      introduced during Project implementation; and (iii) the institutions chosen to run the Project were
      weak and lacked experience and expertise, especially in rural credit.

27.           The second review took place in January 2009 and it modified the rating for the overall
      quality of design to moderately unsatisfactory after a detailed examination of the comments
      provided by the task team on the first panel’s assessment. Specifically, the second panel agreed
      with the team that: (i) even though the Project may inevitably have contained a certain degree of
      complexity as a land project, it was precisely this type of intervention that the GOM valued from
      the Bank; (ii) lessons from international best practice were partially introduced into the design;


      8
        The initiatives supported by the SRA up to that point were based purely on the provision of grants to
      groups of landless producers.



                                                           7
            (iii) the Project design introduced as many modifications up-front as could be acceptable to the
            Government; (iv) the Project adopted a “learning and improving by doing” approach; (v) neither a
            LIL nor an APL were feasible at the time of approval; and (vi) benefits should have been derived
            from the substantial modifications to the Operation Rules introduced over the life of the Project,
            although it was too early to see results on the ground.

28.                  The second panel’s moderately unsatisfactory rating for design was influenced by three
            factors: (i) it should have been apparent from prior Bank experience that the terms and conditions
            under which the subprojects were being approved were unlikely to ensure their sustainability; (ii)
            the failure to specify piloting meant that attention was focused on experimenting with an
            approach and a process, and on strengthening SRA's capacity, rather than on implementing the
            training programs and productive subprojects; and (iii) even though the risk analysis correctly
            anticipated many of the issues encountered during implementation, the remedial actions proved to
            be ineffective.

            2.2 Implementation

29.                  Aware of the shortcomings of the original Government Program, in mid-2006 the Bank,
            jointly with FAO, supported an economic, financial and social analysis of a sample of productive
            subprojects financed under the PJERFT Program during 2004-2006. The analysis revealed several
            problems: (i) training and technical assistance to young farmers were not adequate; (ii) the
            selection of potential young entrepreneurs and subprojects did not follow rigorous criteria and
            processes; (iii) the loan versus subsidy ratio needed to be more flexible; and (iv) more flexibility
            also was required for accessing land (other than purchase and rental). The analysis further
            emphasized the need to complete testing of methodologies before scaling up the Program to the
            entire country. The batch of subprojects that was analyzed had been approved under the 2004 and
            2005 Operation Rules. The financial performance of many of these productive subprojects
            (evaluated after 1 or 2 years of operation) was found to be unsatisfactory: only about 27 percent
            of the 2004-06 subprojects had positive economic returns; 23 percent were no longer operating,
            and the remaining half had negative returns.

      30.           Changes in the Operation Rules of the Program. The findings of the Bank-FAO-
            financed analysis and supervision missions formed the basis for a number of recommendations
            that led to some improvements in the Program’s Operation Rules. At the time of Project
            effectiveness (January 2006), the Program rules had already incorporated some recommendations
            that had been made by the joint Bank-FAO team during Project preparation. Additional changes
            were introduced in the 2007 Operation Rules as a result of Bank engagement, which significantly
            improved the operation of the Program. The most relevant were:

            (i)                Modification of the terms of the financial support provided by the Program,
                    balancing subsidies with loans, to help to change the perception that the social sector could
                    only survive with 100 percent subsidies;

            (ii)    Introduction of more options for accessing land, other than purchase or rental, with the aim
                    of promoting other non monetary access mechanisms and thereby increasing in the short
                    and medium term the viability of productive subprojects;

            (iii)               Inclusion of a preliminary phase (“etapa A”) to nurture entrepreneurial talent in
                    Proyectos Escuela, through more targeted training aimed at providing young farmers with
                    relevant information for the selection of productive activities;



                                                              8
      (iv)               Introduction of the concept of business promoters to provide better technical
             assistance (although in practice this was not implemented);

      (v)              Introduction of an environmental screening step in the Project cycle (also not
             implemented as intended in the Operation Rules); and

      (vi)              Promotion of innovative mechanisms to ensure access by the indigenous
             population to land.

      Additional recommendations were made by the Bank-FAO team to improve the 2008 and 2009
      Operation Rules, the most important of which included:

      (i)    Maintaining the pilot nature of the Program, but avoiding “focalization” on marginalized
             ejidos, as chances for successful productive subprojects are lower;

      (ii)   Clarifying the main activities of the different phases of the Program;

      (iii) Providing training based on existing business opportunities in the micro-regions (although
            in practice this was not implemented);

      (iv)   Clarifying that selection of subprojects should be based on their viability, including
             targeting specific markets for their products (although in practice this was not
             implemented);

      (v)    Modifying the financial terms of loans, to include longer repayments periods, especially for
             the acquisition of land; however, FR did not accept this recommendation, even though
             loans were 100 percent guaranteed by SRA;

      (vi)   Reducing overall Program benefits to make it more sustainable; and

      (vii) Lowering the threshold for financing land purchases from MX$175,000 to not higher than
            MX$90,000 per loan and per beneficiary.

31.            Recommended changes were partially incorporated. The process of changing the
      Program’s Operation Rules during Project implementation proved to be much more complicated
      than anticipated at appraisal, considering the legal nature of the Rules. This helps explain why
      Project restructuring, despite repeated attempts, was not undertaken.

32.            The 2009 Operation Rules modified the stated objectives of the Program, placing more
      emphasis on agro-enterprise development and essentially eliminating the objective of transferring
      lands. This modification, which in effect simply reflected what had been occurring on the ground,
      exemplified the difficulty of making the current Program’s objectives and practice compatible
      with the Project’s stated PDO. Eventually, this incompatibility led to the cancellation of the loan
      (see following section).
      Major Factors Affecting Project Implementation

33.           Despite the inclusion of important changes in the 2007 and 2008 Operation Rules, the
      Project suffered from a number of limitations during implementation.

34.           Weak strategy and political imperatives. The Program did not have a consistent
      strategy to encourage viable land transfers and productive subprojects. The decision to


                                                        9
      dramatically expand the Program in 2006 compromised the supervision and monitoring capacities
      of the SRA; the quality of Project implementation, particularly the identification of viable
      business opportunities; and the pilot nature of the Program. In 2007, the Government scaled back
      the Program, prioritized activities in micro-regions where other programs were operating, and
      increased the emphasis on productive chains and marketing alliances.9 However, although the
      number of states in which the Program was operating diminished, the number of training projects
      (proyectos escuela) and productive subprojects increased significantly in 2007 and 2008. In 2009,
      the Program’s approach shifted again toward targeting the most marginalized municipalities, with
      little emphasis on the productive potential of subprojects. The external evaluation from 2008 and
      2009 in fact showed that in the more marginalized areas, the success rate of productive projects
      was substantially lower.

35.           Weak institutional capacity. Despite Project efforts, the weaknesses in technical,
      organizational and management aspects of Project execution (M&E, appraisal and supervision of
      subprojects, provision of technical assistance, etc.) continued. The incorporation of FR improved
      Program implementation and supported SRA and FIFONAFE in relation to the selection of
      productive subprojects. The leadership of the Program also suffered from instability. There were
      four Program Directors between 2005 to 2009, and several key technical staff were changed
      regularly. Further, there was little coordination between the Program’s implementing agencies
      and other institutions working on related initiatives.

36.            Shortcomings in the identification of beneficiaries and inadequate technical
      assistance. Throughout the life of the Project, the incentives for promoters and technical
      assistance providers were such that they aimed at maximizing the number of participants in the
      training program, rather than evaluating and screening them. During the initial phase, the
      Program hired a single consultant firm for the design and development of the training phase
      (Proyecto Escuela), which featured the same business model in all participating ejidos. Starting
      from 2006, the training offer was diversified, and efforts to improve the quality in the selection of
      technical assistance service providers were made, through certification of individual consultants.
      However, the services of many of the training and technical assistance providers were not
      satisfactory, in that they often focused on limited technological skills not always adequate to
      carry out the selected activities. In those cases where the training responded to expectations
      (including transferring administrative and commercialization skills), there was no follow up in the
      subsequent phase (access to land and development of a productive project). As a result, very few
      young farmers were able to set up satisfactory administrative systems. The business promoters
      mentioned in the Operations Rules were never hired to assist beneficiaries.

37.           Poor quality of productive subprojects. In the first three years, the combination of
      weak institutional capacity and rapid expansion led to poor quality of subprojects. For example,
      by 2008, some 23 percent of subprojects were no longer operating. The Program’s response to
      these dismal rates was to promote the formation of young farmers’ committees (Comité de
      Jóvenes). However, this mechanism did not work as the majority of beneficiaries preferred family
      enterprises.

38.           Loan recoveries.10 Starting in late 2006, different interpretations by Government entities
      regarding the recoverability of loans financed under the Program created a climate of uncertainty.
      9
           For example, the Program reached an agreement with CONAFOR to set-up tree nurseries.

      10
           The Government has submitted a detailed analysis on this subject and it is presented in full in Annex 7.



                                                             10
      One the one hand, the Loan Agreement between the Borrower and the Bank stated that Project
      funds for land acquisition were to be financed through loans given to beneficiaries. This
      agreement was clearly reflected in the Operation Rules of the Program for those years (approved
      by the Ministry of Finance); FIFONAFE’s actions in 2004-2006 were guided by the Loan
      Agreement and the Program Operation Rules. On the other hand, in December 2008, the Ministry
      of Finance issued a legal opinion stating that FIFONAFE could not recover funds from
      beneficiaries since these resources had been disbursed under a “subsidy” line item in the budget.
      In May 2009, the Bank informed the Borrower that if Project implementing agencies acted upon
      said legal opinion, the Bank would be forced to declare the funds already disbursed as ineligible
      and suspend further disbursements from the Loan. To the Bank’s knowledge, FIFONAFE did not
      act upon this legal opinion. Nevertheless, this ambiguity weakened FIFONAFE’s ability to
      recover the loans it originated between 2004 and 2006.

39.           Ultimately, the changes to the Operation Rules failed to address the most
      fundamental causes of the Program’s poor performance. The adjustments made to the
      Operation Rules in the course of Project implementation failed to address the most fundamental
      shortcomings of the Program, namely, the overall very high cost per beneficiary11, rigid rules
      which discouraged savings and efficiency, geographical dispersion, weak implementation
      capacity, and weak follow-up to investment subprojects.

40.            Cancellation of loan funds.12 Over time the Program evolved in a direction that departed
      from the original PDO established for the Project and focused more on establishing “niche”
      capital-intensive agro-enterprises and less on the original intent of establishing and consolidating
      an effective mechanism for land transfers. Moreover, although some cost reductions were made,
      the Program continued to be very expensive, with high debt-to-equity ratios for beneficiaries, and
      with limited prospects for sustainable scaling up. The Government and the Bank sought ways to
      realign the original Project intent to the evolution of the national Program. In the end, the
      Government decided to continue with the Program without further Bank support, and on
      December 17, 2009, the Borrower requested the Bank to cancel the undisbursed loan balance of
      US$46.6 million. The Program continues its implementation following the 2010 Operations Rules
      with 100 percent Government funding.

      2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.           Given the Project’s pilot nature, an effective monitoring and evaluation system for
      capturing lessons learned was critical. The PAD underscored its importance. However, an
      effective M&E system was never consolidated. SRA and FIFONAFE maintained separate and
      incompatible databases. Although at the Mid-Term Review in mid-2008, an agreement was
      reached to improve the Project’s M&E, this was not done. Although it is recognized that with its
      own resources FR made important contributions with to the Program’s implementation, it
      maintained a separate database and did not always provide critical Program information.


      11
        The Bank notes that in its comments to this ICR, the GOM has expressed its disagreement with this
      assertion.

      12
           The Government has submitted a detailed analysis on this subject and it is presented in full in Annex 7.




                                                             11
42.             In early supervision it became clear that SRA did not have the capacity to establish an
      effective M&E system to capture lessons learned from Project implementation in a timely
      fashion. As a result, the Bank developed a complementary monitoring strategy. Specifically, the
      Bank financed an evaluation of the Project’s results for the time period prior to the Bank’s
      involvement. This first joint Bank-FAO evaluation was done in the first part of 2006, five months
      after the Project was declared effective, and looked at a sample of “mature” subprojects (i.e.,
      those that had implemented the Proyecto Escuela according to the 2004 Operation Rules). This
      study provided quantitative and qualitative data on productive subproject performance and the
      first set of recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the 2007 Operation Rules. In
      2008 and 2009, SRA contracted FAO to carry out additional external evaluation studies, which
      provided data on: (i) the viability of the productive subprojects; (ii) recovery rates of FIFONAFE
      loans; and (iii) the level of capacity acquired by the beneficiaries.

43.            The Bank’s insistence on improved monitoring of Project activities, combined with the
      results of the joint Bank-FAO studies, resulted in the Government’s increase of the Program’s
      operational budget (from 3 to 7 percent in 2008) allowing for improved monitoring and
      supervision.

      2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

44.           Environment. The Project had an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) and a
      Pest Management Plan (PMP). The EMF set forth procedures to promote sound environmental
      management of subprojects, through the screening of potential subproject activities and lands, and
      through the application of a variety of environmental management tools (including maps of
      environmentally sensitive areas and standardized environmental management plans for typical
      subprojects). The PMP included allowable pesticides and measures to ensure their safe use.

45.      The EMF was a useful screening tool to identify the environmentally riskiest subprojects.
      Results of the initial screening were used to assess eligibility for financing. However, the overall
      Project environmental management was less successful, given weak implementation capacity on
      the part of SRA and FR. Lack of continuity in environmental staff at SRA precluded adequate
      attention to environmental aspects during the pre-screening of Proyectos Escuela and productive
      subprojects after 2007. FIFONAFE had been somewhat more effective in implementing the
      Project environmental safeguards provisions. Implementation of the PMP was less successful in
      all cases. One particularly weak point related to the provision of technical assistance to Project
      beneficiaries. Beneficiaries were taking on new activities for which they required ongoing
      support, particularly after one or more years of implementation. This was particularly true for pest
      management issues, which tend only to become apparent after a few years of cropping.

46.            Overall, despite these deficiencies, the Project was not found to lead to significant
      environmental impacts. Subprojects were small in scale, and, while the Project was rolled out in
      several states, the total area of land affected was still quite limited. While the types of subprojects
      supported by the Project were not all sustainable in the long-term (including particularly more
      extensive cattle ranching), there was a trend to move toward more sustainable activities as the
      Project was implemented. Overall, Project environmental management could have been improved
      through a more concerted institutional capacity building effort and through better inter-
      institutional coordination.

47.      Social. The design of the Project was based on an analysis of rural institutions and land
      markets in Mexico, which fully took into account the particularities of indigenous communal land
      tenure. An Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) and an outreach strategy were prepared


                                                        12
      to ensure the Project engaged indigenous beneficiaries. Attention was paid to putting in place
      mechanisms to ensure that land transfers within indigenous communities were approved by
      traditional community decision-making bodies and that land was retained in the hands of
      community members rather than transferred to outsiders. The Program’s application form
      comprised a set of questions to identify indigenous beneficiaries based on national regulations
      that were compatible with Bank’s criteria. Training incorporated an indigenous native speaker or
      translator in 39 percent of indigenous ejidos.

48.            During the Mid-Term Review in June 2008, an evaluation of Project compliance with
      safeguards requirements highlighted the need to improve implementation of the IPDP, since the
      Project had begun working in indigenous areas. Specific recommendations to improve such
      implementation included: (i) updating the social assessment and the IPDP; (ii) incorporating a
      social specialist within SRA to monitor Indigenous Peoples’ participation; and (iii) improving
      training materials to be culturally compatible with the indigenous population and training
      promoters to better respond to this population. In 2009, following a Bank recommendation, a
      social scientist was hired to support and monitor IPDP implementation.

49.           Given the weaknesses of the Project’s M&E system, in 2009 the Bank carried out an
      evaluation to assess Project compliance with Bank safeguards in five states with a high
      percentage of indigenous population. The results indicated that overall the Project had a positive
      impact on the participating indigenous population (see section 3.5 below).

50.           Financial Management. Overall, Project management systems and controls in place
      were judged reasonably adequate and reliable for managing and monitoring the Project. SRA
      complied with most of the Bank’s financial management (FM) requirements and provided
      adequate implementation support and oversight, contributing to the moderately satisfactory
      financial management of the Project. NAFIN provided implementation support and oversight
      based on its many years of experience with Bank-financed projects, maintaining adequate records
      and accounts to reflect the Project’s operations and financial condition.

51.             The Project was audited by the SRA Internal Control Unit on an annual basis, which
      issued an unqualified (clean) opinion on financial statements corresponding to the calendar year
      2008. However, some issues were identified by both the auditors and the Bank’s FM team,
      including: (i) expenditures incurred by the Program which were not eligible, amounting
      approximately to US$25 million; (ii) deficiencies in the integration of eligible expenditures for
      approximately US$47 million; and (iii) other irregularities in subprojects financed by the
      Program. The last reimbursement process for the Project was in December 2007. In November
      2009, the auditors confirmed that most of these issues had been clarified, including validation of
      eligibility of additional expenditures in the amount of US$25 million (MX$33.4 million) which
      were submitted for re-documentation by NAFIN to the Bank on August 10, 2009.

52.      Based on the results of the last FM mission (November 2009), the team confirmed the
      moderately satisfactory rating, as moderate shortcomings in FM existed but did not prevent
      timely and reliable provision of information required to manage and monitor the implementation
      of the Project. The Project’s FM risk was substantial.

53.      Procurement. Three ex-post reviews of procurement activities related to the Project were
      conducted during the course of Project implementation. The findings of these reviews indicated
      that procurement agreements suffered from delays mainly due to constant changes in the
      implementing team within SRA and the decision of the Federal Government that took office at
      the end of 2006 to issue a decree that restricted the budget and limited procurement of goods and


                                                     13
      other expenses. Resources originally allocated to support the PCU and other activities in support
      of the Project were not used and had to be cancelled.

      2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

54.            The Government Program continues to be operated under the responsibility of SRA. For
      2010, a budget of about MX$460 million was allocated to target about 4,000 beneficiaries
      through Proyectos Escuela and productive subprojects. The Program continues to evolve along
      the lines established in the Operation Rules, with a primary focus on establishing niche agro-
      enterprises in selected ejidos. Some of the Bank-FAO operational recommendations are being
      considered, including: (i) the need to identify viable productive activities and productive chains;
      (ii) improved coordination with FR in particular with regard to the selection process; and (iii)
      improved quality of technical assistance. However, the fundamental issues of high cost per
      beneficiary (thereby limiting the scalability of the Program) and rigid financing parameters which
      discourage reallocation of Program benefits according to need were not addressed. In its
      comments to this ICR, the GOM has noted that the transfer of lands is no longer a key objective
      to the Program.

      3. Assessment of Outcomes

      3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

55.           The main Project objective was and remains highly relevant for Mexico. Establishing a
      participatory, demand-driven, and cost-effective land transfer mechanism in the social sector is
      fundamental for the future growth of this sector. However, the central objective of the
      Government’s PJERFT Program gradually diverged from these objectives and now focuses
      almost exclusively on replicating geographically-dispersed “niche” capital-intensive agro-
      enterprises. The current Program has little prospect of transferring sizable amounts of land from
      senior landholders to young rural entrepreneurs. Accordingly, as noted above in late 2009, the
      Government decided to continue the Program without Bank support and requested the Bank to
      cancel the Loan’s undisbursed funds.

56.           Regarding the secondary Project objective, facilitating the access of senior landholders to
      social welfare services, this was a high priority for the Government at the time of Project
      preparation. Although the Bank considered more appropriate to deal with the development of a
      revised pension system as a separate program, at appraisal, it was agreed that the Project would
      acknowledge the importance of including a parallel safety net for those senior landholders who
      agreed to participate in the Program. These activities were to be financed entirely through
      counterpart funds. Over time, however, it became clear that there was little demand for these
      services among the senior landholder population and, thus, this objective was essentially dropped.

57.           A social assessment carried out in 2006 by a Bank-FAO team revealed that there were no
      takers for the social welfare schemes supported by the Program and that older ejidatarios were
      investing the proceeds from the their land sale in their health, their children’s productive projects,
      or other initiatives that could provide higher returns than the ones offered by the Government
      pension programs. In 2009, the Bank carried out a brief study to assess the situation of older
      ejidatarios that participated in the Project; the study confirmed that no senior ejidatarios took
      advantage of the proposed pension scheme, given that very few fulfilled the requirement
      necessary to be part of the Government welfare program. The study further indicated that the
      Project had no negative impact on senior landholders’ welfare: in 63 percent of the cases their


                                                       14
      income remained the same, while 23 percent registered an increase as a result of investments
      made with proceeds from the sale. For another 23 percent their income slightly decreased, while
      only 8 percent suffered a loss in assets. Support to senior landholders was eliminated in the
      Program 2008 Operation Rules.

      3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

58.            The Project made limited progress in establishing a beneficiary-driven efficient land
      transaction model. However, the Project supported the access of young rural entrepreneurs to
      training, some land, and to other productive assets (capital and technology). More than 11,000
      young farmers benefited from the training phase and about 4,500 benefited from financial
      resources to buy or rent land and develop a productive project (about 88 percent and 75 percent of
      appraisal targets, respectively). However, since there was no baseline, it is not possible to
      calculate the increase in beneficiary incomes. Instead, the Program carried out surveys to measure
      the life span 13 and profitability of productive subprojects at different periods in time. The survey
      data showed that only 77 percent of the productive subprojects developed during 2004-2006 were
      still operating in 2008, and 50 percent of these were not providing positive economic returns. The
      Project achieved some intergenerational transfer of land, given that 80 percent of land
      transactions were characterized by an age difference between the buyer and the seller of at least
      20 years.

59.           Access to land mechanisms. The different models of access to land promoted by the
      Project have allowed for testing of the advantages and limitations of the various approaches, in a
      context where there was no previous experience with such mechanisms in Mexico. For example,
      rental of land has turned out to be more appropriate than purchase for establishment of a
      greenhouse, given that it allows for the use of only the necessary portion of land (the Agrarian
      Law does not allow for parcels in ejidos to be subdivided). The purchase of land for the
      development of this activity caused young farmers to borrow too much, given that they had to
      buy more land than they needed.

60.            Financing mechanisms. Given the lack of formal credit lines in Mexico that allow for
      long-term financing of investments in the social sector, the Project put a lot of effort into
      identifying financing mechanisms and adjusting them to the specificities of starting a productive
      activity in the Mexican ejidos and communities. However, a suitable mechanism that fully
      responded to the needs of the social sector was not developed. In a first phase, FIFONAFE
      offered long-term loans with interest rates that were almost a third of commercial rates, but it was
      not the type of financial organization with the needed capacity to expand the Program. With the
      introduction in 2007 of FR, a rural development bank, the financial terms offered to the young
      beneficiaries of the social sector were no more favorable than those offered to other clients. The
      fact that community and ejido lands cannot be used as collateral was a major factor in the
      inability of FR to offer financial products more in line with the needs of Project beneficiaries. As
      a result, the more successful young farmers were those that had access to parallel sources of
      financing, mostly in the form of subsidy or subsidized loans, from other Government programs.

61.           Repayment of loans by beneficiaries. The repayment rate of loans made by FIFONAFE
      to Project beneficiaries during the 2004-2006 period (for land and productive subprojects) has
      been lower than expected. The overall repayment rate was 45 percent in 2007 and it dropped to


      13
         This indicator is important because it shows the interest that young people have in continuing working in
      their farm.


                                                          15
      33 percent in 2008 due mainly to the de-capitalization in 2007 of the newly formed agro-
      enterprises. Sanctions were applied on delinquent loans.

62.            The Project’s approach, in the first years of implementation, to access land through the
      purchase of use rights undermined the viability of productive subprojects and ultimately the
      capacity of young farmers to repay their loans.14 Between 2004 and 2006, 70 percent of
      beneficiaries opted for the purchase of land and but often had to buy more land than necessary
      due to the legal restriction on subdividing parcels in the social sector.

63.           Starting in 2007, when more flexibility in accessing land was introduced and land rentals
      were encouraged, average loan amounts for buying land decreased by 78 percent (see Table 1).
      This change, coupled with increased financial support for productive subprojects rather than for
      accessing land15 and a more rigorous subproject selection carried out by FR, contributed to
      improving the viability of productive subprojects. According to unofficial estimates, in 2008 and
      2009 the repayment rates for loans made by FR were somewhat higher than in previous years;
      however, data from FR are not available for the following years, when issues of de-capitalization
      of newly established businesses usually start to emerge16.




64.           Average cost per beneficiary17. The Project’s average cost per beneficiary changed
      annually with each new set of Operation Rules, in which revised amounts and thresholds for both
      loans and subsidies were established. The beginning of the Government Program (2004-2006)
      saw a steady increase in the cost per beneficiary, from about MX$219,000 in 2004 (about
      US$20,000 per beneficiary) to about MX$350,000 in 2006 (about US$33,000), an increase of
      about 60 percent. From 2007 onwards, average costs started to decrease and in 2009 they were
      back at 2004 levels, due to: (i) lower levels of investment for the purchase of land; and (ii) better
      cost assessments for the implementation of subprojects (Table 2 shows total Program costs by
      component and per beneficiary).


                           Table 1) Costs of Access to land by modality (MXN pesos)


      14
         In order to access the funds for productive subprojects, a young famer had to buy or rent land; the
      purchase of land was accompanied by higher percentage of subsidies for the development of the productive
      subproject than the rental of land.

      15
         In the first phase (2004-2006), loans amounted to up to 150,000 pesos for the development of the
      productive subproject; 250,000 pesos for the purchase of land; and 27,000 pesos for the rental of land. In
      the second phase of Program implementation (from 2007 onwards), loans amounted to up to 175,000 pesos
      for the purchase of land, 225,000 pesos for the productive subproject; and 54,000 pesos for the rental of
      land.

      16
        In its comments to this ICR, the GOM has noted that these issues were highlighted as risky during
      Project design.

      17
           These estimates and those presented in Table 3 have not been confirmed by GOM.

      3.3 Efficiency

65.            One important dimension of the Project Development Objective was the cost-
      effectiveness of the land transfer mechanism piloted. In this regard, the Project proved to be much
      more expensive than comparable programs in other countries in the Region, as shown in Table 3
      below. Whereas the Cédula da Terra / Crédito Fundiário program in Brazil, another large,
      middle-income country, had an average cost per beneficiary family of US$8,047 (including land
      acquisition and productive investments), the Project had a per beneficiary cost that increased from
      about US$20,000 in 2004 to US$33,000 in 2006 (the last year of financing by the World Bank
      loan) and went down to about US$18,000 in 2009. Similar programs in Guatemala and Honduras
      also had much lower costs. Moreover, the costs of acquiring land under the Project, both in terms
      of per hectare and per beneficiary, were also much higher than in the other countries.

      3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

      Rating: Unsatisfactory

66.            Overall, the Project did not achieve its main objective of establishing a beneficiary-driven
      efficient land transaction model in the ejido sector. Although a mechanism for land transactions
      was established, it is only partially beneficiary-driven and it is not efficient. Also, despite the fact
      that a high percentage of Project beneficiaries received training and financial resources, the
      sustainability of many of the financed enterprises is questionable. Reliable data to demonstrate
      the impact on incomes by Project beneficiaries are lacking; a baseline (for beneficiaries supported
      in 2007 and 2008) was only established in 2009. The GOM has also noted that the Program
      attempted to encourage a culture of borrowing in the ejido sector. The existing Program
      evaluations indicate that average profitability of the subprojects (financed during the 2004-2006
      period) is negative, while data on the viability of subprojects financed in 2007 and 2008 are not
      yet available. Data on the low rate of loan repayments corroborate these results and the
      difficulties encountered by young entrepreneurs in operating their new businesses. On the other
      hand, the Project has served as a valuable tool to test for the first time land redistribution
      mechanisms in the Mexican social sector and this has yielded important lessons discussed below.

      3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development




                                                        18
67.           Beneficiaries. By and large, the Project reached its intended beneficiaries. The farmers
      benefited by the Project were on average 31 years old with a secondary level of education.
      Younger, single, beneficiaries (from 18 to 30 years of age) somewhat self-excluded from the
      Program once they reached the second phase, given that the development of a productive activity
      did not appear as attractive to them as to those with a family. The participation of women was on
      average more than 40 percent, although it varied from year to year.

68.      Indigenous Peoples. Of the 10,448 Program beneficiaries from 2004 to 2008, indigenous
      beneficiaries represented almost 12 percent (1,238). During 2007-2008, the Program financed 856
      agro-businesses, of which 103 belonged to indigenous beneficiaries (12 percent). One of the first
      and most successful productive subprojects was actually in Acatlán de Alvarez, an indigenous
      community in the state of Guerrero.

69.           The 2009 study on indigenous beneficiaries carried out by the Bank found that:

      •   All applicants received adequate support to access to land (27 percent through purchase and
          73 percent through rental). No agrarian conflicts emerged as a result;
      •   All Projects proposals (79) except one were rated as viable and obtained financing; 90
          percent received technical assistance;
      •   After three years, 74 percent of beneficiaries under the Program were still operating a
          productive subproject: 16 percent were working very well, 51 percent regularly and 33
          percent were facing some difficulties;
      •   The Project represented a viable alternative to migration.

      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

70.            Overall, institutional development is assessed as modest. The Project was not able to
      significantly affect institutional capacity and coordination in the sector. Limited institutional
      strengthening occurred in the Program through the inclusion of FR in the selection process of
      viable productive activities. The Project also had a somewhat positive impact on internal
      coordination between the SRA at the central level and its state-level offices, which were involved
      since the beginning in the supervision of all phases of Project implementation.

71.           The Project achieved mixed results in terms of fostering coordination with state
      governments and municipalities. In a few cases, the states in which the Project was being
      implemented demonstrated willingness to support the productive subprojects with additional
      resources. However, for the most part, coordination with the municipalities fell short of
      expectations, given that the multitude of stakeholders at this level made it difficult to define an
      adequate outreach strategy, without generating conflicts regarding access to the Project’s benefits.

      (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

72.             The evaluations carried out by FAO-Mexico, including case studies, showed that in many
      cases the fact that women obtained support from the Program created an incentive for their
      spouses who had migrated to the United States to come back and participate in the productive
      activity.

73.           In some cases, young farmers promoted innovative organizational schemes, including
      small cooperatives for distribution activities or other arrangements that allowed them to maintain


                                                      19
      their autonomy in the production phase while sharing some equipment for the transformation and
      sale of the products. These successful ways of organizing the work are a good practice example
      for other farmers of the same ejido.

      Not available.

      4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

      Rating: Significant

74.           The sustainability of a significant proportion (perhaps 50 percent or more) of the
      productive activities supported by the Project is questionable. Important improvements regarding
      the design, selection, and management of subprojects remain to be achieved to ensure that new
      businesses are economically and financially viable. In addition, the Government’s strategy to
      address the question of failing subprojects is still unclear as is its commitment to devise
      appropriate, well-targeted and coherent subsidy policies which would develop the young famers’
      capacity to manage their new business in a financially sustainable manner.

      5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

      5.1 Bank Performance

      (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

75.            The Bank responded promptly and effectively to the Government’s interest in developing
      its newly established program, which represented an innovative approach to land access in the
      country. During the design phase, the Bank drew on the lessons learned from previous similar
      operations in the Region, especially the Crédito Fundiário program in Brazil. Given that not all
      the lessons could be introduced upfront, the Bank maintained flexibility in the design so as to
      incorporate lessons learned during implementation. However, the Bank should have paid greater
      attention to having monitoring arrangements in place at the time of approval. Further, many risks
      cited in the PAD were correctly projected, but mitigation measures were not always realistic or
      effective. Finally, Project preparation took a relatively short time (one year) considering the
      complexity of the issues to be addressed and the lack of previous experience in the country on
      establishing the mechanisms supported by the Project. The need for more in depth field-based
      economic, financial and institutional analysis during preparation was somewhat affected by the
      pressure to quickly engage and support the already ongoing Government Program.

      (b) Quality of Supervision

      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

76.           The Bank was keenly aware of implementation limitations, and regularly took proactive
      steps to address them, taking into consideration country processes and procedures. Bank
      supervision efforts focused on: (i) developing an alternative M&E strategy; in particular, the close
      partnership with FAO allowed for the timely provision of information on subproject performance;


                                                      20
      (ii) encouraging adoption of improved Operation Rules; Bank recommendations were made as
      early as 6 months after Project effectiveness (in July 2006) and 6 months before the new
      administration was inaugurate (in January 2007); during the political transition the Bank kept a
      close dialogue with the counterpart agency and prepared a policy note identifying challenges to
      be addressed by the new administration in relation to the Project; (iii) emphasizing the need to
      scale down the Project and maintain a pilot approach; and (iv) providing training to SRA to
      improve its supervision capacity and effectiveness. However, given the limited progress on a
      number of issues (only partial changes to the Operation Rules, lack of effective M&E, weak
      implementation capacity), Bank supervision could have been more proactive in seeking a
      substantial Project restructuring in 2008.

      (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

77.            Although the Bank’s role in seizing the historic opportunity to work in this critical sector
      is commendable, the Bank’s overall performance is moderately unsatisfactory. At entry,
      important risks were not correctly identified or overlooked, and during supervision, Project
      restructuring should have been attempted earlier and more aggressively.

      5.2 Borrower Performance

      (a) Government Performance

      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

78.           The Government ensured consistent availability of adequate budgetary resources for
      timely implementation. NAFIN was intensively involved in Project preparation and supervision,
      with a focus on fiduciary issues. The Government provided strong overall support to the Project,
      but weak attention to implementation. While Operation Rules were revised over time to include
      lessons learned in the initial phases of the Bank’s intervention, incorporation of Bank
      recommendations slowly became less consistent. Political objectives, including the rapid
      expansion of the Program’s coverage and pressure to disburse the allocated budget, had a
      negative impact on Project implementation. In addition, there were clearly difficulties in the
      dialogue between the Government and the Bank on finding alternative ways to move away from a
      policy for the development of the social sector heavily based on subsidies. Finally, the
      disagreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Project implementing agencies regarding
      the recoverability of FIFONAFE loans seriously undermined the sustainability of the Program.

      (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

79.           Although SRA and FIFONAFE consistently showed strong commitment to the Project,
      they suffered from a number of operational weaknesses:

      (i)    Multiple changes in leadership and staff, in part due to political transitions;
      (ii)   Lack of adequate capacity to supervise the Project; in particular, lack of sufficient technical
             staff trained in subproject appraisal, training, and procurement;




                                                        21
      (iii) Weak M&E system and lack of coordination between SRA and FIFONAFE, which kept
            separate databases;
      (iv)   Weak coordination at the federal and state levels; and
      (v)    Inadequate implementation of plan to rescue subprojects experiencing losses.

      (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

      Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

80.      The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately unsatisfactory because, despite
      the strong overall support and availability of financial resources, some critical strategic mistakes
      were made. First, the rapid expansion in 2006 undermined the Program’s ability to learn from
      pilot activities. Second, the lack of a clear vision to achieve long-term goals (instead of so much
      emphasis on meeting annual budgetary targets), the lack of attention to financial sustainability for
      scaling up in the future, and the frequent leadership changes resulted in high-cost interventions
      with limited economic sustainability.

      6. Lessons Learned

81.      Addressing land reform issues is always subject to strong political pressure which tends
      to overshadow technical and operational considerations. In this case, Mexican authorities
      launched an ambitious (in terms of stated objectives and total cost) program with very attractive
      benefits, but without a clear strategy of what was to be learned and how it could be scaled up
      sustainably over time. The pressure was always there to (i) have wide geographical coverage so
      the Program would be noticed; and (ii) use centralized implementing agencies (SRA and
      FIFONAFE), which were known to the target beneficiaries but lacked operational capacity to
      address farm-level issues. Under these conditions, it proved very difficult for a Bank-financed
      operation to implement a pilot project that required operational flexibility and relative isolation
      from political pressures (as in Brazil, for example). Moreover, as pointed out by the Government
      comments to this ICR, the restrictions on land sales applicable to the ejido sector imposed by the
      agrarian legislation in Mexico further limited the ability of outside agents to participate in the
      already tight land market in this sector. This raises the question of whether further reforms should
      have been considered during implementation. Future engagement will require further reforms in
      this area, like expanding the options for ejido residents to enter into long-term investment
      partnerships with outsiders, broadening the scope for converting long-term rentals (including with
      outsiders) into sales, and providing additional incentives for commercial lenders to engage more
      actively in the ejido sector .

82.      The Bank’s leverage to introduce major changes in national programs of a sophisticated
      Middle Income Country like Mexico is limited. It was unrealistic for the Bank to expect that a
      pilot project would be able to introduce periodic substantive changes to a national program like
      PJERFT. Bank support to national programs in a country like Mexico, with well-established rules
      about funding and targeting of public resources, must be based on the Bank’s endorsement of the
      Program’s rules at the time of approval and not on the expectation of making substantive changes
      to these rules.

83.      The scope of a pilot operation needs to be carefully defined. Considering the potential gains
      from Bank support to the PJERFT Program, the Bank-financed pilot Project should have been
      restricted to a handful of states at the most, with intensive monitoring and supervision, and
      effective isolation from national political pressures.

84.      Access to land projects need strict adherence to some key operational principles.
      Although the Project incorporated in the design some of the lessons learned from the other Bank-
      financed access to land projects (use of loans to finance land acquisition, the importance of
      financing substantive productive on-farm investments), it failed to incorporate other important
      operational lessons in the course of implementation. Specifically, the following features are
      critical for success:

        (i)     Overall program costs (combination of loans and matching grants) must be moderate
                  (certainly under $10,000 per beneficiary for a Middle Income Country like Mexico);
        (ii)    Loans for land acquisition must have long repayment periods (10 to 20 years);
        (iii)   The debt-to-equity ratio of beneficiaries must be no higher than 1:1.5;
        (iv)    The benefits package must directly make the cost of acquiring land (and thus the level of
                  indebtedness) inversely proportional to the level of matching grants, so that
                  beneficiaries have an incentive to economize on land costs and maximize investments;
                  and
        (v)     Overall benefits must be flexible and interchangeable, so that the agents are not tempted
                  to maximize the use of a particular benefit component (e.g., technical assistance,
                  training, land acquisition) in order not to lose it.

85.      Financing through loans should be through solid financial institutions with a track
      record of loan recoveries. The appraisal of the technical, economic, and financial viability of
      investment subproject proposals must be carried out by both the Project implementing agency and
      the financial institution according to established criteria and not subject to temporary mandates
      arising from political considerations. In this Project, the Government’s strong inclination to
      subsidize virtually all types of activities undertaken by farmers in the social sector caused serious
      distortions in the loan mechanisms promoted by the Project and its ability to create a credit
      culture in the sector.

86.      Target beneficiaries of access to land projects need to be well identified to ensure project
      sustainability. This type of project should not target the poorest segments of the rural population.
      To be sustainable over time, the target population should have proven farming experience and an
      entrepreneurial approach to production and marketing.

87.      Analytical work to identify viable business opportunities is a key activity. Given the high
      level of competitiveness and capitalization that characterizes the Mexican agricultural sector, the
      promotion of new and economically viable businesses to be operated by young and inexperienced
      farmers requires strong long-term technical and organizational support, including rigorous
      screening of potential agro-businesses. Participatory mechanisms or technicians’ opinions are not
      sufficient. Rather, potential options for productive activities need to be identified through
      analytical studies, with the support of regional experts. Unfortunately, the Project was very
      centralized and relied too heavily on the promoters’ opinions, instead of looking for partnerships
      with the states where it operated, or with other institutions with experience in promoting
      innovative businesses.

88.     Strong coordination and alliances with state-level governments and institutions is critical.
      The Project’s performance and impact was clearly enhanced when young farmers and their
      communities could benefit from the additional support of state-level institutions or local
      governments in a coordinated fashion with the PJERFT Program. Unfortunately, this happened
      only in a small number of cases.

89.      Training and technical assistance activities should respond to the specific needs of
      potential young entrepreneurs. The establishment of new agro-enterprises requires the
      provision of high quality technical services for an extended period of time. The certification
      system set up under the Project was not effective in ensuring high quality of technical services.
      The training phase should focus on the validation of several viable technological packages, so
      that potential young entrepreneurs can learn and experiment with various options, rather than
      promoting a single business model.

      7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

      (a) Borrower/implementing agencies

90.      The GOM’s comments to this ICR were submitted through direct comments to the draft
      document, as well as through an extensive letter (an unofficial translation of the latter is presented
      in full in Annex 7). The main issues noted relate to the evolution of the Program, changes in
      Project objectives, the recoverability of loans, and the reasons for the eventual cancelation of the
      Loan. These issues are addressed in paras. 11/12, 32/55, 38, and 40, respectively. The key issues
      raised in the direct edits on the document are summarized below.

91.     The GOM highlighted several key features of the Program:

         (i)   The importance of emphasizing the pilot nature of the Project in support of a wider
                 Government Program and the need to evaluate its results this context;
         (ii) Weak institutional capacity to implement the Project was due to the fact that the
                 executing agency was bound by the agrarian legislation; and
         (iii) Restrictions imposed by the agrarian legislation related to the selling of ejido lands were
                 also a challenge that was underestimated in promoting a more dynamic land market
                 within the social sector.

92.      The Bank agrees with these comments. The ICR emphasizes the pilot nature of the Project and
      the importance of continued improvements in order to make it more affordable, sustainable and
      scalable in the future. Indeed, one important lesson is that despite the significant legal reforms to
      the social sector over the past two decades, the current framework still imposes considerable
      restrictions to land transactions in ejidos.

93.     The GOM also provided the following clarifications:

         (i)     The reduction of the Program’s coverage from 2007 onward was due to the
                    Government’s decision to give priority to the pending applications for productive
                    subprojects that could not be financed in 2006;
         (ii)    The GOM eventually decided it was better to cancel the loan given that the Program had
                    diverged from the initial objectives as stated in the Project documents, so as to adjust
                    to the reality on the ground;
         (iii)   Sanctions were applied in the case of delinquent repayments of loans;
         (iv)    Project beneficiaries chose the type of investment subprojects to undertake; and
         (v)     From the very beginning, the Project was rated as highly risky, which partially helps
                    explain the results achieved.

94.      The Bank acknowledges these clarifications by the Government and they have been
      incorporated in paras. 12, 40, 61, 5, and 25, respectively.



                                                        24
95.      The GOM noted that its analysis of the loan recovery issue and the reasons for the cancellation
      of the loan would be presented in a separate correspondence (see Annex 7). The Government also
      expressed its disagreement with the assertion that the Program’s overall cost per beneficiary is
      very high (see footnote 11).

96.       The GOM also made the following comments:

      •    The ratings in Section G. of the Data Sheet of this ICR for 2009 should be disregarded, since
           at that time Bank Loan funds were no longer used to operate the Program (the Bank
           acknowledges that no Bank Loan funds were used in 2009, but the rating was required given
           that the Loan Account was still open at the time);

      •    The Bank insisted that subprojects be financed through loans resembling market conditions,
           which encouraged Government to engage Financiera Rural (noted in para. 11);

      •    Changes to the Operation Rules were being incorporated during implementation (noted in
           paras. 17, 25, and 30);

      •    Financiera Rural made important contributions to the Program’s implementation, with its
           own resources (noted in paras. 13 and 41);

      •    The transfer of lands is no longer a key objective of the Program (acknowledged in para. 54);

      •    The figures on costs of access to land by modality (purchase or rental), noted in Table 1,
           could not be confirmed by the Government (hence, the ICR used staff estimates based on the
           2009 FAO evaluation);

      •    The estimates on Project’s average cost per beneficiary and those related to average cost of
           land per ha and average cost of land per beneficiary could not be confirmed by the
           Government (the Bank notes that these are staff estimates based on FAO evaluations and also
           notes that the average cost per beneficiary came from the Borrower’s completion report).

97.     Finally, the Bank appreciates the Government of Mexico’s acknowledgements related to the
      Bank’s efforts in support of this important pilot Program, as noted in its letter of January 13,
      2011, and reiterates the Bank’s commitment to continue working with the Government in
      addressing the development challenges in the agrarian sector.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Capacity Building of Young Rural Entrepreneurs and Assistance to Senior
Landholders. The Project achieved a high participation of young famers in the training phase,
however, it was not very successful in: (i) transferring a diversified set of technological,
accountability and administrative skills; and (ii) identifying existing productive chains that would
have contributed to the viability of productive activities. No technical assistance was provided to
older famers on social welfare schemes. Table 1 shows relevant outputs achieved compared to
those committed in the original design.

Component 2: Land Transactions and Productive Projects Although the Project was a key
instrument to test mechanisms to access land, it was not very successful in creating a dynamic
land market in the social sector (it promoted only 55% of projected transactions). Similarly,
although the Project could benefit 75% of young farmers through the land fund, it was not
successful in ensuring sustainability of productive activities that would raise beneficiaries’
income.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Partly as a result of the premature cancellation of the Loan, the Project did not have one
comprehensive impact evaluation of all its activities and investments. Nevertheless, the broader
PJERFT Program was subject to a few partial evaluations. At the request of SRA, FAO carried
out evaluations from 2006 to 2009 and in 2008, with a different methodology, FIFONAFE also
carried out an internal evaluation of its activities. The FAO studies used a sampling methodology
to assess in detail the economic viability of the newly established rural enterprises, taking into
account all the costs and incomes, including asset depreciation and financial costs. For its part,
FIFONAFE made a comparison between the costs and incomes of the investment subprojects, as
estimated during the formulation of the business plan (after the conclusion of the Proyecto
Escuela), and the actual results on the ground.

The 2006 FAO study showed that at least two years were needed before the investments made by
the young entrepreneurs’ entering the program (in the Proyecto Escuela) could be evaluated. It
also showed that often the projected costs and incomes were not assessed correctly during the
formulation stage (at the conclusion of the Proyecto Escuela). A subsequent FAO evaluation,
carried out in 2007, suggested that one year of activity was not sufficient to assess the
sustainability of the new enterprises. Some beneficiaries kept working on their projects, despite
the fact that opportunities to obtain a significant income increase were very low; others, who
faced some technical difficulties at the beginning, had found alternatives whereby they could
improve their business profitability. Furthermore, organizational aspects played an important role
in ensuring the solidity of the economic activities: young farmers had better access to market
when they were organized in well functioning groups.

The economic and financial analysis of sub-projects did not include the evolution of land values,
due to the higher survey costs involved. However, in many cases, economic losses suffered by the
rural enterprises were partially offset by the capital gains of increased land value19.

Summary of Results

The FAO surveys and the FIFONAFE internal evaluation showed that 77 percent investment sub-
projects supported by the Program from 2004 to 2006 were still operating, while most of the
remaining 23 percent of beneficiaries had returned to their previous economic activities. More
than 30 percent of the operating sub-projects were estimated to be at risk, given the very low or
negative performance. One-tenth of sub-projects had a profitability of up to 15 percent, half had
profitability rates of between 8 percent and 15 percent, and the rest were 8 percent (or even
negative). The 2009 baseline survey carried out by FAO indicated that all sub-projects financed
by Financiera Rural in 2007 and 2008 were still operating, but that some 20 percent of them were
facing economic difficulties and had lost part of their capital.

The low profitability levels of Program subprojects had a negative impact on the beneficiaries’
repayment capacity. The interest rate on loans provided by FIFONAFE (2004 to 2006) was 5
percent. Under these conditions, about 45 percent of beneficiaries were able to repay their loans
in 2007. In 2008, FIFONAFE recovered only 33 percent of the projected payments. There is no

Between 2004 and 2006, some 2,080 young farmers were financed by FIFONAFE receiving
loans and grants for land access, equipment and technical assistance, for a total amount of
MX$542,661,923 (approximately US$45,500,000). The main categories of economic activities
supported by the Program included: cattle (50 percent of the financed activities), small livestock
(such as sheep, goats, chickens and pigs, 21 percent), and vegetable production in greenhouses
(16 percent). The 2007 evaluation carried out by FAO-Mexico looked at a randomized sample of
120 of these enterprises.20

For each of these activities, internal rates of return (IRR) and net present values (NPV) were
calculated using realistic assumptions (based on the known evolution of these enterprises), taking
into account a 15-year projection and a discount rate of 6 percent. The results are presented in
Table 3.1 below.

These negative results may be explained by the following factors, depending on the type of
investment subproject:

Livestock: 70 percent of young farmers involved in small livestock activities obtained negative
economic results in 2007 largely due to the high cost of feeding the animals; grain prices were
very high and young farmers didn’t have access to grazing and there were limited opportunities
for producers to get organized and consolidate their purchases of inputs. For the case of cattle
farmers, 89 percent of beneficiaries obtained negative economic results in 2007 for similar
reasons.




20
  Other activities, such as fisheries, ecotourism, and small-scale dairy production that represented 13
percent of the projects financed by FIFONAFE were not included in the sample. The results of the 2010
evaluation carried by FAO-Mexico on subprojects supported by FR between 2007 and 2009 were not yet
available when this ICR was being prepared.



                                                   31
Greenhouses: 45 percent of young farmers involved in greenhouses obtained negative economic
results in 2007 due to (i) the inability of most of beneficiaries to achieve two harvests per year as
expected in the business plan; and (ii) adverse weather conditions (frost and strong winds).

   Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

       A. Summary of the Borrower’s Completion Report

   The Government of Mexico’s Final Report for the Access to Land for Young Farmers Pilot
   Project concludes that the Project had positive results in the objectives established by the PAD,
   particularly for the first component. Throughout the life of the Project, there was degree of
   flexibility which allowed for important modifications that were derived from each year’s results
   and lessons learned. One of the main lessons learned was that the purchase of land represented a
   large financial burden for beneficiaries establishing new productive activities. As a result, the
   Project implemented an important modification in the Operation Rules which reinforced
   entrepreneurial training for beneficiaries. Similarly, the Operation Rules were modified in 2009 to
   reflect the Project’s focus on the agribusiness program. Regarding the cost per beneficiary,
   although there was a 60% gradual increase which peaked in 2006, the Project was able to return
   its cost per beneficiary to 1% above its original value in 2004. As a result of the 5 years of the
   Project, the Program is now matured and more effective in being able to accompany the
   beneficiaries through the cycle of the Project.

1. Modifications to Operation Rules

   On September 30, 2004, the Secretaría de Reforma Agraria (SRA) released the Operation Rules
   for the Fondo de Tierras and Joven Emprendedor Rural (PJERFT) program. The program had two
   components: first, the training of youth through the Proyecto Escuela (School Project), and
   second, the provision of access to finance and direct subsidies for youth involved in the first
   component through the Fondo de Tierras (Land Fund).

   On February 18, 2005, there were some minor modifications to the Operation Rules; however, the
   2006, given the lessons learned from previous experience, there were mayor changes made to the
   Rules, including: the expansion of the Program to cover 21 rather than 10 states; the
   establishment of 4 criteria for the selection of ejidos (the presence of an adult, the absence of any
   agrarian-related conflict, the availability of land for its rental or purchase, the existence of current
   ejido or community representation); changes in financing terms provided by the Fondo de Tierras
   (an interest rate reduction from 5% to 3%, an increase in period of repayment of the loan from 10
   to 15 years in the case of purchase, and from 4 to 5 years in the case of a rental, and the
   establishment of 70% of investment capital as the percentage for direct contribution for purchase,
   and 50% in case of rental); and the inclusion of a new component for adults in the Program. The
   objective of the adult component was to provide access to a social security system for any adult
   who voluntarily transferred land rights to youth beneficiaries of the Program.

   In 2007, an assessment of lessons learned from the Program led to important modifications to the
   Operation Rules for the Fondo de Tierras component of the Program. The main modification was
   the separating the first component of the Program into two stages: stage A would consist of
   training through a course called “Desarrollo de Talento Emprendedor” (Development of
   Entrepreneurial Talent), and stage B would be the previous Proyecto Escuela (School Project).
   Similarly, stage C was divided into the Agribusiness Project and the Adult Project. In addition to
   these changes to the structure of the Program, FIFONAFE was replaced by Financiera Rural as
   the credit granting institution of the Program. There were also modifications to the amounts of
   funding provided in stage C (up to $225,000 for productive projects and up to $175,000 for the
   acquisition of land rights). Lastly, due to conclusions from the World Bank and FAO meeting at
   the end of 2006, it was decided that youth beneficiaries could access land rights through
   donations, in addition to purchase and rental agreements.


                                                     37
    In 2009, the Operation Rules were modified in order to reflect a change in the main objective of
    the Program which increased its focus on the agribusiness project. The main structure of the
    Program was kept the same; however, the participation of CEDA in the Project was removed in
    order to simplify and reduce the amount of time consumed in the Project’s internal processes.

2. Benefits and difficulties of the Project

    In the 2004 fiscal year, a total of 4,657 beneficiaries selected from 8 states out of which 4,317
    finished the training through the Proyectos Escuela component created a high demand for the
    Fondo de Tierras component of the Program. Consequently, in the 2005 fiscal year, the Program
    was implemented in the 10 states established in the World Bank loan agreement; however, due to
    the large demand that was generated from the first year of the Program, the number of
    beneficiaries in the first component was reduced (see table 1). During the 2006 fiscal year, the
    Program sought to increase its coverage to the national level, in order to pilot the Program is
    various geographic and demographic environments. In addition, the Adult Project was introduced
    as a way to provide an alternative social security system to those adults who voluntarily donated
    their land parcels to youth beneficiaries of the Program. Unfortunately, there were no
    beneficiaries from the Adult Project in 2006 due to the component’s lack of flexibility, and lack
    of interest from adults to participate in the Program.

    In 2007, the number of accredited beneficiaries was largely increased due to the Program’s
    intention to have Financiera Rural provide 30% guarantees, which would have increased the
    Program’s budget threefold had it been implemented as planned. After 2007, the Program became
    more flexible in its land access mechanisms as a result of the large number of land rights being
    acquired by project beneficiaries through donations. In addition, this flexibility made the
    agribusiness component of the Program more feasible, thus, increasing the Program’s overall
    financial sustainability.

    Regarding the inclusion of indigenous population and women as project beneficiaries, the total
    percentage of indigenous beneficiaries was approximately 12% throughout the life of the Project.
    In addition, 40% of the total project beneficiaries were women, a satisfactory result for any
    government program, particularly one being implemented in rural areas where generally women’s
    participation is limited.

    During the six years of the Program, the average cost per beneficiary varied. In 2004 the average
    cost per beneficiary was $219,426 pesos. In the next two years the cost increased, reaching its
    highest amount in 2006 totaling a 60% increase from the initial cost in 2004. However, from 2007
    to the end of the Project, the cost per beneficiary decreased down to $221,523 pesos in 2009 (only
    a 1% difference from the initial cost in 2004).

3. Project financing

   The World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) participated from the
   beginning of the Program in providing technical expertise for the design, evaluation and
   supervision of the Project. The objectives established for the Program were reflected in the
   expenditure categories of the loan provided by the World Bank. In addition, the proposal for the
   Fondo de Desarrollo de Tierras (Land Development Fund) established a mechanism to mobilize
   local land parcels by creating a fund with contributions from financial institutions, private banks,
   and federal, state and municipal funds.

   In 2006, the Program expanded its coverage to all 20 states, which were not included in the
   World Bank Loan Agreement. In addition, 4 of the federal entities that were served by
   FIFONAFE were not included in the World Bank Loan Agreement. The process to include these
   4 entities in the Loan Agreement was started; however, due to the change in Government and in
   World Bank personnel in charge or the Project, this process was not completed and expenses for
   these activities were declared ineligible for Loan financing.




                                                                    39
4. Inter-institutional coordination

    Since the beginning of the Project in 2004, the PJERFT established a basis for coordination with
    other institutions within the SRA, in the agricultural sector, outside the federal government, and
    with other private institutions and individuals. In addition, the SRA is part of the CDI board. In
    the agriculture sector, PJERFT partnered with the Procuraduría Agraria to provide training and
    legal advice to youth in the Program. In addition, the Program partnered with the Registro
    Agrario Nacional (National Agrarian Registry), and with FIFONAFE, which operated the Fondo
    de Tierras component of the Project. At a state level, the SRA had individual delegations in each
    state, which supervised the various stages of the Program. Throughout the years of the Program,
    communication and coordination between these delegations improved. At the local government
    level, the local governments in Guerrero, Muchoacán, and Aguascalientes were actively involved
    in the Program, designating funding for the youth agribusiness program. However, at the
    municipal level, there was not enough coordination or involvement with the Program.

5. Technical assistance

    The program established relationships with external institutions, which were contracted to
    provide technical assistance and training. From 2004 to 2006 COLPOS was contracted by the
    SRA to provide training for youth involved in the Fondo de Tierras component of the Project.
    Unfortunately, while some consultants provided an excellent service, some lacked the training
    and willingness to complete the task. In 2007, the Program began hiring private firms and
    independent consultants to provide training and advisory services; however, the Program lost the
    institutional support that had been previously provided by COLPOS. Consequently, the Dirección
    General de Política y Planeación Agraria, filled this gap by supervising that consultants had
    sufficient education and experience to provide training for youth beneficiaries of the Program. In
    addition, in order to ensure the quality of work, the DGPPA began accrediting consultants while
    beneficiaries were also able to select the person who was to provide their training. This last
    process of accreditation managed by the DGPPA provided the Program with better supervision of
    consultants supplying technical assistance and training services beneficiaries of the Program.

6. Lessons learned and project sustainability

    One of the main lessons learned during project implementation was that the acquisition of land
    parcels represented a significant financial cost for new business activities being carried out by
    project beneficiaries. As a result, the Program decided to reinforce the training component of the
    Program. This was achieved through the separation of component 1 into two stages of training,
    the Desarrollo del Talento Emprendedor course, and the Proyecto Escuela.

    Overall, after 5 years of implementation the Program is now well developed. In addition, Aide
    Memoires from World Bank missions, documents from project audits, Operation Rules, and
    Operational Manuals will remain as institutional memory that will serve for future use.
    Concerning the Program’s sustainability, the Secretaria de la Reforma Agraria (SRA) has been
    designated a budget of $458,261,800 pesos for 2010, and the Program aims to include 4000 new
    beneficiaries in Proyectos Escuela and Proyectos Agroempresariales during 2010.

This letter is in reference to the US$100 million World Bank Loan 7323-ME to partially
finance the Mexico Access to Land for Young Farmers Project, and specifically to the
Project’s Implementation Completion Report (ICR).

In reference to letter CIE-013 (50816), attached please find the comments from the

Sector Executive

Attachment:

In reference to the US$100 million World Bank Loan 7323-ME to partially finance the
Mexico Access to Land for Young Farmers Project, listed below are comments of the
implementing agency, the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform (SRA), regarding the
cancellation of the Loan.

On July 2004 activities to prepare the Access to Land for Young Farmers Pilot Project
began, and the Secretariat of Agrarian Reform was selected as the Project’s implementing
agency. The framework underpinning the design of the Project was as follows:

The Project was designed under the Bank’s newly approved policy (OP/BP 6.00)
which authorized the use of Bank loan funds for land acquisition (purchase or
rental) under the following requirements:
    a. The acquired land would be used for production;
    b. The use of land markets as an efficient mechanism to acquire land (this
        included an assessment of market distortions and how the Project would
        correct them);
    c. Mechanisms to channel funds for land acquisitions would prevent misuse
        of such funds;
    d. The associated risks, including political risk, were to be assessed as
        acceptable risks;
    e. The establishment of a satisfactory M&E system to monitor the land
        acquisition component of the Project.

The World Bank rated the Project’s risk as high in the Project Appraisal Document.

The Land Fund component, which intended to have an impact on the land market in the
agricultural sector, was influenced by the specific conditions of the Mexican social lands.
In this sense, the land market was affected by the existing legal framework, and for this
reason, in depth knowledge of the country’s legislation was essential for the design of the
Project.

The framework under which the Project was appraised, which considered land acquisition
as a fundamental component in order to achieve the Project’s objectives, was not
validated by the results of various evaluations. World Bank consultants recommended
modifying the Operation Rules due to the Land Fund component’s negative impact on the
profitability of the subprojects. Following the Bank’s recommendations, the Operation
Rules were modified in order to authorize young entrepreneurs to acquire land to be used
for productive subprojects through donation, rental or purchase of land rights. As a result
of these modifications, the profitability of productive subprojects increased.

As a result of lessons learned throughout Project implementation, the Project’s objectives
evolved as follows:

As a result of the above situation, and with the understanding that the project was initially
defined as a pilot Project with a high risk rating, the Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit, the Ministry of Agrarian Reform, and the Nacional Financiera agreed to request
an amendment of the program according to the following considerations:
    • The World Bank has provided technical assistance and partial funding to this pilot
        Program since its design and through implementation. The Operation Rules that
        govern the use of these funds have been modified by the SRA, as the program’s
        implementing agency, following the World Bank and FAO’s recommendations, in
        order to guarantee the program’s technical and financial feasibility as a pilot
        program.
    • Since 2004, these Operation Rules have considered the use of project resources as
        a mix of loans and complementary matching grants in recognition of the
        importance of promoting a credit and entrepreneurial culture among beneficiaries,
        as well as to increase the number of beneficiaries through additional funds
        obtained from loan repayments.
    • Initially, the implementation of the program’s loan component was entrusted by
        SRA to FIFONAFE. In August 2006 the World Bank learned that the SRA’s
        Internal Control Unit had indicated that given that the Program was established
        under the subsidies category of the budget, which [the Vice Ministry] of
        Expenditures had pointed out, loan repayments should be voluntary. FIFONAFE
        carried out the necessary inquiries to solve this discrepancy. However, from a
        legal standpoint, funds disbursed to beneficiaries are defined as subsidies in the
        Federal Expenditure Budget Decree, which supersedes Operation Rules. This
        situation resulted in several interpretations of the matter and in December of
        2008, the Vice Ministry of Expenditures formally issued its position. SRA policy
        has been consistent reiterating that it is a priority for agrarian policy to encourage
        a culture of using loans.
    • The amount of funds disbursed during 2004-2006 related to this situation total
        US$32,144,232.16.
    • Starting in 2007, disbursement mechanisms were modified. Funds allocated to
        this pilot program were deposited as direct support and liquid guarantees in
        Financiera Rural, the new entity responsible for disbursing matching grants and
        issuing loans with its own resources (supported by the guarantees given by SRA)
        for land operations and productive subprojects. The amount of funds disbursed in
        this budget cycle included technical assistance and other subsidies which totaled
        US$21,150,054.00.
    • The 2008 period was similar to 2007. Funds from the 2008 budget were not
        authorized by the World Bank.
    • During 2009 there were no disbursements. There were eligible operations which
        allowed the resubmission of documentation amounting to USS$33,411,455.13,
        which was accepted by the Bank.



                                             46
   •   In February 2009, the Social Office of the Presidency of the Republic instructed
       the alignment of the various legal mechanisms of existing programs so that this
       type of resources would be recoverable. The Vice-Ministry of Expenditures of the
       SHCP and the various secretariats which operate subsidy programs are working in
       coordination so that the budget items and the Operation Rules of the 2010 budget
       are consistent. Budget resources shall be issued under budget items 4,000 and
       7,000.

However, even with these elements it was not possible to obtain a retroactive amendment
to the Loan Agreement because the World Bank considered that the changes the project
had undergone during this period were substantial and affected the project’s objectives,
which led to the decision to cancel the Loan.

Nevertheless, the Mexican Government would like to reiterate its commitment to the
project given the following considerations:
    • The highly satisfactory results of the IDF grant which financed the modernization
        of the National Agrarian Registry (RAN), which had an outstanding
        implementation. This pilot program has served as a point of reference for the
        development of a cadastre system at a national level. In addition, RAN is the
        leader in the inter-ministerial group in charge of defining land regulation policies,
        which implies legal security for investments.
    • The commitment of the Secretary of Agrarian Reform to implement the Program
        under a mechanism consisting of training, technical assistance, and the
        disbursement of funds as mix of loans and matching grants.
    • The commitment to comply with environmental and indigenous peoples’
        safeguards through the staffing of environmental and social specialists. As a result
        of complying with the environmental safeguards at the regional and project level,
        funds used for the land acquisition and productive subprojects were deemed
        eligible under this pilot program (states). The subprojects submitted for
        disbursement have been given a rating according to their environmental impact
        agreed to with the Bank. In addition, the SRA submitted environmental impact
        assessments to include 21 more states than those originally established; at the
        time, the World Bank requested additional information in order to approve the
        inclusion of these states.
    • The SRA’s commitment to implement Bank and FAO’s recommendations to
        modify the Operation Rules, arising from evaluations carried out by FAO
        consultants and the Bank itself, in order to improve project implementation, as
        reflected in the Bank Aide Memoires, including the modifications to the
        Operation Rules of 2007, 2008, and 2009:

       2007 Term:
          o Establishment of Stage A: Entrepreneurship
          o Stage B: Proyecto Escuela – The expansion of the Facilitator’s role from
             supervisor to a training specialist.
          o Selection of Facilitators. Lessons from previous years proved that
             Facilitators with a large age difference from the JER groups were unable


                                             47
            to relate to JERs and as a result were weak in monitoring Project activities.
            In addition, it is important to better define the Facilitator’s role (facilitator
            vs. technical expert), as well as to include an operational manual
            specifically for facilitators. Including a program to monitor and train
            facilitators could be a possible way to strengthen their skills.
          o Selection process for consultants in charge of Proyecto Escuelas and
            technical assistance. Pre-selection of these consultants (taking advantage
            of knowledge from other institutions and research centers) where the
            candidates will present their skills and experience in order for the
            beneficiaries to make a more informed decision.

       2008 Term:
          o The elimination of Component 3, Assistance to Senior Landholders, given
             the lack of interest of program participants to invest capital obtained from
             selling land rights in a subsidized pension supported by the program, as
             well as the existence of similar programs funded by the public and private
             sector.
          o The participation of a representative from the Mexican Council for
             Sustainable Development (Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural
             Sustentable) in the Projects Directive Council.
          o A new accreditation mechanism for professional services providers.
          o The approval of an option to rent as a pre-requisite to participate in
             Proyecto Escuela.
          o Placing a limit on the financing ceiling for land acquisitions.

       2009 Term:
          o The elimination of strategic proyectos escuela and creation of a more
             flexible funding mechanism for proyectos escuela.
          o Assigning the SRA field offices a new responsibility to supervise the
             facilitators’ work as well as to monitor the proyectos escuela and the
             agribusiness subprojects.

It is important to note that the Mexican Government recognizes the work carried out by
World Bank staff and consultants, which have greatly contributed to improving the
project’s implementation through their multi-disciplinary approach.

This institutional experience contributed to the Project’s improvement, which is
classified as a Federal Government priority.
