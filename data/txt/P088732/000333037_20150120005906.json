The\n            rural social sector consists of \u0091ejidos\u0092 and \u0091communal\n            lands\u0092 that represent half the country\u0092s land. This is where\n            nearly 70 percent of the rural population lives and where\n            poverty rates are the highest. Mexico\u0092s efforts, however,\n            have been limited by legal and administrative restrictions,\n            and a lack of economic incentives. In the \u0091ejidos\u0092, most\n            land rights belong to older people, many of whom are unable\n            to use their land efficiently. Meanwhile, young households,\n            headed by more educated and potentially more innovative\n            farmers, suffer from land shortages or insecure land tenure.\n            As a result, the rural social sector is getting older and\n            young people are migrating to big cities and the United States."}, "docdt": "2006-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
