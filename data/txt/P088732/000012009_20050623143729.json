The project will thus contribute to an integrated\n            rural development strategy that emphasizes the improvement\n            of land markets, and promotes rural dynamism. This\n            Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) ensures that the most\n            vulnerable, in particular indigenous populations benefit\n            from project implementation, and provides a framework for\n            compliance in accordance with the country's legal\n            framework, and the Bank's safeguard policies. It\n            examines the indigenous locations within the project area,\n            the apparent agrarian conflicts in relation to land tenure\n            and land rights, and issues relating to land demarcation and\n            access to natural resources and water. Recommendations\n            suggest a participatory approach, which includes fostering\n            public awareness and public consultations. Capacity building\n            shall be pursued, as will training and technical assistance,\n            in addition to workshops to strengthen community\n            participation. Monitoring criteria shall be in place,\n            including grievance mechanisms should conflict occur."}, "docdt": "2005-06-15T17:01:03Z"}
