                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It is unlikely that the construction of two basic cycle schools and the development of NQF will be completed by the end of the project. In case the construction of two basic cycle
                         schools does not complete on time, the government and the World Bank will discuss the options to cover the financing. Higher education activities including the development of NQF
                         were all additional ones that were planned recently from savings incurred under the project.
