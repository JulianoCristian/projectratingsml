"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Phase of the\n            Third Education Project for Gambia, The were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            this project\u0092s introduction of a performance-based\n            management approach, whereby every civil servant in the\n            Ministry had a performance-based contract (i.e., service\n            level agreement) including teachers, administrative staff,\n            both at directorate and regional levels provided important\n            incentives for behavioral change at all levels. Supporting\n            and drawing on local partners (private local operators) can\n            be useful in ensuring effective delivery and sustainability\n            of an intervention. Under the Project, literacy activities\n            relied on the work of local private operators for\n            implementation wherein literacy training was provided to\n            more than 4,839 learners. The reach (and effectiveness) of\n            this activity was likely much greater than an externally\n            supported activity might have been. Improving the quality of\n            teaching and teachers\u0092 performance is driven by both\n            capacity-building and the provision of incentives. The\n            Project contributed to an increased level of confidence and\n            motivation among teachers as the activities supported under\n            the Project improved their content knowledge in key subjects\n            and, in turn, their capacity to teach.  It is essential to\n            ensure that first, teachers have the basic content knowledge\n            to teach.. The teachers\u0092 learning assessments undertaken by\n            the project highlighted the continued need for support to\n            improving teachers\u0092 content knowledge. It was important to\n            ensure that training covered basic knowledge needed to teach\n            in lower basic schools \u0096 before covering those areas that\n            would be required to receive West African Senior School\n            Certificate Examination, or WASSCE credit."}, "docdt": "2014-09-01T00:00:00Z"}
