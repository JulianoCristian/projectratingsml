The legislation on resettlement of the government\n            of the Gambia and the norms of the World Bank in its OP 4.12\n            will be the instruments that will govern any resettlement\n            arising out of the activities of the project. In general,\n            the resettlement principles that will guide the project\n            include zero displacement for the populations of any\n            community and coverage by compensation of any displacement\n            of persons or assets, and loss of access and services and\n            attenuation of all impacts due to re-installation to an\n            appropriate site. While the consultant could not at this\n            stage do estimate the number of affected persons, this will\n            be detailed in the resettlement action plan for each\n            subproject. Several mitigating measures should be\n            implemented by the project and the communities in the event\n            of physical population re-location as well as the losses\n            that such relocation will generate, namely: relocate the\n            people affected to housing equivalent to those they left;\n            reallocate land equivalent if not better than their land\n            re-possessed; intensify the methods of production and\n            diversify their produce or revenue generating activities\n            outside their lands; and use resources created by the\n            project to improve productivity. In all cases the value of\n            the compensation is estimated at the current market value\n            plus the added value or on the basis of the declared value\n            to the fiscal authorities. For those who may lose\n            employment: create cottage industries and revenue generating\n            activities; and encourage husbandry of small ruminants; and\n            fish farming from hand-dug ponds, etc. The displaced persons\n            must not suffer any prejudice with regard to access to\n            natural resources and services. Overall, the displaced\n            persons whether individuals, families or communities with\n            certain affinities must be assisted by the project and the\n            communities to reconstruct their livelihoods without any\n            form of alienation, in particular by the host communities.\n            The right of use of the land and the forest code are\n            recognised and presents no conflicts as far as project\n            implementation but the mining code may, pose problems in\n            certain rural communities, such as in the Khosanto and\n            Missirah Sirimana in Tambacounda region where the sub-soil\n            contains gold deposits. The risks of resettlement to the\n            population and project locations will be there when\n            industrial exploitation of the deposits is decided. The\n            report recommends prior sensitization of the community and\n            establishing mechanisms for settling disputes."}, "docdt": "2013-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
