1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. The Gambia is the smallest country in West Africa and on the entire
continent. In 2005, around the time of project appraisal, it had an estimated population of 1.48
million, an average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of approximately US$430 and life
expectancy at birth was 57 years. Though the Government’s commitment to education was
strong, the macroeconomic crisis in 2001/2002 had led to severe reductions in the Government
budget. In addition, during this period, the share of the budget allocated to education fell from
20.7 percent in 2002 to 14.2 percent in 2003. Since that time, recurrent budget allocations to
education have shown small increases in 2004 and 2005 of 15 and 16 percent, respectively.
Although recurrent expenditures in education were lower than the already-low allocations, this
was more an illustration of the overall macroeconomic crisis than of a lack of commitment to
education. In fact, the Government had provided more funding to the education sector than to
any other sectors in the economy, and budget increases each year favored education over almost
all other sectors.

2.      Sector Context. The Bank had a long tradition of support to the country’s education
sector and had gained considerable sector experience and the trust of the Government.
International Development Association (IDA)-funded operations had provided substantial
support in the development of basic education for many years prior to the preparation of this
Project, the Third Education Project (Phase II) (P077903). IDA had provided support for the
construction and rehabilitation of classrooms and teacher training institutes and provision of
equipment and had also funded teacher training and curriculum and instructional material
development. This Project, built upon the achievements of the Third Education Project (Phase I)
(P035643) (implemented between 1998 and 2005) and aimed to support the Education Sector
Program’s Second Phase.

3.      This Project built upon the successes of the previous project (Phase I) and provided
support to scale-up successful innovations introduced under Phase I such as the expansion of
multi-grade classrooms and double-shift teaching, curricula revisions, and regular assessments.
The first phase of the Third Education Project (P035643) aimed to improve access to and quality
of basic education. The Project (Phase I) achieved a number of positive outcomes including: (i)
an increase in access at all levels of education (Grades 1 through 12) with particular success in
increasing girls’ enrollment through the construction and rehabilitation of schools and through
the provision of girls’ scholarships and hiring of female teachers; and (ii) improvements in the
quality of education as a result of better learning materials (e.g., textbooks) and revisions to the
national assessment systems. In addition, the Project (Phase I) also sought to increase access to
secondary education as well as provide technical support to policy development in the Technical
and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and Higher Education sectors. 1

 The Project was rated Moderately Satisfactory in both the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR)
and The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) review.

                                                     1
 4.      At the time of project appraisal, improvements in the quality of teaching and in the
 learning environment, more generally, were identified as key sector priorities. The Gambia had
 become increasingly dependent on teachers from abroad. Further, and even despite this, it had
 an inadequate number of teachers in both rural and urban areas. In addition, a large number of
 teachers were unqualified and required a substantial level of in-service training while the pre-
 service training curriculum needed to be upgraded and modernized.

 5.     The Bank’s support to The Gambia has been consistent which is significant particularly
 given that the country is considered a “donor orphan”. Table below provides information on
 support provided by various donors during the project life.

 6.      Project Context. At the time of project preparation and appraisal, Bank assistance was
 considered critical in the effort to improve the quality of teaching and learning. In order to
 improve the quality of education a series of interventions were required including: teacher
 training; provision of effective learning and teaching materials; and the construction and
 rehabilitation of classrooms. As the quality of pre-service teacher training had been generally of
 poor quality, there had been significant investment in in-service teacher training. To meet
 Education For All (EFA) goals of universal primary education, in addition to improvements in

                                                        2
quality, efforts would be needed to ensure that education was inclusive and that support was
provided to literacy programs. The Bank had relevant experience in these areas and, therefore,
was in the position to share its global experience in supporting innovative models within the
Gambian context.

7.      The Third Education Project (Phase II) was approved by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors on June 1, 2006 in the context of the FY04-FY07 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
which had been presented to the Bank’s Board on March 6, 2003. The Project objectives and
design was also aligned with the subsequent Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) (IDA and African
Development Bank (AfDB)) covering FY09-FY11 that was approved on February 1, 2008. The
Project was also in full alignment with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approved in
June 2007 which highlighted human development as a major priority – with a specific emphasis
on providing support to basic education and skills development. This Project was implemented in
parallel with the Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA FTI) Project (P115427). Together
these investments made the World Bank the largest financier of the education sector in The
Gambia.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.      The project development objective (PDO) in both the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
and Financing Agreement (FA) was “to improve conditions for teaching and learning in basic
education through: (a) improving performance of students, teachers and schools; (b)
strengthening capacity building and performance management, and enhancing monitoring and
evaluation; and (c) continuing expansion of effective access to under-served communities.”

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.       In June 2010, an Additional Financing (AF) grant in the amount of US$5.5 million was
allocated to this Project. 2 This AF was, in part, possible as a result of the macro-economic crisis
in 2009 which opened up an opportunity for the Government of The Gambia to access IDA
funds. The Third Education Project (Phase II) was eligible for this funding as a result of the
Project’s strong implementation performance and recommendations of the Mid-Term Review
(MTR) in 2009. The revised PDO under the AF was “to improve access of underserved
communities to, and quality of, education in The Gambia, with a particular focus on primary
education (lower basic education) and teacher quality”. Under the AF, the indicators and targets
of the Project were revised and adjusted in order to improve their alignment with the newly
introduced project activities. In addition, the Project’s closing date was extended by 21 months
from March 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. Specifically, six indicators (one PDO-level and
five intermediate-level) were added to monitor in-service teacher training and support for Higher
Education/Science, Technology and Innovation (STI). Subsequently, in December 2012, a Level
II restructuring was undertaken which extended the project closing date by one year to December
31, 2013. There were no further changes to the PDO. However, one PDO-level and three
intermediate-level indicators were dropped and three intermediate-level indicators were revised.

2
  At the time, changes to the PDO and the RF could not be introduced within the context of the AF (i.e., included in
the Project Paper, etc.) but rather required a Level I Restructuring.

                                                         3
This was done in order to improve the alignment of the Results Framework (RF) with changes
introduced to the Government’s Education Sector Program.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The beneficiaries of the Project included: teachers who participated in training, and
regional directorate and central level staff who benefited from capacity-building activities.
Specifically, the Project beneficiaries included: (i) 529 head teachers trained in management
education and leadership; (ii) 5,598 teachers in in-service teacher training; (iii) 2,730 teachers in
the in-service face-to-face training program (AF); (iv) 912 teachers benefitting from training at
the certificate level and at the Bachelor’s level; (v) 931 students enrolled in newly constructed
schools; (vi) 15,000 female students receiving scholarship grants; (vii) 31 students enrolled in the
newly constructed classrooms; (viii) 4,839 literacy learners (2,469 in literacy classes and 2,370
literacy learners in post literacy classes) (95 percent of which were female); (ix) 2,679
headmasters and deputy headmasters benefitting from training; and (x) about 257,000 students
received textbooks. These beneficiary groups were not significantly changed under the AF
though the project focus included a greater number of teachers.

1.5 Original Components

The Project had the following three components:

11.    Component 1: Improved conditions for teaching and learning (Appraisal Estimate –
Original Financing: US$5.5 million and Additional Financing: US$5.5 million; Total Estimate:
US$11.0 million. Actual Expenditure – Original Financing: US$4.22; Additional Financing:
US$5.65; Total Actual Expenditure: US$9.87 million). The activities supported under this
Component included school-level pedagogic support, teacher training activities, training for
head-teachers, purchase of instructional materials, capacity building at the West Africa
Examination Council (WAEC), school improvement grants, support to the Government’s
scholarship trust fund for girls and tertiary education strategic studies.

12.     Component 2: Strengthened capacity building, performance management, and
monitoring and evaluation. (Appraisal Estimate – Original Financing: US$1.0 million;
Additional Financing: US$0 million; PHRD: US$3.0 million; Total Estimate: US$4.0 million.
Actual Expenditure – Original Financing: US$2.47; Additional Financing: US$0; PHRD:
US$3.0 million; Total Actual Expenditure: US$5.47 million). The activities supported by this
Component included technical assistance (TA) for a functional analysis and for the creation of a
more effective organization; and funds for the purchase of office equipment and furniture for
managers. This Component also sought to support TA for the development of management
training modules and for the career development of teachers and of education personnel in
general. The Component also aimed to support the signature of service level agreements (SLAs)
with all central and regional directorates, and the awarding of team performance bonuses to those
having fulfilled their annual work plan commitments. In addition to the above activities, the
Component also aimed to support monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities, including training
and TA; and implementation support to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).



                                                 4
13.     Component 3: Expansion of effective access. (Appraisal Estimate – Original Financing:
US$1.5 million and Additional Financing: US$0 million; Total Estimate: US$1.50. Actual
Expenditure – Original Financing: US$1.12; Additional Financing: US$0. Total Actual
Expenditure: US$1.12 million). This Component aimed to support the construction and/or
rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping of 36 urban classrooms (two schools with two streams of
9 grades each) in Region 2, and of 16 multi-grade classrooms (two 2-classroom blocks in each of
the four outlying regions). It also aimed to provide support to literacy courses through the
involvement of local staff (6,000 learners provided with literacy training and with post-literacy
support).

1.6 Revised Components

14.     Under the AF, two new activities were supported under Component 1: (i) teacher
training; and (ii) support to tertiary education strategic studies. In terms of teacher training, the
AF aimed to support “the implementation of an in-service training program (including through e-
learning opportunities, individualized learning and peer support networks) to approximately
3,000 teachers who did not reach West African Senior School Certificate Examination
(WASSCE) level credits in Maths and English”. While the AF aimed to provide support to the
tertiary education sector “through the carrying out of studies and the provision of TA [technical
assistance] to the newly founded Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and
Technology (MOHERST) to enhance its capacity to provide relevant, sustainable and high
quality higher education, including its ability to lead in the development of science and
technology (S&T) innovation.”

15.     These enhancements to Component 1 reflected the Bank and Government’s heightened
efforts to address specific challenges related to the low quality of teaching. This decision was
driven by findings from the Whole School Development (WSD) impact evaluation (IE) and a
growing realization within the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MOBSE) that the
quality of teaching was relatively weak and warranted additional support. Further, an emphasis
on supporting tertiary education reflected the shared view that capacity-building and knowledge
strengthening activities would be useful for the newly established MOHERST and this would
contribute, in turn, to improvements in pre-service teacher training.

1.7 Other significant changes

Additional Financing

16.     The Project’s mid-term review (MTR) in 2009 recommended that more emphasis be
placed on improving the quality of teachers with a specific focus on improving their content
knowledge and qualifications. As described above, the WSD IE found serious gaps in content
knowledge among teachers. This study was based on a teacher assessment (N = 1,049 teachers)
(approximately one-quarter of the total number of lower basic school (LBS) teachers) which
tested their competency level in literacy and mathematics (for the most part, in terms of primary
level content). The study found that only a small proportion of teachers (approximately 2.6
percent) obtained a score of at least 90 percent. On the basis of the study findings, it was
determined that in order for the Project to have as significant an impact as originally envisioned
on basic education, more teacher training needed to be provided. The MTR recommended that
                                                 5
the Project support the provision of continuous in-service training focusing on content and
pedagogical competencies. On the basis of a request from the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Affairs (MOFEA), an AF grant in the amount of US$5.5 million was provided to the Project in
June 2010. A Level I restructuring 3 was also undertaken which introduced revisions to the PDO
and RF (ensuring proper alignment of project activities and objectives). The AF supported two
new activities under Component 1: (i) in-service teacher training (equipment, services, minor
works, training and operating costs) (in the amount of US$4.45 million); and (ii) TA for Higher
Education/ Science Technology and Innovation (STI) strategy (furniture, services, and training)
(in the amount of US$1.05 million).

Extension of Project Closing Date

17.     In June 2010, the closing date of the Project was extended by 21-months from March 31,
2011 to December 31, 2012 in order to allow for additional time to complete project activities
(including those introduced under the AF, namely in-service teacher training and the provision of
both TA and capacity strengthening activities within MOHERST).

Project Restructuring

18.      The Project was restructured twice during its lifetime. The first restructuring in June of
2010 introduced, as described above (in addition to the AF grant amount of US$5.5 million),
modifications to the PDO and performance indicators. The second restructuring in December of
2012 introduced: (i) a reallocation of funds; (ii) an extension of the closing date by 12 months to
enable completion of project activities; and (iii) additional revision to the results framework (RF)
including modifications to some indicators’ targets to better capture progress made under project
activities and to better align with what could be feasibly completed during the remainder of the
project life. 4 There was no change to the PDO under this second Restructuring and the scope of
the Project remained unchanged. Funding originally allocated for printing supplementary
materials, and materials and stationary for tutors among others in the amount of US$158,792 was
reallocated to finance civil works as additional support was needed to complete these activities
(to provide funding needed to address the “school construction gap”).


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     Project Preparation and Design. The Third Education Project (Phase I) was based upon
the priorities of the Education Sector Policy (2006-2015), the CAS (FY2004-FY2007) and PRSP
(2002). The Project was designed in collaboration with a number of development partners (DPs),

3
  As noted earlier, changes to the PDO and the RF could not be introduced within the context of the AF (i.e.,
included in the project paper, etc.) but rather required a Level I Restructuring.
4
  At the time, there was an emphasis on replacing system-wide indicators with performance indicators which were
project-specific. In this instance, a PDO-level indicators (change in the completion rate in lower basic education)
was dropped as it was a system-wide one. In addition, the primary completion rate was included in the RF as it had
become a core sector indicator (a Tier 1 indicator – i.e., tracked at the corporate level).

                                                        6
including, in particular, the UK Department for International Development (DfID). Specifically,
TA provided by DfID in the context of its Basic Education Support for Poverty Reduction
(BESPOR) Project supported the development of the Government’s Education Policy and
Strategic Sector Plan which provided important insight into major challenges and issues faced by
the sector, including those related to basic education and literacy. As such, this Project’s design
focused on these issues – building upon the achievements of the Third Education Project (Phase
I). This Project’s primary emphasis on improving the teaching and learning environment was
appropriate given the gains made under Phase I in terms of increasing access to basic education.
The Project’s aim to provide support to address each of the main factors affecting teaching and
learning (i.e. schools, teachers and students) was appropriate in light of the challenges faced. In
addition, the decision to continue to provide girls’ scholarships (provided through Phase I) to
enhance completion rates and transition rates of girls is one good example of Phase II building
on interventions which were successful under Phase I.

20.     Project preparation was led by the MOBSE and its Project Coordination Unit (PCU),
drawing on their experience in implementing Phase I of the Project. The design of this Project
(Third Education Project – Phase II) incorporated a number of lessons learned from the design
and implementation of Phase I in continued implementation of these activities. The team also,
drawing from its previous experience and lessons learned in the first phase, aimed to: keep the
project simple and have a modest number of components and sub-components; and create
financial and non-financial performance-based incentives under the Project. By establishing
contracts between the Permanent Secretary (PS) and Directorates, for example, the Project put
into place a performance evaluation framework which both rewarded good performers and
sanctioned those unable to effectively fulfill their responsibilities and built on an effective
approach used and developed under the first phase. Further, the Project relied on existing
implementation arrangements which were entrenched within the Government structure.
Moreover, the Project’s emphasis on undertaking approaches to improve the quality of teacher
training mechanisms stemmed from a growing understanding that this was a major pre-condition
to achieving improvements in teaching and learning outcomes. In addition, the Project design:
(i) reinforced and built upon the high level of donor coordination – further solidifying the
harmonized dialogue and M&E in cooperation with key DPs; and (ii) used needs-based targeting
for focused and appropriate interventions. Since M&E was highlighted as an area warranting
significant attention (in terms of capacity-building, i.e., training staff in data collection, analysis,
reliable and regular M&E) at the Concept Stage, the Project design included support to this area
under Component 2.

21.     The Project had some important and innovative features. For example, the use of e-
learning training modules was innovative insofar as it addressed key quality challenges using a
new approach and allowed teachers to receive training without traveling to the capital. The
decision to focus the Project on improvements in basic education and literacy was sound given
the support to the other sectors provided by the various DPs and the limited resources and
reduced IDA envelope for the Project. The choice of an adaptable program loan (APL) rather
than a specific investment loan (SIL) was strategic and appropriate given that under Phase I three
of the four triggers were met (with the fourth being unrelated to education) thus the rationale to
continue with the chosen APL instrument.



                                                   7
22.      The MOBSE as implementing agency of the Project continued to use the existing PCU as
its coordinating unit. The decision to maintain the PCU in this role was justified given that: (i)
the sector had major challenges in attracting highly qualified personnel in part due to limited
education and opportunities for career growth combined with low salaries; and (ii) the PCU had
experience implementing the first phase of the Project and was well-placed to continue to play
this role under the second phase of the Project. Under this Project, however, the PCU was
further mainstreamed in the MOBSE which strengthened and ensured continued effective
coordination and a strong partnership between the PCU and MOBSE. The implementation and
institutional arrangements were sound as the Project focused primarily on basic education and, in
those instances under the Project, where other sectors were involved all fiduciary matters were
handled by the PCU. While the large number of teacher training activities made their role more
challenging, the focus on improving teachers’ knowledge content was appropriate given the
challenges facing the sector and this further strengthened their capacity to manage and oversee
large and complex activities.

23.      The Government demonstrated a high-level of buy-in in terms of the Project’s
overarching objectives, design and implementation strategy. The Senior Management Team
(SMT) which was comprised of Ministers, as well as the PS and Deputy PS held regular
meetings to ensure alignment between the central and local levels which continue to be held
today. This further ensured strong ownership and commitment from the highest levels of the
MOBSE. By making the PCU or Directorates responsible for implementation of specific
activities, capacity building was provided while a level of flexibility was introduced wherein
SLAs could be (and were) signed with local entities for delivering each of the specific activities
within their sub-sector.

24.     Quality at entry. The project design focused on addressing key challenges facing basic
education in The Gambia and supported the Government in achieving its strategic objectives for
the sector. Moreover, the operation built on interventions that had been successful under the first
phase of the Project and incorporated lessons learned from other relevant Bank operations. The
Bank team possessed the necessary skills mix and expertise to properly appraise the Project and
guide its design. Project preparation benefitted from a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) held
in February of 2006. There were some issues, however, related to the RF and M&E arrangements
which were challenging at the project preparation stage. Specifically: (i) a sound M&E system
which could regularly collect and provide data for all indicators was not fully in place; (ii) the
RF was complex with a large number of PDO-level indicators (some of which were redundant);
and (iii) baseline values had not been collected for some the PDO-level indicators and all of the
intermediate-level indicators. It is important to note, however, that baseline values were not
required by the Bank at the time. The team, aware of the M&E limitations during project
preparation, proactively applied for and obtained a Policy and Human Resources Development
(PHRD) grant to support capacity building to establish the M&E system to collect and regularly
report on these indicators. Based on the information above, Quality at Entry is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

25.     Revised design. The 2010 AF introduced changes to activities (adding new activities
under Component 1) as well as revisions of the PDO and the RF to better capture project-related
results and outcomes (which reduced the number of PDO-level indicators from nine to five).

                                                8
The revised design narrowed the Project’s focus on improving the quality of teaching through in-
service teacher training and providing support to pre-service training through TA for Higher
Education and STI. These revisions were relevant and timely in light of new information
obtained through the teacher assessment conducted as part of the WSD IE and adjustments were
appropriate in strengthening the alignment of the PDO and Project-supported activities.
Furthermore, target values were adjusted to better reflect the status and reach of project
activities. The extension of the Project closing date was also warranted given the newly
introduced activities. The second restructuring (Level II) in December of 2012, which extended
the Project closing date by one year and introduced a minor reallocation of funds, was timely and
an appropriate step given additional time and support needed to complete the construction of two
basic cycle schools and eight multi-grade schools. The changes to the RF introduced under this
Restructuring were relevant and appropriate (one PDO-level indicator was dropped as the sector
advised that the completion rate should be measured at the sector level and not the project level)
and three intermediate level indicators were also dropped. Three intermediate-level indicators
were also revised at this time.

26.    The decision to direct the majority of funding towards activities that aimed to improve
teachers’ content knowledge and their overall quality of teaching demonstrated flexibility and
was driven by recent evidence obtained from the WSD IE. It also provided needed capacity
building support to the Government to expand training at the secondary and tertiary levels which
would also be important in improving the quality of teaching in the medium- and long-term.

2.2 Implementation

27.    The following provides an overview of the various phases of the Project.

Phase I: February 2007 to June 2010

28.     The Third Education Project (Phase II) was approved by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors on June 1, 2006 and became effective on February 28, 2007 (three months after the
planned effectiveness date). The original closing date was March 31, 2011. According to the
project status reports (PSRs), implementation was largely smooth during the first years of the
project life. Disbursement was also on track with 66 percent of the original IDA grant amount
disbursed 12 months before the original closing date of March 31, 2011. Overall implementation
progress (IP) was rated Moderately Satisfactory in the ISRs.

29.     The implementation arrangements under the Project were sound with MOBSE 5 as the
implementing agency and the PCU playing a coordinating role. The Inter-ministerial senior
management team (SMT) held regular meetings. These played an important role in guiding
overall policy direction and in centralizing key implementation decisions related to the education
sector. The SMT was responsible for delegating the implementation of activities to either the
PCU or relevant Directorates on the basis of SLAs. The PCU was adequately staffed and
organized. Given its experience to date in the education sector, it was able to effectively play a

Secondary Education (DOSBSE)

                                                  9
critical role in the successful implementation of the Project. This point was highlighted during
interviews with Government officials undertaken in the preparation of the ICR.

30.      The MTR began in July 2009 and was completed during the joint annual sector review in
December 2009. 6 The findings from this MTR guided many of the changes made to the Project.
The MTR found that progress towards achievement of the PDO achievement and overall IP was
Moderately Satisfactory, successfully implementing many activities. Under Component 1,
stipends were provided to teacher trainees, the Primary Teacher Certificate (PTC) extension
programme was being piloted so that unqualified teachers could become qualified, 169 head
teachers were trained at the University of The Gambia (UTG), close to 3,000 teachers attended
training on Early Grade Reading Ability, and 15,000 girls received scholarships that covered
tuition, textbooks and examination fees. Under Component 2, SLAs were signed at all level of
the system. Under Component 3, seven literacy providers were selected to teach literacy courses.
In addition, at the MTR, some challenges in implementation of project activities under
Components 2 and 3 were highlighted. For example, though the M&E framework had been
established and data were being collected on a regular basis, there had been limited data
verification activities until TA was provided for M&E capacity building. Under Component 3,
significant delays occurred as a result of a complaint by one of the bidders for a contract related
to the construction activities supported under the Project. This resulted in a Department of
Institutional Integrity (INT) investigation which lasted for 18 months. Further, this resulted in a
decision to re-launch the entire bidding process – further delaying the construction activities.
The MTR also concluded that some of the PDO-level indicators in the RF were not sufficient for
measuring achievements made under a number of the project activities. Moreover, while the
Project did provide support for inputs that aimed to improve access to schooling and to improve
the quality of education provided, the MTR found that these specific inputs did not directly
impact “the broader sector indicators” which were included the RF (e.g., the primary completion
rate and increase in instructional time). 7

Phase II: July 2010 – December 2012

31.      The 2010 AF (which included a restructuring) had introduced a number of the changes
which had been addressed in the context of the MTR. The Project closing date had been
extended by 21 months to December 31, 2012. Project implementation continued to progress
steadily throughout this period with approximately 90 percent of the original grant and 80
percent of AF grant being disbursed by December 2012. Progress was made across a number of
activities, including: teacher training which continued to be held (over each school holiday);
training of literacy learners throughout the country; and the construction of eight multigrade
schools and two basic cycle schools.

Phase III: January 2013– December 2013

32.    The Project closing date was extended in December 2012 for one year. The new closing
date was December 31, 2013. By the time of Project closing, nearly all (96.3 percent) of the

6
 The Annual Review looked at both the Education Sector Plan and the Third Education Project (Phase I).
7
 The MTR also recommended, therefore, that these broader indicators would be “monitored as part of the sector-
wide indicators but will not be used to measure the project’s results”.

                                                     10
original financing and all of the AF grant had been disbursed. Similarly, almost all project
activities had been completed with the exception of the construction of two basic cycle schools
(which were 85 to 90 percent complete). 8 The Government requested a three-month extension of
the closing date in December 2013 to complete the construction, however, it was not granted. As
a result, it was decided that the unused resources (US$200,000) be committed to finishing these
schools under the Results for Education Achievement and Development (READ) Project, which
became effective on April 25, 2014 (and they were completed as of August 2014). At the end of
the Project, US$0.1 million was cancelled (1.2 percent of the original grant amount). The
activities supported under the AF were also implemented successfully in a timely manner. With
regards to the in-service teacher training, teachers were selected on a voluntary basis which
required a strong communications campaign to incentivize teachers to participate. This was a
challenging undertaking. Though initially envisaged to include e-learning modules, the training
was only provided face to face given the delay in the installation of the e-learning centers. By
project completion, however, 48 e-learning centers (1 main hub, 6 regional centers and 41
distance e-learning centers) had been installed under the Project in both urban and difficult to
reach areas with the E-Center for Support to Excellence in Learning (ECSEL) Hub set up in the
MOBSE’s regional office (Region 1). 9 TA was provided to MOHERST to support the
development of Higher Education policy, an STI policy and an operational strategy, which were
also successfully implemented. Both the policy and strategy have been developed and, with cost
savings, additional activities in this area were supported.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

33.     Original M&E Design. Several of the original PDO-level indicators were appropriate
given the project design and practice for selecting indicators at the time. However, the large
number of PDO-level indicators (nine in total) required an elaborate and functional M&E system
that was not fully in place at the time of project appraisal. In addition, the lack of baseline values
and end-of-project targets for a number of these was also a challenge during implementation as
data needed to be collected for these indicators’ baseline values during the early stage of the
Project life. The intermediate-level indicators were well aligned and linked to each of the
Project’s components.

34.     Revised M&E Design. The 2010 AF/Restructuring addressed the above-mentioned
limitations. Three PDO and three intermediate indicators were dropped, six PDO-level and two
intermediate-level indicators were revised, and two PDO-level and eight intermediate-level
indicators were added at the 2010 AF/Restructuring. At the 2012 Restructuring, one PDO and
three intermediate indicators were dropped, and three intermediate indicators were revised. No
indicators were added at this time. A number of PDO-level indicators were modified to: (i)
improve the alignment of the RF with project activities; (ii) ensure baseline values for all
indicators; and (iii) include mandatory World Bank core indicators (e.g., number of project

8
  This determination was made by a Bank review at the end of the Project.
9
  Originally it was envisaged that the ESCEL Hub would be established within the University of The Gambia (UTG)
with its principal function being to deliver lectures and interactive sessions through e-learning to remote sites
(regional offices and clusters) and produce e-learning resource materials. However, during project implementation
coordination between UTG and MOBSE on this activity proved challenging. Eventually, the ECSEL hub was
moved to MOBSE’s regional office in Region 1.

                                                       11
beneficiaries). Baseline values and end-of-project targets were revised on the basis of more
recent population data projections made available in December of 2011. See Annex 10 for an
overview of indicators across the project life. In light of the above, the rating for both the
original and revised M&E design for the Project is Modest.

35.     Data needed to track progress under each of the indicators were provided by the
Education Management Information System (EMIS). Following the school stabilization period
(in November of each year), under this Project, the MOBSE Planning Directorate conducted a
school census and collected school-level data, analyzed these data by February of the following
calendar year and published their findings in a report by May of that same year. This systematic
school census was well developed by the end of the project and MOBSE published the most
recent school census in May 2014.

36.      M&E implementation: The M&E framework designed under the Project was used to
track and report on progress made under each of the indicators listed in the RF. However, there
were some challenges in the initial phases of the Project in M&E as data were not being
regularly collected. Though this did improve over the life of the Project, there were still
difficulties in ensuring data verification and, therefore, the reliability of the data as collection
methods were not entirely consistent over time. In terms of project-level data, the
implementation status reports (ISRs) did not regularly track progress under each PDO-level
indicator but requested the team “enter at least one indicator of achievement of the PDO”. As
such, three out of nine PDO-level indicators were not recorded in the Project’s ISRs until the
first restructuring in 2010. However, after June 2010, data were provided on all of the indicators.
One of the capacity-building activities supported under the Project was TA to the MOBSE’s
Planning Directorate in undertaking data collection, cleaning, and analysis as well as in using
and strengthening the EMIS. This enhanced capacity within the MOBSE was evidenced through
the development and dissemination of an annual sector progress report (as described above, it is
published in May of every year). The PHRD grant resources were also used to develop baseline
values for a number of performance indicators as well as derive end-of-project targets. Given the
critical importance of sector data in the context of the joint annual reviews, these data became
more available and reliable over time. Specific project-level data were also recorded to measure
the Project’s achievements and progress made under the Project.

37.    The changes introduced under the 2010 and 2012 restructurings allowed for strong
alignment (reflected in the RF) between project interventions and outcomes and the indicators
were more measurable. These modifications to the RF as well as the efforts to provide baseline
values for the newly introduced indicators, the inclusion of new indicators to measure progress
towards achievement of the revised PDO, and additional indicators to measure progress under
each of the new activities were appropriate.

38.      M&E utilization: The delays in establishing a functional M&E system within the
MOBSE resulted in initial challenges to M&E under the Project. However, by project closing, it
was clear that data collected were being used to inform decision-making and policy formulation.
Additional assessments undertaken during the life of the Project and used to improve the Project
included: (i) the IE of the WSD grant scheme and of the provision of scholarships to girls; and
(ii) regular teacher assessments. The findings of these assessments played a significant role in the

                                                12
design of the AF in 2010. On the basis of the information presented above, M&E Quality under
the Project is rated as Modest.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.    The Project’s safeguard screening category was S2, and the environmental screening
category was B. The project triggered two safeguards policies: OP/BP 4.01 – Environmental
Assessment and OP/BP4.12 – Involuntary Resettlement. To assess and mitigate any potential
environmental and social impact of project activities, two safeguards instruments - an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF), were prepared and disclosed in-country and at the Bank InfoShop prior to
project appraisal. The two instruments (ESMF and RPF) provided guidelines and standard
methods and procedures, along with institutional arrangements for preparation, approval,
implementation and monitoring of specific Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) and
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs). The EMPs and RAPs were to be prepared as and when
necessary during project implementation.

40.     In June 2013, The Government commissioned audit reports on the implementation of the
ESMF and the RPF to assess the Project’s compliance with mitigation measures recommended
by the two safeguards instruments. Audit reports concluded that, during implementation, the
nature and size of the infrastructure works carried out did not have any significant negative
impact on the environment to constitute the preparation of an EMP. The same applied to the
preparation of a RAP. The small size of the infrastructure works did not generate any major
negative social or economic impact in terms of relocation, loss of livelihood or access to
economic assets, as all of the construction took place on land that already belonged to the
schools and/or on land provided by the communities without any request for compensation,
either in-kind or in cash. Also, there were no objections or counterclaims for the land allocated
for schools during the life of the Project. Consequently, there was no need to prepare a RAP
during project implementation.

41.     The Financial management (FM) system of the PCU/MOBSE was adequate during the
project implementation: (i) qualified FM staff were in place; (ii) a computerized accounting
system was in place; (iii) the fund flows system was adequate; (iv) an Internal Audit function
was set up in April of 2012; and (v) a strong SMT was in place to monitor the project funds and
make decisions on implementation. In addition, the Borrower complied with the financing
agreement (FA) provisions relating to the submission of the interim unaudited financial reports
and the audited financial statements.

42.    FM performance improved during project implementation as indicated in FM
implementation support mission reports. The Borrower took on board suggested
recommendations and its performance in FM was rated Satisfactory by the FM implementation
support missions. Further, the FM implementation support mission noted that the quality of the
interim unaudited financial reports had improved, the external auditor expressed an unqualified
opinion on the Project financial statements, and the Internal Audit function issued useful reports.




                                                13
43.     Procurement activities were undertaken by the PCU which was well-versed in IDA
procedures as it had acquired relevant experience from previous and on-going IDA-funded
projects. The procurement unit within the PCU functioned effectively having a procurement
specialist on board during most of the project life. Procurement under the Third Education
Project (Phase II) was Satisfactory for most of the project life with capacity-building provided to
enhance knowledge of IDA procedures and systems.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

44.     Phase II of this Project built on the capacity, experience and lessons learned under Phase
I. The Third Education Project (Phase II) was designed to expand on and support a number of
key elements introduced in Phase I, for example, continuing and further strengthening its focus
on girls’ education while placing increasing emphasis on the quality of education quality –
specifically on providing enhanced teacher training.

45.     The READ project funded by IDA and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) in the
amount of $18.8 million became effective on April 25, 2014. This four-year project will
continue to support a range of activities that address both access and quality issues pertaining to
basic education – many activities which were supported under the Third Education Project
(Phases I and II). Specifically, it will support: (i) construction of multi-grade schools in remote
areas; (ii) construction of water points within new construction sites; (iii) provision of donkey
carts as transportation to school for young students; (iv) provision of supplemental readers; (v)
support to Primary Teacher Certificate (PTC) and Higher Teacher Certificate (HTC) teacher
trainees through classroom observations, distance learning, and stipends; (vi) provision of
hardship allowances to teachers in disadvantaged communities; (vii) training of teachers on early
grade literacy skills; (viii) completion of national assessment tests (NATs) for Grades, 3, 5, and
8; (ix) statistical capacity-building activities among the MOBSE staff; and (x) support for bi-
monthly coordination committee meetings (CCMs) and Inter-Ministerial SMT meetings in
Regions 1-6. The Project is also using the same PCU to coordinate project activities.

46.     There were only four months between the close of the Third Education Project Phase II
and the effectiveness of the IDA- and GPE-funded READ Project in April of 2014. Nonetheless,
to support activities during this transition, the Government received a project preparation
advance (PPA) in the amount of US$1.4 million in September 2013 to support a number of
activities within the MOBSE for early childhood care and development (ECCD), professional
development for teachers, and M&E capacity-building. Moving forward, it will be important for
the MOBSE to continue to encourage teachers, especially those who have benefited from
training in the final year of the Project, to take the WASSCE.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

47.    The Project’s emphasis on improving the quality of education, specifically enhancing
teacher performance and institutional capacity-building was evidenced in a number of far-
reaching activities. In addition to reaching a large number of beneficiaries, the Project is
expected to have a positive impact on the education sector in the medium- and long-term. Some
                                                14
of the Project’s major achievements included: the provision of intensive pre-service and in-
service teacher training to over 4,000 teachers which amounted to 90 percent of the qualified
primary teachers in the country at the time. Despite the difficult task of recruiting teachers to
voluntarily undertake assessments and participate in training to enhance their basic subject and
pedagogic knowledge and teaching skills, there was a high level of participation among teachers
in the entire training. In addition to strengthening teachers’ capacity, this activity also built
capacity within the Gambia College and the MOBSE, institutions which were responsible for
providing this training. The Project also supported major reforms including a performance-based
management approach and regular coordination committee meetings (CCMs) that allowed for
strong monitoring and implementation at the Directorate-level. The Project also provided
support to the construction of the first multi-grade schools in the country. These schools were
established in remote hard-to-reach areas of the country – increasing access amongst rural
populations. The operation also financed literacy training for 4,839 literacy learners throughout
the country which has also introduced a new partnership approach to literacy training in The
Gambia. Finally, the Project supported for the first time, the development of STI and Higher
Education strategies and policies through its support of the newly established MOHERST. The
latter were instrumental in strengthening the sector’s ability to prepare the workforce with the
necessary skill set to increase the country’s competitiveness and long-term economic
growth/development potential.

48.     Section 2 described three phases of implementation: Phase I - effectiveness to June 2010
(AF/first restructuring); Phase II - June 2010 to December 2012 (second restructuring); and
Phase III - December 2012 to December 2013 (project closing). This section, however, will look
at the Project in relation to two distinct periods: Period I (spanning from effectiveness to June
2010 when the AF and first restructuring took place) and Period II (spanning from June 2010 to
project closing in December 31, 2013).

49.     This approach (rather than a three-phased one) will be employed for the following
reasons: (i) major aspects of the Project (i.e., PDO, components, etc.) were not revised in the
December 2012 restructuring; (ii) the Project’s performance in terms of relevance, efficacy and
efficiency was consistent from June 2010 until December 31, 2013 10; and (iii) from an analytical
standpoint, the Project can be both better understood and evaluated by looking at the period from
June 2010 to December 2013 as a whole, rather than two discrete periods.

Relevance of Objectives

50.     The Project, as designed and implemented, addressed key development priorities that
remain relevant to The Gambia today. The original PDO – to improve the conditions for teaching
and learning in basic education – was and still remains a critical focus of the Government’s
Education Policy and Strategy as well as its Education Sector Plan (ESP). The Government’s
emphasis on improving the performance of students, teachers and schools highlighted the quality
of basic education as a major priority. This assessment was also echoed in the JAS. In addition,


10
  Since the project performance was the same, as described above, the evaluation would arrive at the same overall
conclusions and outcome ratings.


                                                       15
the Project’s focus on capacity-building, performance management and improvements to the
M&E system have been important measures in both increasing capacity and strengthening
accountability in the sector. Finally, the Project’s emphasis on expanding access to schooling
among undeserved communities addressed an important need in the sector and was aligned with
GPE goals for The Gambia.

51.     Under the 2010 AF/Restructuring, the PDO was modified. 11 The revised PDO was “to
improve access of underserved communities to, and quality, of education in The Gambia, with a
particular focus on primary education (lower-basic education) and teacher quality”. Although
the wording of the PDO changed, the intent of the operation – to improve quality and access
while strengthening institutional capacity – did not change over the life of the Project and this
objective remains relevant today.

52.    For these reasons, the relevance of the Project Development Objectives in both project
periods is rated Substantial.

Relevance of Design

53.     The original project design was well-aligned with national priorities during both project
periods, as evidenced in the close alignment between the Government’s education policy and
original CAS (as well as the subsequent JAS). The Project design built on successes of Phase I
of the Project as well as key lessons learnt. Further, its emphasis on improving the quality of
teaching was appropriate given the limited number of qualified teachers in the country. By
focusing less on school construction under Phase II, the Project design was able to narrow its
focus on the most pressing priority – that is, enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in
The Gambia. Despite these strengths, the design had a number of shortcomings: (i) a complex
RF with a large number of PDO-level indicators, many of which did not have baseline values or
end-of-project targets, a number of them were not fully -defined and a few were sector-wide
measures rather than project-specific ones. It is important, however, to highlight that at this time
and in the context of EFA projects that it was common and a widely accepted approach to
include sector-wide measures in the Project RF. These issues were of particular concern as (ii)
an M&E system was not already in place which would be needed to monitor project
implementation and progress. In addition, (iii) the design did not fully take into account that
some activities were to be implemented in recently established institutions (i.e., MOHERST and
UTG).

54.     During the second period of the Project, as a result of changes introduced under the
AF/Restructuring, the relevance of the project design was improved upon. The teacher
assessment conducted in year 1 of the WSD IE in 2009 highlighted the need for further
investment in improving teachers’ content knowledge in order to improve the quality of teaching
and learning outcomes in the Gambia. The AF, therefore, was underpinned by analytical work
making the design more relevant to the sector’s most pressing needs. To address these needs, the
Project’s revised design supported a new method of delivering in-service training through

11
     As stated in the AF Project Paper and FA (Financing Agreement) dated July 8, 2010.


                                                         16
information and communication technology (ICT) to ensure availability of good quality teachers;
and (ii) providing TA to the newly established MOHERST to enhance its capacity given
increasing enrollment at the primary level which, in turn, was putting pressure on tertiary
education to further expand. The RF was also appropriately adjusted to capture project-specific
achievements and adjust target values. At the same time, despite these improvements, the
project design was not adjusted to account for potential delays in construction (as a result of the
18 month INT investigation) and potential difficulties in providing teacher training through an e-
learning approach.

55.    On the basis of the above information, on balance, the relevance of overall project design
under both periods of the Project is Modest.

Relevance of Implementation

56.     The focus and approach of this Project corresponded to the overall needs of the sector
and the Government. The following were achieved during the first project period: (i) training of
head teachers to obtain a Bachelor’s degree in education, training in early grade reading and the
training of cluster monitors, (ii) provision of girls’ scholarships; (iii) delivery of supplementary
readers; (iv) under the tertiary education sector support, a few of the initial research grants for
the competitive fund had been awarded; and (iv) the functional analyses supported under DfID
was used to inform the SLAs (performance contracts) as well as other capacity-building
activities.

57.     During the second period, following the AF/Restructuring in 2010, arrangements
continued as envisioned with steady progress on the implementation of project activities. Despite
this, the construction of two basic cycle schools was not completed by project closing (with a
review undertaken by the Bank finding that approximately 85-90 percent of the civil works were
complete).

58.     On the basis of the ratings for the relevance of project development objectives
(Substantial) and relevance of project design (Moderate), the overall relevance of the Project is
rated Moderate. The shortcomings in the design of the operation are given greater weight (than
the relevance of the project objectives) as they were more consequential in terms of the specific
outputs and outcomes that could feasibly be achieved under the Project.




                                                17
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

59.     The original PDO and PDO-level indicators were maintained during the first period of
the Project. The weighting used for the ratings is based on the net financing for the Project
(including the original financing plus the AF). During the first period (effectiveness to June
2010), 45.1 percent of the total project amount was disbursed with the remaining funding (54.9
percent) disbursed during the second period of the Project (June 2010 to December 31, 2013). 12
Achievements for each period will be discussed in relation to the original and revised PDOs and
associated performance indicators. For a complete list of indicators across the project life, refer
to Annexes 2 and 10.

Period I (Effectiveness – AF/Restructuring of June 2010)

PDO-level Indicators

60.   The Project had nine original PDO-level indicators. The table below shows progress
made on each of these indicators during this first period.

 *This baseline value (raw score) is taken from the Monitoring Learning Assessment (MLA) which was conducted from
 1998 to 2003. National Assessment Test (NAT) is being currently conducted. Although the project documents are
 somewhat unclear, a 70% increase over the baseline values was envisioned by project closing (this applies to both the total
 and the figure for females).
 **The PAD indicates both 58% and 62% for UBS. But 58% is the correct figure.
 *** This was delayed primarily due to the prolonged INT investigation as a result of a complaint from one of the bidders
 and the requested re-launching the bidding process.



61.      During the first project period, progress towards achievement of the PDO was observed
with progress under a number of the PDO-level indicators. Most had not yet been achieved in
full, as their targets were meant to be achieved only by the original project closing date of March
31, 2011.

62.     In terms of PDO-level indicators: (i) instruction time had increased from 690 hours in
2005 to 710 hours; (ii) absenteeism had decreased among head-teachers, teachers, and students
by 15 percent from the previous year (2009); (iii) student learning had improved evidenced in
increases on the Monitoring Learning Assessment (MLA); (iv) the basic education completion
rate had increased from 62 percent to 73 percent (in LBS) and from 58 percent to 60 percent (in
UBS); (v) a performance monitoring system and incentive framework were in place at the
central and regional levels; and (vi) a functioning organizational structure was established as a
result of the analysis undertaken by the DfID BESPOR Project and support from this Project.

63.    However, there had been limited achievement in terms of: the number of additional
students accessing basic education in under-served areas as a result of delays in school
construction caused by the 18 month INT investigation and required re-launching of the bidding
process; and literacy learners had not completed training but they had been identified and
contracted by the end of this period. Finally, there are no data on the level of parents’ and
students’ satisfaction (and this indicator was subsequently dropped as it was not properly
defined).

64.    The following provides an overview of achievements during the first period of the Project
by specific objectives (PDOs 1- 3) which are correlated with Components 1- 3.

Project Development Objective 1: Improving performance of students, teachers and schools

65.    Under Component 1, the Project provided teacher and head teacher training and piloted
the PTC extension program. Specifically, the Project trained 912 head teachers of which 169
completed a Bachelor’s of Education degree. This Component also provided training in early
grade reading to 2,979 teachers of Grades 1, 2 and 3 as well as head teachers, deputy head
                                                            19
teachers and cluster monitors. During the course of this training, some of the teachers were also
exposed to the Jolly Phonics approach. Each cluster monitor visited each of ten schools three
times a month for a period of four hours. During this time, the cluster monitors visited schools on
a regular basis – checking the attendance of teachers and students, conducting classroom
observation to improve teaching and learning, and discussing with teachers on how to improve
their teaching methods.

66.     This Component also financed the purchase and delivery of instructional materials
including: 155,000 supplementary readers and an additional 25,000 (in English) were distributed
for a total of 180,000 readers. This Component supported a girls’ scholarship scheme in which
more than 15,000 girls in UBS and senior secondary school (SSS) (representing one-third of the
country’s UBS and SSS female students in 2006) received scholarships under the Project.
Specifically, these scholarships covered school fees, cost of textbooks and exam fees for
disadvantaged girls. These scholarships aimed to reduce the likelihood that these girls would
drop out of the education system.

67.    There was also an increase in female enrollment in UBS observed under the project from
46 percent in 2004 (before the project) to 50 percent in 2013 (after the project) and in SSS from
42 percent to 48 percent during the same time period which points to a potentially positive
impact of girls’ scholarships on their enrollment (though there was no IE or rigorous analysis to
determine the direct impact of the Project-supported interventions, the Project did provide
scholarships to poorer girls).

Project Development Objective 2: Strengthening capacity-building and performance
management, and enhancing monitoring and evaluation

68.      In order to achieve this objective, the Project provided support for the creation of a more
effective organizational structure within the MOBSE. The functional analysis was conducted in
2007 under the DfID-funded BESPOR Project. 13 Based on this analysis, steps were taken to
ensure that MOBSE’s structure was more robust with roles and responsibilities more clearly
defined, qualified personnel were assigned to key roles, and senior management was
participating in work-flow analysis. On this basis, SLAs (i.e., performance contracts) were
created and signed at all levels of the system (financed under this Project and supported under
the BESPOR Project). Though the target was specifically for SLAs to be signed by head
teachers, the Project was able to scale up this activity to include all teachers. 14 The performance
management system and incentive framework was established and functional in the MOBSE and
in all regional directorates. These reforms enhanced accountability within the sector and allowed
for the identification of best practices and for sanctioning those that were not delivering.

69.     The Project also financed management training (based on a module developed under the
Project) for 529 head teachers (who received a certificate); supported capacity-building and

13
   The selected candidate who would conduct the functional analysis was not able to be hired under the project, as he
was a former WB consultant. Therefore, he was hired under the BESPOR Project.
14
   SLAs, which were developed prior to the restructuring, were signed between MOBSE and all public basic and
secondary school teachers. Having 500 signed SLAs was one of the major triggers in the First Economic
Governance Reform Grant Project (P123679).

                                                        20
strengthening of M&E systems (though there were no PDO-level indicators related to M&E);
and supported DOSBSE in putting in place both short- and long-term capacity development
activities for central and regional staff.

70.     Co-financing (in the amount of US$3 million) from a PHRD - Japanese trust fund grant
provided additional support to capacity building under the Project (Component 2). Specifically,
this funding provided support to strengthen the capacity of central and regional MOBSE staff
through the provision of training while also funding participation in Bachelor, Masters, and
Doctoral-level courses both in-country and abroad. In addition, training was provided to
construction monitors, procurement staff and information technology (IT) professionals while
seminars and workshops were offered to all levels of management. A selected number of staff
obtained degrees (e.g., MBA, MA in Construction Management, MPhil in Educational
Management, BSc Quantity Surveying, BA School Broadcasting, BSc Informational
Technology, MA English Language, MSc Curriculum Management). All trained staff returned
to work in the MOBSE. The PHRD grant also financed the procurement and installation of a new
software system as well as training to improve transparency in financial management and
procurement practices. Specific training was also provided in textbook publishing and book
distribution methods so that textbooks could be procured smoothly under the Project. Finally,
given the limited M&E capacity, training in data management and analysis was also provided.

Project Development Objective 3: Continuing expansion of effective access to under-served
communities

71.     Under the Project, it was envisaged that 36 urban classrooms and 16 multi-grade
classrooms would be constructed and equipped. At the end of the first phase, the tender process
for consulting on designs of multi-grade classrooms had been concluded. However, construction
had not progressed as smoothly as envisioned. This was in part a result of the 18 month INT
investigation which resulted in the need to re-launch the bidding process. Further, though
literacy providers had not been trained, they were selected during this first phase and their
contracts were about to be signed. Given these delays in implementation, the number of literacy
learners was downscaled to 2,400/year with a total of 4,800 learners to be supported under the
project.

Intermediate-level indicators

72.    Progress was made on each of the intermediate-level indicators for which data were
available during this period. Progress under each of the indicators is as follows: (i) teachers were
using early grade reading strategies in schools, with cluster monitor reports; (ii) schools were
engaged in school improvement activities; (iii) 60 head teachers had received certificates in
management at UTG in 2007/08 and an additional 109 had enrolled in 2008/09; and 263 people
obtaining the PTC and 117 obtaining the HTC from The Gambia College; (iv) pedagogical
support was being provided to schools with consistent visits from cluster monitors; (v) the NAT
was reintroduced to assess learning outcomes of Grades 3 and 5 students; (vi) improvements
were made in terms of performance monitoring and feedback with 498 SLAs between lower,
upper basic and senior secondary head-teachers and the MOBSE signed (as noted above, all the
teachers from LBS, UBS and SSS signed SLAs, which exceeded the target); and (vii) training in

                                                21
teaching reading skills was provided to all teachers of Grades 1, 2 and 3 and headmasters and
senior teachers in the six regions.

73.     Under the 2010 AF/Restructuring, the PDO was revised and the RF was simplified with
the number of PDO-level indicators reduced from nine to five (and several intermediate-level
indicators were simplified and dropped). Further, many of the indicators’ targets were revised.
Most of the activities initiated in the first phase of the Project continued with two main additions
to Component 1 as described earlier. The revised PDO was “to improve access of underserved
communities to, and quality of, education in The Gambia, with a particular focus on primary
education (lower-basic education) and teacher quality.”

PDO Objective 1: Improved access of undeserved communities

74.    The two main activities initiated early in the Project life to achieve this objective were: (i)
the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms; and (ii) support to literacy courses through the
involvement of local operators. Each of these activities continued during the second phase.
Although there were initial delays in the implementation of the literacy activity as a result of
limited familiarity with procedures and contracting of local operators, this activity led to the
development of a new partnership approach to the delivery of literacy training in The Gambia.
As a result of these efforts, the PDO-level indicator target on training of literacy learners was

                                                      22
exceeded with 4,839 literacy learners completing 300 hours of courses (exceeding the target of
3,000 literacy learners completing 300 hours). The number of additional students enrolled in
lower basic education (Grades 1 – 6) had increased by 931 (falling short of the end-of-project
target of 2,200 additional students). This was attributed to the fact that the construction of two
basic cycle schools had not been completed. These were, however, recently completed under the
READ Project and the enrollment is expected to increase to reach 2,200 when the new school
year starts in September 2014 (next school census is in November 2014). Under the Project, the
completion rate in Grade 6 reached 73 percent by the time of project closing, not meeting the
target of 80 percent. However, as this was a sector-wide indicator (and, therefore, could not be
attributed solely to the Project) it was dropped under the 2012 restructuring.

PDO Objective 2: Improved quality of education with focus on primary (LBS) and teacher
quality

75.      The additional activities financed under the AF of June 2010 were completed at the time
of the project closing. The in-service teacher (INSET) training that aimed to increase teachers’
content knowledge in lower basic education was provided to approximately 3,000 teachers (out
of a total of 4,000 LBS teachers) over a period of 110 days. Though originally an e-learning
method of delivery was envisioned, a delay in the set-up of e-learning centers prevented this
from being realized under the Project and instead the training was provided face-to-face. There
was a high level of continuity with around 80 percent of those teachers who enrolled in the
program in 2011 remaining in the program until the end (the last training was provided in
September 2013). Teachers took assessments at the end of each training module with those
teachers passing the final module also taking the WASSCE exam. However, as it was found that
obtaining credits of WASSCE requires content knowledge beyond that needed to teach at the
primary level, training supported under the Project shifted to focus on acquiring the basic content
knowledge required to teach in primary schools. Approximately 2,000 teachers participating in
the INSET Program took the WASSCE exam (2,003 took the English exam and 2,043 took the
Math exam). The test results suggest that the majority of these teachers now possess the basic
content knowledge required to teach in primary schools in both Math and English. The details of
the test results can be found in Annex 2.

76.       The PDO-level indicator “percentage of targeted teachers obtaining the West African
Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) credits in English and/or Mathematics (with a
target of 30%)” was achieved. Of those teachers who took the WASSCE in 2012, 60 percent
obtained credits in English and/or Mathematics.
77.     The other new activities supported under the AF (capacity-building within the newly
established MOHERST and support for two studies for the tertiary education sector) were
completed by the time of project closing. Both of these studies contributed significantly to the
development of related strategies and have strengthened capacity within the MOHERST.
Specifically, these policies/strategies have laid the foundations for a diagnostic of the status of
the sector and key priorities moving forward. In addition, as a result of cost savings under the
Project, MOHERST was also able to fund the following: (i) drafting of the Higher Education
Act; (ii) drafting of guidelines and validation of the Accreditation and Quality Assurance Board
(AQAB); (iii) the development of STI and research and development (R&D) indicators; and (iv)
other activities tailored to strengthen capacity within MOHERST.

                                                23
      78.    Though this indicator was not included in the RF, the team tracked progress in terms of
      the percentage of students reaching grade level competence in Grades 3 and 5 based on the
      National Assessment Test (NAT). Test results show a significant increase in minimum (40
      percent) and mastery (70 percent) levels between 2010 and 2013 – pointing to improvements in
      student learning outcomes. However, it should be noted that the test items in the NAT were not
      linked directly to each other (and, therefore, are not necessarily comparable and as such, it
      cannot be fully confirmed that students’ learning has improved). Under the new READ Project,
      however, the 2012 and 2017 NAT items will be linked in order to better demonstrate increases in
      student learning.

      79.     As shown in the table below, the percentage of students reaching grade level competence
      in grades 3 and 5 in the in the 2013 National Assessment Test (NAT) has increased significantly
      from the 2010 baseline for both the minimum (40 percent) and mastery (70 percent) levels.
      However, it should be noted that the test items in the NAT were not linked directly to each other
      (and, therefore, are not necessarily comparable and as such, it cannot be fully confirmed that
      students’ learning has improved). Under the new READ project, the 2012 and 2017 NAT items
      will be linked in order to better demonstrate increases in student learning.

      80.    Finally, the overall PDO-level indicator on number of direct project beneficiaries was
      exceeded reaching 17,948 individuals (significantly greater than the target of 8,800 beneficiaries).
      When taking into account all of the individuals who benefitted from the Project 15 , the total
      number of beneficiaries reached around 292,000.

      Intermediate-level indicators

         Specifically, 529 head teachers were trained in management education and leadership, 2,730 teachers in in-service
      face to face program (AF), 5,598 teachers in in-service teacher training (original IDA), 912 benefiting from training
      at the levels of certificates, bachelor and master's degrees, 931 children enrolled in the new classrooms, 15,000 girls
      received scholarships, 4,839 participated in literacy classes, 2,679 headmasters and deputy head masters benefitted
      from training, and 257,000 students received textbooks.


                                                               24
81.     During the second period of the Project, the RF included 15 intermediate-level result
indicators three of which were dropped and three of which were revised under the December
2012 restructuring. Progress was observed under all but one of these indicators. Activities that
supported the achievements of these indicators included: (i) training of pedagogic leaders and
mentor teachers at the schools; (ii) training and monitoring tools for tracking school level data
including introduction of cluster monitors; (iii) intensive in-service teacher training; (iv)
provision of textbooks and teachers’ guides of all Grades 1-4 core subjects and English and
Mathematics Grades 7-9 textbooks for all Government and grant aided schools; (v) ensuring
annual NATs and bi-annual EGRAs were conducted; (vi) providing TA to develop a higher
education and STI policy and an operational STI strategy; and (vii) providing financial support
and TA for the construction of schools.

82.     Under the Project, the following was achieved in terms of intermediate-level indicators:
(1) 90 percent of teachers were attending school for at least 18 days on a monthly basis
(exceeding the target of 85 percent); (2) 42 percent of targeted teachers took the WASSCE
(exceeding the target of 30 percent); (3) MOBSE had developed a viable business plan for
continued service provision (achieving the target); (4) 5,598 teachers participated in INSET
training (exceeding the target of 3,000); (5) 529 head teachers were trained in management and
education leadership (exceeding target of 400); (6) at least 75 percent of schools were collecting
data on instructional time on a bi-annual basis (achieving the target); (7) cluster monitors were
spending four hours in each school every month (achieving the target); (8) a learning assessment
system (EGRA, NAT) was in place (achieving the end-of-project target); (9) a higher education
and STI policy had been developed (achieving the end-of-project target); (10) a STI strategy had
been developed (achieving the indicator target); and (11) additional classrooms had been
built/rehabilitated. The indicator target was 16 multi-grade classrooms (of which all were
completed) and 36 classrooms from 2 basic cycle schools. Though progress was made under the
Project (being between 85 and 90 percent complete by project closing), the construction of the
two basic cycle schools was not fully completed under the Project, but has since been completed
under the READ Project.

83.     Of the original intermediate-level indicators, the indicator on Directorates at the central
and regional levels benefiting from bonuses was dropped under the 2012 restructuring because it
would no longer be financed by the Project but by the Government’s budget; and the indicator
measuring Average hours of content delivery in ECSELs during project life (number) was no
longer tracked because e-learning centers became available to teachers only recently. In addition,
the indicator on schools receiving school grants was also dropped under the 2012 restructuring
(as the activity was dropped from the Project) (though 184 schools received grants under the
DfID program) and in September 2013, every public lower basic school started receiving school
grants under the Government’s budget and the new READ Project.

84.     Other achievements related to the second activity (support to the Tertiary Education
sector) under the AF included the following (with respect to intermediate-level indicators):
MOHERST staff were trained in M&E, Planning and Research, Budgeting, Education Indicators
and Higher Education Management (i.e., post graduate and PhD training). Moreover, towards
the end of the Project, MOHERST was proactive in using the remaining AF funding to: (i)
develop a database for the sector with data collected from 98 learning centers, 3 universities and

                                                25
95 tertiary education centers offering various general and TVET programs and designing a
website that hosts this database; and (ii) develop a survey report on STI and R&D indicators.

3.3 Efficiency

85.     The Gambia’s Third Education Project – Phase II has already led to significant efficiency
and economic gains, demonstrated by examinations of the following benefits: (i) internal
efficiency with a cost-effectiveness analysis of outcomes and implementation; (ii) external
efficiency with a cost-benefit analysis of quantifiable benefits; and (iii) fiscal sustainability of
Project activities.

86.     The cost-effectiveness analysis shows improvements in efficiency due to quality
enhancements, reduced wastage at the system level, low unit costs, and effective Project
implementation. Successful efforts to enhance teacher quality have contributed to higher levels
of student learning on available student assessments, as the most recent rounds of EGRA show a
significant drop in the percentage of children who cannot read anything. 16 Higher quality of
education and more efficient student learning has also led to gains in efficiency at the system
level, as the time it takes to produce one graduate has decreased from 8.93 years of investment
on average 17 to 6.59 years. The improved efficiency results in a reduced total cost equivalent of
producing one primary school graduate from an estimated US$190 to US$179 18.

87.    In addition to efficiency gains, provision of instructional materials was cost-effective
when compared to similar initiatives in other African countries. The Project provided learning
materials at unit costs of US$1.23 for readers, US$0.43 for grades 1 to 4 textbooks, and US$2.49
for Grades 7 to 9 (produced in the UK), compared to project costs in the following countries: (i)
Burundi, US$1.15 19; (ii) Eritrea, US$0.60 20; and (iii) Mauritania, US$0.73 21. Classrooms were
also constructed cost-effectively when compared to similar projects supported by other partners,
with the unit cost of Project classroom construction of US$18,874, which is lower than units
costs for BADEA of US$ 31,404 and for AfDB of US$19,412. This cost-effectiveness is
especially impressive considering the Project’s additional costs to make all classrooms accessible
to physically disabled children.

88.     Project implementation can also be considered efficient in some ways. At the time of the
project closing, about 96 percent of the original grant (2.3 percent was transferred to the new
project and 1.2 percent was cancelled) and 100 percent of the AF amount had been disbursed,
showing that the Project team used almost all available funds toward Project activities. The
Project exceeded expected progress in several key indicators, including 4,839 learners attending
literacy courses of 300 hours over the target of 3,000 learners; 60 percent of targeted teachers
obtaining WASSCE credits in English and/or mathematics over the target of 30 percent; and
about 292,000 direct project beneficiaries over the target of 8,800. The Project has enrolled 74

percent of the intended additional 2,200 LBS students in new classrooms as the construction of
basic cycle schools had not been completed at the Project close. However, as of August 2014, the
construction of all classrooms was complete and enrollment is expected to increase to about
2,200 when the 2014/15 school year starts.

89.    External efficiency shows positive Net Present Value (NPV) and a high Internal Rate of
Return (IRR), as assessed through a cost-benefit analysis of the Project’s quantifiable benefits in
the areas of quality (direct and indirect impact of Project activities as related to improved
learning) and access/equity (new classroom construction and equipment as well as girls’
scholarships). Under conservative assumptions, the Project will generate a total of US$25.5
million in benefits against US$6.5 million in costs, yielding an NPV of US$19.0 million, an IRR
of 28 percent, and a benefit to cost ratio of 3.9. A sensitivity analysis showed that the NPV of the
Project could range from US$1.4 million in the low case to US$28.5 million in the high case,
leading to benefit to cost ratios of 1.2 to 5.5, and IRR from 13 percent to 35 percent respectively.
Therefore, even with the most conservative assumptions, the Project will contribute to net
economic gains due to expansion of access and quality improvements.

90.     The Project’s sustainability depends on the Government’s continued support to education
as well as capacity to absorb additional costs necessitated by the Project. Costs associated with
the Project focus on maintenance of the newly constructed classrooms, which represent a very
minimal amount of annual spending, and hiring a small number of teachers. Both of these costs
should be feasibly financed, for example, at much less than 1 percent of planned spending for
2014. In addition, the Project activities related to better accountability in Component 2 are
anticipated to contribute to more efficient use of funds (although the precise impact is difficult to
quantify).

91.     The Project has also contributed inputs to areas that were high-need, which may mean
high returns (although returns by specific input are also difficult to quantify). For example, the
Project provided 180,000 readers and over 360,000 textbooks for Lower Basic Education (LBE)
and Upper Basic Education (UBE) schools in a system. In addition, the Project provided key in-
service training in early grade literacy and numeracy to 3,000 teachers, and increased the formal
qualifications of 335 teachers in a system where 30 percent of LBE teachers were unqualified
and many teachers fell in the 30 to 40 percent achievement range in the entrance exam in core
subjects at Project baseline. Additionally, the Project provided scholarships to 15,000 in regions
where girls’ Gross Enrollment Rates (GERs) range from 31.1 percent to 63.8 percent in 2014,
compared to the national average of 68.1 percent.

92.     Given significant gains in internal and external efficiency attributed to the Project as well
as a favorable outlook for sustainability of activities, Project efficiency is rated as High. For
detailed efficiency analysis under the Project, refer to Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

93.     The Project focused on addressing the key challenges facing the basic education sector in
The Gambia and supported the Government in achieving its strategic objectives (improving the
quality of teaching and learning, while strengthening capacity building) in the sector. The
Project’s Development Objectives remain substantially relevant to the Government’s current
strategic goals in the education sector. The Government, Bank and the donors have agreed to
continue to build upon and scale-up a number of activities which were supported under this
operation. Though the Project’s objectives were well-aligned with the Government’s strategic
agenda, and the design built upon the successes of Phase 1 of this Project, a few shortcomings
were also evident: (i) the M&E system needed for data collection, monitoring and reporting was
not initially established, and (ii) a number of performance indicators lacked baseline values
and/or end-of-project targets.. Under the AF and restructuring of 2010, relevant modifications
were made to the design, including: adjustment of activities and indicators (including targets) to
reflect what could be feasibly accomplished in the remaining period of the project and increased
focus on building the M&E capacity within the Government. On the basis of the analysis
provided in the ICR (and summarized above), the relevance of objectives and design is rated
Modest for both periods of the Project.

94. As documented in the ICR and detailed in Annexes 2 and 3, the Project achieved a number
of outputs and outcomes, including among others: the provision of in-service teacher training to
almost 6,000 teachers as well as other key staff in the education system (i.e., head teachers, etc.);
the construction of the first multi-grade schools in the country (16) in remote areas of the
country; provision of literacy training to 4,389 literacy learners; supply of 180,000 readers; and
the provision of scholarships to 15,000 girls. The Project also supported capacity-building
through the development of Higher Education and STI strategy and policy; support to the
functioning of the MOBSE and MOHERST; the introduction of a performance monitoring
system with SLAs signed with all education staff; support to the development of a management
training module; and provision of management training to staff at various levels. In addition,
regular student and teacher assessments were undertaken (of teachers and students), and the
M&E system had been strengthened at the local and central levels. As described earlier, On the
basis of the analysis provided in the ICR (and summarized above), the efficacy of the Project
during the first period is rated Modest and for the second period is rated Substantial. On balance,
and given the weighting based on disbursements under each Period, the overall efficacy rating is
Substantial.

95. Based on the information presented in Section 3.3 and detailed in Annex 3, efficiency is
rated High for both periods of the Project. The cost-effectiveness analysis shows improvements
in the efficiency due to quality enhancements, reduced wastage at the system level, low unit
costs and effective project implementation.

96.   In light of the above and on the table below, the Overall Outcome Rating for the Project
is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

97.      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The Project appears to have
had a positive impact on gender and social development issues. Some of the main activities
undertaken to improve equitable access to education included: the construction of eight multi-
grade schools in targeted rural areas in Regions 3-6 and provision of girls’ scholarships in
Regions 3-6 (these are the most impoverished areas in The Gambia), which may have
contributed to increased attendance in schools (particularly among girls) in disadvantaged areas.
Intake rates and completion rate in LBS in Regions 3-6 increased more than those in Regions 1
and 2. In 2006, LBS intake rates were 92, 88, 61, 64, 66, 51 percent for Regions 1 to 6,
respectively. By 2013 these rates had increased to: 122, 157, 106, 110, 92, 115 percent for
Regions 1 to 6 respectively. Similarly, completion rates also increased over the same time
period from 70.7, 65, 31, 41, 24, and 18 percent to 100, 82, 65, 75, 41 and 54 percent, in Regions
1 to 6, respectively.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

98.    A key improvement in the institutional set-up in the sector under the Project was the
introduction of SLAs (i.e., performance based contracts – PBCs) for MOBSE which were
successfully implemented under the Project. MOBSE and PCU staff were all under SLAs
whereby staff were held accountable for delivering a pre-determined and agreed set of results.
This increased accountability and ownership of tasks performed among staff in the Ministry.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

99.    A stakeholder workshop in Banjul was undertaken following Project closing.
Specifically, the workshop sought to: (i) collate perceptions on the projects ability to address
                                                   29
quality of education and improvement in access and (ii) gauge the impact of the project on other
dimensions . The ICR team also held key informant interviews and focus group discussions with
project staff from different Regions. Participants included school teachers, head teachers, senior
management staff in MOBSE, as well as PCU staff and other MOBSE staff from various
directorates.

100. Beneficiaries generally agreed that the Project had had a positive impact on both access
and quality of education in The Gambia. The participants also shared their perspectives on the
relevance of project design as well as challenges faced during the implementation of the Project.
In addition lessons learned from this operation were discussed which can inform future activities
in the sector. A summary of the findings from this workshop are described in Annex 4.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

101. The risks identified in the PAD were appropriate. The following table provides a
summary review of the risks and mitigation measures identified at appraisal while also providing
an evaluation of these same risks at the time of preparation of the ICR. This section also includes
an assessment of the Risk to Development Outcome in the post-project period.

Rating scale: H= High; S=Substantial; M= Modest/Marginal; L= Low or Negligible

102. The Risk to Development Outcome following the end of this Project is rated Moderate.
The Government continues to demonstrate a high level of commitment to the education sector
(through support from the national budget and its own financing of key activities supported
under this Project such as the funding of hardship allowances to incentivize teachers to work in
remote areas).      Further, since Project closing, the Government has completed the two basic
cycle schools that had been originally included under this Project and were transferred to the new
READ Project. Given the emphasis on capacity-building under the Project, the MOBSE is able
to continue to identify and attract highly qualified personnel and the Government plans to
continue to hold Inter-Ministerial SMT meetings which demonstrates their continued
commitment to supporting and advancing various activities that were initiated under this Project
and that are being continued and scaled-up under the new READ Project. Some of these
activities include: (i) construction of schools in remote areas and water points at new
construction sites; (ii) provision of supplemental readers; (iii) provision of hardship allowances
to teachers in disadvantaged communities; and (iv) provision of increased stipends to teacher
students. In light of the information presented above and given the synergies between this Project
and the new READ Project, the Risk to Development Outcome is rated Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

103. The Bank team worked closely with the Government during project preparation to ensure
strong alignment between project objectives and activities and key strategic documents. These
included, in particular, the ESP, CAS and PRSP. The Project also drew on strong partnerships
with other donors active in the sector which had been established and strengthened under the first
phase of the Project and under the EFA FTI Project. The operation built upon the Bank’s long-
term engagement in the sector and success achieved as well as lessons learnt from these and
other relevant operations. The Project was also the first in the country to focus specifically on
improving the quality of teaching. Despite these positive aspects, there were some shortcomings
which affected quality at entry including: an RF with indicators some of which lacked baseline
values and end-of-project targets and some which were not well-defined; and the absence of a
well-established M&E system capable of regularly collecting and reporting on the various
project-supported interventions. To establish an M&E system capable of collecting data on
project activities, the Bank team worked proactively to obtain a US$3 million PHRD grant. As
such, the Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

104. The joint supervision missions were introduced under this project time frame, and the
Bank team actively participated in joint supervision missions with other donors with all project
aide memoires jointly undertaken with other DPs. This resulted in reduced transaction costs for
the counterparts and better coordination of interventions on the part of the donor community.
Supervision missions thoroughly reviewed the project activities and tried the best to resolve any
bottlenecks with the government, and reporting was candid and detailed for each
project/intervention supported by various donors while overall sector progress was also
described and discussed. There was, however, lacking in the recording of some indicators in the
ISRs due to the fact that ISRs used to not require to record all indicators. The Bank took steps to
support capacity-building, including holding a number of reverse supervision missions in
Washington, DC which allowed the Government (MOBSE and PCU) to acquire additional
knowledge from various regional and sector experts. The Bank also provided TA related to the
introduction of various pilot initiatives (e.g., E-learning, NATs). The team was proactive in
processing the AF/Restructuring in 2010 and ensuring that the newly funded activities
corresponded to existing challenges faced in the sector. The Bank also used this opportunity to
re-frame the PDO and RF appropriately. The Bank was also pro-active in undertaking a Level II
restructuring in 2012 which introduced a small reallocation of resources and further fine-tuned
the RF.



                                                33
105. Despite the Bank’s proactive role in supporting the Government and actively supervising
the Project, there were some important delays in the timely implementation and completion of
project-supported outputs. This was particularly the case with regards to support for civil works
activities. Though an INT investigation was appropriately undertaken, the long duration of this
inquiry (18 months) and a request to re-launch the bidding process resulted in significant delays
in the commencement of key construction activities. This prevented the completion of planned
construction under the Project (specifically, the construction of two basic cycle schools).
Though M&E under the Project did improve (reinforced by the sector’s continuous monitoring
of key indicators), it remained an area that required continuous attention (capacity-building)
from the Bank. Based on the above discussion, the Quality of Bank Supervision is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

106. Based on the Bank performance in terms of both Quality at Entry and Quality of
Supervision, the overall rating for Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

107. The strong commitment and ownership from MOBSE was evident from project
preparation throughout implementation. The Government’s aim to promote access, improve
quality of teaching and support institutional strengthening was evident through its strong
endorsement of the Project. In addition to coordinating joint mission reviews, it acted as a
catalyst for cooperation among all DPs active in the sector. The Government institutionalized
this commitment with regular SMT and CCMs meeting throughout the project life which still
continue today. Moreover, it was commendable that the MOBSE openly acknowledged low
content knowledge that teachers had, and decided to vigorously intervene to improve it. Finally,
the establishment of the MOHERST during the Project life demonstrated the Government’s
strong commitment to supporting higher education, and its view that this sub-sector and
particularly training in S&T are critical to national development.




                                               34
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

108. The majority of the project was implemented by the MOBSE as 93 percent of the funds
were designated for the Basic Education Sector. Further, the PCU was housed within the
MOBSE. This required a high level of cooperation and coordination between the two entities
which was further enhanced under the Project. In addition, the PCU’s fiduciary capacity was
strengthened through project activities. The continuity of staff within the PCU/MOBSE team
was an important factor in the Project’s success and smooth implementation – while also
allowing the PCU to maintain its strong technical capacity in core project-related and
coordination functions.

109. At the same time, however, the supervision of the school construction observed the
progress of the construction of two basic cycle schools more optimistically than the reality,
which resulted in the unfinished schools at the end of the project.

110. The MOBSE complied with the Bank’s Safeguard, FM, and Procurement guidelines.
Interim financial reports (IFRs) were generally submitted on time. The last external audit was
conducted for two weeks in June 2014, for the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31,
2013 for all the World Bank’s education projects in The Gambia including this Project. The total
audit score was 7.35 out of 10.

111. The MOHERST was responsible for implementation of all the activities related to the
tertiary education strategic studies. As the MOHERST was newly established in 2007, it faced
significant start up challenges (during the project life) including weak institutional capacity. Staff
turnover was high in the MOHERST. In time, however, the institution has grown stronger with
regular capacity-building provided to the Ministry staff and has a strong leader (PS) and fully
staffed directorates.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

112. Based on the above discussion, the rating for overall Borrower Performance is
Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

113. Focusing on behavioral change by introducing clear lines of accountability are
necessary for building stronger institutions. This Project’s introduction of a performance-
based management approach, whereby every civil servant in the Ministry had a performance-
based contract (i.e., service level agreement) including teachers, administrative staff, both at
directorate and regional levels provided important incentives for behavioral change at all levels.
This major reform institutionalized accountability and performance monitoring which has, in
turn, led to the improved functioning of the MOBSE.

                                                 35
114. Open and consultative dialogue is critical for improving teacher performance and
quality of teaching. Making the information available and involving teachers as well as
teacher unions in the preparation of a voluntary in-service teacher training was critical for the
success of the teacher training activity financed under the AF Project. More importantly,
consensus building via the local Bantabas showed a responsible Government’s attitude and led
to the voluntary enrollment of 80 percent of qualified lower basic teachers into the program to
improve content knowledge.

115. Continuity in the composition of the Government and World Bank team fostered
strong relationships and a high level of trust among partners that facilitated the Project’s
implementation and making important changes on a consensus basis. Senior management
within the Government and the Bank team were by and large stable across the life of the Project
and this level of continuity was valuable to the Project. Though ensuring such consistency is
sometimes difficult given shifts within institutions, this continuity can positively influence the
implementation of project-supported activities and taking swift actions as needed when
confronted with important bottlenecks.

116. Supporting and drawing on local partners (private local operators) can be useful in
ensuring effective delivery and sustainability of an intervention. Under the Project, literacy
activities relied on the work of local private operators for implementation wherein literacy
training was provided to more than 4,839 learners. The reach (and effectiveness) of this activity
was likely much greater than an externally supported activity might have been.

117. Improving the quality of teaching and teachers’ performance is driven by both
capacity-building and the provision of incentives. The Project contributed to an increased
level of confidence and motivation among teachers as the activities supported under the Project
improved their content knowledge in key subjects and, in turn, their capacity to teach. The salary
increase received by some teachers for obtaining WASSCE credits as well as the provision of a
hardship allowance to teachers working in remote areas also highlights the importance of
providing teachers with attractive incentives.

118. It is essential to ensure that first, teachers have the basic content knowledge to
teach.. The teachers’ learning assessments undertaken by the Project highlighted the continued
need for support to improving teachers’ content knowledge. It was important to ensure that
training covered basic knowledge needed to teach in lower basic schools – before covering those
areas that would be required to receive WASSCE credit.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      This annex describes the outputs of the three project components: (i) Improved
Conditions for Teaching and Learning (Component 1); (ii) Strengthened Capacity-building,
Performance Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (Component 2); and (iii) Expansion
of Effective Access (Component 3). The original grant amount for the entire operation was
US$8.0 million. An Additional Financing (AF) in the amount of US$5.5 million was provided in
June of 2010 to support activities under Component 1. A complete review of all of the
performance indicators over the life of the Project including baseline values, end-of-project
targets, and end-of-project achievements can be found in Annex 10.

Component 1: Improved Conditions for Teaching and Learning (Appraisal Estimate –
Original Financing: US$5.5 million and Additional Financing: US$5.5 million; Total
Estimate: US$11.0. Actual Expenditure – Original Financing: US$4.22; Additional
Financing: US$5.65; Total Actual Expenditure: US$9.87 million)

2.      The main objective of Component 1 was to improve conditions for teaching and learning.
The Component aimed to support activities that would lead to improvements in: (a) school
performance; (b) teacher performance and behavior; and (c) student performance and
satisfaction. By addressing these three areas, it was expected that the quality of instruction in the
classroom would be strengthened by improving school functioning. This, in turn, would likely
contribute to an increase in the amount of time spent on task. Activities to strengthen school
performance supported under Component 1 included: (i) school-level pedagogic support; (ii)
teacher training activities; and (iii) training for head teachers. The teacher training activities also
supported the Component’s efforts to enhance teacher performance and behavior. In order to
influence and measure improvements in student performance and satisfaction, the Project
developed diagnostic tools to assess student learning and satisfaction. In addition, in order to
support achievement of Component aims, the Project supported: purchase of instructional
materials; capacity building at West Africa Examination Council (WAEC); school improvement
grants; support to girls’ scholarships; and tertiary education strategic studies.

3.      This Component was primarily implemented by the Ministry of Basic and Secondary
Education (MOBSE) with only the activities related to tertiary education implemented by the
Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (MOHERST). By the 2009
mid-term review (MTR) the Project had made progress on most activities supported under
Component 1, especially teacher training activities and the distribution of instructional materials.
During the MTR, it was also agreed that the Project would benefit from an AF in the amount of
US$5.5 million to support teacher in-service training (US$4.45 million) and TA for higher
education (US$1.05 million). It was decided that 80 percent of the AF amount would be used on
activities focusing on improving the quality of teaching given that the above-mentioned study
had identified the low content knowledge among teachers in The Gambia as a major challenge
facing the sector. The AF also provided a TA for higher education given gaps in the quality of
training at the university level (this was also timely given the need to support development
capacity within the newly established MOHERST). Specifically, the two new activities added to



                                                  38
Component 1 under the AF were: (i) in-service teacher training run by the In-Service Education
& Training (INSET) Unit under MOBSE; and (ii) TA to MOHERST.

4.   The following provides information on the implementation of activities and outputs under
Component 1.

(i) School-level pedagogic support. This activity aimed to support the objectives of Component
1 in terms of improving performance of students, teachers and schools. It focused primarily on
providing support to head-teachers given their role in school performance. Specifically, this
activity supported the development of pedagogic reinforcement materials used by the head
teachers. This type of pedagogic support was eventually embedded in the terms of reference
(TORs) of the cluster monitors, mentors and senior teachers as well as head teachers. Over time,
however, this activity appeared to merge with other leadership training supported under the
Project. In addition, the new training and monitoring tools for tracking school-level data (e.g.,
instructional time and classroom observations) were used by the cluster monitors when visiting
schools that they were assigned to monitor. This activity contributed to achievement of the
intermediate-level indicator related to cluster monitors (in charge of monitoring about 10 schools
each, visiting each school three times a month and spending four hours in each visit to check the
attendance of teachers and students, conducting classroom observation to improve teaching and
learning, and discussing with teachers on how to improve teaching methods).

(ii) Teacher training activities. These activities aimed to lead to improvements in teachers’
performance and, in turn, aimed to improve the performance of students. Specifically, the Project
supported efforts to increase the number of teachers participating in pre- and -in-service training.
This training, in particular, focused on improving classroom instruction and providing
certification possibilities for unqualified teachers. To this end, the Project provided stipends to
more than 4,000 teachers who participated in face-to-face training sessions. In addition, the
Project provided training to 231 and 223 mentor teachers in 2006 and 2007. This was higher than
the original end-of-project target of 60. In addition, sensitization and recruitment campaigns
were undertaken to present teaching as a career in order to recruit qualified individuals to the
profession. As a result, the Education Department of The Gambia College has more applications
than the maximum enrollment from more qualified senior secondary graduates than before.
There was an increase in the intake of Primary Teacher Certificate (PTC) candidates from 278
(2007/2008) to more than 1,000 in 2012. As such, The Gambia College was able to raise the bar
on the enrollment requirements.

In response to the low content knowledge of teachers, training was also provided to improve
teachers in early grade reading. Just under 3,000 individuals (2,979) (including teachers of
Grades 1 to 3, head teachers, deputy head teachers and cluster monitors). This was part of a
larger effort to improve reading ability in schools and to expose a small number of teachers to
the use of a teaching approach called Jolly Phonics. An Early Grade Reading Assessment
(EGRA) showed a significant drop from The Gambia’s first EGRA of 2007 to the most recent in
2013 in the percentage of children who could not read anything by the end of the Project.
Finally, the PTC Extension Programme was piloted in Region 5 where all regular unqualified
teachers were trained – gaining skills, knowledge and an increased ability to teach. These
teachers earned the PTC qualification and became qualified teachers. The Program was later

                                                39
expanded through the country with support from The Gambia EFA FTI Project. Project
indicators which aimed to measure progress under this activity included “Availability and
adequacy of pre and in-service training for teachers and school managers.” Under the Project, 60
Head teachers received certificates in management at UTG in 2007/08 and 109 head teachers
enrolled in 2008/09. Further, the Project provided a US$5 per month stipend to all PTC regular,
PTC Islamic, Higher Teaching Certificate (HTC), HTC Primary student teachers. They used the
stipend as part of their living expenses as they did not get salary until they graduated from The
Gambia College. Between 2006 and 2010, 3,151 students (PTC, HTC and PTC Islamic and 1st
cohort of the PTC Extension) graduated from School of Education of The Gambia College.
Finally, additional teacher training activities were added under the Project and the outputs and
outcomes related to the teacher training discussed in this section – and related to the additional
teacher training activities is discussed in further detail below.

(iii) Training of head teachers. Initially, the Project was expected to train 400 head teachers as
pedagogic leaders. Under the Project, 169 head teachers earned a Bachelor’s degree at the
University of The Gambia (UTG).

(iv) Purchase of instructional materials. The purchase of instructional materials aimed to
enhance the performance of students and teachers. Under the Project, 174,801 textbooks were
procured for Grades 1 through 4 and 188,152 textbooks for grades 7 through 9. In addition,
155,000 supplementary readers and 180,000 readers which had not been planned under the
Project were distributed. The PDO-level indicator which measured increased instructional time
was on track prior to the 2010 AF/Restructuring with an increase in instructional time from 690
hours to 710 hours. The end-of-project target was 900 hours. This indicator, though it had
shown important progress, was eventually dropped under the 2010 restructuring as this was
considered a sector-level outcome and could not be attributed to the Project.

(v) Capacity-building at West Africa Examination Council (WAEC). The Project supported
capacity-building among WAEC staff in an effort to enhance the national assessment system.
Three WAEC staff benefited from Masters level courses in Education under the Project. These
staff were critical in ensuring that the project indicator related to the establishment of a NAT and
an EGRA assessment system.

(vi) School improvement grants. These grants aimed to enhance the performance of schools.
They grants were expected to be undertaken on the basis of the findings from an IE study on a
school grants program that had been provided under the DFID-funded BESPOR project.
However, given the delay in the implementation and completion of the IE, the support to school
improvement grants under this Project never materialized in time as the IE was completed only
in year 4 and this was then supported by other source of financing. Preliminary findings from
the IE, however, did show that the WSD intervention had led to a 21 percent reduction in student
absenteeism and a 23 percent reduction in teacher absenteeism, with no impact on learning
outcomes measured by a comprehensive test. Though no additional school grants were provided
under the Project given the delays in undertaking the IE, the IE was critical in guiding the design
of the AF.




                                                40
(vii) Support to the Government’s scholarship trust fund. The Project provided continued
support to basic and senior secondary girls’ scholarships in Regions 3-6. Approximately 15,000
girls benefited from this activity. The girls receiving scholarships were in upper basic (UBS) and
senior secondary school (SSS), representing a third of the country’s UBS and SSS female
students, respectively, in 2006. The Project supported, through these scholarships, the payment
of school fees and covered the cost of textbooks and examinations for disadvantaged girls in
UBS and SSS. This has reduced the likelihood that these girls would drop out of the school
system. Percentage of female enrollment in UBS has increased from 46 percent in 2004 (prior to
the Project) to 50 percent in 2013 (following project closing) and in SSS from 42 percent to 48
percent, during the same time period. Although an IE or rigorous analysis has not been
undertaken to explore the impact of these interventions on improved girls’ enrollment, the
Project points to the possibility that these scholarships have led to increases in girls’ enrollment.

(viii) Tertiary Education Strategic studies. The Project aimed to continue the support it
provided during preparation, by conducting strategic studies including those related to the
integration of higher education institutions, the creation of a competitive research fund, and
feasibility studies for the construction of the main building including a library and media center
(the construction of which will not be part of this project). The Project also aimed to support a
conference for donors interested in post-secondary education, to help Government identify
potential partners in this sector.

By the time of the MTR (2009) the project had successfully undertaken the Integration of the
Tertiary Education System with a new and dynamic Vice Chancellor – the first Gambian national
to occupy the position. Additionally UTG has reorganized itself from the previous structure
(organized by departments) to a new structure comprising eight Undergraduate Schools and a
School of Graduate Studies and Research. In addition to the four tertiary institutions earlier
earmarked for integration (The Gambia College, Management Development Institute – MDI,
Gambia Technical Training Institute – GTTI and UTG), the National Agricultural Research
Institute (NARI) has joined the integration and will host the School of Agriculture and
Environmental Studies. In addition to the above tasks, the Project also sought to support to pilot
a competitive fund for demand based research. An agreement between the MoBSE and the UTG
was signed in January 2009, outlining the structure of the competitive research fund, including
payment modalities and amounts. By the time of the AF only three of the research proposals,
totaling US$38,000, have were found to be eligible for funding. Thus a total of US$22,839 (60
percent) was disbursed for the research proposals. The tertiary institutions integration process
has been successful with a legal instrument to regulate the operation drafted. At the request of
the former Minister of Higher Education, funds initially earmarked for the feasibility study for
the construction of a core building for UTG have been reprogrammed for additional teacher
training at the Gambia Teachers College following government’s decision to focus on the
development of a new campus at Faraba Banta. Finally a conference for donors was successfully
held on the topic of support to the Gambian higher education sector.


Additional activities under Component 1 – introduced under the 2010 AF

(ix) In-service teacher training (INSET). This was the main activity introduced under the AF.
The objective was to upgrade the content knowledge (in English and Mathematics) of

                                                 41
approximately 3,000 teachers who did not meet the West African Senior School Certificate
Examination (WASSCE) credits in Mathematics and English. This was undertaken by the
INSET unit within the MOBSE. Teachers were selected on a voluntary basis. In order to raise
their awareness and interest in the program a strong communications campaign (using public
fora and local media) was undertaken. This activity was successfully implemented, particularly
since enlisting teachers to undertake training and an assessment is often challenging.

Originally, it was envisaged that the E-Center for Support to Excellence in Learning (ECSEL)
would be located at the UTG with its principal function being to deliver lectures and interactive
sessions through e-learning to remote sites (regional offices and clusters) and to produce e-
learning resource materials. There were, however, some challenges in coordination between the
UTG and the MOBSE on setting up this Center and eventually the ECSEL hub was set up in
MOBSE’s regional office in Region 1. Nonetheless, by the end of Project, 1 main hub, 6 regional
e-learning centers and 41 distance e-learning centers had been installed and were fully functional.
The MOBSE’s long-term plan is to provide pre-service teacher training via e-learning centers,
instead of current face to face mode. In order this to happen, a critical piece to be implemented is
connecting the main hub to distance e-learning centers. Unless this connection is established, e-
learning centers will be constrained in offering quality training to teachers.

In the original design, training was to be provided face-to-face and through e-learning. However,
a delay in the set up of e-learning centers prevented e-learning approach from being used and
training was only face-to-face. Approximately 3,000 teachers participated in the training (out of
approximately 4,000 LBS teachers nationwide). Over the three year training period, the teachers
participated in 110 days of training. Around 80 percent of those teachers who enrolled in 2011
remained in the course until the last training provided under the Project in September of 2013.

* Mean scores in Grades 3&4 are lower than those of Grades 5&6 because English textbooks are theme based (Book
1 Noun, Book 2 Verb, Book 3 Interjection and teachers (pupils as well) may find some of the concepts more
difficult/easy than others, regardless of when it is introduced in school teaching/learning materials.

The end-of-training test results suggest that the majority of the teachers who took the exam
possess the basic content knowledge required to teach in primary schools while around 5 percent
of the teachers do not (see Table 1). Analysis on those training participants who scored below 25
percent (below minimum level in content knowledge) and below 40 percent (very poor in content
knowledge) indicates these teachers are of mixed profiles and most have been and are likely to
remain in the system for a substantial period of time. However, the new READ Project
continues to support in-service teacher training using a combination of face-to-face training
activities during school holidays and ICT-supported learning at e-learning centers.

The PDO-level indicator related to this objective is “Percentage of targeted teachers obtaining
the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) credits in English and/or
mathematics (with a target of 30%)”. This PDO-level indicator target was, therefore, met as 60
percent of those teachers who took the WASSCE in 2012 obtained credits in English and/or
mathematics. However, according to the Aide Memoire of December 2013 “The proportion
achieving WASSCE credits has been lower than expected with the project adjusting the focus
more strongly on school level content”. This can be attributed to the Project’s focus on
specifically improving teachers’ content knowledge at the LBS level rather than covering the
material which is emphasized in the WASSCE. As discussed above, most recent tests suggest
that the teachers score significantly better on the LBS level content than the WASSCE level
material with results in mathematics being lower than those in English.

(x) Technical Assistance (TA) to MOHERST. This support focused on capacity-building
activities within the newly established MOHERST and supporting two studies for the tertiary
education sector. Both of these activities were successfully completed by end of project thereby
                                                      43
meeting the two intermediate-level indicator targets (related to this support): (i) completing a
tertiary and higher education policy; and (ii) completing a science, technology and innovation
(STI) policy. Both of these studies contributed significantly to the strategy development and
capacity of the newly established MOHERST. These two policies have laid the foundations for a
diagnostic of the sector and for determining key priorities moving forward. In addition to the
above-mentioned interventions, MOHERST also took advantage of cost savings under the AF
and produced the following outputs: (i) a draft of the Higher Education Act, (ii) draft guidelines
and a validation of the Accreditation and Quality Assurance Board (iii) STI and research and
development (R&D) indicators; and (iv) further enhancement of the MOHERST capacity.

Project activities that contributed to the achievement of the PDO level indicators included school
level pedagogic support to head teachers which impacted schools in terms of collecting data on
instructional time and attendance of teachers in school. In addition activities such as teacher
training (both pre-service and in-service) contributed to reduction in teacher absenteeism,
measured by the days teachers attended schools.

By the time of the AF of 2010, instructional time had increased from a baseline of 690 hours to
710 hours, on course to the target of 900 hours by original end of project target in 2012.
Following the AF/Restructuring of 2010, this indicator was revised to teachers attending school
for at least 18 days on a monthly basis. The target was 85 percent with an actual rate of 90
percent, although at the 2010 AF/Restructuring this became an intermediate-level indicator. The
remaining original PDO-level indicators were dropped at this time with the completion rate of
basic education tracked until the end of the Project. Although the primary completion rate was
73 percent in 2012 and 2013 (slightly below the end of project target of 75 percent), this
indicator was dropped at the 2012 restructuring as it was a sector-wide indicator and project
activities could not be directly linked to the indicator. Following the AF/Restructuring, the main
PDO-level indicator (measuring the impact of Component 1) was “Targeted teachers obtaining
WASSCE credits in English and/or Mathematics’’. Under the Project, 60 percent of teachers
obtained credits in either English and/or Mathematics, much higher than the end of project target
of 30 percent.

Component 2: Strengthened Capacity-building, Performance Management and Monitoring
and Evaluation (Appraisal Estimate – Original Financing: US$1.0 million; Additional
Financing: US$0 million; PHRD: US$3.0 million; Total Estimate: US$4.0 million. Actual
Expenditure – Original Financing: US$2.47; Additional Financing: US$0; PHRD: US$3.0
million; Total Actual Expenditure: US$5.47 million)

5.      Component 2 aimed to provide support to strengthen capacity building, performance
management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). No further funding was allocated to this
Component under the AF. The education sector in The Gambia did not have a sufficient number
of qualified staff. This was largely because individuals with the necessary qualifications were
not attracted to the civil service given the working conditions and low salaries, opting instead for
positions within the private sector. In the absence of a much-needed civil service reform, it was
imperative that the qualifications of personnel working in the sector be improved and that an
effective incentive system be established to reward and sanction personnel as necessary.

6.      This activities supported under this Component were on track throughout the Project life
with no significant delays. The Project made progress in terms of performance management with
the completion of the functional analysis which was used to inform the service level agreements
(SLAs) (i.e., performance contracts) as well as other capacity-building activities. The main
challenges experienced under this Component were related to M&E. At the time of the
AF/Restructuring in 2010, significant progress had not been made in M&E. Though the
framework had been designed; the data were not being regularly collected and there was limited
verification. The following section provides details on the outputs of each of the activities
supported by the Component.

(i) Technical assistance (TA) for undertaking a functional analysis, improving organization
within the MOBSE, and for purchasing office equipment and furniture. This component
aimed to provide TA for functional analysis and to support the creation of a more effective
organizational structure within the MOBSE. The functional analysis study was conducted in
2007 under the BESPOR project 22. The study enabled the MOBSE to critically review its current
organizational capacity, its functionality compared to best practices around the world and
specifically within the education system. Each compartment and elements of the structure was
thoroughly reviewed and validated by the all the key stakeholders though working sessions and
seminars, which were financed under this Project.

Equipment was purchased for the offices of senior managers.

(ii) Signature of service level agreements (SLAs) with all central and regional directorates
and award of team performance bonuses to those teams that had fulfilled their annual
work plan commitments. Based on the functional analysis, the MOBSE’s functional structure
was strengthened. In addition to ensuring clearly identified roles and responsibilities, qualified
personnel were assigned to these positions and senior management participated in work-flow
analysis. This led to the creation of SLAs (i.e., performance contracts) financed under this
Project and supported under BESPOR Project. The PDO-level indicator target related to the
implementation of a personnel performance monitoring system was achieved with the
establishment of a performance monitoring system (PMS) in the MOBSE 23 and with all regional
directorates with SLAs having been signed at all levels of the system. These reforms were a new
way of enhancing accountability within the sector, providing a mechanism to identify best
practices (and to support them) and sanction those that were not effective. As for the second
PDO-level indicator (functional organizational structure in place), DOSBSE put in place both
short- and long-term capacity development activities for central and regional staff, and the
associated performance monitoring system was finalized in 2008.

(iii) TA for the development of management training modules and for the career
development of teachers and of education personnel in general. The component supported
the development of management training modules (which led to a management certificate). A
large number of head teachers (529) benefitted from this management training.


22
   The selected candidate who would conduct the functional analysis could not be hired under the project, as he was
a former World Bank consultant. Therefore, he was hired under the BESPOR Project.
23
   This was changed to an intermediate-level indicator under the 2010 AF/Restructuring.

                                                        45
(iv) Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities including training and TA Other aspects
included capacity-building and strengthening of M&E systems which is discussed in the M&E
section as there were are no PDO-level indicators related to M&E. Support to enhance M&E
capacity was developed with (i) TA hired to support the capacity-building of the Planning
Directorate within MOBSE to undertake data collection, cleaning and analysis and to utilize and
strengthen the EMIS. This enhanced capacity was evidenced through the development of sector
progress report. Given the critical nature of sector data at the joint annual reviews of the sector,
these data became more available and reliable over time. Specific project data were also
collected and recorded to measure progress under the Project.

(v) Implementation support to PCU including technical assistance, operational costs and
logistics

Component 3: Expansion of Effective Access (Appraisal Estimate – Original Financing:
US$1.5 million and Additional Financing: US$0 million; Total Estimate: US$1.5. Actual
Expenditure – Original Financing: US$1.12; Additional Financing: US$0. Total Actual
Expenditure: US$1.12 million)

7.       The main objective of Component 3 was to continue expansion of access to schools
among underserved communities with particular attention to reaching underserved populations,
including girls, students with special needs and people living in rural areas. Under the
AF/Restructuring, the Component was not allocated additional resources. This Component
focused on two distinct types of demand for additional places in the basic cycle (i.e., urban/peri-
urban schools and remote rural areas) where the Project financed the construction of additional
classrooms. The activities supported under this Component are described below. The two main
activities that had been initiated early in the Project life under this component were; (i)
construction and rehabilitation of classrooms; and (ii) support to literacy courses through
involvement of local operators.

(i) Construction and/or rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping of 36 urban classrooms
(two schools with two streams of 9 grades each) in Region 2 and of 16 multi-grade
classrooms (two 2-classroom blocks in each of the four outlying regions). The procurement
of consultants for the construction of basic and multi-grade classrooms proved to be challenging.
This was largely a result of a complaint from one of the bidders which resulting in an INT
investigation that took 18 months to complete. The PDO-level indicator which measured the
increase in access was the number of additional students enrolled in lower-basic education
(Grade 1-6), with a target of 2,200 additional students which had reached 931 additional students
by project closing. While the construction of the multi-grade classrooms had been completed
under the Project, two basic cycle schools were around 90 percent complete. The funding for the
completion of these schools was allocated to the Gambia READ Project to complete their
construction. As of August 2014, the construction of two basic cycle schools has been
completed. The PDO-level indicator on completion rate of basic education (revised to only
measure grade 6) was 73 percent at time of project closing – not achieving its target. The
indicator, however, was dropped at the 2012 level II restructuring as it was not a project-specific
indicator but a sector-wide measure.



                                                46
(ii) Support to literacy courses through the involvement of local operators (6,000 learners
provided with literacy training and with post-literacy support). There were delays in the
implementation of literacy training activities. Based on stakeholder interviews this delay was
attributable to the limited capacities of both the MOBSE and the local operators tasked with
delivering the literacy training. In particular, there was some level of unfamiliarity of procedures
and contracting of operators. Given these delays, the number of literacy learners was scaled to
3,000, down from original target of 6,000. At the time of project closing the target for the PDO-
level indicator on literacy was exceeded, albeit with revision to the target at the 2010
restructuring from 6,000 learners to 3,000 learners given the delay in implementation.
Specifically number of learners attending literacy courses and number of completed hours (with
a target of 3,000 learners completing 300 hours) has been exceeded (reaching 4,839, of which 95
percent are female and all have completed 300 hours). The literacy activities, despite the initial
activities have resulted in a new partnership approach to the delivery of literacy training.

Implementation support to PCU:                            •   The operational expenses including vehicle fuel and maintenance, salaries of PCU staff took a heavy
TA, OC and logistics                                          toll. The recruitment of a Donor Coordinator and the salary revision for staff following a

Component 3: Expansion of effective access
Construction and equipping: Construction and/or           •   The implementation of this component was not very successful in the past due to the delays in
rehabilitation, furnishing and equipping of 36 urban          procurement of consultants for the multi-grade classroom design and preparation of bidding documents
classrooms                                                    due to an inquiry from a bidder into the bidding process. Over the past 12 months, however, significant

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.     This analysis estimates the economic value of The Gambia Third Education Project –
Phase II. First, the internal efficiency of the Project is demonstrated with a cost-effectiveness
analysis of outcomes and implementation. Next, the external efficiency of the Project is
presented as a cost-benefit analysis of quantifiable benefits within the broader economic context
of The Gambia. Finally, the fiscal sustainability of Project activities is evaluated.

Cost-effectiveness analysis

2.      The cost-effectiveness analysis examines efficiency of quality enhancements, efficiency
gains at the system level, unit costs, and project implementation. Project indicators demonstrate
improvements in the provision of quality education, and available assessment results show that
students are learning more efficiently. Successful efforts to enhance quality include a 60 percent
increase in the share of targeted teachers with WASSCE credits in English and/or mathematics,
significant improvements in teacher attendance rates, and large numbers of head teachers and
teachers reached through training and pedagogical support. As described in the sustainability
discussion, the in-service training was an area of great need as 30 percent of LBS teachers were
unqualified and many teachers fell in the 30 to 40 percent achievement range in the entrance
exam in core subjects at Project baseline. These efforts have contributed to higher levels of
student learning on available student assessments, as the most recent rounds of early grade
reading assessment (EGRA) show a significant drop in the percentage of children who cannot
read anything.25 This means that students will be able to master more content in less time.

3.      Higher quality of education and more efficient student learning has also led to gains in
efficiency at the system level. With the Project’s investments in quality, there were positive
trends in repetition and completion rates when compared to the counterfactual of continued
expansion only. A cost-effectiveness study supported under the previous IDA project assessed
the impact of investments in quality relative to the continued expansion of school enrollment,
and found that without the investment in quality, it would take an average of 8.93 years of
investment to produce one graduate of LBS taking into account the loss due to dropout. With the
investments in quality supported under the Project, recent education management information
system (EMIS) data show that it takes 6.59 years on average 26 for a graduate to complete the
cycle due to improvements in the underlying factors (see Table 1 for a summary). The improved
efficiency results in a reduced total cost equivalent of producing one primary school graduate
from an estimated US$190 to US$179 27.

4.      In addition to efficiency gains, provision of instructional materials was cost-effective
when compared to similar initiatives in other African countries. The Project provided a total of
over 500,000 readers and textbooks at a unit cost of US$1.23 for readers, US$0.43 for grades 1
to 4 and US$2.49 for grades 7 to 9. An analysis of comparable costs in Annex 3 of The Gambia
EFA FTI Project shows that these unit costs are lower than or in line with unit costs for
comparable activities in other countries: (i) Burundi, US$ 1.1528; (ii) Eritrea, US$ 0.6029; and
(iii) Mauritania, US$ 0.7330 (The Gambia grade 7 to 9 textbooks were produced in the UK). As
explained in the sustainability discussion below, the Project more than doubled the number of
textbooks available to these students, thus addressing an area of significant need.

5.      Classrooms were also constructed cost-effectively when compared to similar projects
supported by other partners in The Gambia as reported in an analysis conducted for the economic
and financial analysis of the ICR for The Gambia EFA FTI Project. The analysis examined
school construction efforts over the course of the project (2009-2013) by two other partners: the
Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) and the Africa Development Bank
(AfDB). The unit cost of Project classroom construction of US$ 18,874 compares favorably to
units costs 31 for BADEA of US$31,404 and AfDB of US$19,412. This cost-effectiveness is
especially impressive considering the Project’s additional costs to make all classrooms accessible
to children with physical disabilities.

6.      Project implementation can also be considered efficient in some ways. The Project was
formally restructured to extend the Project life for an additional 21 months and provide an
additional financing (AF) in the amount of US$5.5 million to both mitigate against potential
negative impacts of the global financial crisis on the education budget and also to address needs
for teacher training and support to the newly established Ministry of Higher Education, Science
and Technology (MOHERST). At the time of the AF (June 2010), approximately two-thirds (66
percent) of Project funds had been disbursed. At the time of the project closing, about 96 percent
of original grant (2.3 percent was transferred to the new project and 1.2 percent was cancelled)
and 100 percent of the AF amount had been disbursed, showing that the Project team used
almost all available funds toward Project activities. The Project also exceeded expected progress
in several key indicators, including 4,839 learners attending literacy courses of 300 hours,
exceeding the target of 3,000 learners; 60 percent of targeted teachers obtaining WASSCE
credits in English and/or mathematics exceeding the target of 30 percent; and 292,000 direct

project beneficiaries exceeding the target of 8,800. The Project has enrolled 74 percent of the
intended additional 2,200 LBS students in new classrooms as the construction of basic cycle
schools had not been completed at project closing. However, as of August 2014, the construction
of all classrooms was complete and enrollment is expected to increase to about 2,200 when
2014/15 school year starts.

External efficiency

7.     External efficiency is presented within the economic context of The Gambia through a
cost-benefit analysis.

Economic context

8.     The Gambia is one of the poorest countries in the world. It is mostly rural and its
economy is largely supported by agriculture. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth has shown
mixed signals in the last decade yet poverty has not significantly declined, decreasing only from
58 percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2010. When compared to the size of the economy, public
expenditure on education as a share of GDP has increased from 1.2 percent of GDP at Project
baseline to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2012 (the most recent year available). However, expenditure
on education as a share of total government expenditure has decreased from a peak of 18.7
percent in 2008 to 13.8 percent in 2012 (the most recent year available).

9.      Most individuals with lower levels of education are in low-paid services jobs and/or work
in the agricultural sector. Higher education is, to a large extent, a prerequisite for higher-paid
occupations as shown in Figure 1 and corroborated by Hasan and Jandoc (2008)32. The informal
sector absorbs, for the most part, less skilled labor while the formal sectors attracts highly skilled
and educated individuals – the sectors that usually offer better remuneration.

10.     Analysis of labor market data from the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) 2010 shows
wide disparities in wages by level of educational attainment, which provides evidence of the
need for investment in education. Figure 2 shows that average wage earnings rise steadily with
increasing educational attainment and age. Generally, younger and older populations receive
lower wages, and wages peak between the ages of 40 and 50. A higher level of education is
associated with a higher lifetime earning horizon.




  Source: Annex 3 of The Gambia EFA FTI ICR, authors’ estimate using IHS 2010.

11.     The Mincerian wage coefficients also show increasing returns to education as levels of
education increase, even after controlling for other factors. Similar to results from many
developing countries, the regression analysis shows that an additional year of education results in
about 6.1 percent higher wages in The Gambia. In particular, people with higher levels of
education prefer to work in wage/salaried jobs, and the breakdown of education by levels gives
further insights into the rates of return to education investment. In general, those who attain a
higher level of education receive greater returns from their investments in education. For
example, workers with a primary education earn 27 percent more than workers with no
education, controlling for all other variables. Similarly, those with a secondary education earn 35
percent more than those with primary education while those with technical and vocational
education and training (TVET) earn 7 percent more than those with a secondary education
(holding all other factors constant). Finally, this analysis shows that on average those with higher
education earn 33 percent more than those with TVET (Figure 3).

12.      This analysis clearly shows the pivotal role that education plays in wage earnings, which
demonstrates evidence that investment in education at both the primary and secondary levels is
crucial.

13.    In addition to benefits to wage earnings, education has a positive impact on behavior, as
econometric models developed for economic and financial analysis conducted for the ICR for
The Gambia EFA FTI. The analysis shows the contribution of each grade and each level of
schooling to behavioral changes (see Table 2). Some of the most significant results include the
finding that completion of lower basic education is associated with a lower probability of being
poor (over not completing lower basic education) and that both having no education or just two
years of lower basic education are associated with a higher probability of being poor than those
with more years or those having completed basic education.

Cost-benefit analysis

14.    This cost-benefit analysis assesses the Project’s quantifiable benefits in the areas of
quality (Component 1 aside from girls’ scholarships) and access/equity (construction in
Component 3 and girls’ scholarships). Benefits from Component 2 activities related to capacity
building, performance management, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) were more difficult
to quantify, and are better addressed in the fiscal sustainability discussion that follows this

                                               57
analysis. The cost flows, benefit flows, and calculations of Net Present Value (NPV) are
estimated separately for access/equity and quality, and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is
calculated for the entire project

15.     First, the access/equity analysis focuses on the benefits of new classroom construction
and equipment as well as girls’ scholarships. Providing girls’ scholarships had especially high
potential to increase enrollments, as they were disbursed in regions where girls’ Gross
Enrollment Rates (GERs) range from 31.1 percent to 63.8 percent in 2014 (compared to the
national average of 68.1 percent). Flows are quantified in terms of an individual’s lifetime
earnings from higher levels of educational attainment.

16.      Second, the quality analysis focuses on the direct and indirect impact of Project activities
as related to improved learning. The direct impact can be measured by quality improvements,
including provision of instructional materials, whereas the indirect impact can be measured by
activities of teacher training and school-level pedagogical support, among others. Flows are
quantified by relationships between quantity and quality from similar interventions in other
countries, building on the approach of the analysis of outcomes for The Gambia EFA FTI ICR.
Existing research shows that there is potential for a relationship between education interventions
and student learning outcomes (mainly measured by test scores) 33 and the impact of better
student achievement on labor market outcomes (mainly measured by earnings) 34.

Assumptions for cost-benefit analysis

17.    The calculations of costs and benefits for the Project has been informed by the project
description, the economic and financial analysis for the recent EFA FTI education project in The
Gambia, EMIS data, and outputs by component (see Annex 2). The assumptions that are
common to the access/equity and quality analyses are the following:

     •   Since the analysis takes into account only the quantifiable benefits, it is assumed that the
         NPV and IRR are at their lowest bound for the impact of the Project.
     •   The current lending rate of 12 percent has been used for the discount rate.
     •   The official exchange rate has been set at 39.1 GMD per US$1.
     •   Wages have been estimated for different levels of education using data from the IHS
         2010.
     •   Wages change with age over the duration of the benefits with adjustments for inflation.


33
   The first relationship (defined as the impact of intervention on learning outcomes) is based on findings from
Schiefelbein, Wolff & Paulina Schiefelbein (1998). “Cost-effectiveness of Education Policies in Latin America: A
Survey of Expert Opinion.” The authors used a similar method when studying cost-effectiveness of education
policies in six English-speaking African countries. The approach used in this analysis draws on the initial research in
Latin America as more countries were included in the study, and uses the research in Africa as part of the sensitivity
analysis (similar to the EFA FTI ICR analysis).
34
   As included in the EFA FTI literature review, there is a considerable body of research on the impact of cognitive
ability as measured by test scores on earnings (Patrinos and Sakellariou, 2007; Green and Riddell, 2001; Moll, 1998;
Glewwe, 1996; Murnane, 1995; Jolliffe, 1998; Vijverberg, 1999; Boissiere, Knight, and Sabot, 1985; and Knight
and Sabot, 1990. On average, incremental earnings increase from 13% to 20% per one standard deviation increase in
test score.

                                                         58
   •   The difference in wages remains the same throughout the career of each beneficiary (6
       percent per year of education) as estimated from the 2010 IHS.
   •   Primary school starting age is 7 years old.
   •   Beneficiaries enter the labor market at age 18, and are expected to remain in the labor
       market for 30 years.
   •   Employment rates by level of education are estimated using data from the 2010 IHS as 94
       percent for primary and secondary levels, and remain constant after the Project even
       though quality improvements may increase the chance of employment to provide a
       conservative estimate.

18.     The driving factors of the access/equity outcomes are the construction of 52 classrooms
(36 basic cycle and 16 multi-grade) by August 2014 and provision of scholarships to 15,000 girls
in public and grant-aided upper basic and senior secondary schools in targeted regions to help
improve completion rates. Impact is measured by the incremental wages of graduates specific to
the level of education achieved, and costs include project costs as well as ongoing maintenance.
Assumptions specific to the access/equity analysis are below.

   •   Schools provide services for 40 years.
   •   The number of LBS beneficiaries beyond the Project is calculated using available EMIS
       data on the number of students enrolled per classroom.
   •   The number of future LBS graduates is calculated using the current survival rate to the
       last grade of primary at 58 percent and survival rate to grade 9 of 48 percent, with
       survival rates in early years adjusted for students who may enter at later grades.
   •   The maintenance costs are estimated at 5 percent, similar to those of The Gambia EFA
       FTI ICR analysis.
   •   For simplicity, 6 cohorts of girls are assumed to receive scholarships with the number of
       grade 12 graduates estimated by survival rates from those students in grade 7 to reach
       grade 12, with survival rates in early years adjusted for students who may enter at later
       grades.
   •   An estimated 31 percent of beneficiaries attend multi-grade classrooms and an estimated
       69 percent of beneficiaries attend Basic Cycle classrooms.

19.     The improvements in quality are expected to arise due to teacher training efforts in the
areas of pedagogical support, early reading, Bachelor’s degrees in Education, English, and
Mathematics as well as the provision of instructional materials, including supplementary readers,
textbooks, and library books. Impact is measured by the incremental increase expected in wages
against Project costs. Assumptions specific to the quality analysis are below.

   •   The incremental wage increase due to quality interventions of the Project is estimated as
       5.9 percent based on available literature on a package of similar interventions (as
       included in Schiefelbein, et al. 1998).
   •   The share of students who benefit from the trained teachers and instructional materials is
       based on the share of teachers whose qualifications and knowledge improved under the
       Project (30 percent). The effect of instructional materials is expected to add a small
       amount to this share (15 percent).

                                               59
   •    Quality improvements are expected to accrue for 20 years.

20.     The Project has performed favorably and under conservative assumptions, economic
benefits outweigh costs. The Project will generate a total of US$25.5 million in benefits against
US$6.5 million in costs, yielding an NPV of US$19.0 million, an IRR of 28 percent, and a
benefit to cost ratio of 3.9 (see Table 3 for details). The NPV of the access and equity activities is
higher than the NPV of the quality activities. Given the interactions between access and quality
and the package of interventions, it can be concluded that the Project represented a good
investment in increasing access to LBS, UBS, and SSS in The Gambia.

Sensitivity analysis

21.     The cost-benefit analysis above is based on conservative and well-informed assumptions.
However, future benefits and costs for the Project may perform better or worse than expected. A
sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the potential range of outcomes by adjusting the
key assumptions as outline below.

    •   School survival to last grade of primary: 48 percent for low, 64 percent for high
    •   Survival rate to grade 9: 38 percent for low, 54 percent for high
    •   Survival rate from grade 7 to grade 12: 31 percent for low, 44 percent for high
    •   Employment rate for primary and lower secondary: 90 percent for low, 95 percent for
        high
    •   Employment rate for upper secondary graduates: 60 percent for low, 95 percent for high
    •   Wage differential between levels of education: 15 percent for low, 46 percent for high
    •   Wage increase due to quality: 2.8 percent for low, 8.6 percent for high
    •   Life span of the building: 20 years for low, 40 years for high
    •   Length of labor market engagement: 20 years for low, 30 years for high
    •   Maintenance costs: 25 percent for low scenario case, 2 percent for high scenario case


                                                 60
22.     Findings from the sensitivity analysis show that the NPV of the Project could range from
US$1.4 million in the low case to US$28.5 million in the high case, leading to benefit to cost
ratios of 1.2 to 5.5, respectively (see Table 4). The IRR ranges from 13 percent in the low case to
35 percent in the high case. Therefore, even with the most conservative assumptions, the Project
will contribute to net economic gains due to expansion of access and quality improvements.

Fiscal sustainability

23.     The Project’s sustainability depends on the Government’s continued support to education
as well as capacity to absorb additional costs necessitated by the Project. Table 5 shows that
Government resources for recurrent expenditure on Basic and Secondary Education are projected
to increase during the four years following Project closing. Costs associated with the Project
focus on maintenance of the newly constructed classrooms, which represent a very minimal
amount of annual spending, and hiring a small number of teachers. Both of these costs should be
feasibly financed, for example, at much less than 1 percent of planned spending for 2014.




                                                61
             Table 5. Projected Government Resources for Recurrent Education
                                       Expenditure




24.    In addition, the Project activities supported under Component 2 are anticipated to
contribute to a more efficient use of funds. The outputs by component note improvements in
performance monitoring and feedback with service-level agreements, including performance
reviews for teachers. Additional improvements at the system level include enhancements to the
national assessment system through capacity building for WAEC staff, which will allow the
Ministry to better monitor learning outcomes, as well as training for MOHERST staff in research
methods and reform at the tertiary level. Although these benefits are difficult to quantify,
improved accountability can lead to more efficient and better informed use of funds for
education.

25.     The Project has also contributed inputs to areas that were high-need, which may mean
high returns (although returns by specific input are difficult to quantify). For example, the
Project provided 180,000 readers and over 360,000 textbooks for LBS and UBS schools in a
system where there were only approximately 400,000 mathematics and English textbooks in the
school system in 2014. In addition, the Project provided key in-service training in early grade
literacy and numeracy to 3,000 teachers, and increased the formal qualifications of 335 teachers
in a system where 30 percent of LBS teachers were unqualified and many teachers fell in the 30
to 40 percent achievement range in the entrance exam in core subjects at Project baseline.
Additionally, the Project provided scholarships to 15,000 in regions where girls’ GERs range
from 31.1 percent to 63.8 percent in 2014, compared to the national average of 68.1 percent.




                                              62
26.     Given the analysis above, strong gains in internal efficiency of the education system and
the level of project implementation efficiency, efficiency for the Project is rated High.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) team undertook a Stakeholder
Workshop (Banjul) to hold in-depth consultations and focus group discussions. The team also
undertook various interviews and site visits, and met with project staff in Regional offices.
Specifically the workshop sought to: (i) collate perceptions around the projects main
achievements and outcomes; (ii) better understand the constraints and challenges faced during
the Project; (iii) determine lessons learned that can be applied to another phase; and (vi)
determine initial reactions to the findings of the draft ICR.

The consultations provided an opportunity for participants to respond to a written questionnaire
which included open-ended questions with more in-depth consultations. Other data used to cross
check information included site visits and various progress reports.

Some of the key points which arose from the stakeholders discussions are provided below.

Design
• The was a strong consensus that the project had improved teacher quality and enhanced the
   capacity of MOBSE to increase quality of primary education in the country, especially in
   terms of enhancing teacher content knowledge.

Performance and main achievements (summary of participants’ comments)
• There was a general agreement that the project had enhanced significantly teacher content
   knowledge in Math and English as well as strengthened their motivation and confidence.
• The Project had strengthened the capacity of MOBSE to deliver and monitor the training
   received by teachers with an institutionalization of the In-Service Education & Training
   (INSET) training
• The head teachers reported an improved capacity to manage with enhanced monitoring and
   resource-management skills
• The Standards and Quality Assurance Directorate (SQAD) observed that the Project had
   enhanced the supervision of schools with at least two visits a month and observed that this, in
   turn, helped reduce teacher absenteeism as well as improve lesson planning and delivery
• The school improvement grants had helped reduce costs borne by parents and enhanced
   access for students
• The establishment of the performance management system was seen as one of the most
   important benefits of the Project as it enhanced the management of staff performance by
   improving accountability
• The introduction of CCM meetings greatly enhanced the performance and monitoring of the
   Ministry as it helped enhance the understanding the job at hand, enable teachers and other
   MOBSE staff to learn from each other and share an understanding of challenges facing their
   schools and identifying potential solutions. The behavioral change brought about by the
   CCM meetings was found to be one of the most sustainable innovations of the project
• The project increased the availability of learning materials with the provision of new
   textbooks and learning materials



                                               67
•   The focus on non-formal education and literacy was an important part of the project
    including the approach of using local operators to deliver training, thus encouraging public-
    private partnerships (PPPs) with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
•   The focus of the project to provide soft support to MOHERST was critical given the needs of
    the sector and newly established ministry.
•   The establishment of the M&E unit and the capacity-building of the staff to be able to
    monitor the project and sector was delayed, but eventually it was set-up and is in constant use
    as evidenced through sector reports and updates during joint donor missions

Lessons learnt
• There was a challenge in the delivery of e-Learning equipment for the in-service teacher
   training and it was mentioned that this was partly due to the delay in the involvement of
   different stakeholders
• As rehabilitation costs for the component on increasing access through class room
   construction were underestimated (since costs had risen substantially), a significant amount
   of resources should be put aside for price contingencies if costs increase.
• The learning assessments showed the need to maintain a focus on mastery of basic education
   content for teachers given the low level of content knowledge among teachers rather than
   immediately training the teachers to obtain credit at West Africa Senior School Certificate
   Examination (WASSCE)
• For successful use of the e-learning training centers it is important that there is sufficient
   training for teachers in IT
• With the implementation of the learning materials it was recommended that the CDs for all
   published materials should be available to both PCU and Curriculum Research Evaluation
   Development Directorate (CREDD) as part of the delivery process of textbooks.
• The Monitoring and Evaluation aspect of the project had too many indicators at the planning
   stage of the project. Further, many did not have baseline values. It would have been better,
   therefore, to limit the number of indicators to be monitored (relevance, data availability, etc.)

Interviews with MOBSE Permanent Secretary (PS) and Deputy PS
• Interviewees noted that the Ministry greatly appreciates the World Bank’s support to
   education. The discussants noted that the long relationship and trust developed with the
   World Bank allowed innovative programs to be introduced under the project. For example,
   the performance based management system brought about key behavioral changes to the
   Ministry. The Ministry also noted the importance of a strong PCU team that helped and
   supported the capacity in MOBSE to deliver on the project activities. They also highlighted
   that the main challenges experienced were delays on the access component due to a
   complaint from one of the bidders resulting in an 18-month INT investigation. They said that
   the Bank might have accelerated this process.

Interviews with PCU staff
• A number of PCU staff noted that the PCU was part of the MOBSE. This alignment with the
   Ministry has been integral to the implementation of the Project. A number of respondents
    noted that many of the delays in procurement are linked to lack of knowledge of World Bank
   procedures and noted the need for enhanced capacity building on this front and that this
   training should also be provided to Ministry staff.

PROJECT CONTEXT

The Gambia is located on the west coast of Africa, a thin strip of land straddling the River
Gambia and bordered by Senegal on all but its coastal side. With a population of about 1.4
million, it is one of the least populous countries on the African continent. The highest levels of
poverty are prevalent in rural areas (PRSP, 2002), and preliminary results from the most recent
household survey (2003) show large disparities in poverty prevalence rates between the regions
and between urban and rural populations. With an annual population growth of 2.2 percent and
with strong rural-urban migration, The Gambia’s population is growing, and increasingly
becoming concentrated in urban areas. It is a young population: 40 percent are under 15 years of
age, 20 percent are between 15to 24, while the economically active populations (15 to 64)
constitute 33 percent.

The original grant in the amount of US$8 million (SDR 5.6 million) was approved on June 1,
2006 and became effective on February 28, 2007. The additional financing, also a grant,
amounting to US $ 5.5 million (SDR 3.5 million) was the second of a two-phase adaptable
program loan (APL). The original objective was to improve conditions for teaching and learning
in basic education. The components of the projects were: (i) improving performance of students,
teachers and schools; (ii) strengthening capacity building and performance management, and
enhancing monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) continuing expansion of effective access to under-
served communities. At the time of project approval, co-financing under the Program for Human
Resources Development (PHRD) financed by Japan was granted in the amount of US$3 million.
The proposed Additional Financing was to finance the costs associated with: (i) supporting new
methods of delivering in-service training to ensure the availability of good quality teachers; and
(ii) providing technical assistance to a newly founded Ministry of Higher Education, Research,
Science and Technology (MoHERST) to enhance its capacity to provide relevant, sustainable
and high quality higher education.

Project development objective and key indicators

The overall project development objective was to improve conditions for teaching and learning
in basic education. This was done by (a) improving performance of students, teachers and
schools; (b) strengthening capacity building and performance management, and enhancing
monitoring and evaluation; and (c) continuing expansion of effective access to under-served
communities. However the project development objective was revised and defined as follow: To
improve access to underserved communities and quality of education in The Gambia, with a
particular focus on primary education (lower-basic education).

Due to the adjustments to the scope of the project under the Additional Financing, some the key
monitoring indicators were modified. The description of outcome indicators originally set for the
Third Education Sector Project was refined and the targets re-adjusted due to the extension in
project implementation and to align them better to the additional project activities.



                                               69
   Two activities, teacher training and support to tertiary education strategic studies already listed
   under component one (improving conditions for teaching and learning) were added to the current
   activities to include: (i) additional support to in-service training through the use of new concepts
   of delivering teacher training; and (ii) technical assistance to a newly founded Ministry
   (MoHERST) to enhance its capacity to provide relevant, sustainable and high quality higher
   education, including its ability to lead in the development of science and technology innovation
   (STI).

   Four indicators (two PDO indicators and two intermediate performance indicators) were be
   added to monitor in-service teacher training and support for higher education/STI.
   Main Beneficiaries,

   At the design stage the project targeted (i) school children (LBS & UBS) including those from
   remote, rural areas, out of school children or disadvantaged (with disabilities and those from
   difficult socio-economic background), (ii) teacher trainees who were undergoing Primary
   Teacher Certificate (PTC), Higher Teacher Certificate (HTC) programs, Certificate in
   Management and Bachelors’ Degrees (iii) in-service training for teachers, head teachers,
   pedagogic leaders & mentors, (iv) staff within the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education
   (MoBSE), the Ministry of Higher Education Research, Science & Technology (MoHERST) and
   the West African Examination Council (WAEC) and (V) Support to literacy courses through the
   involvement of local private-sector operators (6,000 learners (mostly women) provided with
   literacy training, and with post-literacy support).

  Lessons Learned

  Lesson 1. The project intended to build two Full Cycle (36 classrooms) and Eight Multi-
  Grade Basic Education Schools (16 classrooms) to accommodate 2200 additional students
  to access basic education in underserved areas. In 2008 the PCU launched the recruitment
  process for the design review and works supervision. However we encountered challenges at the
  earliest stage of implementing while recruiting the consultant. One of the firms, from Nigeria,
  queried the decision of the evaluation report that it did not submit only a financial proposal but
  rather both the technical and financial proposals. That led to the World Bank to mount an
  investigation which lasted for over 2 years and finally the PCU was instructed to re-launch the
  recruitment. In 2009 the project was reallocated and the amounts allocated to works was reduced
  to US $ 700,000 from US $ 1.4 million. The re-launch of the recruitment process saw the bids
  received amounting to nearly US $ 1.3 million thus a huge financial gap. This was thoroughly
  worked out and agreement reached to reduce the scope of the works while the government
  budget covered the furniture and water points.

  Lesson 2. Provision of textbooks Grades 1-4. The procurement process of these textbooks led
  the sector to acquire these textbooks from India at a very reasonable unit cost of less than US$
  0.50 per book. In addition prior to printing the sector embarked on a mission in India and visited
  the firm to verify the available facilities/capacities as well as authorizing the printing. This has
  enabled the sector to print high quality textbooks and with the same unit cost.

  Lesson 3. The implementation of the E-Learning project. In 2010, Lower Basic School
  teachers who did not have credits in English and mathematics in the WASSCE examination took
  a voluntary test in Maths and English at baseline. This task of pre-testing was assigned to the
  West African Examination Council (WAEC) Banjul office. WAEC, in collaboration with other

                                                   76
partners pre-tested 2820 LBS teachers. The test results were analyzed and all 2820 were
streamed into one of 3 categories (level 1, level 2 or level 3) for both English and Math. Set
criteria based on the performance level of teachers in the pre-test were used for this purpose.
This was important in order to plan instruction effectively so as to benefit each individual at their
comfort level. Level 1 category needed more training before they could be allowed to attempt
the West African School Certificate Exams (WASCE), level 3 category was considered closest to
the WASCE level and needed the least amount of time to attempt the WASCE, and level 2
category is in between the two.

Lesson 4. Teacher Training

In order to implement the activities of teacher training at the School of education, between 2000
and 2005 there were factors which were seen as major challenges. These factors included the
following:
    • Inadequate number of subject lecturers most of them were demotivated
    • Low Educational levels of students (entry requirement of PTC students)
    • The Method of screening of students (entrance examination), not properly checked thus
       resulting in the selection of students with low educational levels
    • Number of applicants to the both PTC and HTC programme very low
    • Inadequate orientation for both staff and student on the change in the mode of training
    • Inadequate funding for the implementation of programmes
    • Inadequate space for expansion
With funding provided for the school of education, most of these challenges were overcome.

As a result of more funds being provided for the school of education and on a regular basis, the
lessons that can be learnt is that with adequate funding both the quality of teacher education and
the number of teachers trained can be improved. As a result of this the following have been
achieved;
    • Attract more students as the years went by. Enrollment increased gradually and students
       meeting graduation requirement increased
    • Quality of teaching and learning also improved( teaching strategies and methodologies
       improved- The learner centered approach )
    • The frequency of Supervision and observation for students increased from 0/1 visit per
       year per student to 3 or more visits per term per student
    • Frequency of supervision and observation well structured; teams of 4 lecturers weekly,
       schedule of visits released at the beginning of each term. All student visited with a
       minimum of four observations before graduating
    • Distance Education modules were printed and distributed to students on time; marking
       was also done on time
    • The PTC extension (region 5) was piloted with 450 registered students, graduating 318
       students- thus paving way for another cohort of students and
    • Graduate 3,555 students between 2006 and 2012 compared to previous years. Student
       numbers at graduation will continue to increase.

KEY CHALLENGES IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR AT APPRAISAL AND HOW
THEY WERE RESOLVED

Several studies conducted during the first phase have identified the key constraints to the
effective access to and successful completion of education of all children. The issues that were
of particular concern included: (a) the lack of parity between boys and girls in terms of access;
(b) the gap in learning achievements between boys and girls, at all levels; (c) the lack of effective
access for children with special needs; (d) the need to ensure equality of access to all levels, to
the extent possible, for children in the parallel Koranic (madrassa) system; and (e) the lack of
clarity with regard to the role of the household and the community in setting priorities and in
ensuring that the commitments made are actually respected.
The Government has opted for a series of interventions that are aimed at addressing these
problems:

In order to avoid widening the gap in enrolment already in favor of girls government introduced,
through the FTI, support to needy boys from poor and disadvantaged communities and
households. Government went further and found out to carry out an exhaustive country diagnosis
study known as Country Status Report (CSR) and an “Out of School Children” study. Both
studies revealed the high cost of education to poor and vulnerable households and constituting
main factors/causes for non -participation and drop out in schooling. In order to address these
challenges government introduced the provision of school grants and the prohibition of all levies
charged in public and grant aided schools. Support is also being provided to Daaras through the
conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) initiatives piloted through the FTI.

In an attempt to improve the performance of students government has institutionalized the NAT
at Grades 3, 5 and 8 and is regularly carrying out EGRA and EGMA to consistently monitor
progress and learning achievements of students. Government has also introduced the teaching of
national languages in grades 1-3 with the main aim of improving the reading abilities of children
when they will be switching to English in the upper grades. Initial results are encouraging. The
initiatives are well accompanied by continuous teachers’ professional development and
teaching/learning materials development.

Government conscious of the importance attached to madrassa education continues to support
the madrassa through the provision of grants covering mainly teacher salaries. With the support
from the Islamic development Bank government is intervening in the areas of classroom
construction, textbooks, teaching and learning materials to madrassas.
