INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEEOPMT
BPORT AND RECOCOWIDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRMCTOS ON A PROPOSED LAN TO GUYANA
FOR TAPAKUMA IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recomendation on a proposed loan
to Guyana for the equivalent of US$12.9 million to help finance an irrigation
project. The loan would have a term of 30 years, including 6 years of grace,
with interest at 7¼ percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Guyana, Report No. 242a-GUA, dated December 19, 1973) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on December 27, 1973. Basic data are
shown in Annex I.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
3.        Guyana has a modern mining sector and a relatively efficient sugar
industry; but its overall economic development in the past has been hampered by
an adverse physical onvironment, a small domestic market, and political uncer-
tainty.  Per capita GNP (US$390 in 1971), while fairly evenly distributed, is
low in comparison with per capita GNP in most other countries of the Western
Hemisphere. The path of economic growth has been marked by persistent high
unemployment, slow agricultural growth, poor export performance, and a lag
in private investment. Real growth of the economy, at a rate of between 3 and
4 percent annually in the past two decades, has barely kept pace with the
increase in pDpulation. GDP actually contracted by 3.5 percent in real terms
in 1972, and there are indications that GDP may also have fallen last year.
The slowdown in 1972 and 1973 was caused largely by a decline in bauxite
output and by adverse weather conditions. Since 1971, private investment
has been declining, in part due to uncertainty in the private sector about
government policy towards the relative economic roles of the public and
private sectors.
4.        The development strategy of Guyana since independence in 1966 has
been to increase the role of the public sector and to promote cooperatives.
The government has expanded state enterprises, created new state-owned
financial institutions, and nationalized the country's largest bauxite pro-
ducer. The public sector now occupies a dominant position in the commercial
and industrial sectors. The growing role of the public sector is reflected in
the increase in its share of gross domestic capital formation from 40 percent
in 1968 to 60 percent in 1972. Increasingly, therefore, the level of public
savings will depend on the surpluses realised by public enterprises.



5.        The imediate economic outlook is clouded by the balance of
paymets impact of the lLgher petroleum prices and by the stringency of public
finances. Although it is not possible at this stage to assess the effect of
the recent increases in petroleum prices on the economy in all its ranifica-
tions, it is estimated that the cost of necessary fuel imports will rise
froa about US$20 million in 1973 to US$60 million in 1974. With reserves
falling to perilously low levels, the government embarked on a severe
austerity program in January 1974 to conserve foreign exchange. The measures
taken includes (i) discontinuance of the exchange of Guyanese currency
returned from abroad; (ii) restrictions on foreign exchange allocations for
overseas travel and other purposes; (iii) prohibition of local borTowing by
foreign companies and their subsidiaries; (iv) banning of imports of
rotor cars of over 1600 coc. and of certain other consumption itemas and
tv) licensing of all imports not already banned.
6.        In the five-year period prior to 1973, although current expendi-
tures grew rapidly, modest current surpluses were available from the
budget to finanee capital expemditurs. Further, the growth of capital
expenditures, which were 40 percent higher in 1972 than in 1968, was accom-
panied by efforts to mobilize domestic savings. In 1973, current expenditures
rose by 40 percent, largely because of salary increases awarded to civil
servants, while current revenues failed to grow at the expected rate, partly
because of lower tax receipts from agriculture and mining. The budgetary
deficit on current account amounted to over 25 percent of current expenditure.
Capital spending continued its strong upward trend, rising by about 50 percent.
To cover the budgetary deficits, the government's short-term borrowing from the
Bank of Guyana increased substantially. The budget for 1974 left the current
expenditure unchanged from the previous year's level and provided for growth
in current revenues (over 35 percent) to achieve a balance. A "national develop-
ment surcharge" on income tax collections, increases in various consumption
and excise taxes, end a now tax oan xports of sugar were introduced. As a
result, the deficit in the current account in 1974 is likely to be about
G$25 amllion, as compared with over G$50 million in 1973. The government,
sfter reviewing the financial position, and with the support of IMF. has
also decided to hold capital expenditures to about G$120 million. It is now
,ay-pected that the 1974 current and capital accounts will leave a deficit of about
G$60 mllion; the goverment is exploring ways of financing this deficit.
7.        The rate of development that Guyana is likely to realize over the
medium term will depend heavily on its ability to increase the production and
,cxport of its three key commodities--bauxite, sugar and rice-- which account for
30 percent of GDP and 85 percent of exports. Bauxite production has fallen in
recent years, partly because of a weak market demand and partly due to a lack
of product diversity (i.e., inadequate capacity for calcined bauxite production).
Production of sugar and rice has lagged because of unfavorable weather conditions.
The market prospects for these major commodities are now good. Calcined bauxite
capacity will increase substantially when the new investments planned by the



government are completed. Higher returns to producers from the recent
increase in the price of sugar exported to the United Kingdom should
stimulate sugar production. Sugar production in the Caribbean
Common Market (CARICOM) area as a whole is low and Guyana is in
a position to increase its exports to the United Kingdom and other
countries. Rice constitutes about 10 percent of both value-added in
agriculture and of total exports. With production in 1973 about
30 percent below the 1970 level, the scope for increased output is
substantial. Improved domestic pricing policies, availability of
credit and other facilities as well as new investments will, however,
be needed if the recent downward trend in production is to be reversed.
The proposed project would constitute a major step towards this end.
Thus, with reasonably good management, a good deal of progress may
be expected toward closing the present gap in the balance of payments.
8.        The government's Second 5-Year Development Plan, 1972-76,
outlines a fairly ambitious public sector program aimed at accelerating
the annual real rate of growth of GDP to 8.5 percent and reducing unemploy-
ment from about 15 percent to about 5 percent by the eand of the period.
The allocation of public investment gives high priority to transport
and communications (24.5 percent), manufacturing and power (16.3 percent),
and agriculture (15.8 percent). For a variety of reasons, including
shortages of skilled manpower and limited domestic savings, however, it
is not likely that the plan objectives as a whole will be attained during
the plan period. In view of the present prospects for domestic and
external financing, a capital investment program of G$865 million, about
25 percent lower than the planned level, with shares of public and
private sectors amounting to G550 million and G$315 million respectively,
may be a more realistic target for the government to pursue. The real
rate of growth during the Plan period may not exceed 5 percent per annum
and unemployment *ay still remain well above the 5 percent target.
Nevertheless, a real growth rate of 5 percent in GDP and a reduction in
the unemploymnt rate would represent significant improvements over the
past record. Among the sources of public sector financing for the Second
Development Plan, current account surpluses may account for about 23 per-
cent, net domestic borrowing for 10 percent, and net external borrowing
45 percent. During the preceding 5-year period, net external borrowing
accounted for about 40 percent of the total financing. The greater role
of   foreign financing under the current 5-year plan is justified in the
context of substantially higher development efforts and the more vigorous
mobilization of domestic resources (paragraph 6).



9.         The longer term economic prospects of Guyana are favorable, as
discussed in the latest economic report. There should be considerable scope
for development of the country's traditional exports. A substantial increase
in the acreage under sugar and rice is planned. Considerable expansion in
the capacity for producing calcined bauxite is also envisaged. Opportunities
exist for greater diversification in the agricultural sector both for import
substitution and for export. Government policy is aimed at increasing the
output of fruits, vegetables and livestock. Imports of a wide range of
agricultural commodities were banned at the end of 1971 to stimulate local
production and to deflect consumer tastes towards domestic products. The
country's forestry and fishery resources have yet to be effectively
exploited. The existence of an adverse trade balance in forestry products,
despite the fact that over 80 percent of the country's total land area is
under forests, emphasizes the need to develop forestry. Export prospects
for shrimp and fish are good, especially since other members of CARICOM
have a deficit in these products. A greater rate of industrial development
is also possible, provided foreign capital and expertise can be attracted
to participate in development projects in Guyana and policies to enable
the country to compete successfully with the industrially more developed
CARICOM countries are pursued. Thus, with appropriate development strategy,
including sound fiscal and monetary policies, Guyana can also improve its
economic development performance significantly over the longer term.
External Assistance and Creditworthiness
10.       Guyana has received considerable aid on concessionary terms in the
past from bilateral doners. In its own lending activities, the Bank has taken
into account the efforts of other multilateral and bilateral agencies, notably
the UNDP, USAID, the United Kingdom (ODA), and CIDA. Guyana is not a member of
the OAS or, as yet, IDB; it is expected that, following a resolution by the IDB
Governors' meeting in Santiago this year, IDB will soon accept Guyana as a member.
The Bank at present is the executing agency for two UNDP-financed studies
(highways and fisheries), and expects to execute two further UNDP studies
(highways and power) shortly. USAID's program has been extensive, including road
construction, water and sewerage projects, and agricultural assistance, mainly
through the construction of a rice research station and six rice drying and
storage installations. The Bank and USAID have cooperated in studies of the
Tapakuma and Black Bush irrigation and drainage rehabilitation and development
schemes. USAID-financed consultants have prepared or are preparing feasibility
studies for these projects. The Bank cooperation with CIDA is in the fields of
education, forestry, and power. Until recently, CIDA financed the training of
teachers for the Bank's first education project; CIDA is also financing a forestry
products marketing study which may lead to a possible Bank loan. CIDA joined
with the Bank and ODA in a loan to the Guyana Electricity Corporation in FY73.
In view of Guyana's increased aid requirements, there will be a greater need for aid
coordination.

12.       It is estimated that some US$30 million annually in inflows of long-te-
capital to the public sector in Guyana would be called for during the Second Dexzwr'
opment Plan period. Until recently, a considerable proportion of Guyana's capitaa
requirements frcm abroad came on highly concessionary terms. As a result, the debt
service ratio remained fairly moderate. The government may now find it
difficult to meet its capital requirements through loans and credits from
official sources alone. Last year, the government borrowed in the Euro-
dollar market for the first time and also placed increased reliance on
suppliers' credits. This practice may continue. The external public debt
outstanding at the end of 1972 amounted to US$153 million. The service
charges on this debt amounted to 4.5 percent of the export proceeds and
were expected to rise to 11 percent by 1979. Since exports account for
over one-half of Guyana's GNP, a debt service ratio of this magnitude is
high. Nevertheless, with proper debt managements this should not prove
to be overly burdensome. Guyana, while remaining creditworthy for Bank
and other conventional long term lending, would also benefit from concessionary



-6-
aid In order to ease its debt servicing problem. Extended amortization
periods on conventional loans ae also justified. It is estimated that the
Bank Group's share in Guyana's projected debt may increase fros 3 percent
in 1972 to 18 percent in 1979, and the Bank share in debt service would rise
from 4 percent to 16 percent over the same period. While it has not been
possible at this time to assess fully the impact of petroleum prices on the
Guyanese economy,, the effect would be substantially alleviated if the
expected increases in the prices of bauxite, alumina and sugar materialize.
PART II - BENK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GUIANA
13.       The first Bank loan to then British Guiana was US$1.3 million in 1961
for agricultural credit. The loan has been repaid in full. Since independence,
Guyana h s received from the Bank Group loans and credits totalling US$28.8 million,
US$19 31dmillion from the Bank and US$9.5 million from IDA. The proposed loan
would be the seventh Bank Group operation since F11969 and would be the only
loan in M1974. Reflecting Guyana's development needs, past lending has
been for infrastructure (sea defnse, highways, and power projects accounted
for 69 percent of lending), education (19 percent), and agriculture and livestock
(12 percent). There have been no IFC operations in Guyana and no investments
are at present being conidered. While some delays occurred in the early stages of
the execution of the sea defense, livestock, and education projects, the projects
cuirrently are proceeding satisfactorily. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans and IDA credits as of February 28, 1974f, with notes on the status of
on-going projects.
1a.       Future Bank Group lending in Guyana is expected to grow moderately
as the pipeline of projects grows and managerial constraints to project implemen-
tation are gradually overcome. During the years ahead, Bank Group lending is
likely to place heavy emphasis on the development of agriculture and natural
resources. A fisheries project, which would involve both the private and
public sectors, would provide for fish processing, shrimp trawlers, and possibly
port facilities. A forestry project would support a program to exploit, process
and market the tropical hardwoods of a forest area of some 880,000 acres in
central Guyana. A second livestock project would support the program now being
assisted under a 7T1971 project (Credit No. 221-GUA). After the Tapakuma project,
a second major irrigation and drainage project is planned in the Black Bush
Polder area to promote a diversified crop production as well as rice cultivation.
In the social field, a second education project is planned to increase the
supply of teachers and technicians, to expand nonformal training and to broaden
the curricula at the secondary level.  A water supply and sewerage project, for
which a USAID-financed feasibility study is in progress, would be the Bank Groupts
first venture in this field in Guyana. As regards to power and transport, we are
assisting in the preparation of a hydroelectric power project to enable Guyana
to smelt aluminum based on electricity at reasonable prices, and in the identification
of a project aimed at the development of the inland water transportation system.
including a US$6.0 million loan made in FY1973 for a power project.

PART III - AGRICULTURE AND RICE PRODUCTION IN GUYANA
15.       Agricultural development is accorded a high priority in the Guyana
government's Second Development Plan for 1972-76. During the last decade,
the growth of agricultural output, at about 1.5 percent annually (at constant
prices), lagged behind the rate of population growth. The sector's contri-
bution to GDP declined from 26 percent in 1960 to about 20 percent in 1972.
There has been a virtual stagnation in both rice and sugar production.
Annual sugar production averaged 328,000 long tons in the triennium 1960-62
and 332,000 long tons in 1970-72; and rice production decreased from an
average of 127,000 long tons to 119,000 long tons during the same periods.
The proportion of the total labor force employed in agriculture has also
declined from 45 percent in 1950 to about 30 percent at present.
16.       Unlike sugar, rice production is dominated by small, independent
farmers. In response to the stimulus of high world prices, rice production grew
at an annual rate of about 6 percent during the 1955-65 period, from 89,000 to
165,000 long tons, mainly by expanding the area under cultivation through large
investments in water control works. Guyana became the major rice producer and
exporter in the Caribbean region. As the new cultivation was extended into
marginal lands, however, yields fell from 2,100 lbs. per acre in 1960 to about
1,640 lbs. per acre in 1965. Producers attempted to cut costs by substituting
machinery for increasingly expensive labor. After 1965, annual production leveled
off as the expansion of the area under cultivation came to a halt. The situation
was aggravated from 1967 onwards as a result of low world prices for rice and,
in the past two years, by adverse weather conditions in Guyana. The position has
recently changed for the better, however, and rice prices are now quite high and
should remain reasonably remunerative in the future.
17.       The goverment controls the Guyana rice indu try.  At present, the
principal government agency charged with responsibility for providing credit
and technical services to rice farmers is the Guyana Rice Board (GRB), a
statutory body responsible to the Ministry of National Developmnt and Agri-
culture (MNDA). The GRB provides production credit to farmers in the form
of fertilizers, insecticides and other ossential inputs; it is the principal
buyer and processor and sole exporter of rice. For exports to the CARICOM
area, its principal market, contracts are negotiated each year at prices
which are more stable than in outside world markets.
18.       In 1969, the government initiated a rice modernization program to
revitalize the industry. With financial support from USAID, the GRB has
been improving its processing facilities to cut down on losses incurred in
the harvesting, storage and distribution stages of production. The program
should markedly improve the qimlity of rice for export and promote a higher
capacity utilization. Improvement and expansion of irrigation and drainage
systems in the two major rice producing areas, Tapakuma and the Black Bush



- 8 -
Polder, are important components of the government's 1972-76 Development Plan.
In comparison with other areas, the Tapakuma area is depressed economically
and is in urgent need of rehabilitation.
PART IV - THE PROJBCT
19*       The project proposed for Bank financing is designed to rehabilitate
and extend the existing irrigation development in the Tapakusa area. The
Bank appraisal mission in May 1973 concluded that three adjacent areas,
Supenaam, Johanna Cecilia, and Somerset-Berks, should be included together
with the Tapakuma scheme. The feasibility studies for these areas were
received in October 1973 and provided the basis for the report entitled "An
Appraisal of the Tapakuma Irrigation Project" (No. 388-GUA dated Hay 31, 1974),
which is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.  The main
features of the loan and the project are summarized in Annex III.
20.       Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington on May 6-10,
1974. The borrower was represented by Messrs. Winston King, Economic Adviser,
Ministry of Economic Development; Phillip Allsopp, Chief Works and Communications
Officer, Ministry of Works and Communicaticns; B.I.T. Pollard, Chief Parliamentary
Counsel, Attorney General's Office; Ben A. Carter, Chief Agricultural Officer, MNDA;
and Mr. Edward A. Agostini, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury.
Project Description
21.       The proposed project would provide for the rehabilitation, improve-
ment and extension of irrigation and drainage systems and other services for
the development of 41,750 acres (net) of land in four contiguous areas along the
Essequibo coast. This would include 27,700 acres in the existing Tapakuma irriga-
tion scheme and the construction of new irrigation and drainage systems for the rest
of the project area. The principal objectives of the project are to increase rice
production and to improve rice quality. This would strengthen Guyana's position
as the major rice producer and exporter in the CARICOM region. It would benefit
about 5,000 farmers, mostly smallholders with 2 to 20 acres each, who are among
the poorest in the country. At present, the main constraints in the region are
inefficient drainage, poor roads, lack of land leveling, inadequate extension
services, and lack of good management. The proposed project would address these
problems. It would also enable the government to improve farmer incomes in the
project region.
220       On-farm development would consist primarily of land leveling on about
20,000 acres at present cropped to rice, and clearing and leveling about 7,000
additional acres of bush land which is suitable for rice production. After
covlpetion of the civil works and on-farm development, about 6,000 acres of
land suitable for irrigated cropping would be available for new settlers.



- 9. -
23.       The project would assist in expanding and improving the extension
services in the project area and would provide for improved seed production.
Consultants would assist in preparing, for Bank approval, a program to strengthen the
Extension Division of MNDA through improved extension services to farmers, training,
field trials and soil testing. The MNDA Extension Division staff in the project area
would be increased from 3 to 6 extension agents, and they would be trained by a
consultant in specific fields of agricultural production. Provision would also be
made for field equipment to serve the farmers, principally for soil testing to determine
fertilizer requirements, efficient water use and proper cultivation practices.
The GRB's technical assistance and research programs would be expanded to include
three applied research farms for research on rice varieties, fertilizer response,
water requirements, pest and disease control, seed testing and improved cultivation
techniques. A new building for seed storage and new seed processing machinery
would also be provided, as well as equipment to operate experimental farms and
to conduct research.
24.       GRB will maintain a reserve fund out of profits earned from export
sales of rice to stabilize the prices paid to farmers and to cover the costs
of replacement and major repairs of its farm machinery and rice processing
equipment. The technical assistance staff of the GRB would be strengthened and
would be aided by consultants. The project-related operations of the MNDA Exten-
sion Service and of the GRB would be coordinated; the staff of both agencies would
participate in a farmer-training program to be developed by consultants.
25.       To replace and consolidate existing facilities, a new headquarters
building at AnnA Regina would be constructed to accommodate the project staff.
In addition to the office of the Project Manager, the new headquarters building
would provide office space for the NNDA Tapakuma Extension Service, Land
Development Division, Operation and Maintenance Division, the administrator
for the Cooperative Societies and the Chairman of the Rice Action Committee.
The now facilities would also include a machinery repair and servicing shop
for equipment to be used in the project area. Equipment and vehicles would
be provided to assist in project administration. An Operation and Maintenance
Division, with adequate staff and equipment, would be established to improve
water management and maintenance works for the project.
26.       Consultant services would be provided for engineering design, super-
vision of construction of civil works and for on-farm development. Consultants
would also advise the GRB and the MNDA Extension Division on research, agricul-
tural development and seed production. A total of 26 man-years of consultant
services would be provided under the loan. Employment of consultants, accept-
able to the Bank and contracted under appropriate terms and conditions, would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Project Management and Organization
27.       The MNDA would be responsible for implementing the project over a
6-year period, for providing supporting services and for operating and maintain-
ing the project when it is completed. A Project Nanager, under terms of refer&enie



determined in consultation with the Bank, would supervise and coordinate all
project activities. The appointment of a Project Manager, with adequate powers
to supervise and coordinate the execution of the project, and of a Project
Engineer, both acceptable to the Bank, would be conditions of effectiveness
of the proposed loan. The land leveling program would be carried out by the
Land Development Division of the HNDA with equipment provided under the project.
The surveys and designs for civil works would be carried out by the Drainage
and Irrigation Board (D & I Board) of the MNDA with the assistance of consultants.
28.       All of the major departments in the MNDA with responsibility for
agricultural development would be participating in project operations. The
Ministry has recently undergone a reorganization which greatly expanded its
responsibilities, and some of the new departments and divisions are not yet fully
integrated into the new structure. It is planned that the divisions at project
le7el would be adequately strengthened to be able to handle their tasks.
Supervision and coordination of all project activities would be centralized in
the office of the Project Manager.
Costs, Financin  and ProJect Cb.ares
29.       The project cost is estimated at US$18.5 imillion, net of taxes and
import duties. A Bank loan of US$12.9 million would cover the estimated foreign
exchange costs, including contingencies and interest during construction. It
would be equivalent to about 70 percent of the total project cost. The period
of the proposed Bank loan would be 30 years. The loan would have a 6-year
grace period, corresponding to the construction period of the project.
30.       The MNDA, through the D & I Board, is empowered to impose irrigation
charges sufficient to cover operation and nmintenance costs and the cost of
capital investment. The charges levied at present in the Tapakuma area cover
only 80 percent of the operating and maintenance costs, with no provision for
capital recovery. It is now planned to gradually introduce charges which would
cover all operation and maintenance costs plus recovery of all investment costs
over a period of 50 years at an interest rate of 6 percent per annum.
The charges would be graduated according to farm size and would amount to
an estimated 7-28 percent of net farmer incomes. It is proposed that
farmers continue to pay the rates now in force during the execution of the
project and that payments of the new rates be imposed progressively as
project facilities are completed and lands come into full use. It is
expected that full charges could be imposed on about 10,000 acres in 1978
and on the entire project by 1982. The level of charges would be reviewed
by the government in consultation with the Bank, at least once every two
years, taking into account changes in farmers' incomes having occurred
since the last review.
Procur-ement and Disbursement
31.       Except for contracts too small to attract foreign bidders,
all contracts for civil works and equipment, which would account for



- 11 -
about US$7.0 million of the foreign exchange component excluding contingencies,
would be awarded through international competitive bidding under the Bank's
Guidelines. For purposes of bid comparisons and the award of contracts for
equipment, preference would be granted to local suppliers equal to 15 percent of
the CIF costs of competing imports or to the existing rate of duty, whichever
is lower. Suppliers in the CARICOM countries other than Guyana would be accorded
preference equal to 15 percent of the CIF price or to the difference in tariff
between CARICOh and external suppliers, whichever is lower. For civil works, it
is likely that foreign contractors will form joint ventures with local contractors,
which would help local contractors to improve their capability for this type of
work. The procurement for on-farm development and office buildings would be
made under proodums appropriate for each category: buildings would be constructed
under contracts awarded through local competitive bidding; consultants by direct
negotiation; and on-farm development would be carried out by the Land Development
Division of MNDA.
32.       The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against 65 percent of the
total cost of civil works (including buildings); 66 percent of on-farm develop-
ment costs; 100 percent of the CIF cost of imported equipment, 80 percent of
the cost of imported equipment purchased locaLly, or 100 percent of the exfactcry
price of locally manufactured equipment; and 100 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of foreign consultants' services and of salaries of local consultants.
It is estimated that survey and design work would begin during the second half
of 1974; the Closing Date would be June 30, 1980.
Economic Justification
33.        The major benefit of the project for Guyana would be the increases
in rice production and higher foreign exchange receipts from rice exports.
Increased sales would lead to higher farm incomes (representing an increase
in farm income of 200 percent by 1980 in the case of subsistence farmers and
37 percent for large farmers) and, as the project would be located in a
depressed rural area, to a better income distribution. The average annual
per capita cash income of the farmers affected by the project would increase
from about US$50 at present to US$80 when the project is in full operation.
With the increased cropping intensity, seasonal underemployment would decline.
The newly-developed rice lands available for settlement would enable the
government to accommodate an additional 500 to 600 low-income farm families.
34.       At full agricultural development, 9 years after commencement of the
project, the net value of production at eostant prices would be US$9.8 million
per year, while the corresponding value without the project would be about
US$4.9 million. With the project costs and benefits discounted over a 50-year
period, a conservative estimate of the most probable economic rate of return
is about 20 percent. A sensitivity analysis shows that with a combination of
a 20 percent cost overrun and a 20 percent decrease in expected yields, the
economic rate of return would be reduced to 10 percent, which would still be
acceptable.
35.       No adverse ecological effects are expected.

PART V - LEGAL INSTWMUENTS
36.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Guyana, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
37.       The special features of the proposed project concerning the employment
of consultants, the appointment of the Project Manager and the Project Engineer,
and the system of water charges, which are referred to in paragraphs 26, 27, and
30 of this report, are reflected in Sections 3.03(a), 3.03(b), 6.01(a),snd
6.01(b); 3.02(a), 3.02(b); and 4.07 of the draft Loan Agreement, respectively.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RKCOIMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Execiutive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI/
Ln No. 583     Education Project; US$2.9 Million Loan and US$2.9 Million
Cr. No. 139    Credit of January 31, 1969-
Closing Date:  December 31, 1974
Construction of all project schools is expected to be completed
by April 1975, about 20 months behind the appraisal schedule. Slippage
resultetl principally from delays in appointing consultant architects and
in awarding civil works' contracts following opening of bids. The delay
has resulted in about a 21% increase in estimated project costs, which
is borne by the borrower. Project implementation now is expected to
proceed according to the revised schedule and should be completed about
four months after the present closing date. Procurement of furniture
and equipment is progressing satisfactorily and inaccordance with
the revised construction schedule.
Cr. No. 221    Livestock Project; US$2.2 Million Credit of November' 27, 1970;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1976 
Progress on execution of this project has been slower than antici-
pated at appraisal, due largely to difficulties and delays in the formation
and functioning of cattle owners' cooperatives as successful livestock
enterprises. However, a sound start has been made with a number of loans
already apprcved and others being processed. Other aspects of the project,
including financing of private ranches in the inland and the conduct of
pasture grazing trials, are now proceeding fairly well.
kn. No. 765    Second Sea Defense Project; US$5.4 Million Loan of
June 2h, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1 974
The project costs are now estimated at 45% above the appraisal esti-
mate.   A number of factors have affected costs: devaluation, a lag of 1.5
years between appraisal and bid opening, construction difficulties with the
cofferdam on the first sea defense project (ln. no. 599), and accelerated
erosion of the foreshore. The lowest bid for the civil works was more than
double the appraisal estimate. The government proposed to construct the
sea wall by force account since it believed that consultants' assessment
of the risks involved was an important cause of these high bids.
1/      These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being takcen
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced
evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 3
After a detailed examination of this proposal by consultants and
Bank staff, the proposal was accepted. At the time of appraisal, the
economic return on the project was estimated at 31%; even with a 45%
increase in estimated costs, the project is still justified economically
since its rate of return should still be above 20%. Although the project
as a whole is now progressing satisfactorily, past delays in reaching
agreement between the government and the consultants on the rehabilitation
of sluice outfalls will necessitate an extension of the present closing date.
Cr. No. 301  Highway Project; US$4.4 Million Credit of April 26, 1972;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1976
The start of construction work was delayed until July 1973, and
progress has since been slow due to adverse weather conditions and to the
contractor's lack of experience. The original economic rate of return
estimate of 15% may have to be lowered to (a still acceptable) 13%. This
reduction results from a 15% cost overrun and delays in project completion.
Ln. No. 875   Power Project; us$6.0 Million Loan of January 12, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Because of delays in project engineering, the execution of the
project had a slow start. As the project is being built in several
stages, however, the initial delay will not affect the final project
completion date. Due to higher costs of many project items, the project
is likely to cost considerably more than the appraisal estimate. A Bank
mission is scheduled to visit Guyana in June to review the cost estimates.
