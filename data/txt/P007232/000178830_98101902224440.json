           improving, rehabilitating and extending irrigation and\n            drainage systems serving 41,750 acres (net) of rice land\n            along the Essequibo Coast. The project would help Guyana to\n            increase rice production and exports, and thereby increase\n            farmer income. The main project works are summarized below:\n            (a) construction, rehabilitation and expansion of irrigation\n            systems and interceptor and facade drains; (b) construction\n            of 6 drainage pumping stations; (c) construction of a flood\n            protection dike along the Pomeroon River; (d) construction\n            of 4 sea sluices and repair of an existing sluice in the\n            Supenaam Extension Area; (e) construction of regulators,\n            tail-gates, checks, irrigation inlets and drainage outlets\n            for individual farms; (f) reinforcement and expansion of the\n            conservancy dam and reservoir in the Johanna Cecilia\n            Extension Area; (g) construction of 2 reservoir relief\n            sluices and a discharge channel in the Johanna Cecilia\n            Extension Area; (h) construction and rehabilitation of\n            all-weather access roads and related structures; (i) land\n            leveling of about 20,000 acres presently under rice\n            cultivation, and clearing and land leveling of about 7,000\n            acres of bush land; and (j) improvement and expansion of\n            extension services in the project area."}, "docdt": "1974-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
