The lessons learned indicate that the project\n            has demonstrated that the demand-driven approach, as an\n            alternative to the traditional supply-driven service\n            delivery, works quite successfully. Making the communities\n            participate fully in the decision-making process and in\n            contributing cash and labor have enabled them to gain a\n            sense of ownership of their infrastructure schemes. The\n            project has also demonstrated to the government that reform\n            is possible, and that it pays to try innovative ways of\n            delivering infrastructure services. The project's\n            experience highlights the need to have effective planning\n            and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, for example, with\n            an efficient Management Information System (MIS) system in\n            place from the beginning of a project. To scale up the\n            demand-driven approach to service delivery, it is important\n            that the implementing entity (such as the Fund Board) does\n            not become dependent on IDA/donor financing. Although the\n            project has enabled the communities to own and operate their\n            infrastructure schemes without any significant assistance\n            from the sector institutions or the local government\n            agencies, the need to ensure follow-up support to\n            communities and NGOs in case of natural calamities, for\n            example, remains crucial. Given the Support\n            Organization's (Sos) high involvement in mobilizing and\n            guiding the communities, it is crucial to pay strong\n            attention to the selection and training of the SOs."}, "docdt": "2004-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
