Lessons learned\n            from the projects included: comprehensive approaches to\n            development in which provision of small-scale infrastructure\n            is accompanied by capacity-building to develop local\n            institutions and ownership are more successful than\n            infrastructure alone. When existing institutions fail and\n            are unwilling to reform, careful design of new institutions\n            can be a viable solution. The success of this approach is\n            heavily conditioned on in-depth institutional analysis,\n            close attention to the governance structure and the\n            willingness of the Bank to stand firm against vested\n            interests for as long as it takes to be accepted. Even so,\n            government does have a role and its interest must be\n            internalized in the governance and regulatory structures of\n            new organizations: partnership is better than conflict.\n            Small pilot projects to test new institutional approaches\n            can be very successful providing they adopt a learning\n            approach and give thoughtful attention to feedback from\n            continuous monitoring to refine the development model. If\n            improved health outcomes are a project objective then\n            careful design of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to\n            link project interventions to improvements in health incomes\n            is needed. This needs to be done from the outset of the project."}, "docdt": "2008-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
