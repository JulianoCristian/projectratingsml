The lessons learned\n            indicate that the project helped improve relations between\n            forest departments and local people from a high conflict\n            situation to one of improved cooperation and collaboration\n            through implementation of the ecodevelopment model. The\n            creation of microplans and community funds linked village\n            development to Protected Area (PA) protection and provided\n            villagers with choices about livelihood and development\n            options. The long-term sustainability and success of the\n            ecodevelopment programs and individual Ecodevelopment\n            Committees (EDCs) can be enhanced through linkages to\n            political processes and local and national government\n            programs. India has a strong civil society movement, both\n            pro-conservation and pro-poor, and the project attracted\n            much criticism for a) sacrificing biodiversity objectives to\n            address poverty issues and b) disadvantaging poor\n            communities to support wildlife conservation. The need to\n            provide 25 percent co-financing towards ecodevelopment\n            activities led to some village families being excluded from\n            ecodevelopment benefits."}, "docdt": "2004-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
