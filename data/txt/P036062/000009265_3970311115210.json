The main\n            objectives will be to: 1) improve capacity of PA management\n            to conserve biodiversity and increase opportunities for\n            local participation in PA management activities and\n            decisions; 2) reduce negative impacts of local people on\n            biodiversity, reduce negative impacts of PAs on local\n            people, and increase collaboration of local people in\n            conservation efforts; 3) develop more effective and\n            extensive support for ecodevelopment; 4) ensure effective\n            management of this project; and 5) prepare future\n            biodiversity projects. The project will be implemented over\n            a five-year period from October 1996 through September 2001.\n            Its components correspond to its objectives and comprise: 1)\n            improved PA management; 2) village ecodevelopment that\n            reduces negative interactions of local people on\n            biodiversity and increases collaboration of local people in\n            conservation; 3) education and awareness and impact\n            monitoring and research that develops more effective and\n            extensive support for PA ecodevelopment; 4) overall project\n            management; 5) preparation of future biodiversity projects;\n            and 6) reimbursement of the project preparation facility."}, "docdt": "1996-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
