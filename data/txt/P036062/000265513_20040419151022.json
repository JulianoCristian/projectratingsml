Both are important goals\n            but there are inherent conflicts as well as potential\n            complementarities between them. Tribal people from one of\n            the seven sites-Nagarahole, filed a Request for Inspection\n            claiming that no specific indigenous peoples development\n            plan had been prepared with the informed participation of\n            affected indigenous/tribal groups. They fear that an\n            anticipated forceful eviction of the tribal population from\n            the project area will result in them being uprooted from\n            their forest habitats, which are their socio-cultural life\n            base. They believe that current and potential harm is a\n            result of the Bank's own failure to follow its policies\n            and procedures. Management decided that past experience with\n            conservation projects in areas with human pressures pointed\n            towards a process design project which, after a period of\n            indicative planning to establish the framework and define\n            appropriate processes, proceeded to get things done on the\n            ground. Indicative planning to establish the main areas of\n            conflict, appropriate participatory mechanisms, eligible\n            types of investment, and effective institutional\n            arrangements was undertaken during project preparation.\n            Management appears to have been aware of the paucity of\n            information and research at the appraisal stage. In simply\n            accepting the fact that objective data and scientific\n            studies were very limited, however, the International\n            Development Association (IDA) appears to have allowed much\n            of the debate about the potential conflict between the two\n            main thrusts of the project to be conducted on the basis of\n            predetermined views and unsubstantiated claims. Management\n            acknowledges that the Project did not carry out the\n            \"identification of local preferences through direct\n            consultation\" at the appraisal stage. Instead of\n            complying directly with the OD 4.20's directives in the\n            appraisal phase, Management intended that \"more\n            detailed consultation\" would follow during\n            implementation. Management admits that no separate\n            Indigenous Peoples' Development Plan was prepared\n            during the appraisal stage, as required by OD 4.30. If an\n            Indigenous People's Development Plan had been prepared,\n            it would have further exposed the tension between\n            biodiversity protection objectives and the condition and\n            aspirations of the indigenous people at Rajiv Gandhi\n            National Park. It would have enabled significant input on\n            the basic assumptions and concepts underlying the\n            Ecodevelopment Project. The Panel finds that certain key\n            premises underlying the design phase of the Project at the\n            Nagarahole site are flawed, as a result of which there is a\n            significant potential for serious harm. It therefore\n            recommends that the Executive Directors authorize an\n            investigation into this case."}, "docdt": "1998-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
