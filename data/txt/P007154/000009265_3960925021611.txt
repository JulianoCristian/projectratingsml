THIRID TELECOMMUNICATICO-S PROJECT (LOAN 1570-ES)
Highlights
1.        The Third Telecommunications Project in El Salvador, a self-
contained part of ANTEL's 1978-82 Investment Program, was to assist ANTEL in
developing local networks in San Salvador and nther cities to meet part of the
demand for local connections. The project also included the provision of
telephone services to low-income urban areas and rural communities.
2.        The physical targets for the urban sector were largely achieved but
with considerable delays. A number of installations, mostly outside San
Salvador, had to be reLocated and work in rura. areas proceeded very slowly.
Tranmission media and routes also had to be changed for security reasons.
Delays were due tos
(a) changes in design and scope of project, which caused delays in
procurement of equipment, financed by both ANTEL and the Bank;
(b) frequent changes in top management at the initial stage of the
project; and
*(c) civil unrest in the country.
3.        The financial performance of ANTEL has been satisfactory (para.
5.2). The covenants on rate of return and debt service coverage were met.
4.        The organizational structure of ANTEL was modified to meet the
current and future needs. There has also been improvements in ANTEL's
accounting system through the desogn and implementation of a new computerized
accounting system.
5.        The lessons to be learned are:  (a) the desirability of maintaining
continuity of top manager; (b) advanced procurement for major items would
substantially help the fast execution of the project.



EL SALVADOR
THIRD COMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (LOAN 1570-ES)
PROJECT COIPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL), an
autonomous government-owned public corporation provides all telecommunication
services in El Salvador. Act 370 of August 27, 1963 grants ANTEL the right to
plan, acquire, construct and operate all telecosmunication facilities; to
propose tariffs and other charges for its services; and to introduce the
tariffs after obtaining the approval of the Minist:y of Economy. Private
users may obtain licenses from the Government on an annual basis to operate
point-to-point telecommunications services when ANTEL is unable to provide
them on payment of a license fee. ANTEL is administered by a Board of
Directors, whose president is appointed by the President of the Republic.
ANTEL's day-to-day business is managed by the President of the Board assisted
by a General Manager, who also functions as the Secretary of the Board.
1.2       The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector in
El Salvador since 1963 through three loans. The first loan (358-ES) effective
October 1963, of $9.5 million was closed in December 1968. The second loan
(811-ES) effective August 1972, of $9.5 million was closed in March 1979. A
project completion report was issued in April 1980. In May 1978, the Bank
apptoved a third loan (1570-ES) of $23 million to ANTEL, with the Republic of
El Salvador as guarantor. This lean was closed in December 1984 and is the
subject of this report.
II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND COVENANTS
Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.1       Under Second Bank Project (Loan 811-ES (1972-1978)), ANTEL retained
the services of TAI, Inc. of U.S.A. as consultants to prepare the short-term
(1978-82) and long-term (1978-98) telecommunications development pansi for
El Salvador. In April 1977, ANTEL prepared a project for Bank financing based
on the consultants' report. TLe project was appraised in June/July 1977.
Negotiations were held in Washington in February 1978 and the Bank's Board of
Directors approved the loan on May 18, 1978. The loan agreement was signed on
June 9, 1978, and became effective on September 21, 1978.
Project Objectives
2.2       The project was designed to finance a self-contained part of ANTEL's
1978-82 national telecommunications development program.  The project
objectives were to:



-2
(a) significantly develop local networks in San Salvador and secondary
cities to meet part of the unsatisfied 4emand for local connections
(including the provision of telephone service to low-income urban
areas through public call boxes);
(b) upgrade and expand the domestic long distance network;
(c)  expand telephone service to rural communities then without
facilities;
(d) improve the quality of service; and
(e) improve financial managcment and practices as well as planning
improve-tents to be carried out with assistance from ITU experts.
Project Description
2.3       The inititat project design consisted of the installation of the
following:
(a) about 41,000 additional lines of local automatic telephone exchange
equipment, the local cable network, and subscriber facilities to
provide about 36,000 additional telephone connections and about 320
local public call boxes in low-income urban areas;
(b) two long-distance automatic exchanges with about 2,200 terminations;
Cc) long-distance transmission equipment on various routes to provide
about 2,400 additional circuits*
Cd) 300 VF telegraph channels and 600 teleprinters at subscribers'
premises;
(e) about 200 long-distance pubic call offices in municipalities and
rural areas with a population of 2,000 or more, then without
service; and
(f) buildings to house the equipment.
Proiect Cost Estimates
1.4       The project cost was estimated at t 129 million ($51.6 million
equivalent)-with a foreign exchange component of $35.7 million. The Bank was
to finance $23.0 million of the foreign exchange cost and ABTEL to finance the
balance of $12.7 million in foreign costs and all local costs ($15.9 million
equivalent).
Covenants
2.5       In addition to the standard covenants, the Loan Agreement provided
that ASMEL,



(a)  conduct a stue7 on the revaluation of the Borrower's assets as of
December 31, 1980 and furnish to the BSank, not later thar. July 31,
1980, the findings and preliminary recoamendations of the study;
(b) as of December 31, 1980, revalue the Borrower's fixed assets and
determine one or more methods satisfactory to the Bank for future
revaluation;
(c) not undertake additional capitai expenditures for any major
expansion;
(d) carry out, by December 31, 1979, a feasibility study on the applica-
tion of peak and off-peak rates on long distance calls;
(e) have its accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year
audited by independent auditors and furnish to the Bank copies of
the audited financial statements and the auditors' reports within
four months of the end of each fiscal year;
(f) produce an annual rate of return of not less than 15X on historical
assets, before 1980, and 101 on revalued assets on !980 and
thereafter;
Cg) not incur any debt unless net revenues are at least 1.5 times the
azimum debt service requirement for any succeeding year.
ANTEL complied with all the loan covenants. The FY77 and FY78 audited
financial statements were late, but subsequent years' statements were on
time.  Compliance with the covenants is indicated in Annex 1.
2.6       The Guarantee Agreement provided that the Covernment of El Salvador
CThe Guarantor):
(a) pay, or cause the public agencies to pay, by September 30, 1978,
bills overdue as of becamber 31, 1977, in an amount of not less than
¢ 1,400,000;
(b) cause the public agencies to coor~erate with the Borrower, in order
to enable the Borrower to determine, by September 30, 1978, the
balance of bills overdue as of December 31, 1977, as well as methods
for the settlement of such balance;
(c)  pay, or cause each public agency to pLy, by June 30, 1979, any
amount of the balance of bills overdue as of December 31, 1977, that
each such public agency shall have to pay to the Borrower; and
(d) take all such measures as ihall be necessary to ensure that, at all
times, each public agency shall pay, promptly when due, each bill
other than bills referred to in (a), (b) or (c).
ANTEL has collected bills for services to Government as covenanted with the
exception of the Ministry of Defense and Security, on a regular basis since
1978.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.1       Loan 1570-ES became effective on September 21, 1978.  There were no
special conditions for effectiveness. Project was delayed initially by
changes in design, from Crossbar switching (electromechanical) to Digital
switching (electronic) and the changes in the bidding documents. Further,
there were changes in ANTEL uanagement in 1979-80. Later, due to the civil
unrest in the country, Bank suspended disbursements in 1981.
Revision of the Project
3.2       Revisions were made in the project during execution for security and
technical reasons and to meet higher than '!pected demand.  The changes made
with the consent of the Bank, were as follows:
(a) Some exchange installations planned were relocated and capacities
increased. An additional 10,000 local lines in San Salvador area
were included in the project after appraisal to meet higher than
expected demand;
(b) Some transmission media had to be changed and some routes changed.
The coaxial cable links proposed in the original project had to be
substituted by micro-wave and UHF radio. Coaxial cable was used to
link other cities not proposed in the original project. Except for
one link, all microwave links were relocated.
(c) The specifications for telephone switching equipment were changed
from electromechanical systems to electronic (digital) systems.
Some S.P.C. analogue systems (2,000 lines) were also procured.
Implementation
3.3       At appraisal in 1977 the project was scheduled to be completed by
December 31, 1982. However, substantial delays in project execution prompted
extended the closing date to Dqcember 31, 1984. ANTEL expects to complete the
project only by December 1988._
3.4       The main reason for the delay were:
(a) Change in project design, from electrochemical exchanges to
electronic digital exchanges. Specifications were changed, delaying
the start-up of the project. Change in project scope, with the
addition of 10,000 new lines.
1/   Approximately 97% of the project has been completed by December 1987.
For the balance, all procurement has been done, and only minor local
costs associated with installation need to be incurred (Annez 4).

(b) Unrest in the country: The disbursements under the loan were
suspended for about six months starting January 1, 1981 because Bank
missions could not visit El Salvador to supervise the project. Some
of the installations planned, mostly outside the city of San
Salvador, had to be relocated and routes changed due to the unrest;
(c) Frequent changes in management during the project's initial stage of
contributed to the very slow start of the project.
In retrospect, the original implementation and disbursement schedules were too
optimistic.
Reporting
3.5       ANTEL submitted regular quarterly reports on the physical progress
of the project and operations, including audited financial statements.
Procurement
3.6       Procurement delays were a significant problem in project
execution. Procurement started very slowly. During negotiations it was
agreed that contracts for all Banks financed goods (except rural service
equipment) would be signed by the end of December 1978. Contracts for rural
services equipment were expected to be signed by December 1979. However, by
June 1979, ANTEL had yet to issue a single bid invitation. Three staff from
ANTEL visited Bank headquarters in Washington in November 1980 to expedite
procurement. As a result, by July 1981 Bank approved ANTEL's bid award
recommendations for goods totalling about US$20.2 million. The last contracts
for procurement of equipment under the project were signed in November 1983.
Except for a long delay of over two years in the procurement stages of the
project, there were no major procurement problems of Bank financed goods which
were in accordance with Bank's guidelines.
34        Regarding telephone switching equipment, ANTEL originally intended
t.o install analog systems, but with Bank's concurrence later decided to
install mostly digital systems. The lowest offer was from Nippon Electric
Company of Japan (NEC). NEG introduced a contingency clause providing for the
modification of the contract for security measures for its installation
staff.  AIEL considered this clause could result in the non-completion of the
installation, and ANTEL's legal department rejected the offer. The Bank's
legal department accepted ANTEL's rejection as valid and the bid was awarded
to next lowest bidder, was L.M. Ericsson. However, ANTEL then requested the
Bank's approval to contract with L.M. Ericsson for switching equipment for
about 2,000 analog lines and the rest of the digital type, for the same total
cost as the analog type equipment which L.M. Ericsson had bid. However, ANTEL
had already contracted with L.M. Ericsson for digital switching equipment for
San Salvador in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for international
competitive bidding; because of the merits of the digital system, Bank agreed
to ANTEL's request to contract with L.M. Ericsson.

Project Costs
3.8       The estimated project costs at the time of appraisal, revised
estimates, and the actual costs as of December 31, 1985 are shown in Annex 2
and summarized in TabLe 3.1.

/a   The exchange rate at appraisal was US$1 = Colones 2.50 Exchange rate changes to US$1 l
Colones 5.00 effective January 1, 1986 are taken into account in the costs.  This
results into a proforma rate of US$1 = Colones 2.6 during the project period.
/b   The revised cost estimates as of December 31, 1978.
7c   Costs added up to December 31, 1986.  However, the project is expected to be completed
in December 1988.
3.9       The revised cost estimate was about 292 higher than the original
estimate. This was largely due to the increased scope of the project (para.
3.2). Thie addition of 10,000 local lines to the project (after appraisal with
Bank's consent) to meet a higher than expected demand, increased project costs
by about 26X or the equivalent of about US$11.5 million.
3.10      It is difficult to make a direct comparison between the estimated
and actul} project costs due to numerous changes in the scope of the
project.-   However, costs for internationally procured equipment were
generally higher than for similar equipment procured through ICS in other
countries, because of the number of bids received being limited as a result of
the civil unrest in the country. The Japanese companies' bids, whicb were
generally the lowest, were disqualified bacause they placed unacceptable
conditions.
Disbursement
3.11      Estimated and actual disbursement of the Bank loan is shown below:

procurement of the equipment.

3.12      The slow disbursement reflects the delay. in start-up and implemen-
tation of the project (para. 3.4). Loan disbursements were suepended in
January 1981 as the Bank met increasing difficulties in carrying out routine
supervision because of a ban on travel to El Salvador due to civil unrest.
Disbursements were resumed in July 1981. The appraisal estimate of disburse-
ment was overly optimistic since the project was expected to be completed in
four years (by December 1982), even though procurement action had not been
initiated.
Loan Allocation

/a   As of November 1981.
7i   Due to the unrest, ANTEL decided to install microwave links instead of
coaxial cables.  The Bank agreed to reallocate funds from coaxial cables
to microwave equipment. However, the microwave was procured through
ANTEL's own resources since the bid award to the lowest bidder was
cancelled.
/c   Telex and telegraph equipment was procured using a loan from the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration and internally generated funds.
The Bank funds were reallocated to finance central office equipment.
'd  US$1,028,459 was cancelled effective October 31, 1985.
3.14      The revised allocation was largely a result of the redefinition of
categories. For example, equipment originally listed under category 2, (long
distance equipment) was included under category 1 (local exchange equipment);
contracts for swit-hing equipment (category 1) also covered long distance
equipment (originally included in cate&ory 2). This redefinition of
categories was preferred by the Controller's Department to avoid difficulties
in disbursements from several categories for the same contract.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers, and Borrower
3.15      This loan did not finance any consultants, although Bank's Second
telecommunications project did finance a study by consultants. However, ANTEL
utilized the services of ITU experts to assist in strengthening its planning
group. It also retained a consulting firm to design a new accounting system
in cooperation with ITU consultants. The consultants carried out their
assignments to the satisfaction of ANTEL.
3.16      The performance if contractors and suppliers in general were
satisfactory to all components of the project.
3.17      ANTEL's overall performance was adequate, but organizational
efficiency would have been higher if frequent changes in senior ana mid-level
management had not occurred during the initial stages of the project. There
were five different presidents in the first four years of the project.
However, the last president has been in office since 198S. ANTEL submitted
regular progress reports to the Bank during the project's execution.

IV.  OPERATING PERFORMANCE                                      M
4.1       At appraisal, ANTEL was expected to increase the capacity of the
automatic exchanges from 70,000 lines (on December 31, 1977) to 111,000 lines
(by December 1982) and the DELs fom 56,000 to 93,500. These and other project
objectives were realistic and achievable, but the project implementation
schedule as proposed did not have any allowance for delays due to unforeseen
circumstaices. The project objectives in terms of lines installed and in
service were achieved by December 31, 1985, that is with a delay of three
years. The initial project start-up delay was occassioned by: (a) change in
project scope and design, (b) civil unrest in the country and (c)
discontinuity in management in ANTEL. Annex 4 gives details of project
implementation.
4.2       Telephone service was extended to 56 new towns over the project
period. The number of DELs/100 population rised from 1.3 in 1977 to 2.0 in
1985.
4.3       The long distance service was improved by the addition of three
transit exchanges. The conversion of San Salvador transit exchange to handle
international traffic improved the call completion rate and reduced congestion
in the international traffic.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.1       ANTEL's financial statements, including both appraisal estimates and
actual results, for FY1977-86 are given in Annex 5-7. A summary of the key
results is given in Table 5.1.
5.2       The financial performance of ANTEL for the 1977-1986 period was
satisfactory. The annual rate of return on average net fixed assets was
higher than appraisal estimates. The covenanted return of 102 on revalued
assets was met during this period. Tariffs were increased in 1982 and in 1986
but still fell 5X in real terms. ANTEL however, has been able to contain
cost/DEL during the period and operating cost (before interest and
depreciation) also fell an average of 5Z p.a. in real terms. ANTEL thus has
been able to maintain its operating ratio at about 701 over the period.
Financial Position
5.3       The current ratio was higher than appraisal estimates due to a large
accumulation of cash balance and invehtories caused by the delay in project
implementation. The net long-term debt/equity ratio was below appraisal
estimates, with net long term debt at 14S of total equity in 1982, as opposed
to the appraisal estimate of 30Z. ANTEL was able to finance a higher
percentage of its investment requirements through internally generated cash
than anticipated at the time of appraisal.

5.4       The level of accounts receivable has been consistently higher than
targeted at appraisal. Bills to private subscribers are collected promptly
and outstanding bills on average are about one month of billing, which is
good. Collection of bills for services are about one month of billing, which
is good. Collection of bills for services to Government has not improved and
still remains a problem, inspite of the covenants agreed to during
negotiations (para. 2.6). The 1986 level of accounts receivable is extremely
high, partly due to the disruption caused by the October earthquake.
Financing Plan
5.5       It is difficult to make a direct comparison between the investment
program and financing plan as estimated and as executed, due to the numerous
revisions made to the scope of the project, the delays of about five years in
its implementation as well as the lack of complete financial dats. However,
Table 5.2 shows that the actual percentage of the capital outlay financed by
self generated funds compared favorably with the appraisal estimate. Net
internal cash generation was 81X of investments and working capital needs over
the 1977 to 1985 period, compared to the appraisal estimate of 651 over the
1977 to 1982 period. External financing requirements were met by the Bank
loan (21.97 million) and CABEI.
5.6       ANTEL's funds flow statements over the 197b-1985 period are shown in
Annex 7 and summarized in Table 5.2 below.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.1       ANTEL is administered by a five member Board of Directors.  The
President of the Republic appoints ANTEL's president who also functions as the
President of the Board. The day-to-day business is managed by the President
of the Board, assisted by a general manager, who also functions as Secretary
of the Board of Directors. During the project period numerous changes in top
management took place, delaying the implementation of the project. In July
1977, in the early stages of the project, the President, Ceneral Manager, and
the Chief Planning Officer were replaced. The new President has no previous
management experience in telecommunications, and had considerable difficulty
in guiding his technical and operational staff, a number of which were also
new. The General Manager was a member of ANTEL's Board of Directors and had
some prior experience in ANTEL's working, but had to work under pressure due
to the inexperience of his colleagues. The changes temporarily weakened
ANTEL's administration, but with increasing experience the management
improved. However, the president was replaced in 1980 and the new president
was in office for about only one year.
6.2       In January 1981, ANUEL's General Kanager was promoted to President
and a new Ceneral Manager was appointed. The new manager had a good
understanding of the technical and financial aspects of the institution and of
the project. Concurrently, ANTEL's organization underwent modification at the
sub-division levels to meet the demands of ANTEL's expanded network and
operations. New sub-divisions were created. Planning, engineering,
construction and operation and maintenance; and commercial operations and
Finances were under one manager each, but were split into six sub-divisions.
The new organization was better adapted to ANTEL's needs. Earlier in 1979, at
the recommendation of the Bank, ANTEL created the post of Assistant General
Manager to control operations and finance separately.
6.3       The last change in President took place in 1983.  Since 1983 the
management team has remained intact with only a few changed in mid-level
management.
Staffing and Training
6.4       At the end of December 1976, ANTEL employed 3,500 staff, or 64 per
1,000 DELs, which is high. The ratio was expected to decrease to 49/1,000 by
the end of 1982, but stood at 60. By the end of 1986, however, the ratio
remained 60, which is high compared to the average ratio of 10 staff per 1,000
DELs in the developed countries.
6.5       ANTEL administers a regional training center (INCATEL) in San
Salvador to train line and switching maintenance personnel, operators,
clerical and semi-skilled staff. The training was expanded in 1979 and meets
the needs of ANTEL. Although ANTEL technical training programs are adequate,
its training facilities for financial and administrative staff are not. ANTEL
sends candidates abroad for two-year engineering training in various
telecommunication disciplines. Some qpecialixed telecommunications training
was provided by equipment suppliers.

Accounting System
6.6       In 1977, ANTEL retained a local consulting firm to design, in
cooperation with ITJ's consultants, a new accounting system to better handle
ANTEL's expanded operations. In mid 1980, ANTEL completed the design of the
new accounting system, partly based on the consultants' work. The system was
codified to enable its computerization and also provide more detail on
revenues and operating costs for tariffs setting and cost control purposes.
ANTEL computerize'd its accounting system by January 1, 1982 and ran it
parallel with the manual system during 1982. ANTEL discontinued manual
accounting as of FY 1983.
Audit
6.7       ANTEL's accounts are subject to both internal and external audit.
The internal audit is exercised by tbe court of accouuts, a government
institution, and the external audit by independent auditors. The quality of
the external audits is satisfactory. Audit financial statements were received
only slightly behind the covenant schedule.
Tariffs
6.8       ANTEL's tariffs were not changed from 1964 through April 1978, with
the exception of connection fees, which were increased from 4 200 to 4 411 as
of January 1978. At the time of negotiations of Loan 811-ES in November 1971,
ANTEL agreed to review its tariff structure. After several studies and
reviews, ANTEL finally implemented a revised tariff structure as of May 1,
1978. In addition to lowering the fixed monthly rental and elimirating free
calls, three subscriber categories were reduced to two. Under the new tariff
structure, subscribers pay according to their actual telephone usage, which
contributed to reduce congestion, especially on the long distance lines, since
under the old tariff structure unused free pulses often were used for long
distance calls. The new tariff structure increased ANTEL's local traffic
revenues by about 10 (which equals about 2Z of ANTEL's total revenues).
6.9       As covenanted, ANTEL carried out a feasibility study in the
application of peak and off-peal rates on long distance calls. The study
found, however, that partly due to the existing low call charges, the
introduction of off-peak rates would not substantially change traffic'
patterns. Furthermore, the expansion of telephone facilities under the
project was expected to alleviate the telephone traffic congestion; it was
decided to postpone the introduction of off-peak rates.
6.10      As of January 1, 1982, the connection rates for subscriber-dialed
international calls were increased by 20X and rates for operator connected
international calls by about 451. In addition to increasing FY82 revenues
from international traffic, the tariff charge induced subscribers to use
existing automatic facilities with lower per call costs rather than using
operator assistance, As of May 1, 1986 the international call rates were
charged at the new official rate of exchange of 5 colones - 1 US$.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.1       In terms of physical works, the objectives of the project were
largely achieved for the urban sector. Due to the unrest in the country, a
number of installations had to be relocated and work in the rural areas
progressed very slowly. ANTEL planned to achieve a rate of growth at DELs of
112 per annum during the project period. Between 1977 and 1982, the average
growth actually achieved was around 71 per annum. Between 1978 and 1982,
21,760 DELs were added to the telephone network, compared to a project target
of 36,000. By tne end of the project, exchange fill was expected to reach
851, and at the end of 1986 it was about 82S.
Project Spin-off
7.2       The main spin-off from the project for the manufacturing sector was
the support it gave to the telephone cable industry in the country. $8.0
million of cables/accessories were procured from the local industry.
Least Cost Solution
7.3       The original project design was based on engineering studies
designed to determine the least cost means for improving service to existing
subsectors, and meting new demand in priority areas. However, technical
adjustments and type of equipment use (e.g. microwave used instead of coaxial
cables and digital electronic exchanges instead of electrochemical exchanges)
had to be made in the project's design.
Rate of Return
7.4       The actual internal financial rate of return for the 1977-1985
investment program was estimated at 201 (Annex 8). This rate of return is
higher than the appraisal estimate of 161. The economic rate of return should
be higher since it would also include:
(a) incremental revenues beyond 1985 due to utilization of spare
capacity made possible under the project;
(b) indirect external benefits to other sectors such as transport,
agriculture, public servicess etc., from improved and expanded
telecommunications; and
(c) consumer surplus, given the long waiting list.

VIII.  BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall and Specific Performance
8.1       The overall Bank performance on this project was adequate.  The Bank
dealt firmly by suspending disbursement when it was not possible to supervise
the project due to unrest in the country. The Bank processed bid documents
promptly. When project revision was necessary and justified (see para. 3.2),
the Bank reacted positively and agreed to the relocation of some installations
and to the reallocation of loan proceeds.
Supervision
8.2       Because of disturbances in the country, travel to El Salvador was
restricted during the project implementation period. Thus the Bank's
supervisory efforts were inadequate. The schedule of supervision shows that
there were not sufficient visits. Although the loan was not closed until
December 31, 1984, there were no supervision missions after December 1983.
The last full supervision by both a technical and non-technical staff was in
September 1982. Due to the difficulty in supervising the project, the Bank
suspended disbursement starting January 31, 1981 for around a six month
period.
IX. CONCLUSION
9.1       The project essentially met its physical objectives.  The project
did contribute to the development of the telecommunications system in El
Salvador. ANTEL has attained greater maturity as a well-organized entity
capable of planning, implementing, and operating the national
telecommunication system of El Salvador. ANTEL has also maintained a healthy
financial position. ANTEL's achievement is all the more commendable
considering the constraints due to adverse extraneous circumstances.
9.2       During the implementation of the project, two major lessons have
been learned by the Bank, and which need to be addressed in the desi&n of
future projects.
(a) lack of continuity in ANTEL's top management was an important
problem. Continuity in top management would have resulted in a
faster and more efficient project implementation. Increased
autonomy from Government would have helped to achive
(b)  future operations should ensure thet the procurement procedures
start as early as possible by agreeing on bidding documents and on a
procurement schedule at negotiations.

1.        An analysis on the capital and recurrent cost streams of the project
and on the benetits to be derived reestimated for the Pioject Completion
Report (PCR) was performed.
2.        All cost and benefit streams have been expressed in 1980 prices.
Reestimated streams have been deflated using inflation rates actually recorded
in El Salvador.
3.        Actual capital cost streams are based on the programs as actually
implemented 1979-35 and are taken from funds flow statements.
4.        Incremental revenues and operating costs net of depreciation and
interest attributed to the program are based on actual financial results. As
of 1985, incremental revenues and costs are assumed to remain constant in real
terms.
5.        A summary of the program's cost and benefit streams at 1980 price
levels follow.
