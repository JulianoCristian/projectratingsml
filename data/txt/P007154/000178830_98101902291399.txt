INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL DE TELECOMUNICACIONES
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR
FOR A THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for the equivalent of US$23.0 million to Administracion Nacional de Telecomu-
nicaciones (ANTEL) with the guarantee of the Republic of El Salvador to help
finance a Third Telecommunications Project. The loan would have a term of
20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Memorandum on El Salvador" (1313-ES) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on January 24, 1977. The main findings
of this report, as supplemented by information subsequently obtained by Bank
staff, are summarized below. Country data are contained in Annex I.
Economic Growth and Prospects
3.        El Salvador is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere,
with estimated per capita income of US$490 in 1976. It has the smallest land
area of the five countries in the Central American Common Market (CACM) area,
but with over 4 million inhabitants, it has the second largest population in
the area, the highest population density (195 per square kilometer), and only
3 hectares of arable land per capita. These density ratios are comparable to
those of the Caribbean Islands and India. Not only must El Salvador increase
agricultural productivity rapidly--since it has no land frontier--it must at
the same time expand its manufactured exports at a rapid rate if it is to
continue to grow satisfactorily over the longer term.
4.        The nation's population has grown at a very fast pace.  Between 1961
and 1971, the growth rate was 3.5 percent per annum, a result both of rapid
natural growth (3.1 percent per annum) and of repatriation of Salvadorians
living in Honduras.  The Government is carrying out a family planning program
with the support of the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), the
United Nations Family Planning Agency and the Planned Parenthood Federation.
The program is focusing on rural areas where the birth rate remains high and
family planning motivation is low. By mid-1977, an estimated 20 percent of
the fertile female population was being reached by public and private family
planning programs, and this figure is expected to increase to 26 percent by
the end of the decade.
5.        El Salvador's poverty is evident from a variety of indicators.
Nutritional standards are among the lowest in Latin America. Calorie and
protein deficiencies are common, particularly among pre-school children.
Roughly 68 percent of the dwellings are without piped water and 55 percent
without access to electricity. The illiteracy rate is high. Income is highly



-2-
concentrated and unemployment is substantial. Living conditions and incomes
in rural areas, which account for about 60 percent of the population, are
considerably worse than in the cities. Although the Government made some
efforts to change the structure of land ownership, the pattern of rural land-
holding remains very skewed. As a result of urban-rural differentials,
migration of the rural population to the cities is substantial. The urban
income distribution, however, is also skewed and living conditions in the
cities are difficult for people in the lowest income brackets. About three-
quarters of the population of metropolitan San Salvador resides in makeshift
squatter settlements. Minimum industrial wages are low; furthermore, workers
employed in small factories or self-employed in informal work shops have
incomes which are often below the minimum wage. Small informal business
activities have created employment at essentially subsistence levels for
almost one-half of the total urban labor force. The Government recognizes
these urban problems and is making efforts to remedy them (see paragraph
12).
6.        While the Salvadorian economy still depends heavily on agriculture,
which contributes about 25 percent of GDP, the relatively fast growing indus-
trial sector now accounts for 23 percent of GDP. Agriculture, however,
continues to employ nearly 55 percent of the labor force, compared with only
about 15 percent employed in industry. An ongoing Government program of
agricultural development, which gives emphasis to the promotion of basic
grains through the provision of credit, technical assistance and support
prices, has already had a strong positive impact on production. This program
is expected to continue in the future and, partly as a result, the agricultural
sector is expected to grow at about 4.5 percent per year in the medium term.
7.        During the first half of the 1970's, El Salvador's GDP grew in real
terms at an average rate of 5 percent per year -- about 2 percent on a per
capita basis. Growth during the period compared favorably with the 4.5
percent annual growth of the second half of the 1960's, although it fell
considerably behind the 7 percent annual growth of the first half of the
1960's, when the development of the CACM gave impetus to industrial pro-
duction. The growth rate is estimated at 4.7 percent and 6.2 percent for 1976
and 1977 as a result mainly of the unusually favorable price of coffee which
stimulated domestic demand and output.
8.        With a further improvement of the world economy, and with the
Government export-promotion policies described below, real exports of manufac-
tures are expected to grow by 9-10 percent annually in the coming years
compared with 6 percent during 1970-75. This should have a strong impact on
the growth of the manufacturing sector. The overall GDP is expected to
continue to grow in real terms at about 5-6 percent annually, at: least until
the mid-1980s. This growth could be attained more easily if the mediation
process now underway between the Governments of Honduras and El Salvador
results in a normalization of relations between the two countries. Should
this happen, it would facilitate a full restoration of the CACM arrange-
ments which were partially disrupted by Honduras' withdrawal in 1970.



-3-
The Public Sector and Development Policy
9.        The role of the Government in the economy traditionally has been
supportive rather than a leading one. Public revenues and expenditures have
been maintained at relatively low levels and, consequently, the growth of
public services such as health, education and agricultural extension has been
slow. However, under the 1973-77 Development Plan, some progress was achieved
in this area. Thus, the share of Central Government revenues in GDP increased
from an average 11.1 percent in 1970-72 to 13.1 percent in 1973-76, while
the share of public savings and investment in GDP increased from 3.3 to 4.4
percent and from 3.2 to 6.4 percent, respectively. The improvement in revenue
performance has been mainly the result of better tax administration, which
helped to quintuple the number of individual taxpayers within a three-year
period and, in 1976, of the progressive tax levied on coffee exports which had
reached exceptionally high prices. Further modifications of the basic tax
system, which has remained virtually unchanged for many years, could provide
additional income and thus make possible a stronger development effort.
10.       The Salvadorian Government is also giving increased attention to the
rural sector, intended to be the first stage of a broader long-term plan of
"national transformation" designed to attack the serious unemployment problem.
Effective unemployment (including underemployment) in El Salvador is estimated
to be at least 30 percent of the labor force. By embarking upon a program to
change the structure of production of the agricultural sector, the Government
could bring about an increase in rural incomes and a reduction of seasonal
unemployment. This, in turn, might lead to a slowdown of migration to urban
centers, improvement in nutritional standards, and the creation of an expanded
domestic market for industrial products. As a first step in its rural develop-
ment plan, the Government in May 1975 secured passage in the Congress of
El Salvador's first comprehensive land reform law. This law provides a frame-
work for the Government to expropriate land (with deferred payments) for
redistribution to small farmers in agrarian reform projects developed by a new
Institute of Agrarian Transformation (ISTA). Government efforts to go forward
with a major land reform project in 1976, however, were unsuccessful because
of strong resistance from larger farmers. The new administration that took
office in July 1977 secured passage last December of an amendment to the land
reform law which reflects the intention to redirect the focus of the program.
This amendment eliminates the requirement that land to be redistributed be
limited to ISTA project areas, but it authorizes ISTA to acquire land outside
such areas by purchase only. It is too early to assess the impact of the
amendment.
11.       The Salvadorian authorities recognize that with the country's limited
arable land and high population density, the development of the rural sector,
while important, could not suffice either to maintain a satisfactory rate of
economic growth or to provide employment for the quickly expanding labor
force. The Government has therefore embarked upon a broad program for the
promotion of industrial exports to countries outside the CACM area. An Export
Development Law which offers generous incentives to export industry, was
passed in 1974. Furthermore, the Government is developing free trade zones
for the production of industrial goods exclusively for export. The first of
these free zones, located in the outskirts of San Salvador, is well advanced



- 4 -
with a number of plants already in operation -- many of them foreign
industries with labor-intensive assembling processes. The existence of a
strong and growing entrepreneurial class in the country should contribute
to the success of the export promotion program. However, the program also
requires considerable investment in supporting economic and social infra-
structure in fields such as power, communications, water supply, education and
housing. Shortages in any of these fields, especially those affecting human
resources, would seriously hamper the competitiveness of the Salvadorian
industrial sector and could have a lasting detrimental effect on the future
development of the country.
12.       To improve living conditions in the urban areas, the Government has
provided 13,062 housing units for low- and medium-income households during
1973-75, through the existing Government housing agencies, and supplied physical
inputs for community development projects through the Government's community
development agency. A private organization, Fundacion Salvadorena de Desarrollo
y Vivienda Minima (FSDVM), in the last few years has become a major provider
of low-cost housing and community development in cooperation with Government
agencies and with financial support from the Bank Group. By mid-1977, FSDVM
had planned, designed and assisted in the construction of over 4,000 serviced
sites. Further Government efforts are under way to improve housing conditions
and incomes in San Salvador and several major cities by financing the construc-
tion of over 60,000 urban housing units during 1978-82 by providing access
to land, basic services, infrastructure, and housing credit to over 10,000 of
the lowest income families, by making available credit and training programs
for informal industrial expansion, and by providing industrial training for
5,600 skilled and semi-skilled workers a year in the urban areas.
Balance of Payments and External Debt
13.       The small size and limited natural resources of El Salvador make it
highly dependent on foreign trade. Following the 1969 conflici: with Honduras,
all exports to that country, which accounted for over 10 percent of the
country's merchandise exports, were suspended. Moreover, the closing of the
border with Honduras resulted in a considerable increase in transport costs of
goods traded with other Central American countries. By 1972, Ell Salvador had
regained its market share in the CACM, offsetting the loss of the Honduran
market by increasing its exports to Guatemala. In the following years, how-
ever, the world recession adversely affected El Salvador's manufacturing
exports to both the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) and CACM countries. Fortunately, increased world prices for the
principal export commodities -- coffee and cotton -- and the substantial
increase in their export volume helped to soften the effect of the decline
in manufacturing exports.
14.       While coffee and cotton remain the most important commodities,
El Salvador's exports the 1970s are much more diversified than a decade
earlier. During 1959-61, nearly 80 percent of export earnings were derived
from the two traditional products; almost 65 percent came from coffee alone.
By 1974-76 these figures had dropped to about 52 percent and 41 percent
respectively, while the contribution of manufactured products had increased
from 13 percent to about 30 percent of export earnings.



15.       Following seven years of either positive or slightly negative
balances in the current account of the balance of payments, unusually high
deficits occurred in 1974 and 1975 -- 8.8 and 5.8 percent of GDP, respective-
ly--as a consequence of the oil crisis. Subsequently and because of the
sharp increase in coffee prices, which boosted El Salvador's export earnings,
the balance of payments returned to its earlier healthy situation. In 1976
and 1977, the current account was in virtual equilibrium and foreign exchange
reserves increased.
16.       Coffee prices, while declining, are expected to be still relatively
high in the next year or two, while manufactured exports and tourism receipts
are expected to grow more rapidly than in the recent past. Nevertheless,
high prices of crude oil and oil-based products (fertilizers and others) will
continue to be a serious burden on the country's foreign exchange earnings --
the share of petroleum, oil and lubricants alone in imports increased frum
2.2 percent in 1970 to about 7 percent in 1976. In the medium term, the real
price of coffee is expected to decline considerably. Therefore, in order to
strengthen the balance of payments in the future, substantial effort to
diversify and expand exports will be required.
17.       As of the end of 1976, the country's external public debt outstanding
and disbursed repayable in foreign currency amounted to US$272.3 million, or
12.5 percent of GDP. The public debt service ratio is estimated to have
declined sharply from 9.2 percent in 1975 to 4.2 percent in 1976, partly
because the 1975 figure reflected heavy prepayment of commercial loans but also
because of high proceeds from coffee exports in 1976. This temporarily
advantageous situation is bound to change and, even if a major portion of
future external borrowing is obtained on soft terms, the public debt service
ratio is expected to increase somewhat--to about 6 percent in the mid-1980s.
External Assistance
18.       The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has been an increasingly
important lender to El Salvador for such sectors as power, water and sewerage,
and agricultural credit. While IDB lending was largely repayable in local
currency through 1972, the bulk of its loans in recent years is repayable in
foreign currency. The Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) has
focused on industry and infrastructure projects with a regional impact, while
the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) has assisted in the fields
of agriculture, health, basic education, housing and industry. The activities
of the major lenders during the 1950-77 period are summarized in the following
table:

19.       The balance of payments and growth projections call for an
acceleration in El Salvador's total borrowing from major multi:Lateral and
bilateral lenders. While El Salvador has traditionally maintained a low
debt-service ratio, the country's widespread poverty, the serious imbalance
between natural resources and population as well as the uncertain long-term
prospects of its main exports and the strong dependence of its industrial
sector on imported inputs limit the country's capacity to borrow abroad on
conventional terms. Under these circumstances, if domestic savings--which
at about 18 percent of GDY are relatively high for a country of this income
level--are to be complemented by a reasonable proportion of external capital
at the same time as social projects with a low foreign expenditure component
are undertaken, external assistance in excess of the foreign exchange component
of individual development projects is called for.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
20.       El Salvador has to date received seventeen Bank loans and four IDA
credits totalling US$185.2 million. The last operation involving a Bank loan
of US$6.7 million and an IDA credit of US$6.0 million for a second urban
development project was signed on July 28, 1977. Annex 11 contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1978,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
21.       At the end of 1976, the Bank Group held 24.6 percent of the
US$272.3 million external public debt outstanding and disbursed repayable in
foreign currency. This share is likely to remain substantially the same
over the remainder of the decade. The Bank Group's share of total public
debt service in 1976 was 13.8 percent, and, because of the relatively softer



-7-
terms provided by the other major external lending agencies, is projected to
reach about 17 percent by 1980.
22.       In the past, the Bank Group assisted El Salvador in the uevelopment
of its infrastructure through projects in highways, power and telecommuni-
cations. Together with IDB and CABEI, the Bank assisted the development of
El Salvador's arterial highway system. A close relationship has evolved
between the Bank and El Salvador's public power agency, Comision Ejecutiva
del Rio Lempa (GEL), since its establishment, enabling the Bank to contribute
significantly to the institution building efforts of GEL's management.
Similarly, the Bank's efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity of the
national telecommunications agency (ANTEL) have helped improve its organization
and expand its operations.
23.       Bank Group lending for the social sectors has been much less than
that of IDB and AID, principally because of the Salvadorians' preference for
the softer lending terms offered by these agencies. Nevertheless, the Bank
Group has begun developing an important role in the social sectors with the
result that three of the last four loans have been for education and serviced
sites. Also, negotiations have been substantially completed on a proposed
loan for industrial and agricultural training which we expect to present for
the Executive Directors' consideration in a few weeks. Other projects
currently under consideration for Bank loans include primary and secondary
eduzation, squatter upgrading, small business credit, and urban sanitation.
These projects would help El Salvador meet the educational needs of its
rural population and develop a broad program of urban improvement addressed
primarily to the lowest income groups. In addition, the Bank Group would help
in meeting the growing requirements in power and in the further strengthening
of the public power agency. The Government has so far met its requirements
for external finance for agriculture and rural development largely through
loans from IDB and AID. The possibility of Bank assistance to these sectors
is being examined in the light of a recently completed FAO/CP agricultural
and rural development survey of El Salvador, which has identified a project
for small-farm credit. It is not yet clear, however, that this project
will require external financing in addition to what IDB is planning to make
available to the credit institution involved.
24.       IFC has made two investments in El Salvador.  The first, a US$140,000
loan made in 1959 to Industrias Textiles, S.A., has been fully repaid. The
second, a US$233,000 equity investment and US$600,000 loan to Hoteles de
Centroamerica, S.A., in 1969, was for a hotel project that was completed in
1972. IFC is exploring possibilities of additional investments to encourage
private enterprise in El Salvador.

25.       The telephone density in El Salvador, 1.39 per 100 persons, is one of
the lowest in Latin America 1/ and lower than a number of countries in other
1/   Telephone density in Panama is 8.52; Costa Rica, 5.61; Mexico, 4.76; and
Colombia, 5.45.



- 8 -
parts of the world with per capita incomes similar or lower than El Salvador's
(e.g., Tunisia--2.03, Zambia--1.45, and Syria--2.14). Existing telephone
service is concentrated in the area of San Salvador, the country's major
center of economic activity, although even there telephone density is only
5.40 per 100 people compared to 16.1 in San Jose, Costa Rica, 13.0 in Mexico
City, 10.6 in Bogota and 8.9 in Santo Domingo. Telephone density for the rest
of the country is approximately 0.41 per 100 people. Of the 201 "cantons" 1/
with populations over 2,000, only 9 have access to telephone service and of
the remaining 1,821 cantons, only 8 have access to service. As evidenced by
these figures, development of telecommunications in El Salvador has lagged
behind the rapidly growing needs of industry and commerce, sect:ors which play
an important role in the country's economic growth and are expected to become
even more important in the future (paragraph 11). The rapidly increasing
demand for telephones in industry and commerce is, to some extent, a result of
the proliferation of small business concerns (with less than five employees)
which are now estimated to employ nearly 40 percent of the non--agricultural
labor force. Many of these are essentially household operations, and the
availability of telephones is important for improving communications and thus
the output and efficiency of these enterprises.
26.       With regard to the actual usage of telephones, traffic generated by
telephones assigned to business and professional tariff classes accounts for
about 60 percent of all usage. However, this figure understates business
related usage because a significant number of telephones which are categorized
as residential are used for business purposes. The pattern of national long
distance telephone traffic generally reflects the dominance of San Salvador in
the country's economy. In some small communities, 70 percent of all long
distance calls are directed to San Salvador. In larger towns t:he proportion
varies between 35 and 45 percent.
27.       In spite of improvement in the last decade, lack of timely investment
and proper planning in the past has resulted not only in a large unsatisfied
demand for telephone service but also in significant congestion in some
exchange areas and some long distance networks. Test checks made for the
first five months of 1977 showed that while the local service in San Salvador
is reasonably satisfactory, the long distance service during peak hours is
congested. Similar checks made for the three next largest towrns revealed
local and long distance congestion during peak hours. Waiting times for long
distance services in public call offices in several towns outside of San
Salvador are about one to two hours.  Where such towns are served by manual
exchanges, the waiting time can be even longer. In addition, existing local
service in manual exchange areas is unsatisfactory since the services provided,
largely on open wires, are prone to faults, and numerous areas share a single
long distance line.
28.       With regard to international telecommunications service, El Salvador
is a member of the Central American telecommunications network and has good
service to countries in Central America, the United States and Europe.
International direct dialing services are available to the Central American
countries, to the United States and to several countries in Europe.

Sector Organization
29.       In 1963, the Government, with Bank advice and financial support,
reorganized the telecommunications sector and placed it under the new auto-
mous agency, the Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL),
which is responsible for all telecommunications in the country.
30.       ANTEL is administered by a 5-member Board of Directors, each with a
tenure of 4 years. The President of the Republic appoints ANTEL's President
who also furictions as the Chairman of the Board. The remaining four directors
are appointed respectively by the Minister of Economy, the Minister of the
Interior, the Banking sector, and the Industrial and Commercial associations.
ANTEL's day-to-day business is administered by the President and by a General
Manager.
31.       As of December 31, 1976, ANTEL had a total of about 3,500 employee3
of which about 1,300 and 2,200 were involved in telegraph and telephone
operations respectively. With ANTEL operating about 66,000 telephones,
the employee ratio was about 33 employees per thousand telephones, which is
considered reasonable. With the expected improved productivity at the end of
the proposed project, the employee ratio should decrease to 28 employees per
thousand telephones.
32.       ANTEL's major institutional problems have been the lack of continous
planning activities and shortage of technical staff. Acting with Bank advice,
ANTEL retained technical consultants for planning and ANTEL has now consider-
ably strengthened its planning organization. ANTEL has recruited technical
personnel, has set up a local training center for low and medium level tech-
nicians and has recruited and sent several engineers abroad for specialized
telecommunications training.
33.       In spite of these improvements, ANTEL has yet to develop fully
in-house capabilities for planning and expansion of telecommunications
facilities, to identify projects for a balanced development, to improve
service quality, to set up reliable data collection systems and to improve and
refine demand forecasting methods. Also, ANTEL needs to introduce further
improvements in its financial management and accounting procedures.
Sector Development and the Bank's Involvement
34.       The Bank has been closely involved in the development of the
telecommunications sector in El Salvador through two projects. In 1963,
long-distance service consisted of only a few unreliable manually operated
radio circuits between the main urban areas in the country. The local ex-
change network at the time comprised a total of 16,000 lines of exchange
equipment (7,000 of which were automatic), with about 14,000 connections.
35.       Under the first Bank loan (Loan 358-ES of US$9.5 million equivalent),
signed in October 1963, the Bank assisted ANTEL in financing the installation
of automatic exchange equipment for 26,000 telephone lines, cables, line
networks and long-distance facilities for inter-urban connections. While this
project, which was successfully completed in 1968, helped overcome major



- 10 -
deficiencies of the sector at that time, the rapidly growing needs of industry
and commerce soon overtook the capacity of the telecommunications sector. By
1972, serious capacity deficiencies had become obvious in the local telephone
exchanges and in the long-distance network.
36.       Under the second Bank loan (Loan 811-ES of US$9.5 million equivalent),
signed in April 1972, the Bank assisted ANTEL in overcoming some of these
problems.  The Second Project was designed to:  (a) increase local automatic
exchange line capacity by about 45 percent and increase the traffic handling
capacity to satisfy the backlog of applications for telephone service in
metropolitan San Salvador and to meet part of the new demand for telephones;
(b) provide a 150 percent increase in the long-distance circuits to remove
congestion and meet growth in demand; and (c) provide technical assistance to
ANTEL.
37.       In 1975, in order to accelerate achievement of the objectives
of the Second Project, ANTEL initiated a drive to increase the rate of
telephone connections within the country. In that year about 6,200 additional
connections were completed, compared with about 3,600 during 1974, and in
1976, about 7,500 additional connections were made. All project works under
the second project have now been completed, and are beginning to be placed
in service. Due to initial delays in procurement of equipment, however,
project execution took two years longer than projected at the time of
appraisal.
38.       As a result of ANTEL's Bank-supported efforts, at the end of 1976
local telephone service had increased to 68,300 lines of exchange equipment
with about 54,700 mostly automatic connection, an increase since 1963 of
nearly 300 percent in connected subscribers. Additionally, El Salvador's
long-distance network was expanded to 1,600 circuits with automatic long-
distance dialing between all automatic exchange areas. Nevertheless, as
discussed above, service still lags well behind demand, is becoming in-
creasingly congested, and while existing service is heavily concentrated in
San Salvador, even there waiting time for telephone applicants can range
up to three years depending on the exchange area.
Future Expansion
39.       In May 1976, on advice of the Bank, ANTEL retained the services of
consultants for the preparation of a short-term (1977-82) and a long-term
(1978-1997) telecommunications development plan. ANTEL, after completing the
review of the consultants' recommendations for the short-term p:Lan, prepared
the 1977-82 telecommunications development program, which is estimated to
cost about US$75.7 million equivalent. Pursuant to this prograra, the telephone
density in El Salvador is expected to increase to 2.22 telephones per 100
persons by 1982, still low by Latin American standards, but a substantial
improvement over the present situation. In San Salvador the telephone density
is expected to increase by 35 percent over the 1977-1982 period, while in
areas outside San Salvador the telephone density is expected to increase by
78 percent over the same period.
40.       In the long term--over the next ten to fifteen years--and in addition
to steadily improving the quality of the service, ANTEL plans to extend local
services particularly to rural areas in the country and to low-income urban



- 11 -
areas - both of which are currently poorly served. The proposed project
would be the first major step in the progressive extension of services to
these areas. In order, inter alia, to develop adequate in-house capability for
continuous planning, ANTEL is utilizing the services of the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) to assist ANTEL in strengthening its planning
group and in other areas as required.
41.       A summary of requirements and sources of funds for ANTEL's 1977-82
development program is as follows:

Total Net Sources                            85.9           100
As shown in the above table, ANTEL's internal cash generation (net of debt
service) and the proposed Bank loan are expected to contribute 65 percent and
27 percent, respectively, of the total program requirements for capital
expenditure. The CABEI financing of US$5.1 million has already been secured.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
42.       A report entitled "El Salvador, Administracion Nacional de Teleco-
municaciones (ANTEL), Third Telecommunications Project," No. 1763-ES, dated
March 3, 1978, is being distributed separately. Project preparation
was completed by ANTEL, assisted by foreign consultants, in April 1977. The
project was appraised in June and July 1977. Negotiations were held in
Washington from February 21 to February 24, 1978. The principal repre-
sentative for the Government was the Minister of Planning, and for ANTEL, its
president.



- 12 -
43.       The Bank's role in the Third Project would be to assist ANTEL to:
(a) significantly-develop local networks in San Salvador and secondary cities
to meet part of the unsatisfied demand for local connections (including the
provision of telephone service to low-income urban areas through public call
boxes); (b) upgrade and expand the internal long distance network; (c) expand
telephone service to rural communities now without facilities; (d) improve the
quality of service; (e) improve financial management and practices (discussed
in paragraphs 49 through 53 below) which, together with the planning improve-
ments to be carried out with assistance from ITU experts, should help ANTEL
largely to overcome its principal remaining institutional deficiencies; and,
(f) obtain cost savings through utilization of international competitive
bidding.
Project Description
44.       The project consists of:
(a) installation of about 41,000 additional lines of local
automatic telephone exchange equipment;
(b) expansion of the local cable network and subscriber facilities
to provide about 36,000 additional individual connections and
about 320 additional public call boxes (the latter to be installed
in low-income urban areas);
(c) installation of two long-distance automatic exchanges with
about 2,200 terminations;
(d) installation of long-distance equipment on various routes
to provide about 2,400 additional circuits;
(e) expansion of the telegraph network by 300 channels;
(f) installation of 600 teleprinters at subscribers' premises; and,
(g) installation of about 200 long-distance public call offices
in municipalities and rural areas with populations of 2,000
or more, currently without service.
45.       Approximately one-half of the public call boxes to be provided in
low-income urban areas would be installed in sites being developed by the
Fundacion Salvadorena de Vivienda Minima (FSDVM) under the Bank Group-financed
first and second urban development projects (serving over 100,000 low-income
individuals located in urban areas throughout the country). The remainder
of the urban call boxes would be installed in other low-income areas (with
total population expected to be at least 100,000); the needs of some of these
areas are being evaluated by a UNDP-financed urban study, for which the Bank
is the executing agency. As ANTEL has recently acquired with its own funds a
stock of call boxes sufficient to meet project requirements for low-income
urban areas, these call boxes will not be financed with Bank funds as
originally contemplated; however, ANTEL has agreed to install the 320 call



- 13 -
boxes in all FSDVM sites as mentioned above and in other locations selected in
accordance with criteria which have been agreed with the Bank (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.01, Schedule 2, Part A(3) and Schedule 5). In the rural areas, all
communities with over 2,000 inhabitants will be provided with public call
boxes, thus providing telephone access to some 400,000 individuals presently
without service.
Project Cost and Financing
46.       The total project cost is estimated at the equivalent of US$51.6
million. The proposed Bank loan of US$23 million equivalent would cover about
45 percent of total project costs, and 64 percent of foreign exchange costs.
ANTEL will provide US$12.7 million of foreign costs, and all (US$15.9 million
equivalent) of the local currency costs.
47.       A detailed breakdown of project costs by source of financing is
shown in the following table:

Procurement and Disbursement
48.       All equipment to be obtained under the project with Bank financing
would be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. ANTEL would utilize its own funds to obtain:
(a) imported goods estimated to cost about $5.4 million comprising additions
to existing equipment obtained earlier by ANTEL with its own resources; and
(b) through international competitive bidding, other imported goods, such as
cables, teleprinters and telephones, estimated to cost about US$7.3 million.
All local cost items, which are to be financed with ANTEL's own funds, would
be procured through local competitive bidding procedures which are satisfactory
to the Bank. None of the goods to be financed by the Bank loan are currently
manufactured in El Salvador or the other Central American Common Market (CACM)
countries. ANTEL however expects that telephones, for which US$0.6 million of
Bank funds are expected to be utilized, are likely to be manufactured in
Costa Rica by the time bids are called, and has requested application of a
regional preference. It has been agreed therefore, in accordance with the
CACM Agreement on Fiscal Incentives for Industrial Development, that manu-
facturers from the CACM will be allowed a preference of 15 percent of the CIF
price, or 50 percent of the tariff payable by non-CACM manufacturers, which-
ever is lower.
49.       Disbursements would be for the CIF cost of imported equipment
and for foreign costs of installation. Any unused balance of the loan would
be used, with the concurrence of the Bank, to finance additional equipment
required for ANTEL's expansion program.
Project Execution
50.       ANTEL would implement the proposed project.  Its staff, with assis-
tance from ITU experts for switching equipment, would prepare engineering
designs and bid documents, evaluate bids and draw up equipment contracts.
ANTEL would lay all distribution cables and would supervise construction of
cable ducts by local contractors. The installation of all other equipment
would be carried out by ANTEL's technical staff, except in the case of new and
sophisticated types of switching equipment where ANTEL's staff would assist
contractors' staff. ANTEL would carry out acceptance testing of all installed
equipment. ANTEL's management is now sufficiently experienced and capable to
handle these works satisfactorily. The project is expected to be completed by
December 31, 1982.
Financial Performance
51.       ANTEL's past operating performance has been satisfactory both in
terms of rate of return and internal cash generation. At the end of 1976,
ANTEL had a cash balance of US$6.5 million equivalent, a debt/equity ratio
of 30/70, a current ratio of 2.5 and debt service coverage of 4.7. However,
some plant under construction was not promptly transferred on completion,
for accounting purposes, to plant in service, which resulted in reduced
depreciation and net plant in operation and an over-statement of the rate of
return in ANTEL's financial statements. Nevertheless, taking into account



-15 -
the adjustments necessary to correct those deficiencies, thie rate of return has
been well over the ten percent required under tbe second loan.  Aiso, ANTEL
has now begun co transfer completed works to plant in (operation on a systematic
and consistent basis and has agreed to follow consistently maintained appro-
priate accounting practices in the future (Loan Agreement, Section 5.01).
52.       During "he period between 1963 and 1973 Government agencies received
essentially free telephone service, since the service was treated as compen-
sation by ALTEL to the Government for the latter's relinquishment of its equity
share (as part of the process of confirming ANTEL s status as an autonomous
agency). By 1973 the Government had been fully paid, but some Government
agencies only very slowly accepted the obligation to make payments to ANTEL.
As a result, Government account receivables amounted to a total of US$1.0
million equivalent at the end of 1976, which is equivalent to about 16 months
of billings to the Government. In order to settle its overdue bills, the
Government has agreed to a partial payment of US$560,000 equivalent for past
due bills by September 30, 1978, to the settlement of the remaining balance
by June 30, 1979, and to assure that all public agencies make prompt payment
of future bills (Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02). ANTEL, on its part, is
installing a new computerized billing system which should expedite the billing
and collection process.
53.       Financial forecasts for 1977 through 1982 indicate a rate of return
on revalued assets in excess of ten percent, an operating ratio between 71 and
77 percent, a debt/equity ratio of 30/70 to 38/62 and a debt-service coverage
of not less than 3.3. All of these ratios would be satisfactory. ANTEL has
agreed to (a) make a study, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank,
to provide the basis for suitable revaluation of fixed assets and to submit
the study to the Bank for comment by July 31, 1980; (b) supply revalued values
of fixed assets with its financial statements as from December 31, 1980; and
(c) maintain a rate of return of at least 15 percent on the book value of net
assets through 1979 and thereafter a rate of return of at least 10 percent on
assets revalued in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (Loan Agreement,
Sections 4.04 and 5.04). Furthermore, ANTEL has agreed not to incur long-term
debt without prior Bank approval unless the preceding 12 months' internal cash
generation would cover maximum future debt service at least 1.5 times
(Loan Agreement, Section 5.05), and that investment, exceeding that included
in the 1978-1982 program by more than US$1.5 million in any one year, shall
be undertaken only after the Bank has been afforded a reasonable opportunity
to comment on such investment (Loan Agreement, Section 4.05).
Tariffs
54.       Under the Second Project ANTEL agreed to change its tariff structure
which provided excessive allowances for free calls and had other deficiencies
all of which contributed to traffic congestion and to distortions in traffic
patterns. After several studies and reviews, ANTEL is putting into effect as
of May 1, 1978, a revised tariff structure, which reduces the number of sub-
scriber categories, lowers the fixed monthly rentals (and therefore is more
accessible to lower income subscribers), and eliminates all free calls.
Subscribers now pay according to their actual telephone usage.



- 16 -
55.       The revised tariff structure, however, does not contain rates for
peak and off-peak periods on long distance calls. Considering the high usage
by business subscribers during peak hours causing congestion in the network,
ANTEL has agreed to study the feasibility of introducing such rate adjustments
in its tariff structure, to complete the study by December 1979, and to afford
the Bank an opportunity to comment on the results of the study (Loan Agreement,
Section 4.06).
Economic Justification and Risk
56.       In El Salvador, telephones and telex are primarily used as inter-
mediate inputs in the production of goods and services. The investment
program, by expanding system capacity, and upgrading the quality of local
and long distance telecommunications services, and increasing rural access
will (a) help reduce the number of subscribers waiting for telephones; (b)
reduce wastage of time caused by having to make repeated call attempts during
peak business hours; (c) reduce wastage of resources consumed by higher cost
means of communication; (d) reduce losses of production and marketing efficiency
resulting from lack of communications; and (e) facilitate improvement of
transport and delivery services. The project's potential for fostering rural
development is significant since the communities to be reached are small, dis-
persed and depend on the nearest market town for almost all their goods and
services, e.g. supply of inputs like fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, repair
services for pump sets, tractors, veterinary and other assistance and for
marketing produce. Such needs are generally met by public call telephones and,
eventually, by extension therefrom to some principal users. Furthermore, to
the extent that a more efficient and wider access to telephone service for
Government and business results in the substitution of telephonle communication
for face-to-face communication, it will slow the growth of transport costs,
energy costs, and vehicle traffic.
57.       There is a significant excess demand for telecommunications services
which the planned 1978-82 development program will be unable to eliminate. In
this situation, the least cost solution for the implementation of the program
depends on (a) having made the correct technical and economic decisions when
the networks were planned in the early 1960s, and the plans revised in 1977,
and (b) following the optimum path in the design, dimensioning and timing of
the many installations which comprise continuing system expansiLon. Given the
existing network, the dimensioning and timing of the works under the existing
program, of which the Bank project is an integral part, are based on engineer-
ing studies designed to determine the least cost means for improving service
to existing subscribers, and meeting new demand in priority areas.
58.       The internal rate of return, defined as the discounted rate which
equalizes the stream of expected revenues (in 1977 prices) attributable to
the program with capital and operating costs (at 1977 price levels) is 16
percent. This is, however, a significant understatement of total program
benefits since it is based only on the current observed willingness of
subscribers to pay ANTEL for telecommunications services. Thus, it does
not take into account the fact that some consumers in El Salvador have in



- 17 -
the past demonstrated that they are willing to pay significantly higher
prices for telecommunications services than they are currently being asked
to pay. The rate of return also is significantly understated because it does
not include an estimate of the value of time saved through a reduction in
the proportion of unsuccessful call attempts, and benefits obtained by
receivers of calls, by existing subscribers when new subscribers join the
system, and by those who benefit indirectly through the better administration
of regional development, health, transport, and agricultural programs, and
increased urban and regional business and government efficiency.
59.       The project is also justified on social and equity grounds as it
will provide telephone access for the first time to over 500,000 low-income
urban and rural dwellers. The installation of telephone service in the
communities benefitting from the first and second urban development projects
financed by the Bank Group would complement one of the objectives of these two
projects which is the provision of adequate community facilities as an integral
part of low-cost housing. The provision of telephones in these areas would
also complement the efforts being made under the projects to assist small-scale
businesses to increase their productivity.
60.       The project involves no special risks.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Administracion
Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL); the draft Guarantee Agreement between
the Republic of El Salvador and the Bank; and the report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft agreements conform to the normal pattern of loans for telecommunication
projects.
62.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
63.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Ln. 811   Second Telecommunications Project; US$9.5 Million Loan
of April 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 31, 1972;
Closing Date: September 30, 1978.
See discussion in paragraph 36 and 37 of this report.
Ln. 889   Sixth Power Project; US$27.3 Million Loan of April 27, 1973;
Effective Date: September 10, 1973; Closing Date: April 30, 1978.
The project has been largely completed, the principal unfinished
item being the effluent discharge canal to the Pacific, which is
about three years behind schedule. Project costs are now estimated
at US$158.7 million, 62.5 percent above the appraisal estimate, as a
result of worldwide inflation and additional costs for construction
of the geothermal effluent discharge canal arising mainly from the
poor performance of local construction contractors. CEL is borrowing
US$10.3 million from the Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV) to help it
meet the cost overruns of the first geothermal unit and the Cerron
Grande Project. Pending completion of the discharge canal to the
Pacific, output from the 30 MW geothermal plant at Ahuachapan has
been restricted so as not to exceed agreed upon limits of boron and
arsenic in the waters of the Paz River. A request for extension of
the Closing Date to permit disbursement of the remaining US$1.3
million is under consideration.
Ln. 1007  Second Education Project, US$17.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: October 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The project is about two-and-one-half years behind appraisal schedule.
Delays have been caused by frequent turnover and limited experience
of technical staff, shortage of construction materials, and lack of
interest in school construction bids on the part of registered
contractors, especially for school construction in rural areas.
Over one-half of all project buildings are either completed or under
construction; civil works bids are being reviewed for another one-
sixth of the project buildings, with the remainder in the planning
stage. Bids for supply of furniture and equipment for the first
three of eight phases of the project were evaluated and awarded.
The technical assistance program is proceeding satisfactorily. The
response of the rural communities in the regions of San Miguel and
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this context, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Morazan, where the nonformal ruiral training program is being im-
plemented, has been good. It is expected that the project will be
completed by June 1981.
Ln. 1050  Sites and Services Project; US$6.0 Million Credit and US$2.5 Million
Loan of November 4, 1974; Effective Date: February 3, 1975;
Closing Dates: March 31, 1981 (Credit) and May 31, 1981 (Loan).
Although only three years have elapsed since inception of the project,
civil works are complete in five of the eight sites. Units have
been built at costs which have permitted their sale at prices within
the reach of families with incomes of the target group. Total unit
development costs for each site, including price escalation allow-
ances, have been within 6 percent of the anticipated cost. The
implementing agency, Fundacion Salvadorena de Desarrollo y Vivienda
Minima (FSDVM), has increased its annual production capacity from
200 units in the early 1970s to about 1,500 units at present. The
completion of the community centers and markets (both the responsi-
bility of the Government's community development agency) has lagged;
however, an agreement has now been reached with the Government that
the facilities would be completed with additional assistance from
FSDVM. The two major problems encountered under the project (land
