WHEREAS the Guarantor, in consideration of the Bank's
entering into the Loan Agreement with the Borrower, has agreed
so to guarantee such obligations of the Borrower;
NOW THEREFORE the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
General Conditions; Definitions
Section 1.01. The parties to this Agreement accept all
the provisions of the General Conditions Applicable to Loan and
Guarantee Agreements of the Bank dated March 15, 1974, with
the same force and effect as if they were fully set forth herein
(said General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agree-
ments being hereinafter called the General Conditions).

context otherwise requires, the several terms defined in the

Section 2.01. Without limitation or restriction upon any
of its other obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, the

and not as surety merely, the due and punctual payment of the
principal of, and interest and other charges oa, the Loan, and the
premium, if any, on the prepayment of the Loan and the punctual
performance of all the other obligations of the Borrower, all

ARTICLE III
Other Covenants
Section 3.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek,
in normal circumstances, specific security from the member con-
cerned but to ensure that no other external debt shall have
priority over its loans in the allocation, realization or distri-
bution of foreign exchange held under the control or for the
benefit of such member. To that end, if any lien shall be created
on any public assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any
external debt, which will or might result in a priority for the
benefit of the creditor of such external debt in the allocation,
realization or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall,
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto, and at no cost
to the Bank, equally and ratably secure the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the Guarantor, in
creating or permitting the creation of such lien, shall make
express provision to that effect; provided, however, that, if for
any constitutional or other legal reason such provision cannot be
made with respect to any lien created on assets of any of its
politital or administrative subdivisions, the Guarantor shall
promptly and at no cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and
interest and other charges on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on
other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i)
any lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof,


﻿- 3 -
solely as security for payment of the purchase price of such
property; and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of
banking transactions and securing a debt maturing not more
than one year after its date.
(c) As used in this Section, the term "public assets"
means assets of the Guarantor, of any political or administrative
subdivision thereof and of any entity owned or controlled by,
or operating for the account or benefit of, the Guarantor or any
such subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange
assets held by any institution performing the functions of a
central bank or exchange stabilization fund, or similar functions,
for the Guarantor.

ber 31, 1977, in an amount of not less than
01,400,000;
(ii) cause the public agencies to cooperate with the
Borrower, in order to enable the Borrower to

bills overdue as of December 31, 1977, as well as
methods for the settlement of such balance;
(iii) pay, or cause each public agency to pay, by
June 30, 1979, any amount of the balance of bills

accordance with paragraph (a) (ii) above; and
(iv) take all such measures as shall be necessary
to ensure that, at all times, each public agency
shall pay, promptly when due, each bill other than
bills referred to in (i), (ii) or (iii) of this
paragraph (a).
(b) For purposes of this Section:
(i) the term "public agency" means a political or
administrative subdivision of the Guarantor, or an

subdivision;
(ii) the term "bill" shall mean, in respect of each
public agency, the amounts periodically billed by
the Borrower to each such agency for the provision
of telecommunication services by the Borrower to
each such agency; and
(iii) the balance of bills overdue as of December 31,
