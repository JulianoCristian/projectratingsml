APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      The Government of El Salvador has requested World Bank assistance
in financing the five-year 1978-82 telecommunications development program
prepared by the Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL). The
proposed Borrower and Beneficiary of the loan would be ANTEL.
1.02      The Bank has been continuously associated with the telecommunications
sector in El Salvador since 1963. In October 1963, the Bank approved a US$9.5
million loan (358-ES) to ANTEL to help finance a project designed to increase
local telephone exchange capacity and to provide stable long distance facili-
ties. The project was satisfactorily completed in December 1968. This
preceded the setting up of the project performance audit system. Following
discussions by three Bank missions in 1969 and 1970, ANTEL strengthened its
financial organization, negotiated settlements with suppliers for rescheduling
payments to them, prepared a program of expansion in 1970 and in 1971 revised
it. In April 1972 the Bank approved a US$9.5 million loan (811-ES) to finance
a project to extend local and long distance services and to improve technical
project preparation. The project has been completed on December 31, 1977--
two years behind schedule.
1.03      This report is based on information obtained from ANTEL and from
the findings of the mission composed of Messrs. M. DeLima, R. Saunders and
M. Sergo which visited El Salvador in June/July 1977.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
2.01      El Salvador with an area of 21,000 square kilometers, is the smallest
and most densely populated of the five Central American countries. Its popula-
tion totals some four million people or about 190 per square kilometer. San
Salvador is the administrative and commercial center and contains about 17
percent of the total population. The 1975 gross national product per capita
was estimated at US$450, although in rural areas where 60 percent of the popu-
lation lives, it is only US$200 per capita.
2.02      Future economic expansion basically depends on the country's capacity
to increase agricultural output and manufactured exports, which require in
addition to direct investments in those sectors, substantially higher public
fixed investment in social and economic infrastructure.
2.03      Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (ANTEL) is responsible
for all public services in the telecommunications sector. ANTEL, which is an
autonomous government-owned pub:Lic corporation permits private users to obtain
licenses from the government on an annual basis to operate point-to-point
telecommunications services only when ANTEL is unable to provide those services.
2.04      Conductores Electricos de Centro America (CONELCA), a private enter-
prise, manufactures electrical and telephone cables in San Salvador. CONELCA
is currently able to meet ANTEL's total cable needs and is also able to export
cables to other Central American countries.
Access to Service
2.05      El Salvador's telephone density of 1.39 per 100 population is lower
than most other neighboring countries (Panama - 8.52; Costa Rica - 5.61; Mexico -
4.76; Nicaragua - 1.00). Existing telephone service is concentrated in the
San Salvador area although even there telephone density is only 5.40 per 100
population (San Jose - 16.1; Mexico City - 13.0; Bogota - 10.6; Santo Domingo -
8.9). Telephone density for the rest of the country is approximately 0.41 per
100 population. As of April 1977 there were 52,063 paying subscribers in El
Salvador distributed geographically as follows:

Total                           52,063              100           100
2.06      For purposes of government administration, El Salvador is divided
t1ito 14 departments, consisting of 259 municipalities gnd 2,022 cantons. All
departments and all but three municipalities have some telephone access. Of
the 2,022 cantons, 865 have a population more than 1,000 and of these, 201
have population greater than 2,000. Only 17 cantons (including nine with
population over 2,000) currently have telephone access.
2.07      In order to acquire a telephone, a potential subscriber must register
on an official waiting list. Waiting times for telephone applicants in San
Salvador range up to three years depending on exchange area.
Telephone Service Usage
2.08      Telephone subscribers in El Salvador are categorized according to
three tariff classes (business, commercial and government; professionals--
doctors, lawyers, engineers; and residential), with business subscribers pay-
ing the highest monthly rental fees and residential subscribers paying the
lowest. This tariff-related classification scheme has led to a relatively
large number of telephones which are technically located in the residential
portion of premises, but which in fact are used primarily for business purposes.
The official distribution of subscribers according to tariff categories as of
April 1977 was as follows:
Distribution of Automatic
Exchange Subscribers

business   Percent   Total
and pro-    resi-    per-
fessional  dential   centage
San Salvador and nearby Pueblos                34        66         100

Rest of country                                40        60         100
Total                                          38        62         100
1/   Government subscribers are not broken down geographically.



-4-
2.09      With regard to the actual usage of telephones, traffic generated
by telephones assigned to the business and professional tariff classes
officially accounts for almost 60 percent of total pulses. This understates
business-related usage since calls originating in other telephones for
business and professions are not included in the above. In addition, the
impact of business-related usage on the system is, however, much larger, be-
cause not only are a significant number of telephones which are categorized
as residential used for business purposes a major proportion of the time, but
also, business and government calls originate during the mid-morning and mid-
afternoon traffic peaks, thereby exerting most of the pressure on system
capacity, and this largely determines system costs. With regard to inter-
national traffic, over 70 percent of all calls are generated by subscribers
officially categorized as business, government or professional.
z.10      The pattern of national long distance telephone traffic generally
reflects the dominance of San Salvador as the center of the national economy.
In some small communities, 70 percent of all long distance calls are directed
to San Salvador. In the largest towns the proportion varies between 35 per-
cent and 45 percent.
Quality of Telephone Service
2.11      Lack of timely investment and proper planning in the past have caused
the telephone network to exhibit a number of deficiencies which have led to
poor service. As a result, in addition to a large unsatisfied demand, there
is significant congestion in some exchange areas on long distance networks,
and in some small outlying exchanges, the long distance congestion leads also
to poor local service. Test checks made for the first five months of 1977
show that while during peak hours, the local service in San Salvador is
reasonably satisfactory, the long distance service is congested. Similar
checks made for the three next largest towns also reveal congestion. Waiting
times for long distance services at public call offices in several towns
outside of San Salvador are about one to two hours, and where such towns are
served by manual exchanges, the waiting time varies up to several hours. In
addition existing local service in those manual exchange areas is unsatis-
factory since (a) the service is provided largely on open wires prone to
faults, and (b) numerous areas share a single long distance line.
Institutional Deficiencies
2.12      The major problems for the expansion and improvement of the tele-
communications sector in El Salvador have been the lack of continuous planning
activities, shortage of technical staff, and insufficient investment. With
Bank assistance, ANTEL retained technical consultants fpr planning and ANTEL
has now considerably strengthened its planning organization. ANTEL has re-
cruited technical personnel, has set up a local training center for low and
medium level technicians and has recruited and sent several engineers to the
University of Michigan for specialized telecommunications training. ANTEL
has been developing the telecommunications sector without government support,
or significant local borrowing for capital expansion. Expansion has thus been



- 5 -
tied to ANTEL's capacity to generate funds from internal sources, or to
borrow externally.- For the period 1978-82, ANTEL's annual investment will
be about US$15 million.  ANTEL has planned to finance about 62 percent of
the program by internally generated funds. External borrowing will have
to cover the balance of the expansion program.
Sector Objectives
2.13      The Bank's participation through two projects, since January 1963,
has already enabled ANTEL to:
(a) establish a modern long distance network with associated
long distance exchanges to link together the principal
areas of the country, and to provide a nationwide high
quality subscriber dialing network covering nearly all
automatic exchanges in the country. In 1963, long distance
service, which is an essential requirement for government,
industry and commerce, consisted of only a few unreliable
radio circuits between the main towns in the country operated
on a manual basis and subject to considerable delays. In the
first project, reliable and high quality microwave radio
communication equipment was provided for the first time, and
additional microwave radio and multiplex equipment was
installed in the second project. At the end of 1976, El
Salvador had a reliable long distance network with a total
of 1,600 circuits, largely removing congestion. Addition-
ally subscribers automatic long distance dialing was intro-
duced between nearly all the automatic exchange areas;
(b) expand local telephone services in San Salvador and other
towns in the country. ANTEL's local exchange network in
1963 comprised a total of about 16,000 lines (7,000 of which
were automatic) of exchange equipment, with about 14,000
connections. At the end of 1976, ANTEL operated about
68,300 exchange lines with about 54,700 mostly automatic
connections--an increase of nearly 300 percent in connected
subscribers. Additionally, ANTEL improved the quality of
service, and reduced congestion which is now insignificant
except on some long distance network; and
(c) establish an institutional framework for development and
create a financial base for future expansion. In 1963,
ANTEL had few qualified staff, and undertook works on an
ad-hoc basis executed through turn-key contracts. ANTEL
had no technical and financial planning or control, and
the accounting routines were unsatisfactory. At the end
of 1976, ANTEL had improved considerably in these areas,
and the financial position has become sound. ANTEL is
now able to handle its expansion program smoothly and is
systematically making steady progress.
2.14      In the next 10 to 15 years, ANTEL would extend local services and
high quality long distance circuits using latest available techniques, and
would concentrate attention in providing basic telecommunication facilities



-6-
to rural areas in the country, which are currently poorly served. ANTEL's
management would have to carry heavier responsibilities, to function more
effectively and to manage efficiently a more complex network. ANTEL would
have to formulate projects and to review the need for telecommunication
facilities development on priorities designed to meet the requirements of
administration, social services and economic efficiency as well as expected
demand and traffic growth.
2.15      ANTEL proposes to accomplish the sector objectives under the
project by:
(a) significantly developing local networks in San Salvador, the
capital, and in small towns to meet part of the demand for
local connections, and opening of public call telephones to
meet needs of low income urban areas;
(b) improving the quality of service;
(c) upgrading and expanding the long distance network to handle
the additional traffic generated over the network (including
rural call offices);
(d) expanding access to telephone service in rural areas by
expansion of small exchanges, conversion of public call
offices to exchanges and opening of new public call
offices in communities now without telephone facilities.
This would constitute the first phase in the progressive
extension of services to rural areas in the country;
(e) institution building, particularly in the area of enhancing
ANTEL's planning capabilities; and
(f) improving management and accounting procedures.
2.16      Quantitatively, the number of public call offices in El Salvador
outside the capital San Salvador will increase from 158 to over 650. About
200 of the additional call offices would be installed in rural communities,
and would provide telephone access for the first time to about an additional
400,000 1/ people. In addition to this increase, about 320 call offices would
be installed to meet the needs of the low income urban areas. Subscribers
with individual connections will increase from 58,000 in 1978 to over 93,000
in 1982. Changes in selected parameters, reflecting expected changes in
telephone service are shown below:
1/   This is arrived at by multiplying the 200 new public call offices to
be opened in cantons now without service by the minimum population of
2,000 in the smallest of these cantons. Since the cantons are small
in geographic area, all the population can be expected to have access
to service.

The Bank's Role
2.17      The Bank's role in the two previous loans is outlined in paragraph
2.13.  The Bank's role in the third project would be to assist ANTEL to attain
the objectives set out in paragraph 2.15. While ANTEL has made considerable
progress in organization, planning and financial areas, ANTEL has yet to de-
velop in-house capabilities for planning and expansion of telecommunications
facilities, to identify projects for a balanced development, to improve service
quality, to set up reliable data collection systems and to improve and refine
demand forecasting methods. Additionally, ANTEL is making a major effort for
the first time to provide long distance facilities to rural areas. Finally,
ANTEL has to introduce further improvements in its management and accounting
procedures to enable it to efficiently manage the considerable additional
assets being created under this project. The Bank would assist in continuing
ANTEL's institution building by association in the financing of the project.

III. THE BORROWER
3.01      Created by Act 370 of August 27, 1963, ANTEL, the proposed
Borrower, is an autonomous Government-owned public corporation responsible
for all domestic and international telecommunications services in El
Salvador. ANTEL has the right to plan, acquire, construct and operate all
telecommunications facilities; to propose tariffs and other charges for
its services; and to introduce the tariffs after obtaining the approval of
the Ministry of Economy.
Organization
3.02      ANTEL is administered by a five-member Board of Directors, each
with a tenure of four years. The President of the Republic appoints ANTEL's
president who also functions as the president of that Board. The Minister
of Economy, and of Interior, each nominate one director; and operating banks,
and industrial and commercial associations in El Salvador, each nominate one
director. ANTEL's day-to-day business is managed by the president of the
Board, and by a general manager who also functions as the secretary of the
Board of Directors. An organization chart is set out at Annex 3.01. By
and large ANTEL's organizational set up is similar to that existing in similar
organizations in other countries, and is satisfactory.
3.03      Under Bank Loan 811-ES, ANTEL retained the services of TAI, Inc. of
USA as consultants to prepare short-term (1978-1982) and long-term (1978-1998)
telecommunications development plans for El Salvador. ANTEL also seconded
junior staff to work with, and to be trained by, the consultants. The short-
term plan has been completed, and ANTEL has prepared a project for Bank financ-
ing utilizing the consultants' report. The consultants have also prepared the
long-term plan in draft form but would finalize it after the consultants
obtain ANTEL's comments on the draft report.
3.04      During the last three years, ANTEL has steadily strengthened its
planning group which was set up at the time of an earlier appraisal. Though
the planning group consisting of the staff seconded to the consultants (see
para. 3.03) is now capable of handling much of the engineering planning work,
it needs to be further strengthened and made to function effectively in
several areas. ANTEL has, therefore, decided to utilize the services of
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) experts, currently working in
the region, to assist ANTEL in strengthening the planning group and offering
technical assistance as required. At the end of the project, ANTEL's plan-
ning group, after gaining additional experience with the assistance of ITU
experts, is expected to function effectively and independently.
3.05      ANTEL's senior engineering (other than planning) and financial
staff have now gained sufficient experience in project management, are well-
qualified, and are capable of managing the present operations as well as the
considerably expanded operations resulting from the installation of additional
assets during the project period.

Auditing
3.06      ANTEL's accounts are subject to both internal and external audits.
Internal audit is exercised by the Court of Accounts, a government insti-
tution, and external audit is done annually by independent commercial auditors.
These arrangements have in general functioned well. However, some changes in
the information sent to the Bank by the external auditors in addition to the
audit report would be desirable. These changes have been discussed with the
auditors, who have declared they have no problem in presenting the information
in the way the Bank requires. The auditing covenant for Loan 811-ES should be
continued under the new loan.
Accounting
3.07      The actual chart of accounts has become inadequate as it does not
permit a systematic adaptation to ANTEL's growing needs due to larger volume
of operations. Furthermore, it does not permit proper allocation of costs to
cost centers and services for tariff and profitability studies.
3.08      ANTEL plans to introduce a new accounting system as from end of 1978
and retained a local consulting firm, Prodasa, which will design the system
in cooperation with ITU consultants. The new system will provide more accurate
information on categories of costs and their distribution on cost centers and
services. The change of system has become feasible through the introduction
of new computer (IBM 370), which has the capacity to absorb the extra work
involved.
Insurance
3.09      ANTEL has an insurance coverage of 029.2 million against fire, strikes,
civil war, earthquakes, etc., with the Hanover Insurance Company, San Salvador.
The assets covered are buildings and equipment in the most important exchanges:
Central Roma, San Miguelito, Central Centro and the administrative building in
San Salvador. Even so, the amount insured is under replacement cost for these
larger exchanges and with reference to Section 4.03 in the Loan Agreement for
Loan 811-ES, ANTEL was asked to review insured values periodically. The
remaining centers are distributed widely over a large geographical area and
the maximum loss in one place is limited, so it can be accepted that ANTEL in
those cases acts as its own insurer.
Tariffs
3.10      ANTEL's present tariffs, with exception of the connection charges
which recently were raised from 1200 to 9400, have not been changed since 1964.
The monthly rentals and the monthly number of free calls for each category are:



- 10 -
Number of       Monthly Rental in ¢
Category                 Free Calls      Automatic   Manual
I.   Commercial and government         500              25         15
II.  Professionals - doctors,
lawyers, engineers                400              20        12
III. Residential                       300              15         10
Calls beyond the free allowance are charged at the rate of e0.05 per pulse.
While the level of tariffs is adequate, the tariff structure has several
deficiencies. Manual long distance rates, for example, are lower than the
automatic rate, although the operating cost of manual service is higher.
Furthermore, the high fixed monthly charge with an excessive number of free
calls has contributed to congestion in San Salvador and has disturbed traffic
patterns.
3.11      At the time of negotiations of Loan 811-ES, ANTEL agreed to change
the tariff structure. After several studies and reviews, ANTEL implemented a
revised tariff structure. In addition to the elimination of free calls the
former three subscribers' categories were reduced to two. Subscribers pay
according to their actual telephone usage. These changes are expected to raise
local revenues by about ten percent and eliminate some of the deficiencies in
the old tariff structure.
3.12      The revised tariff structure does not contain rates for peak and
off-peak periods on long distance calls. Considering the high usage by
business subscribers during peak hours causing congestion in the network,
ANTEL should study the feasibility of introducing such rates. During negoti-
ations, assurances were obtained that ANTEL will complete the study by
December 1979, and review the results of the study with the Bank.
Staff and Training
Staff
3.13      At the end of December 1976, ANTEL's staff totalled about 3,500 of
which about 2,200 were employed for telephone operations, and the balance were
used in telegraph and telex operations. ANTEL operated about 66,000 telephones,
and the employee ratio works out to 33 per thousand telephones. The staff
number is considered reasonable keeping in view that ANTEL operates (a) long
distance facilities in remote areas using an extensive open-wire system, and
(b) about 260 small capacity manual exchanges which require a minimum level of
staffing independent of the number of working subscribers on those boards.
During the project period, ANTEL expects to recruit 450 additional staff for
telephone operations, of which 30 would comprise engineers and 420 line and
switching maintenance technicians, operators and other support personnel. At



- 11 -
the end of the project when ANTEL would operate about 110,000 telephones, the
staff ratio would drop to 28 per thousand telephones, which is an improvement.
Annex 3.02 gives details of the number of employees in each department for the
years 1976 to 1982, the staff pay scales as of December 31, 1976, and service
conditions. The pay scales are generally attractive and the requisite quality
of staff can be recruited. Turnover of staff is reported tu be negligible.
Training
3.14      Line and switching maintenance personnel, operators, clerical and
semi-skilled staff are trained in San Salvador at a regional training center
(INCATEL) administered by ANTEL. That center was set up by ANTEL with ITU
assistance to meet the training needs of personnel in telecommunications
organizations in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
Senior engineers are trained at equipment suppliers' headquarters or factories,
and at various institutions in Europe and in Mexico. ANTEL has recently re-
cruited 12 people and sent them for five-year engineering training in various
telecommunications disciplines. Those people would return about the comple-
tion time of the project and would augment ANTEL's maintenance operation
capacity in all telecommunications branches. INCATEL has currently a capa-
city to train about 130 personnel per year. ANTEL has already proposed an
expansion of INCATEL's training facilities for completion by end 1978 after
which the training center would meet ANTEL's needs for trained personnel re-
quired to operate and maintain equipment installed under the project.
Existing Telecommunications Facilities
3.15      Comparison of the telephone density in El Salvador as of January 1,
1976, with Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico and Nicaragua may be seen in paragraph
2.05. Annex 3.03 sets out international telephone statistics. The existing
exchange and long distance network in El Salvador is shown in the Map. Basic
network data are set out in Annex 3.04. A brief description of ANTEL's
facilities as of December 31, 1976, is given below.
Local Services
3.16      ANTEL was responsible for 42 local automatic, and 259 (most of these
have less than ten lines each) manual exchanges largely in rural and semi-urban
areas, with a total capacity of 68,270 lines and 54,722 connected lines, of
which 98 percent were connected to automatic exchanges. The unfilled demand
was about 29,000. Annex 3.05 sets out data on exchange capacity and the
number of connected lines at the end of 1976.
Long Distance Services
3.17      Long distance services (see map) are provided by microwave radio,
coaxial cables, VHF radio, open-wire carrier systems, and open-wire physical
lines. Facilities for subscriber dialing of long distance calls are available
to nearly all subscribers on the automatic exchange network; for the others
long distance service is provided on a semi-automatic, or fully manual basis.



- 12 -
Telex and Telegraph Facilities
3.18      San Salvador is connected by telex and fixed point-to-point tele-
printer circuits to 15 traffic group centers, using voice frequency telegraphs
over microwave and carrier systems. About another 150 telegraph offices in the
country are connected by open-wire lines to these group centers. A telex
system with 400 lines capacity with 342 subscribers is installed in San Salvador.
International Facilities
3.19      El Salvador has good international telecommunications facilities to
countries in Central and South America, USA and Europe. El Salvador is
connected through a high capacity microwave system to provide a total of
196 stable high quality circuits to Guatemala, Tegucigalpa (Honduras), Managua
(Nicaragua) and San Jose (Costa Rica), with extension links to Mexico from
Guatemala, and to Panama from San Jose. For places in the USA, international
telephone traffic is routed direct via satellite circuits through an earth
station commissioned with 24 circuits in June 1977, and over the regional
network to Mexico and thence tFo Florida on microwave links. Traffic to
countries in South America is routed through the USA. Traffic to Europe is
transmitted through Spain on satellite circuits currently routed through
Nicaragua, but will be routed later through its own earth station when it is
fully operational with 168 circuits in 1978. International direct dialing
service is available to the Central American countries, to the USA and to
several countries in Europe. Toll ticketing equipment is installed at San
Salvador to record international calls.

IV.  DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
4.01      Given the large unsatisfied demand for telephones in urban areas,
the relative lack of telephone penetration into rural areas, and the inade-
quate quality (paragraph 2.11) of both local and long distance service, it
is impossible to accurately forecast the demand for telecommunications services
in El Salvador. Current and historic traffic totals, and the inadequately
maintained waiting lists, are of limited assistance since they provide little
indication of the rapidity with which the demand for telephone service will
grow as the quality of service improves, and access to service is broadened.
4.02      Nevertheless, ANTEL, with the assistance of consultants (TAI of the
US), has estimated that the demand for individual telephone connections through
1982 will increase as follows:
Connected    Unsatisfied   Total
Subscribers      Demand      Demand
1976:  San Salvador metropolitan area            43,800         22,700       66,500
Rest of country                           10,900          6,200       17,100
Total                               54,700          28,900      83,600
1978:  San Salvador metropolitan area            46,200         19,800       66,000
Rest of country                           11.400          7,500       18.900
Total                               57,600         27,300       84,900
1982:  San Salvador metropolitan area            70,200         12,300       82,500
Rest of country                           23,300          2.500       25,800
Total                               93,500          14,800     108,300
4.03      While the mission considers these estimates, which are based on the
old tariff structure to be reasonable, they may considerably underestimate
actual demand based on the new telephone tariffs which were approved in 1978.
The new tariff structure has lower monthly minimum charge for a telephone.
Thus, telephone service is cheaper for those who generate less than 180 to 320
traffic pulses per month (depending on subscriber classification). This lower
basic rate could stimulate some additional demand for telephone service.
4.04      ANTEL proposes to review the demand projections including the
requirements of public call offices in low income urban areas identified by
an urban study financed by UNDP in the course of the next two years. ANTEL's
current plan is to initiate during the project period advance works for
commissioning about 10,000 lines of additional equipment in the two years,
1983 and 1984, following the construction period of the project. This addi-
tional capacity will be augmented further if the above review of demand
forecasts points to such a need.

V. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
The Program
5.01      ANTEL has drawn up aL five-year (1978-82) telecommunications develop-
ment program which comprises t.he following main items:
(a) ongoing works comprising the installation of earth satellite
station phase 2, and routine minor works;
(b)  the project for Bank. financing (see paragraph 5.03); and
(c)  preinvestment for extension equipment of:
(1) central telex system;
(2) international telephone exchange; and
(3) local and long distance telephone networks.
The earth satellite station is expected to be installed by end 1978; and con-
tracts signed for the extension equipment by end 1980 for installation to be
completed progressively from the first semester of 1983 to the end of 1984.
5.02      The estimated cost of the program is about V189 million (US$75.7
million equivalent). Annual program costs from 1978 through 1982 are set out
at Annex 5.01.
The Project
5.03      The objectives of the project are outlined at paragraph 2.15.  The
project proposed for Bank financing is a self-contained part of ANTEL's
1978-82 program, provides for a balanced and integrated development of faci-
lities and would be carried out between 1978 and 1982. It comprises mainly
the installation of the following:
(a)  a total of about 41,000 local automatic exchange equipment
lines (about 24,500 lines would be installed in San Salvador)
with associated cables and subscribers plant and the con-
nection of about 36,000 additional subscribers; and about
320 public call offices -160 to be located in sites being
developed by Fundacion Salvadorena de Desarrollo y Vivienda
Minima (FSVM) under the Prior Urban Projects, and about 160
in communities.
(b)  two long distance automatic exchanges with a total of about
2,200 terminations;
(c)  about 250 km of coaxial cables on 11 routes with the associated
coaxial cable transmission equipment;



- 21 -
(d) microwave radio equipment on 12 routes; UHF radio equipment on
eight routes; and multiplex equipment to provide about 2,400
additional long distance circuits;
(e) 300 VF telegraph channels; and 600 teleprinters at sub-
scribers' premises;
(f) about 200 long distance public call offices to provide services
in municipalities, and in rural areas having more than 2,000
inhabitants, currently without any service; and
(g) buildings to house the equipment.
Project Cost
5.04      The total cost of the project is estimated at about 0129 million
(US$51.6 million equivalent) including a foreign exchange expenditure of
about US$35.7 million equivalent. The cost of the project shown in detail
in Annex 5.01 is summarized as follows:

/1   Represents costs of providing links from the communities to the long distance
network. Costs of additional facilities needed to handle this traffic within
the rest of the network are included under long distance facilities costs.
5.05      The project costs reflect estimated December 1976 prices based on
ANTEL's experience with contracts relating to ongoing works, and those recently
completed under Loan 811-ES, with adjustments to bring them up to date. The
project estimates are reasonable. ANTEL is exempt from payment of customs
duties on imported goods.
Contingencies
5.06      Price contingencies for project costs amount to 16% of total base
and physical costs. They result from the year-by-year estimated local cost
increases of: 1978 - 9%; 1979 - 9%; and 1980 through 1982 - 8% annually; and
year-by-year estimated foreign costs increases of: 1978 through 1979 - 7.5%
annually. The foreign cost increases are applied to the contract date since
all contracts in this sector are made on a fixed-price basis and are likely



- 23 -
to be signed by 1979. ANTEL proposes to purchase with its own funds equipment
from L. M. Ericsson at a total of US$5.4 million on the basis of Ericsson's
quoted fixed prices, hence no price contingency has been provided for this
purchase. The annual percentage cost increases assumed above are consistent
with Bank guidelines.
5.07      Except for variations in quantities which could occur in building
and civil works for which a physical contingency amounting to 5% of local
costs have been provided, no other physical contingencies are considered
necessary. Provision of local and long distance exchange lines, telephones,
microwave radio equipment and multiplex terminal channels proposed to be
procured and installed under the project are based on detailed forecasts of
equipment quantities and detailed engineering. In view of this, the proposed
quantities of equipment are not expected to change significantly, and accord-
ing to experience any unexpected increases of equipment on some routes are
compensated by corresponding unexpected decreases on other routes. In the
case of cable networks, the dispersion of these networks throughout the
country permits flexibility and adjustments, to make provision of physical
contingencies unnecessary.
Items for Bank Financing
5.08      Of the project's foreign cost of US$35.7 million, the Bank would
finance US$23 million and ANTEL's own resources would provide the balance of
US$12.7 million in foreign costs and all (US$15.9 million) local costs. The
items to be financed by the Bank are as follows:

Procurement
5.09      All goods to be obtained under the project for Bank financing would
be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. ANTEL proposes to obtain with its own funds (a) imported
goods estimated to cost about US$5.4 million (see para. 5.06) which comprise
additions to equipment earlier obtained by ANTEL with its own resources
through negotiations with the existing suppliers for standardization purposes,
and (b) other imported goods like cables, telephones and teleprinters
estimated to cost a total of about US$7.3 million would be procured through
international competitive bids. Reasonable quotations have been received by
ANTEL for the additions to equipment at (a) above and contracts are being
drawn up. Goods such as cable ducts and external plant which are manufactured
locally and which would be financed through ANTEL's own resources would be
procured through local competitive bids.
5.10      El Salvador is a member of the Central American Common Market and,
in accordance with the agreement of Fiscal Incentive for Industrial Develop-
ment, ANTEL is obliged to give suppliers from member countries a preference
of 50% of the import duties applying to suppliers from non-member countries.
Suppliers from Central American. countries would be allowed, in accordance
with current Bank policies, a preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the CIF
price, or 50% of the import duties, whichever is lower. None of the goods to
be financed by the Bank loan are currently manufactured in El Salvador or the
Central American Common Market countries. ANTEL however expects that tele-
phones for which an allocation of US$0.6 million exists in the loan are likely
to be manufactured in Costa Rica by the time bids are called, and has requested
the Bank to provide for bid preference for Central American countries' suppliers.
Project Implementation
5.11      The proposed schedule for the execution of the project is set out
in Annexes 5.02 and 5.03. The proposed schedule is realistic. ANTEL's staff
would prepare engineering designs and bid documents for long distance trans-
mission equipment and rural service equipment, VF telegraph equipment, cables,
telephone instruments, and later carry out bid evaluation and prepare con-
tracts with suppliers. ANTEL, however, does not have the capacity to prepare
bid documents for switching equipment and proposes to utilize the services
of regional ITU experts to prepare the bid documents, and later to evaluate
bids and prepare contracts for equipment. ANTEL would lay and commission all
distribution cables and would supervise construction of cable ducts by local
contractors. All installation would be carried out by ANTEL's technical staff,
except in case of new and sophisticated type of switching equipment where
ANTEL's staff would assist the contractors' staffs. ANTEL would carry out the
acceptance testing of all installed equipment.  ANTEL's management is suffi-
ciently experienced and is capalble of managing the above work satisfactorily.
The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1982.

Disbursements
5.12      Estimate of loan disbursements is set out in Annex 5.04.  Disburse-
ments would be made for 100 percent of foreign expenditures including, where
necessary, installation costs, for goods specified under the loan. Because
the project as designed does not meet all of the estimated demand for service,
any unused balance of the loan should be used to finance additional equipment
similar to that already procured under the loan, after agreement with the
Bank. The closing date of the loan would be December 31, 1982.
5.13      The project offers limited risk, the principal one being the possi-
bility of delay in a few works due to unforeseen circumstances. In tele-
communications projects, which comprise a large number of works, delay in
the completion of a few works does not generally prevent the use of other
newly created assets. A sensitivity analysis contemplating a ten percent
increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, a ten percent decrease
in revenues, a two-year delay in program completion is given in Annex 7.01.

VI. FINANCES
Past Financial Performance and Present Position
6.01      Over the period of the last construction program ANTEL's
financial performance has been satisfactory both in terms of rate of
return and in internal cash generation. At the end of 1976 ANTEL had a
solid cash position and a satisfactory debt/equity ratio for further
expansion.
6.02      The financial statements for 1974-76 as presented by ANTEL are
found in Annexes 6.01, 6.02 and 6.03. Due to lack of coordination between the
Financial, Planning and Technical Departments, plant under construction, when
finished, has not been promptly transferred to plant in service e.g. some
major works reported as finished in 1974 in the progress reports to the Bank
are still included in plant under construction. This has led to reduced
depreciation and net plant in operation in ANTEL's financial statements, and
as a consequence the rate of return shown on these statements has been over-
stated. Nevertheless, taking into account the adjustments necessary to
correct these deficiencies, ANTEL has met the 10% rate of return target as set
out in Loan 811-ES. ANTEL agreed that plant under construction in future will
be transferred to assets in operation on a more systematic and consistent
basis.
6.03      Summaries of ANTEL's financial performance for 1974-76 are presented
in paragraphs 6.04 and 6.06. These have been adjusted for the incomplete
transfers of plant under construction.
6.04      ANTEL's adjusted income statement for FY74/76 are summarized below:
Years ending December 31:         1974       1975      1976
Millions of ¢
Operating revenues                32.6      38.9       51.9
Operating costs                   19.9      25.5       37.0
Operating income                  12.7      13.4       14.9

Rate of return (%)                 25        23         21
6.05      ANTEL's tariff level has been constant since 1964.  The 59% in-
crease noted in 1976 operating revenues as compared with 1974 has been caused
by higher traffic volume billed. However, operating costs increased at a
still higher rate, causing the operating ratio to increase from 61% to 71%;
and the rate of return decreased from 25% to 21%. The main reason for the
increased operating expenses was higher labor costs, especially in 1976,
when a 40% salary increase was granted.

6.06      ANTEL's-adjusted financial position as at December 31, 1976, is
summarized below:
Mlillions of ¢
Total fixed assets                            90.5
Accounts receivables                          12.4
Other current assets                          22.4
Total Assets                            125.3
Equity                                        78.5
Long-term debt, excluding
current portion                             33.2
Current liabilities, including
current portion of long-term debt           13.6
Total Liabilities                       125.3
Debt/equity ratio                            32/68
Current ratio                                  2.5
Other current assets include a cash balance of about US$6.5 million. Most of
those funds are currently lent to other state entities on short-term through
the Central Bank, producing a return of about 8%.
6.07      The fixed assets are stated at historic cost.  About half of exist-
ing net fixed assets were installed in 1972 or earlier. The inflation in
El Salvador before 1972 has been negligible. During the period 1972-76,
however, the accumulated inflation has been about 60% according to the
official cost of living index. Even if cost reductions through advances in
technology, economies of scale and increased productivity during the same
period are considered, book values of fixed assets may be low. Even so, the
rate of return on revalued net: assets should be well in excess of the mini-
mum 10% covenanted in the Loan Agreement for 811-ES.
Accounts Receivable
6.08      Receivables (excluding governmental accounts) as at December 31,
1976, was equivalent to about 65 days' billing, consisting of 30-35 days to
issue the bills and about 30 days for payment. A new computer, IBM 370/115,
replaced the old one, IBM 1401, as from July 1977. As a result, bills are
expected to be issued within 15-20 days as from 1978. This should reduce
accounts receivable to about 50 days' billing, which can be considered very
satisfactory.
6.09      Government's accounts receivable amounted to a total of V2.5
million (US$1 million) at the end of 1976 (see Annex 6.04). This is equiva-
lent to about 16 months' of billing to the Government. The present situation



- 37 -
is very much the same. The Supreme Court and four ministries account for
80% of the total dues.  While many of the ministries and autonomous insti-
tutions pay their bills within a reasonable time, others do not. This
situation has been brought about because bills to the Government for
telephone service were settled against the Government's equity contribution
as part of the process of confirming ANTEL's status as an autonomous agency.
By 1973 the Government's contribution had been fully settled, but some govern-
ment agencies only very slowly accepted the obligation to make payments to
ANTEL thereafter. A small amount (V197,000) from 1973 is still under
discussion as whether it is to be settled against the Government's equity
contribution or not.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that:
(a)  by September 30, 1978, ANTEL will collect ¢1.4 million
(US$560,000), which have been earmarked by the Government
as partial payment of past due bills;
(b)  ANTEL and the Government will, by September 30, 1978,
determine the exact balance of past due bills (other than
those paid in accordance with (a) above) as well as ways
to settle said balance; and
(c)  before June 30, 1979, the final settlement of said balance
will be achieved (including payments to be made there-
under).
Financing Plan
6.10      ANTEL's projected funds flow statement for the 1977-82 period is
shown in Annex 6.03. A summary of the requirements for capital construction
and the sources from which they would be met is given below:

ANTEL's net internal cash generation is expected to cover 65% of the total
capital outlays 1977-82. The remaining 35% will be financed by a CABEI loan
of US$5.1 million, unused part of Loan 811-ES, US$2.2 million, and the proposed
Bank loan, US$23.0 million. The proposed loan is assumed to have a term of 20
years, including a grace period of five years and carry an interest of 7.5%.
Future Financial Performance
6.11      Projected financial statements for 1977-82 and comments are given
in Annexes 6.01, 6.02 and 6.03. A summary is given below:
Years ending December 31:            1977    1978    1979    1980    1981    1982

Debt service coverage                 4.2      3.4      4.1      3.3      3.6     4.2



- 39 -
6.12      The projected results are satisfactory.  It should be observed, how-
ever, that the projected rate of return is not based on revalued assets (see
para. 6.07). Even with assets and depreciations suitably revalued, the rate
of return is expected to surpass the 10% rate of return covenant in Loan 811-ES.
This covenant should be continued and a proper rate base should be established.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from ANTEL that:
(a) a revaluation study will be made and that complementary
information will be supplied with the financial statements
as from December 31, 1980, giving values for fixed assets
and depreciations suitably revalued as from 1972 onwards;
(b) a rate of return of at least 15% on the book value of net
assets will be maintained until the revaluation study is
completed; and
(c) thereafter, a rate of return of at least 10% on suitably
revalued assets in accordance with previous return covenant.
6.13      Projected balance sheets as of 1977 through 1982 (Annex 6.02) indi-
cate that ANTEL's financial position will remain sound. At the end of 1982,
the debt/equity ratio would be 32/68, thus leaving a margin for further
borrowing. The high initial cash balance of about US$6.2 million in 1977 is
expected to be reduced to about US$3.5 million under the current investment
program. ANTEL is likely, however, to increase the second phase of the in-
vestment program if a review of demand after the introduction of the new
tariff structure confirms current forecasts (see para. 4.04). Under these
circumstances ANTEL will use the projected cash balance for increased capital
outlays in 1980-82. Although an increase in the development program may be
justified, the financial viability of ANTEL should be assured. During negoti-
ations assurances were obtained from ANTEL that any additional work to the
1978-82 investment program, exceeding US$1.5 million in any one fiscal year,
will be undertaken only after the Bank is afforded an opportunity to comment
on such additional investments.
6.14      Debt service coverage by internal cash generation over the period
1977-82 would be not less than 3.3 in any fiscal year. As under Loan 811-Es,
ANTEL was asked not to incur long-term debt without the Bank's prior approval,
unless the preceding 12 months' internal cash generation would cover maximum
future debt service at least 1.5 times. During negotiations assurances
to this effect were obtained.
6.15      Indicators which will help monitor ANTEL's performance are given in
Annex 6.05.

ANNEX 6.01

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
A. Income Statements
1.        Installation charges  have been calculated at the actual tariff
of 0400 per connection times the number of new subscribers connected per
year. Charges for transfers of connections are expected to decrease to
about ¢100,000 per year as more telephones are connected.
2.        Rentals in 1977 are based on existing tariffs and include a
number of free calls. As from 1978 the revised tariff structure is expected
to be put in force, eliminating free calls.  The new tariff structure is
expected to produce a 10% increase in local revenues as from 1978. A pro-
portion of 60% residential subscribers and 40% commercial subscribers has
been assumed for the whole projection period.
3.        Metered traffic includes all automatic local and long distance
calls. The revenues have been calculated at the current rate of 00.05 per
pulse. The average number of pulses per subscriber is assumed to remain
constant as from 1978.
4.        International telephone revenues are expected to increase 14% in
1977, partly due to better facilities available from the earth satellite
station, which was inaugurated at the end of June 1977. As from 1978
onwards, the increase is projected to be about 20% per year. An increase
in demand of 30% - 35% per year is projected by COMTELCA and TAI in two
different traffic studies, but the lower growth rate assumed in the forecast
takes into account limitations in projected facilities within the COMTELCA
network.
5.        Miscellaneous revenues include:  rentals of lines, repairs, tele-
phone books, fines and manual long distance calls etc. These revenues are
expected to increase in proportion to total number of subscribers..
6.        Telex, Telegraph and Cable.  Telex revenues are projected to
increase from about 02 million in 1976 to about ¢12 million in 1982 based
on a study by COMTELCA from 1976. Telegraph and cable revenues are expected
to remain practically constant during the period.
7.        Salaries and Wages.  The increase in number of staff is expected
to be 10% in 1977, 4% in 1978 and 3.3% per year thereafter. The wage
increase for 1977 was 5% and a 10% yearly wage increase has been projected
from 1978 onwards.
8.        Depreciation has been calculated at an average annual rate of 5%
over gross fixed assets in operation.

ANNEX 6.01
Page 3 of 3 pages
9.        Operation and administration (excluding wages and depreciations)
are expected to increase 10% per year.
10.       Maintenance costs (excluding wages) are expected to increase in
proportion to average fixed assets.
11.       COMTELCA costs (excluding wages) are projected to increase in pro-
portion to the traffic within the COMTELCA network.
12.       Rental of channels includes rents for satellite channels.  Cost
increases have been projected according to expected increase in inter-
national traffic.
13.       Net hospital cost is expected to increase in proportion to total
wages.
14.       Net Interest.  No income from interest and no capitalization of
interest has been projected.

B. Balance Sheets
1.        Fixed assets are based on ANTEL's construction program.
2.        Plant under construction is assumed to equal the year's capital
outlays, which is equal to assuming that each individual work is put in
operation on an average one and a half year after the capital outlay was
made.
3.        Accounts receivable are expected to equal about 50 days' billing.
4.        Government account is expected to decrease to about half a
year's billing in 1978 and be kept on that level afterwards.
5.        Inventories are expected to increase in proportion to total
average fixed assets.
6.        Other current assets, prepayments, transitory items etc., are
expected to decrease during 1977 and thereafter increase 0100,000 per year.
7.        The equity consists of retained earnings from prior years and the
net profit of current year.
8.        Long-term debt.  In addition to the proposed Bank loan of US$25
million, ANTEL will take up a loan of US$4.3 million from CABEI for the
financing of current works outside the project.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      The economic analysis relates primarily to ANTEL's investment program
of which the Bank project is an integral part.
Efficiency in Development
7.02      Economic expansion iLn El Salvador depends primarily on the country's
capacity to increase agricultural output and manufacturing exports. As output
in these two sectors increases, communications needs grow, and as El Salvador
becomes increasingly developed, the least cost means of communication for an
increasing proportion of the population is some form of telecommunications.
7.03      In El Salvador, telephones and telex are primarily used as intermed-
iate inputs in the production of goods and services. 1/ The investment program,
by increasing rural access, expanding system capacity, and upgrading the quality
of local and long distance telecommunications services will (a) help reduce the
number of subscribers waiting for telephones; (b) reduce wastage of time caused
by having to make repeated call attempts during peak business hours; (c) reduce
wastage of resources consumed by higher cost means of communication; (d) reduce
losses of production and marketing efficiency resulting from lack of communica-
tions; and (e) facilitate improvement of transport and delivery service in both
urban and rural areas. Furthermore, to the extent that a more efficient and
wider access to telephone service for Government and business results in the
substitution of telephone communication for face-to-face communication, the
growth of transport costs, energy costs, and vehicle traffic will be slowed.
Distribution of Benefits
7.04      There are both efficiency and equity aspects to the distribution of
benefits from the proposed telecommunications program. Given the significant
unsatisfied demand for telephone service in El Salvador (para. 4.02), the
recent doubling of individual subscriber connection charges from US$80 to
US$160 was a positive step toward attempting to assure that in serviced areas
individual telephone connections will be rationed in such a way that at the
margin those subscribers who are willing to pay the highest prices for
telephones (and therefore who presumably will incur the most benefits from
having a telephone) can get a telephone within at least two years of appli-
cation. In most instances, in both urban and rural areas, it is thought
that these new subscribers will be business or government, or managers of
business and government who will use their residential telephones partially
in connection with their employment.
7.05      With regard to the equity aspects of the program, an attempt is
being made to assure significantly increased communication access to lower
1/   During the first five moniths of 1977 approximately 56 percent of all
national and over 70 percesnt of all international telephone traffic
was generated by business, professional or governmental subscribers.
The network is designed, however, for peak daytime traffic periods
during which business related traffic is even more dominating.



- 49 -
income population by extending service to the three municipalities and approx-
imately 190 currently unserved cantons with populations greater than 2,000,
by increasing the number of long distance links to 200 additional small com-
munities in rural areas, and by increasing the number of public call offices
in San Salvador. In total, approximately 400,000 rural dwellers (almost ten
percent of El Salvador's population) will benefit through more convenient
access to telephones. With this increased access of rural pouplation to tele-
phone communication through public call offices, a more equitable distribution
of the benefits of telephone service in El Salvador will be achieved. This is
not only because the telephone access of the lower income rural population will
be significantly increased, but also because, with the existing and proposed
tariff structures, this increased rural access will be financially subsidized
by the generally higher-income urban subscribers.
Least Cost Solution
7.06      As outlined in Chapter IV, there is a significant excess demand for
telecommunications services which the planned 1978-1982 development program
will be unable to totally eliminate. Given this, the least cost solution for
the implementation of the program depends on (a) having made the correct tech-
nical and economic decisions when the networks were planned in the early 1960's,
and the plans revised in 1977, and (b) following the optimum path in the de-
sign, dimensioning and timing of the many installations which comprise contin-
uing system expansion. Given the existing network, the dimensioning and timing
of the works under the existing program, of which the Bank project is an in-
tegral part, are based on engineering studies designed to determine the least
cost means for improving service to existing subscribers, and meeting new de-
mand in priority areas.
Return on Investment
7.07      The internal rate of return, defined as the discounted rate which
equalizes the stream of expected revenues (in 1977 prices) attributable to
the program with capital and operating costs (at 1977 price levels) is 16
percent (Annex 7.01). This is, however, a significant understatement of
total program benefits since it is based only on the current observed will-
ingness of subscribers to pay ANTEL for telecommunications services. Thus,
it does not include the consumer surplus which subscribers and other callers
receive.
7.08      An estimate of some portion of this consumer surplus can be made,
however, by taking into account the fact that consumers in El Salvador have
in the past demonstrated that they are willing to pay significantly higher
prices for telecommunications services than they are currently being asked
to pay. With a portion of consumer surplus estimated by tabulating the prices
in real terms which existing consumers actually paid when they acquired tele-
phone service, and assuming that new consumers are similar to the average
existing consumer, the rate of return on the program is 36 percent. Alter-
natively, assuming that new and existing consumers will in the future be
willing to pay in real terms the same price that existing consumers are pay-
ing in 1977, the rate of return ranges between 31 percent and 33 percent
(Annex 7.01).



- 50 -
7.09      These rates of return are still significant underestimates of
program benefits, however, since they do not include a complete estimate of
consumer surplus, an estimate of the value of time saved through a reduction
in the proportion of unsuccessful call attempts, and benefits incurred by
receivers of calls, by existing subscribers when new subscribers join the
system, and by those who benefit indirectly through the better administration
of regional development, health, transport, and agricultural programs, and
increased urban and regional business and government efficiency.
7.10      Benefits are also underestimated because, while the costs included
in calculating the internal rate of return are those for extending and up-
grading the network and providing facilities in the newly served rural areas
now, the full benefits are not included because they available capacity of
various components of equipment will only be fully utilized when additional
investment is made in the future. Thus, the costs incurred during the 1978-82
period will generate additional. untabulated benefits during the period follow-
ing 1982.

Return on Investment
1.        Benefit Period.  The benefit period of the program extends from
1979 to 2000, when on average the equipment provided under the program is
expected to have substantially completed its useful life.
2.        Capital Expenditures.  Pre-investments for the 1983-87 program
are excluded. All price contingencies have been deducted from the estimated
total capital expenditures for the 1978-82 program. Capital expenditures do
not include expected price increases of foreign costs of 7.5% per annum during
1978-79 and 7% during 1980-83 in addition to projected increases in local
expenditures of 9% per year in 1978-79 and 8% per year in 1980-83.
3.        Operating costs and revenues have been deflated with expected local
price increases of 9% per annum in 1978-79 and 8% per annum in 1980-83 to
bring them to constant 1977 price levels and to make them comparable with
capital expenditures. As from 1984, incremental operating costs and revenues
are assumed to remain constant in real terms. Incremental revenues assigned
to the program are primarily based on expected additional telephone and telex
subscribers and traffic brought about by the program. Incremental operational
costs exclude depreciation and interest and are based on additional assets and
traffic generated under the program.
4.        Net Benefits.  A summary of the program's cost and benefit streams
at 1977 price levels is as follows:
Capital        Operating               Net
Year       Expenditures   Costs    Revenues        Benefits
(In millions of ¢)
1978           21.3         1.4           -          (22.7)
1979           33.9         5.1         10.7         (28.3)
1980            39.6        9.0         17.9         (30.7)
1981           25.2        11.1         26.6          (9.7)
1982           15.0        13.9         35.3           5.4
1983             -         14.7         37.0          22.3
1984-2000            -        14.7         37.0          22.3
The internal rate of return for the net benefit stream is 16%.

5.        Sensitivity Analysis.  A sensitivity analysis was performed with
the following results:
Rate of Return
10% increase in capital expenditures                    14%
10% increase in operating costs                         15%
10% decrease in revenues                                13%
Two years' delay in program completion                  12%
Combination of all factors above                         7%
6.        Estimates of partial consumer surplus.  The 16% rate of return is
a significant underestimate of total program benefits since it is based only
on the observed willingness of subscribers to pay current ANTEL tariffs for
telecommunications services. In the past, however, consumers in El Salvador
have been asked to pay higher prices for telecommunications services and have
demonstrated a willingness to do so. Thus, a partial estimate of the con-
sumer surplus can be made by tabulating the prices in real terms which existing
consumers actually demonstrated a willingness to pay at the time when they
acquired telephone service, and by assuming that new consumers will be similar
to the average existing consumer. Given the existing investment program, the
assumption that new telephone subscribers will have similar characteristics to
existing ones is considered by the mission to be reasonable.
7.        With one recent exception 1/ telecommunications tariffs have not
changed since 1964. Over the 1964-1977 period, however, domestic consumer
price inflation of approximately 80% has taken place. 2/ As a result, con-
nected subscribers in 1964 were demonstrating in real terms that they were
willing to pay at least 80% more for a lower quality and more limited access
telephone service than current subscribers are being asked to pay. To estimate
the prices in real terms which existing telephone subscribers demonstrated a
willingness to pay during the period between 1964 and 1977, the average price
paid in real terms, and the quantity of services supplied represents a point
on the telecommunications supply curve at the end of each year. They do not
represent a point on any of the demand curves which existed in the past since
even at the higher historic real tariff levels significant excess demand
(waiting lists and traffic congestion) existed at each past point in time.
Given the historic real price-quantity tabulations, a "weighted average price"
paid by existing consumers when they entered the network was calculated.
Thus if it is assumed that new subscribers also would be willing to pay (in
terms of 1977 prices) what present subscribers have in the past on average
demonstrated a willingness to pay, the quantifiable rate of return on the
program is 36%.
1/   In September 1976 telephone connection charges were doubled from
US$80 to US$160.
2/   The national consumer price index in El Salvador increased from
108.0 in 1964 to approximately 195.0 as of Mlay 1977.

ANNEX 7.01
Page 3 of 3 pages
8.        A second estimate of consumer surplus can be made by assuming
that existing and future subscribers will be willing to pay in real
terms the same prices in the future that existing subscribers are domon-
strating a willingness to pay today. Given this assumption the quanti-
fiable economic rate of return on the program is between 31 and 33 percent
depending on whether or not the entry price for new subscribers is taken
as that existing when they enter the waiting list, or as that which they
pay when they first receive service.
9.        These estimates do not explicitly take into account the fact
that new subscribers will be receiving a better quality of service (less
traffic congestion and noise) and a better quantity of service (a much
larger number of connected subscribers who can be contacted by telephone)
than did existing subscribers when they joined the network.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  ANTEL will complete a feasibility study of peak and off-
peak rates by December 31, 1979, and review the study
with the Bank (para. 3.12);
(b) By September 30, 1978, ANTEL will collect 01.4 million as
partial payment by the Government of past due bills and the
balance will be settled before June 30, 1979 (para. 6.09);
(c) a revaluation study will be made and complementary information
will be supplied with the financial statements as from
December 31, 1980 g:iving values for fixed assets and deprecia-
tion suitably revalued. Tariffs will be maintained to
achieve a rate of return of at least 15 percent on book values
until the revaluation study is completed and thereafter
ten percent on suitably revalued assets (para. 6.12);
(d) ANTEL will not undertake additional works to the 1978-82
investment program exceeding US$1.5 million equivalent in
any one fiscal year without obtaining Bank's comments on
the additional investment (para. 6.13); and
(e) ANTEL would not incur long-term debt without the Bank's prior
approval unless the preceding 12 months' internal cash
generation covers maximum future debt service at least
1.5 times (para. 6.14).
8.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$23 million.
