ongoing 1978-81 program to expand water supply and sewerage\n            services in order to improve the levels of service in Amman\n            including those areas in which the urban poor reside. The\n            project includes the following main elements. (a)\n            construction of approximately 207 km of water mains,\n            laterals and house connections, a reservoir and one booster\n            pumping station; (b) construction for approximately 225 km\n            of sewerage mains, laterals and house connections and two\n            sewage lift stations; (c) supply of 15,000 water meters,\n            pipes, fittings, relevant electrical and mechanical\n            equipment and maintenance equipment; (d) consulting services\n            for construction supervision; and (e) staff training. The\n            project would extend further the water and sewerage systems\n            in Amman as well as help protect the groundwater resources\n            there from pollution. In addition, a large proportion of the\n            project will benefit low income users."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
