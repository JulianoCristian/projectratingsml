INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NIGERIA
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the equivalent of US$54 million to
help finance a project for the expansion of secondary education, in. the six
Northern States and associated technical assistance.   The loan would have a
term of 25 years, including 10 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4% per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Current Economic Position aud Long-Term
Prospects of Nigeria" (AW-35a) dated June 9, 1972 was distributed to the
Executive Directors on June 20, 1972 (R72-169). A country data sheet is
attached at Annex I.
Recent Developments
3.        Nigeria has recovered substantially from the consequences of the
civil war that ended in January 1970. The three Eastern States have beev,
rapidly integrated into the country's political and social life. It has
managed the economy effectively both during and since the war and has launched
its second development plan (1970-74) largely because of the technical compe-
tence of the senior echelons of the civil service. The Federal Government
has established a strong central position in the twelve state Federaticn.
Many important questions relating to Nigeria's future constitutional arrange-
meuts remain to be solved. In this connection the successful imple-mentation
of the national population census scheduled for November 1973 and the accep-
tance of its results by different sections of the population are important.
The Government is conscious of the importance of accurate populaticn figures
as a basis for socio-economic planning as well as their wider political im-
plications and is making every effort to ensure a fair and objective census.
Preparations for its conduct are well advanced.
4.        The end of the civil war early in 1970 was followed by a rapid re-
vival of economic growth. Between 1969-70 and 1971-72, GDP increased by
about 36 percent. The overall rate of growth in FY 1972173 is likely to be
lower partly as a result of a slowing down in the rate of expansion of crude
oil output and, more importantly, due to the slackening in industrial growth
following the liberalization of imports in 1971 and weaker agricultural per-
formance attributable in part to the drought in the Northern States. This
slowing down however is expected to be a temporary phenomenon. Other economic
performance indicators point to the underlying strength of the economy. The



2-
balancce of pavmrents position continues to be stronig, mainly as a result of
the conti.nued rapid growth in petroleum earnings.
5,        With the slackening in the growth of imports, the Government con-
tinued to utilize its surprlus to reduce short-term foreign indebtedness and
to relaxc further Lhe restrictions on payments for imports and the repatriation
of dividends.  The restrictions on import payments introduced in 1971 have
been abolished and the repatriation of accuiraulafcu 6 dividend arrears for 1971
and up to 25 percent of the dividends accruing for 1972 will now be permitted.
Gross official reserves of foreign exchange at the elnd of March 1973 stood at
N292 millionl/ (equivalent to US3$444 million), equivalent to about 3 months
im-,:rts.  TIport liberalization has helped to reduce the pressure on prices.
Food pri;ce indices which had risen at an average rate of some 23 percent per
Year during 1969-71, showed an increase of only 4 per.-cent Juring the Lirst
10 ncnt-hs of 1972.  indices of othier constuer goods pri-e.-. rose even less.
6.        Thle Government's overal.l fiscal pr  ,r also continues to be strcng;
the 197,/74 Budget estimates a current surpiub o. -,232 mi llion (abOut $S429
million), a further substantial increase in the vol umae of public development
expenditures, and larger transfers to the St:ate-i to supoort their prograns.

improvement in the general standard of livivg will depend on the allozat4oii

Oi1 the government's capacity to expand public investment over a broad range
of sectors and geographical areas.
9.        Future employment and incoLme distribution patteris in Nigeria wi '
be determined largely by developments in the rural sector.    Although no re.ia-

in income and employment for mcst workers, particularly for new entrants to
the labor force, will depend largely on developments in the agricultural.,
small industry and service sectors, where detailed planning atnd administrative
capacity present the most difficult problems.
10.       Nigeria's current economic problem is not so mnuch a Problem of re-
sokurce mobilization but rather of resource allocation and effes ti.e use.   I)
1971'72, petroleum revenues increased to about N640 million ('S$960 million,
or about S13 per capita) from slightly less than N200 millio.n in the previolus
ye,ar; ow4ng largelv to expected further increases in these revenues, Govern-
ment revenues are expected to be strong over the remainder of the current
Plan period. Even assuming substantial increases in recurrent expenditures,
the Government's overall fiscal position should remain favorable, with currernt
budgetary surpluses equivalent to about 8 percent of GNP being realized from
1973/74 through 1980, roughly equal to projected public investment expendi-
tures. However, the distribution of resources between the Federal and State
Governments has serious developmental implications. Under the interim reventue
allocation system now in effect, State revenues are likely to grow much slower
than Federal revenues, which are largely a function of the petroleum profits
tax.  Consequently, while the Federal Government can look forward to substantiaL
sturpluses, the States may face rising recurrent deficits by mid-decade.    It also
mray be ditficult for the States to make full use of existing infrastructure and
to establish the new facilities necessary to reduce present regional disparities.
The Federal Government seems to be well aware of this problem of State finances
and is apparently prepared to assume some of the States' economic and social
responsibilities.
1'.       The scarcity of well prepared projects and the limitations of execu-
tive capacitv hampers the fulfilment of the modest investment target of the
Seoced Plan. However, the country's social and economic needs clearly justify
a much larger investment program in the future and the necessary financial re-
sources to sustain it are also available. What is needed is a concerted ef-
fort from now on to augment absorptive capacity by giving greater attention
to project preparation and to building the institutions and training the per-
sonnel necessary to plan and implement a larger investment program. Project
preparation on a very large scale is therefore an immediate priority for the
Government and external aid agencies.



- 4 -
12.       Nigeria's medium-term balance of payments prospects are favorable.
The external resource balance (net exports of goods and non-factor services),
which shiowed a N130 million surplus in 1971, could increase to approximately
N500 million (US$750 million) at the end of the current plan period, witlh fur-
ther growth thereafter.   Correspondingly rapid increases in factor payments
abroad by the oil sector are expected to result in small deficits in the cur-
rent account balance which should, however, be more than offset by private
and official capital inflows. The overall balance of payments position is
therefore expected to be storng at least through the mid-1970s. After 1975,
nlowever, the growth of petroleum exports may decline to about 7 percent while
imports are likely to remain well above this level. A substantial resource
gap may therefore re-emerge in the early 1980's, again constraining economic
growth and development. Balance of payments difficulties could recur much
sooner, if public consumption were to rise more rapidly thar projected.
External Finance
13.       Nigeria's requirements for external finance, over the short and
medium term, are based primarily on the country's need forrew and improved
institutions, planning machinery and strengthened administrative capacity.
Most of the skills Nigeria needs are only available in adequate volume from
abroad and some are most economically and efficiently found and applied in
association with the type of projects typically financed oy external aid
agencies. Aid programs can augment managerial and technical capacity where
it is most needed and, where foreign and domestic resources are being used
in combination, can help to ensure that both are used effectively. The es-
tablishment of a substantial project pipeline by external aid agencies over
the next 5-8 years is therefore important because Nigeria's resource position
is likely to be considerably less favorable by the early 1980s when substan-
tial resource transfers will be required.
14.       As of December 31, 1971 Nigeria's total external public and publicly
guaranteed debt, including undisbursed, amounted to an estimated US$850 mil--
lion, of which approximately $65 million represented suppliers' credits.
Outstanding but undisbursed commitments of official capital currently aaount
to about US$320 million. Debt service in 1971 was 3 percent of gross exports,
or 4 percent of exports less factor payments. Nigeria could clearly handle
a very substantial volume of additional borrowing on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA
15.       Bank/IDA lending to Nigeria to date amounts to $493.7 million (net
of cancellations) of which $220.8 million was committed before, $31.1 million
during and $241.8 million after the civil war. Transport and power together
($353.2 million) account for about 72 percent of the total and agriculture,
education, industry and the post-war rehabilitation program loan for the



- 5 -
remaining 28 percent; excluding the program loan, the respective shares are
about 85 percent for transport and power and 15 percent for the other three
sectors.  Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of April 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
16.       Bank activities since 1970 have generally been aimed at assisting
Nigeria in the following three broad areas: (a) reconstruction and rehabili-
tation of the economy after the civil war; (b) institution-building in the
public sector; and (c) extensive economic, sector and project preparation
work. In pursuance of these aims, Bank commitments in FYs 1971 and 1972
amounted to $97.2 million and $119.6 million respectively; during the same
period, an economic mission and agriculture, education and transportation
sector missions visited Nigeria. Having substantially completed its post-
war reconstruction and rehabilitation program, Nigeria is now at the stage
where a major development effort is feasible. Similarly, the Bank, having
completed a preliminary assessment of Nigeria's medium and longer-term de-
velopment priorities and initiated substantial project preparation work, is
now in a position to develop a more extensive and forward looking pattern of
activities in Nigeria than has been possible in recent years. The results
of this preparatory work during the last two years, which are expected to
result in a gradual shift of emphasis in future Bank activities in Nigeria,
are outlined below.
17.       Given the size of Nigeria's population and its low level of per
capita income, there is room for a considerable increase in Bank lending to
the extent that this can help the country to develop its resources efficiently.
It is necessary, moreover, for Nigeria to prepare for the eventuality that
the growth of oil production may level off after 1980 and even possibly de-
cline, a situation which would justify substantial borrowing abroad to main-
tain the momentum of economic expansion. The Bank is therefore working with
the Federal Government to build up over the next 5-8 years a pipeline of pro-
jects suitable for external financing and to strengthen the administrative
capacity of the Federal and State agencies that will be responsible for
implementing these projects.
18.       Thus, in agreement with the Government, the emphasis of future Bank
lending will increasingly be placed on agriculture and the social sectors
where increased public investment is of high priority and where planning and
implementation institutions are weakest. Bank activities will gradually be
extended into new areas such as water supply and sewerage, telecommunications,
urban infrastructure and, eventually, the direct financing of industrial pro-
jects. Meanwhile, substantial lending is expected to continue in transporta-
tion and power to support the large investments still required, pending the
identification and preparation of sufficient new projects in the high priority
areas noted above. In this latter connection, institutions in a few sectors
(notably power and transport) are expected to develop in the fairly short Lerm

While the initial urbarn infrastructure pro ject<, 'xnder ccnsideratio7n are
expected to be located `in Lagos, whiere the niee.s arm .ost urgent, the Bank
would hope to expand activities to oth.er urban  r
20.       Several specific projects presently rc'l   .Cscassion foi the next
two years illustrate the Bank's; ef:Fort to suppo'n: the objectives rioted above.
In agriculture, for exmasple, the Bank has strongly emphasized the importance
it attaches to rural developmtn.it in Ni,geria andi a recent, preparation mission
reviewed a project co-vering, about 6,000 sq. mi. o- cotton growing areas in the
North-Central, North--Western and North-Eastern States. In additJion to cotton,
the project is designed to increase the productivi-y of fooc crop productiorn
(maize, sorghun).  Investrmernt requirements wi.'i iuclude 7 feeder- roads, water
supply, credit and storage as well as the expansion o.- rmioderu input use.  Ir
the meantime, the Bank plans also to provide subst.antiail suipport during the.
next two years to food and tree crop development (eec   rice, oil palm and
cocoa) in Eastern and Southern Nigeria. The propcsed projects in these areas
will be largely concerned with smaliholder production and will provirde addi-
tional income opportunities -or large ntumibers of the rural population, T he
need for institutional credit for agr:iculture will grow rapidly as input use
by farmiers increases and loinger-term development opportunities are realized.
The Nigerian Agricu;ltural Bank. (NAB), recently established with UNDP techni-
cal assistance, will help meet this need, although. it will reqtuire continued
external technical assistance during its early years of operation.   As a
vehicle for Bank assistance and. support for NAB, an agricultural credit
project i s also under consideration.
21.       Ini addition to the extensive activities iin agriculture described
above, the Bank and the Nigerian Goverrnent are also considering thne prepara-
tion of repeat projects in transport, power and education and the identifica-
tion of new priority projects in teleconumunicatiras, water supply and small-
scale industry within the next two years.   A major objective of these opera-
tions will be to help establish new, and improve exis.ing institutions in
these sectors through technical and capital ass4stance consistent with the
general objectives of Bank operations in Nigeria noted above.

22.       In addition to the proposed third education loan, three other Bank
operations are at an advanced stage of preparation: a proposed $15 million
loan for livestock development; a loan of $55 million to the Nigerian Ports
Authority for the extension of port facilities at Lagos; and a loan for high-
ways, the scope of which has still to be determined.
PART III - EDUCATION IN NIGERIA
23.       Following modest expansion during the 1960s, national enrollment
ratios are still only 34 percent for primary and 4 percent for secondary
schools. These figures obscure a wide regional discrepancy between the North,
where primary and secondary enrollment ratios are 13 and 1.7 percent respec-
tively, and the South, where they are 58 and 7 percent. While the latter
compare with the average for Africa, those for the North are amongst the
lowest in the world. Nigerian education generally lacks relevance to manpower
requirements and is based on inadequate data and planning. In addition, school
curricula tend to be over-academic, although this situation is improving with
the gradual introduction of some pre-employment training through multilateral
schools. Underlying all these problems is a lack of coordinated educational
planning and strategy, reflecting weak executive capacity in the States and
the non-involvement in primary and secondary education hitherto of the Federal
Government.  In this connection, the Federal Government recently decided that
primary and secondary education would henceforward become a concurrent Feder-
al/State responsibility and higher education an exclusive Federal responsibil-
ity. The purpose of this important change is evidently to increase the Fed-
eral Government's effective involvement in the coordination of the national
education system and, in particular, to demonstrate its commitment to the
objective of reducing present regional disparities in educational opportunity.
24.       Owing to the disruption caused by the civil war, Niigeria has not
yet developed a comprehensive long-term strategy to deal with the problems
noted above and planning has necessarily related to medium-term targets and
measures. In broad terms, the principal aims of educational development,
as stated in the Plan, are: (a) to restore facilities damaged by the civil
war; (b) to reduce inequalities of educational opportunity between States;
and (c) to prepare young Nigerians for productive employment. About N4278
million is allocated to education in the Plan's public sector investment
program, 14180 million by the Federal Government and N98 million by the
States. Since the immediate post-war needs for reconstruction and rehabili-
tation are now being met under Federal and State programs, assisted by the
Bank's second education project (Loan 814-UNI), the Nigerian authorities are
now specifically focussing on the other two objectives.
25.       As noted above, primary and secondary school enrollments in North-
ern Nigeria are extremely low. Parallel to the formal primary education sys-
tem there is a large network of small private Koranic schools catering for
over I million pupils in 1971, more than the enrollment in the formal system.



- 8 -
These schools are not recognized by the FederaL and State Governments because
of standards inconsistent with the rest of the system, although some religious
schools have recently introduc:ed secular subjects to thie curriculun.  Non-
formal learning schemes, such as adult education and functional literacy, are
still at the earliest stage of development. The general weaknesses of
Nigeria's educational system become more acute in the North.    For instance,
access of girls to primary education is less than half that of boys and to
secondary and higher educatiorL less than a third; secondary enrollments are
too small to provide the numbers required for further studies at university
or other post-secondary institutions; and primary and secondary curricula are
oriented towards the needs of those who proceed to the next educational level.
Broadening of the secondary program, already initiated in the South and in
the East, nas not been started in the North.    In addition, there is a prob-
lei of supply and retention of qualified teachers.
_2.       Orly one of Nigeria's universities, Allmadu Belo University (ABU),
is located in the North and caters mainly to its needs.    ABU, and its isso-
ciated Institutes of Education and Administration, is one of the few insti:U--
tions common to all the Northern States and is acquiring a position of lead-
ership in many economic and social areas of life, in addition to its more
established academic role. The Institute af Education is involved in curri-
culum work in both primary arni secondary schools.   It, also directly controls
the Advanced Teacher Colleges at Kano and Zaria, which train non-graduate
secondary teachers.   ABUI consists of 12 faculties/schools witih an enroilmelAL
of nearly 4,000 or one-fifth ,of total university enrollment in Nigeria.    Its
development has been adversely affected by the lack of qualified entrants
tro.n the sixth forms of the Northern secondary school system.   As a result,
anal preparatory to the development of general four-year courses, the univer-
sity has established a preliminary basic studies course given orn campus for
qualified West African School Certificate ho'lders.   Remaining vacancies are
filled by graduates from tihe Advanced Teacher Training Colleges and from
primary teacher training colleges (the latter after completion of a prepara-
tory course). This loss of teachers can only be resolved by the systematic
expansion of secondary enrollments relative to university enrollment, together
with an expansion of the basic studies course which, under present circumstances
in Nigeria, is a more efficient preparation for university work than the tradi-
tional sixth form.
27.       Disparities between the N4orth and the South are iltlstrated by the
low per capita expenditures on education, about US$2 in the North in 1970/71
Aigainst US$5 in the South. However, the States' educational efforts have
been considerable and there has been some rise in education's share of public
recurrent expenditures especially in the poorest and educationally most dis-
advantaged States:   Kano, North-Eastern and North-Western.   it now averages '.6
percent for all six States. Further evidence of the high priority given to
education (particularly at post-primary level) is its 18 percent share of
planned public capital expenditure by the Northern States in 1970-74.



- 9 -
28.       The Northern States' educational development plans rightly focus on
the priority need to increase primary and secondary school enrollments, taking
into account existing and projected constraints such as financial resources,
teacher supply, administrative capability and the capacity of the building
industry. In terms of enrollment ratios, the planned targets are reasonable:
by 1982, an increase from 13 percent to 30 percent of the relevant age group
in primary schools and from 1.7 to 4 percent in secondary schools. In absolute
terms, primary enrollments are planned to increase from about 800,000 in 1971
to 2.3 million in 1982 or at 11 percent per annum and secondary enrollments
from about 64,000 in 1971 to 210,000 in 1982 or at 12 percent per annum.
Teacher requirements would increase from about 23,000 to 63,000 at the pri-
mary level and from about 3,100 to 8,300 at the secondary level during the
same period. Higher growth rates, although needed, would cause quality de-
terioration and are therefore undesirable; educational opportunity in the
North will therefore continue to lag behind the national average, although
at a reduced rate.
29.       Qualitative efforts are being made to improve the relevance of pri-
mary education to the needs of the majority of children who will not continue
their education beyond primary school. In secondary education, the present
over-academic curricula will gradually be replaced by multilateral programs
with technical, agricultural, commercial and home economics streams. Teacher
training programs will be reviewed accordingly to give adequate emphasis to
experimental science and practical subjects. While the project now proposed
supports these efforts, it recognizes that they are not sufficiently directed
towards more fundamental issues such as: the nature of the primary school
and its possible relationship with the traditional religious schools, other
non-formal rural education schemes and agricultural extension services; the
high cost of secondary education; and the nature of teacher training programs.
On the other hand, such issues cannot be resolved quickly and should not
delay satisfaction of the Northern States' obvious and immediate needs.
Rather, efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of short-
and medium-range plans do not reinforce existing rigidities or create new
ones which would compromise the possibilities of future change.
30.       The Northern States' educational targets will involve substantial
increases in recurrent and capital expenditures. Overall, the public recur-
rent costs of education in the North are expected to rise in real terms by
about 15 percent per annum through the 1980s compared with an estimated in-
crease of 8 percent in the Northern States' total public revenues. Substan-
tial increases in capital expenditure will also add to the problem of educa-
tional financing, and the States can hardly increase the current share of edu-
cation in total expenditures without threatening the provision of other
vital government services. Consequently, without increased Federal aid,
fiaance could constitute a crucial constraint to educational expansion with
a financing gap of up to US$50 million equivalent in recurrent expenditures
occurring by 1977/78. Such a gap, however, would represent only about 2 per-
cent of projected total Federal Government revenues and would be covered by
the Federal Government, consistent with its commitment to improve educational
opportunity in the North.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Education Project in Nigeria"
(60a-UNI dated May 2591973) has been distributed separately. A loan and proj-
ect sunmary is attached at Annex III. A map showing the location of the proj-
ect institutions is also attached.
32.       To date the Bank/IDA have financed two education projects - a $20
million IDA credit (72-UNI) in 1965 for the construction of secondary, tech-
nical and teacher training schools and equipment throughout Nigeria and a
$17.3 million loan (814-UNI) in 1972 for the rehabilitation and expansion of
secondary schools and primary teacher training colleges in the three Eastern
States. The two common features of these projects and of the proposed third
project are (a) the improvement of educational opportunity 4.n different areas
of the country and (b) the diversification of the secondary level curriculum
taking into account the changing manpower requirements of a rapidly developing
economy.
33.       Implementation of the First Education Project (72-UNI) was slow
initially owing to delays in the appointment of consultant architects and
subsequently due to the civil war there was no progress made with respect to
the schools located in the former Eastern region.   Consequently, the Closing
Date of the credit has been extended to June 30, 1974 and the Eastern States
component, where project execution became imapossible during the civil war,
was revised in 1972 (IDA/R72-26). Satisfactory progress is now being made
in the implementation of the entire project. Despite some delay in the second
education loan (814-UNI) being declared effective, physical implementation of
the project is proceeding satisfactorily.
34.       The genesis of the proposed project was a UNESCO Project Identification
Mission in mid-1971 which underlined the need to further expand and improve
primary and secondary education in the six Northern States with the dual purpose
of reducing disparities between the States and alleviating the shortage of
secondary school graduates. The project was prepared and appraised by Bank/
UNESCO missions which visited Nigeria in February/March and May/June, 1972.
Negotiations were conducted in Lagos in March, 1973 and the Nigerian delega-
tion was headed by Alhaji Abubakar, Deputy Permanent Secretary, Federal Minis-
try of Finance.
35.       Consistent with the analysis of the Northern States' immediate
educational needs described above, the inter-related objectives of the project
are threefold: (a) to expand and diversify their secondary school systems;
(b) to increase the supply of primary school teachers in support of their
own planned expansion of primary education; and (c) to support an applied
research effort at the Institute of Education at Ahmadu Bello University
aimed at the development of primary education better related to the economic
and social needs of the Northern States.



- 11 -
36.       Specifically, the proposed loan would help finance, in association
with complementary works to be undertaken by the Benue-Plateau, Kano, Kwara,
North-Central, North-Eastern and North-Western States and Ahmadu Bello Uni-
versity, construction, equipment and furniture for (a) about 30,000 places
in 19 new and 40 existing secondary schools or about 24 percent of the
States' expected total secondary enrollment in 1978; (b) about 5,000 places
in 8 new and 16 existing primary teacher training colleges or about 20 percent
of the States' expected total primary teacher training enrollment in 1978 and
about 100 places in one secondary teacher training college; and (c) about
1,000 places at the Department of Basic Studies and Faculty of Education of
Ahmadu Bello University, together with technical assistance and equipment
for a primary education research project at its Institute of Education. Sig-
nificant features of the project are described below.
Secondary Education
37.       In addition to the quantitative expansion of secondary education
in the North, an equally important need, as noted above, is a reform of the
present over-academic curriculum, specifically the introduction of diversified
courses. Accordingly, more than half of the additional places to be financed
in connection with the project would be in diversified courses (Forms III-V):
73 of the 191 streams in the 59 project schools would be technical, agricul-
tural, commercial and home economics streams; the remaining 118 streams would
be arts and science streams in the new and expanded schools.
38.       In this connection, another important consideration is the supply
of teachers for the expansion of secondary education in the North, including
the project schools, and particularly the availability of technical subject
teachers for the diversified courses. Taking into account the planned ex-
pansion of ABU to be financed under the project (graduate teachers) and that
of the existing Advanced Teacher Colleges (non-graduate teachers), teacher
supply generally is expected to be adequate. However, a temporary shortage
of technical subject teachers may occur in the short-term. Accordingly,
since data on the development of technical education and on technical teacher
turnover in the North are meagre, the Northern States will prepare projections
of technical teacher supply and demand, pending a comprehensive review of
longer-term needs, and seek technical teachers from external sources if a
temporary shortage of locally-trained teachers should occur. Bilateral
agencies are already aware of this need and their technical assistance pro-
grams are expected to take it into account.
Prinzary Education
39.       While the length of primary teacher training in the North varies
from one state to another, the common long-term goal is a one or two-year
post-secondary course. A one-year intensive course would appear preferable
in principle to the present five-year post-primary course still in operation.
When this objective is achieved, the output capacity of existing colleges
would be greater than presently projected annual needs and surplus colleges
would be converted to secondary schools. Accordingly, the Northern States



- 12 -
have agreed to undertake a review of their primary teacher training policies,
the findings of wnich will be submitted to the Bank for review within two
years of the signing of the Loan Agreement. In the event that one or two-
year courses were adopted by Benue-Plateau, Kano and/or North-Western States,
thus affecting 4 new and extensions to 13 existing colleges to be financed
under the proposed loan, the schedules of accommodation may need to be revised
in agreement with the Bank. Eventual savings resulting from such revision
would become eligible for re-allocation, also in agreement with the Balk, for
additional secondary school construction.
41'3.     The project includes 8 man-years of technical assistance in support
oi an applied research project, to he undertaken by the Institute of Educa-
tion at ABU, related to the development of a primary school curriculum better
related to the economic and social environment of the Northern States. The
terms of reference and detailed work program would be developed by the Insti-
tute, in consultation with the Bank. The project would also include financing
for "work units" and related equipment for experimental practical training
in the upper grades of demonstration primary schools operated by primary
teacher training colleges.
Boarding and Staff Housing
41.       As in other African countries, provision has to be made in many
cases for staff housing and for boarding facilities for pupils. Urban cen-
ters are few and schools are placed in or near small towns where there Is
rarely surplus housing available for rent by staff. Only a small proportion
of the student body lives in the town and lodging is unavailable for the re-
mainder. In the circumstances, provision would be made for some boarding
and/or staff housing in all the project institutions since they are expected
to recruit students and teachers fronm a wide area. On the other hand, the
Northern States' overall policies with respect to boarding and staff housing
particularly in regard to the main urban centers, may need to be revised in
light of the proposed expansion of secondary education in the rural areas
and the high costs of secondary education and primary teacher training.
Accordingly, the State Governments have agreed to review the basis for exist-
ing boarding and staff housing policies, the findings of which would be sub-
mitted to the Bank for review within two years of the signing of the Loan
Agreement. Since it is possible that this review may result in modifications
to the schedule of accommodation for boarding and staff housing presently
included in the project, disbursement for boarding and staff housing would be
conditioned upon confirmation of the need for the accommodation proposed for
each project institution concerned. Eventual savings resulting from such
revision would become eligible for re-allocation, in agreement with the Bank,
for additional secondary school construction.
Project Costs and Financing :Plan
42.       The total project cost is estimated to be $107.4 million, including
a foreign exchange component of $50.9 million. Detailed costs are given in
Annex III. The proposed $54 million loan will finance the entire foreign



- 13 -
exchange cost and up to $3.1 million of local costs representing the local
component of the ex-factory cost of furniture contracts which may be awarded
to local manufacturers. The Federal Government would finance the local cost
and relend the proceeds of the loan to the six state Governments on the same
terms as the Bank loan. The amount allocated out of the Bank loan to the
Ahmadu Bello University will be made available as a grant from the Federal
Government.
Project Administration
43.       A full-time project director, reporting to the Permanent Secretary,
Federal Ministry of Education, and with qualifications acceptable to the Bank,
will be responsible for project implementation. His function will be to
supervise the implementation and financial control of the project, maintain
liaison with the Bank and coordinate the work of the six project units to be
established in the Ministries of Education in each of the six States and that
of responsible authorities of Ahmadu Bello University. It is expected that
the project director for the second education project would fulfill these
functions with appropriate additional support. Each State project unit will
be headed by a project manager, responsible to the State Permanent Secretary
of Education, and with qualifications acceptable to the Bank. Under the
guidance of the project director, each project manager will supervise and
coordinate project implementation at the State level. The project units will
be provided with adequate supporting staff and their local operating costs
met by the Federal and each State government.
44.       A firm of consultant architects will assist the project managers
in surveying project schools, developing standardized design guides and pre-
paring bid packages for construction, furniture and equipment. Space require-
ments, design and building standards, developed in the first and second educa-
tion projects (Credit 72-UNI and Loan 814-UNI) will be applied wherever feasi-
ble to economize on professional fees and to speed implementation. The process
of selecting a consultant firm satisfactory to the Bank is now under way and
signature of its contract with the Federal Government is a condition of ef-
fectiveness of the proposed loan. Ministries' of Works architects or local
private architects will design the individual school, college and university
buildings, using design guides developed by the consultant firm.
Procurement
45.       Contracts for civil works, equipment and furniture will be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines. All civil works contracts are expected to be won by Nigerian
firms or by foreign companies already working in Nigeria; most of the furni-
ture is expected to be supplied locally but equipment will come largely from
overseas. Domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment will be accorded
a preference in bid comparison equal to the prevailing duty on competing im-
ports or 15 percent of their c.i.f. price, whichever is lower.



- 14 -
Disbursement
46.       The proposed loan wi:ll be disbursed against the c.i.f. price of
imported furniture and equipment or the ex-factory price of locally manufac-
tured furniture and equipment, 44 percent of the cost of civil works, 48 per-
cent of the cost of professional fees and project units and 80 percent of the
cost of technical assistance, representing the estimated foreign exchange
component. The draft Loan Agreement provides for withdrawals in respect of
expenditures on architectural fees and project administration incurred after
March 1, 1973 in an aggregate amount not exceeding $100,000.
PAU V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTIiORITY
47.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and the Bank, the draft Project Agreements between the Bank and each State
and between the Balk and Ahmadu Bello University, the Report of the Coimittee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan have been distributed
separately.   Tihe draft agreemenits conform to the normal pattern for loans for
education projects.
48.        1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOM}IENDATION
4'.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Loan 705-UNI Nigerian Industrial Development Bank; US$ 10.0 million
Loan of August 28, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1974
6.        WithdrawTals under Loan 705-UNI have been slower than expected during
the last year, owing to cancellation of sub-project loan commitments and
reduced forecasts of new commitments. One factor in this connection is the
Government's policy to increase indigenous ownership in selected industrial
categories (the Nigerian Enterprises Promotion Decree) which, at least
temporarily, may direct domestic funds towards existing, rather than new,
enterprises and investment. These developments are currently under review
wi th NIDB.
Loan 764-UNI Western Cocoa Project: US$ 7.2 million
Loan of June 23, 1971; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
7.        Due to delav in establishment of Cocoa Development Unit only
about 65 percent of first year planting target was achieved.   However, ex*c:c:!
progress has been made in nursery development and planting materials wil]] bD
available to fulfill the 1973 target and the 1972 backlog.
Loan 614-UNI Second Education Project; US$ 17.3 million

S.        While the Second Education Loan (81h-UNI), approved April 1,-" 197?
did nct become effective until November 2U, 1972 owing to delays in connection
with the preparation of the legal coinion, this did not affect the initial
physical implementation of the project, which is proceeding satisfactorily.

1;,.     ;1,hile the date by which this loan was to have beccnie effective,
December 29, 1972 has been postponed twice to June 29, 1973, the substantive
conditions of effectiveness - namely the appointment of NEPA's General Manager
the signature of a management assistance contract and, more recently, she
finalization of the NEPA Loan Assumption Agreement - have been fulfMlTed.
Accordingly, the loan is expected to become effective very shortly, fcllo:ii
submission of the necessary legal opinions.
