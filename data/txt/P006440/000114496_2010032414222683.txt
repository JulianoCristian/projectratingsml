SCHEDULE 2
Description of the Project
The objectives of the Project are to improve public health by reducing 
industrial air, water and solid waste pollution within the State and to 
strengthen SEMA and selected SEPAS, including CETESB, by developing these 
agencies operational and technical capabilities to design and implement 
integrated long-term industrial pollution control strategies and programs within 
their respective jurisdiction.
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications 
thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve 
such objectives:
Part A:
Sao Paulo Component
 
1.
A program for the identification and preparation of Pollution Control 
Sub-projects, and for the carrying out of Pollution Control Sub-projects for 
which Sub-loans have been approved, or in respect of which disbursements from 
the Loan Account have been authorized. The Sub-projects will be carried out 
through Investment Enterprises operating within the State which: (i) in order to 
comply with the State Pollution Control Legislation and, when applicable, with 
any specific pollution control strategy agreed from time to time between the 
Bank and CETESB for purposes of the Project, undertake industrial pollution 
control activities such as: (a) the treatment or pre-treatment of their 
effluents and emission discharges, or (b) the substantial change of their 
technological or productive processes or (c) the disposal of their industrial 
solid or liquid wastes, or (d) other environmental industrial pollution control 
activities; or (ii) are required by CETESB to relocate, or relocate voluntarily 
contributing by such relocation, if so determined by CETESB, to pollution 
control, or (iii) provide industrial solid waste disposal services' (other than 
ordinary garbage collection services) to third parties.
2.
A program for the identification, preparation and carrying out of 
Page  16
Technical Assistance Sub-projects approved by the Bank and by CETESB such as: 
(i) acquisition and utilization of specific and specialized, training, 
monitoring and laboratory analysis equipment; (ii) applied research and studies 
in fields of biological and toxic treatment, hazardous risk assessment and cost 
benefit analysis of pollution control solutions; and (iii) training of staff 
from industrial enterprises and CETESB in various pollution control subjects. 
Part B:
Federal Component
 
This component will be carried out in respect of several of the Borrower's 
States, other than Sao Paulo, as selected by SEMA from time to time, and of 
SEMA, and in cooperation with the corresponding SEPA. It will include: (i) the 
acquisition by SEMA, and utilization by the SEPA in question, of equipment for 
laboratories and monitoring programs; (ii) the execution of diagnostic studies 
to determine the nature and extent of industrial pollution problems in the State 
in question, with recommendations for control strategies and to assess the 
operational capabilities of each State's SEPA; (iii) the assessment of training 
resources available in the State in question and in the corresponding SEPA; (iv) 
design of technical assistance programs to help each State's SEPA achieve its 
operational objectives; (v) execution of technical assistance programs to 
develop the capabilities in pollution control of SEMA and selected SEPAs other 
than CETESB; and (vi) development by SEMA of appropriate incentives for 
investments in pollution control solutions.
SCHEDULE 3
CESA and FESA Accounts
1.
For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(a)
the term "Categories" means a category of items to be financed out 
of the proceeds of the Loan pursuant to paragraph (d) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement;
(b)
the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect of 
the reasonable cost of goods and services required for the Project and to be 
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the 
eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement; and
(c)
the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to not 
more than $5,000,000 and to not more than $300,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan 
Account and deposited in the CESA and FESA, respectively, pursuant to paragraph 
3 (a) of this Schedule.
2.
Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, payments out of CESA or FESA, as 
the case may be, shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures in 
accordance with the provisions of this Schedule. The Account Bank shall 
authorize withdrawals from the CESA or FESA, as the case may be, on the basis of 
the evidence that the Bank shall have reasonably determined. For each such 
withdrawal so authorized, the Account Bank shall debit or cause to be debited 
CESA or FESA, as the case may be, with the dollar equivalent of the amount of 
the eligible expenditures in question in cruzados, in the case of CESA, or with 
the actual dollar amount or the dollar equivalent of the eligible expenditures 
in currencies other than dollars or cruzados, in the case of FESA.
3.
After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it that CESA or FESA, 
as the case may be, and their corresponding Sub-accounts for Parts A and B of 
the Project have been duly opened, withdrawals of the corresponding Authorized 
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish CESA or FESA, as the case may 
be, may be made as follows: 
(a)
on the basis of a request or requests by the Borrower for a deposit 
or deposits which add up to the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation, 
the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account and 
deposit in CESA or FESA, as the case may be, for the crediting of the 
corresponding Sub-account for Part A or Part B of the Project, such amount or 
Page  17
amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)
The Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for replenishment 
of CESA and FESA, as the case may be, at such intervals as the Bank shall 
specify. On the basis of such requests, the Bank shall withdraw from the Loan 
Account and deposit into CESA or FESA, for the crediting of the corresponding 
Sub-account for Part A or Part B of the Project, such amounts as shall be 
required to replenish CESA or FESA, as the case may be, with amounts not 
exceeding the amount of payments made out of CESA or FESA, as the case may be, 
for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from 
the Loan Account in the respective equivalent amounts as shall have been 
justified by the evidence supporting the request for such deposit furnished 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule. 
4.
For each payment made by the Borrower out of CESA or FESA, for which the 
Borrower requests replenishment pursuant to paragraph 3 (b) of this Schedule, 
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to or at the time of such request, 
such documents and other evidence as the Bank shall reasonably request, showing 
that such payment was made for eligible expenditures.
5.
(a)
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the 
Bank may deny any request for further deposits into CESA or FESA when either of 
the following situations arises:
(i)
the Bank shall have determined that all further withdrawals 
should be made by 
the Borrower directly from the Loan Account in 
accordance with the provisions 
of Article V of the General 
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of 
this 
Agreement; or
(ii)
the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the 
eligible 
Categories, in respect of Part A or Part 
B of the Project, as the case may be, 
minus the amount of any 
outstanding special commitment entered into by the 
Bank 
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the 
corresponding Part of the Project, shall be equal to the equivalent of 
twice 
the amount of the Authorized Allocation credited to the 
corresponding 
Sub-account of CESA or FESA, as the case 
may be.
(b)
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining 
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow 
such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such 
further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank 
shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in CESA or 
FESA, as the case may be, as of the date of such notice, will be utilized in 
making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.
(a)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out 
of CESA or FESA (i) was made for any expenditure or in any amount not eligible 
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule, or (ii) was not justified by the 
evidence furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall, 
promptly upon notice from the Bank, deposit into the corresponding Subaccount of 
CESA or FESA, as the case may be, (or, if the Bank shall so request, refund to 
the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof 
not so eligible or justified. No further deposit by the Bank into CESA or FESA 
shall be made until the Borrower shall have made such deposit or refund.
(b)
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in CESA or FESA will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, 
refund to the Bank such outstanding amount for crediting to the Loan Account and 
immediate cancellation.
