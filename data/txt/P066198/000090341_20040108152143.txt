3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:


The context. Mauritius has been aiming to diversify its economy away from sugar and textiles.
Becoming a regional trading hub and a major center of financial services are two interlinked goals
of Mauritian policy makers in this diversification process. Mauritius has also been trying to
improve its macroeconomic management tools as its developmental goals can only be attained
within a stable macroeconomic environment.

Objectives. The project aimed to: (i) build essential financial system infrastructure to facilitate the
secure, rapid and certain transfer of funds; and (ii) assist in the creation of an institutional
framework to better manage government's debt.

Assessment. The objectives of the project were consistent with Mauritius's overall development
goals and the Bank's Country Assessment Strategy (CAS).              These objectives were also
interlinked. A well-functioning payment and settlement system facilitates government's interaction
of financial markets and enhances efficiency of debt management.

Each component posed two very different sets of challenges. The payment system component
required all the stakeholders to act in unison in accordance with very strict timetable whereas the
debt and cash management component required adaptive responses to the evolving political
economy. The design of the project took into account these considerations. The Payment System
component was defined with greater detail and specificity while Debt and Cash Management
component was broadly defined with ample room to maneuver during implementation.

The project was designed with significant preparatory work which was carried out by Mauritian
Authorities in close collaboration with Bank staff. The project was to be implemented by the
Ministry of Finance (Debt and Cash Management component) and the Bank of Mauritius
(Payment System component).         The operational demands on implementing agencies were
carefully assessed during appraisal and appropriate technical assistance was included in the project
to support implementation. Both of these institutions had the competence and resources to carry
out project implementation.

The project's objectives were validated by the recently completed joint Bank-Fund Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The FSAP noted that the payment system installed by the
project is an essential part of Mauritius's financial sector infrastructure. The FSAP also noted
that improving the efficiency of government's debt management is critical for the development of
capital markets in Mauritius. The FSAP indicated that the work initiated by this project has set
the right course for Mauritius.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The objectives of the project have not been revised.

3.3 Original Components:

The project originally contained two components: a) Payment System; b) Government Cash and
Debt Management.

Component 1: Payment System ($4.0 million)

This component is designed in three parts: a) Computer Based Application Software; b) Project
Support; and c) Computer and Telecommunications Equipment. The design of these components
were clearly linked to the project's objective of building a funds transfer mechanism which is
secure, instantenous and certain.

Component 2: Government Cash and Debt Management ($1.68 million)

This component contained two stages of technical assistance to build an institutional framework
to better manage public debt. The first stage was essentially a comprehensive stock-taking
exercise on the existing systems as well as laying out options to build a better debt and cash
management systems. The second stage was conceived to be the stage to lay foundations of an
effective debt and cash management systems by creating the institutional framework to develop a
modern debt management system.

Assessment of Design of Project Components. The design of each component is markedly
different due to the nature of the components. The payment system component provides a clear
implementation road map. The design of this component includes all the necessary elements for
building an efficient payment system. It should be noted that the design of this component
encompasses      not   only    hardware   and    software   requirements     of    an    automated
real-time-gross-settlement (RTGS) type payment system but provision of necessary technical
support to Bank of Mauritius to ensure successful implementation.

The Government Debt and Cash Management component does not offer a detailed road map for
implementation. It provides an outline of a strategy to build a better cash and debt management
system over time. The design of this component contains three essential dimensions of building
such systems: a) understanding of existing mechanisms of issuing and managing government debt
and managing government cash; b) informing key policy makers on the best practices in the
world; and c) describing necessary institutional changes required to establish state-of-the art debt
and cash management systems.

The two components are also mutually supportive.        Maximum efficiency in debt and cash
management systems could not be attained without a well functioning real time payment and
settlement systems. Furthermore, government's integration in financial markets through a well



                                               - 3 -

functioning payment and settlement system enhances the quality of interaction between
government and financial markets. Likewise, government's participation in any payment and
settlement system enhances the credibility of that system. Moreover, government's participation
in any payment system, especially in developing economies, substantially increases volume in that
system.

3.4 Revised Components:

The project's main framework was kept intact. However, a portion of the loan was cancelled due
to: a) savings realized during the competitive bidding process for the payment system; b) a
greater utilization of existing IT equipment and software for the debt and cash management
component; c) utilization of software provided by bilateral donors; and d) postponing training
programs due to delays in staffing of the debt management unit.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

The project was reviewed by a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Quality at Entry Panel. The
QAG Panel's overall assessment was satisfactory. The QAG panel rated the project's concept,
objectives, approach and implementation arrangements as "Best Practice" and innovative. The
QAG also noted the following strong aspects of the project: a ) emphasis on institution and
capacity building; b) two-stage design of debt and cash management component; c) high-quality
background technical work on debt management; and d) highly qualified task team. The QAG
panel noted that the project document should have better articulated linkages between debt
management systems and payment system as well as better presentation of financial management
aspects of the project. The panel indicated that the project helped to underscore the positive
effects of strong borrower ownership. The QAG also noted that the project demonstrated how a
well qualified and cohesive team can put together a good operation with very limited budgetary
resources.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

Achievement of objectives of the project was satisfactory. Key policy and institutional reforms
supported by the project have all been met. Mauritius now has a world class state-of-the-art
RTGS. This system provides necessary infrastructure to pursue Mauritius's developmental goal of
establishing an internationally recognized financial services industry.    This modern payment
system is an effective macroeconomic management tool which helps government better monitor
and manage its debt and cash.

The project also facilitated creation of an institutional framework for a modern debt management
system. This institutional framework includes an independent and dedicated debt management
unit at the Ministry of Finance and two high-level steering committees comprising all the key
officers from Bank of Mauritius and the Ministry of Finance. Creation of this institutional
structure was a result of: a) a detailed analysis of the existing mechanisms; b) review of best
practices around the world; and c) assessment of Mauritian circumstances.

4.2 Outputs by components:


Payment System Component. This component aimed to install a modern RTGS system in
Mauritius. The system was installed succesfully. This component is rated as Highly Satisfactory.
It is now considered as best practice by payment system specialists and experts. The main output
of this component is the building of MACSS (Mauritius Automated Clearing and Settlement
System). This output is highly consistent with the project's objectives and country's developmental
goals and financial sector policies. Furthermore, MACSS became especially valuable given the
recent emphasis on recording and monitoring funds flow to combat money-laundering and illicit
activities around the world.

Having a real-time gross settlement system made Mauritius one of the leading financial systems in
the SADC region. MACSS also helped Mauritius to pursue its developmental goals in the
financial services industry. MACSS is providing a number of benefits. Among these are: a) it
enhances the efficiency of Mauritius's financial sector; b) it supports Mauritius's pursuit of
becoming an international financial center by providing a modern payment system mechanism; and
c) it reinforces Mauritius's international standing by giving domestic regulators a powerful
capability to monitor financial transactions. The last point became very important given the recent
world-wide emphasis on anti-money laundering and prevention of financing of terrorism. The
recent FSAP noted the importance of having systems to combat money laundering and terrorist
financing. A real-time modern payment system would facilitate compliance with international
norms and, standards in this regard and enhance the international legitimacy of Mauritius financial
system. Therefore, output of this component was highly relevant to specific objectives of the
project and the country's current developmental goals.

The project's payment system component was implemented in record time and without problems.
The system has been working as well as any such system in developed countries since its
installation. This system has attracted significant attention from other African countries as a
number of delegations visited Mauritius to observe the functioning of MACSS as well as to
discuss the implementation process. Experience gained in implementing this component enabled
the Bank of Mauritius to take a leading role in SADC's regional payment system initiative.

The implementation success was mainly due to the design of this component. The main features
of this design were: a) simplified procurement process; b) increased accountability of vendors;
and c) provision of technical assistance to Bank of Mauritius during the implementation process.
In order to simplify procurement process and ensure highest degree of accountability of vendors
as well as provision of technical support to Bank of Mauritius, a "turn-key" delivery approach was
adopted. With this approach a single contractor was chosen to deliver, install and test essential
system software, and train and assist Bank of Mauritius's technical staff. In addition, Bank of
Mauritius agreed to use World Bank's reimbursable technical assistance to supervise the
installation process.

Government Debt and Cash Management. This component aimed to: a) identify existing
problems in managing government debt; b) create an awareness of problems related to managing
government among key institutions and policy makers; c) seek out options to establish modern



                                                - 5 -

debt management systems; d) determine the most appropriate option for Mauritius and prepare a
strategy to implement it; and e) create an institutional framework to implement the desired
strategy. All of these objectives were realized and this component is rated as "Satisfactory".

The inefficiency in managing government debt and its implications for fiscal and monetary policies
as well as financial sector development were largely unnoticed in Mauritius prior to this project.
Moreover, the Ministry of Finance had no specific and explicit instrument to identify and minimize
the risks in managing government debt and corresponding costs. Various debt management
related data were kept by different departments and institutions, and no analytical work regarding
risk and cost implications of the public debt portfolio was being conducted. Consequently, policy
makers did not have the objective of overhauling the government's debt management systems on
their agenda. Neither the Fund nor the Bank had paid much attention to this issue prior to this
project.

The sector work which was carried out during preparation stage of the project and subsequent
discussions laid out the extent of the problems related to public debt management in Mauritius. It
was demonstrated that the existing debt management systems had serious conflicts of interest
between monetary and fiscal policy objectives. The existing system - which relied on the central
bank treasury instruments - placed the entire burden of monetary policy on fiscal balances.
Short-term interest rate and exchange rate targets ignored the efficiency of debt management and
the longer term capital market development objective. As a result, excessive treasury bills with
shorter term maturity were being issued and government carried excessive non-renumarated
balances with the Central Bank.

This component facilitated a comprehensive review of the existing debt and cash management
systems in Mauritius during the first stage. All the key public and private institutions and policy
makers were involved in this review process. In addition, this component provided extensive
information on best practices from around the world to key policy makers and stake holders. In
the light of this extensive information, inherent inefficiencies in the current system of managing
government debt were highlighted. Consequently, the project started and facilitated a dialogue
between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Mauritius on their respective roles in managing
government debt and cash. The key outcome of these discussions was the understanding of
conflicting roles and interest between the implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. A
formal mechanism (in the form of debt management steering committee) to manage these conflicts
was set up. The Bank of Mauritius and the Ministry of Finance signed a Memorandum of
Understanding regarding the treasury bill issuance process. The Bank of Mauritius also agreed to
pay some interest on a part of the government balances which were the result of issuing treasury
instruments solely for monetary policy purposes by Bank of Mauritius. This arrangement will
continue, perhaps with modifications, until the debt management unit is equipped to take over the
process of issuing treasury debt instruments.

The second stage of the component created the institutional framework to establish modern debt
management systems. Based on the review of existing systems and best practices around the
world, the Government of Mauritius decided to set up a separate department within the Ministry
of Finance to manage government's debt. Some staff from the Department of Public Finance and



                                                - 6 -

Accountant General's office were transferred to this newly created department. An external
recruitment effort was launched for the director position. The newly established department and
the debt management steering committee mentioned above now constitute the institutional
framework to build further capacity and establish state-of-the-art public debt management
systems. This institutional framework was created after reaching a consensus between the Bank
of Mauritius and the Ministry of Finance.        Such a consensus, given the starting point, is
remarkable and demonstrates the increased appreciation of the issues by key institutions.

Besides creation of the institutional framework, significant amount of work was done to: (i)
analyze the existing portfolio of debt; and (ii) prepare computer based data bases for further
analytical work. As a result of analytical work, primary risks in managing debt were identified.
Also, preliminary benchmarks for maturity structure and currency composition were developed.
Developed databases within the debt management unit include: (i) the level, composition and
maturity of government debt and the main components; (ii) the level and composition of the
foreign currency debt of the Mauritius economy (public and private sector); (iii) nominal and cash
values of debt outstanding; (iv) debt interest costs, categorized by borrowing type; (v) auction
results; and (vi) major macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, exports, inflation, reserves.

While the project focused on the above activities, fiscal management in general and debt
management related issues in particular became the central focus of the Bank's policy dialogue
and other operations. The government debt and its management became the central themes of the
PERL operation and the recent PER. The FSAP also validated these concerns and identified debt
management as a priority area. This component thus succeeded in raising the profile of debt
management as a key policy issue at a critical period in time, and created an institutional
framework for dealing with it. However, establishing debt management systems is a long term
process. Even in more developed countries, the creation of dedicated debt management systems,
which are capable of adapting to changing market conditions and new instruments, takes years to
develop.

The allocation for study tours for debt management staff was not utilized nor was the allocation
for acquisition of hardware and software. This was mainly due to delays in: a) setting up the debt
management unit; and b) recruiting staff. Delays such as these are not unusual in countries where
government debt was not actively managed. The tours can easily be organized by the Ministry of
Finance when the staff of the debt management unit are ready.

Acquisition of computer hardware and software for debt and cash management purposes became
unnecessary as Ministry of Finance and the Accountant General's Office provided computers to
the newly established debt management office. In addition, Mauritius obtained the newest version
of debt recording and monitoring software from the Commonwealth Secretariat free of charge.
This software is sufficient for current needs and it was prudent not to purchase more sophisticated
systems. IT technology changes rapidly and systems become obsolete in a relatively short time.
Well managed institutions make every effort to avoid over-investment in IT. By making a realistic
assessment of existing equipment and freely available resources, Mauritius avoided
over-investment in this area.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

The project made a substantial impact on institutional development in Mauritius. It created
sustainable new institutions and redefined existing institutional relations. The payment system
component created a well functioning and sustainable automated clearing and settlement system
(MACSS). MACSS now has become the main payment system platform where large value
transactions are being carried out, and is enabling financial institutions to better manage
settlement risk and liquidity. It enhances efficiency of the financial system, and ultimately benefits
the real sector by enabling firms and individuals to transfer large sums instantaneously.           It
provides a powerful macroeconomic management tool to government.                     With MACSS,
government has also an instantaneous link for interacting with financial markets.

The project facilitated the important reform of the government's debt and cash management
systems. Mauritius now is in the process of moving responsibility of the issuing of treasury bills
from the Bank of Mauritius to the Ministry of Finance. A new department was created in the
Ministry of Finance to take over this responsibility as well as actively manage government's debt.
This process will undoubtedly help to deepen capital markets and enhance the overall efficiency of
the financial sector. In addition to the creation of the new debt management unit, a coordination
mechanism        between Ministry of Finance and Bank of Mauritius to support a new debt
management structure was created. While the new debt management unit is in the process of
building its human and technological resources, an interim arrangement was agreed. Under this
arrangement, the relationship between the Bank of Mauritius and the Ministry of Finance
regarding issuance of Treasury instruments and keeping excess balances has been redefined. The
Bank of Mauritius agreed to pay some interest on part of the government balances which were
directly a result of treasury bills issued solely for monetary policy purposes.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

There were many factors outside the control of government which affected implementation. The
majority of these were related to the Payment System component. Performance of the system
vendor, failure of system software, failure in getting financial institutions linked to the system,
problems in telecommunication systems were among the key factors that could have adversely
affected the outcome. All of these factors were mentioned as risk factors in the PAD. These risks
were successfully mitigated by: i) selecting a capable vendor and providing close project support
to the Bank of Mauritius; ii) defining business requirements and performance criteria well in



                                                     - 8 -

advance so that the system software could be sufficiently customized ahead of installation; iii)
securing a high level commitment from financial institutions; iv) setting up a committee of chief IT
professionals to monitor installation of the system and synchronizing their internal efforts with the
installation process at the Bank of Mauritius; and v) closely working with the telecommunication
company to set up secure and reliable communication linkages.

Major factors outside of government control regarding the debt and cash management component
were mainly related to the government's ability to attract high quality professionals for the debt
management unit. It was quite difficult for government to compete with commercial banks in a
field where skills are scarce in Mauritius. In order to compete with banks, government showed
flexibility in offering contractual agreements with competitive salaries. However, the need to
adhere to broader civil service requirements and the uncertainty of the career path in the
short-term discouraged many qualified people from applying.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

The following key factors were subject to government control: i) securing close coordination
between various governmental entities; ii) ensuring an orderly procurement process; iii) ensuring
that the legal and regulatory basis of the payment and settlement system is in place; iv) planning
the intra-day facility to financial institutions for liquidity support and introduction of such a
facility; v) providing necessary environment and support to consultants and vendors; vi)
establishing a dialogue with financial institutions and the private sector on project's goals and
creating a high degree of awareness; vii) allowing sufficient discussion and debate on various
options with the key stakeholders and providing effective leadership in creating an atmosphere of
collective ownership of the project. The Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Mauritius were very
successful in mitigating risks associated with these.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

The project's implementing agencies were the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Mauritius. Section
5.2 above covers this topic.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The project's main structure has not been changed. However, a part of the loan was cancelled due
to: i) savings as a result of competitive bidding for the payment system component; ii) utilization
of software provided by the Commonwealth Secretariat for debt management and using existing
computers in Ministry of Finance and the Accountant General Office; and iii) canceling of study
tours abroad.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

The project's sustainability is rated highly likely. MACSS has already become the main payment
system mechanism in Mauritius. All the key stakeholders, government, the Bank of Mauritius and
financial institutions, are now relying on MACSS as their main vehicle for large value



                                                     - 9 -

transactions. The Bank of Mauritius and financial institutions have developed sufficient capacity
to sustain operations of MACSS and Mauritius is offering its capacity in this respect to other
SADC countries. There is no doubt that the system will continue to perform at current levels of
efficiency for the foreseeable future.        More importantly, the capacity created is capable of
updating the system as the environment changes.

Debt management efforts will also continue in the future as the debt management unit has now
become an official department of the Ministry of Finance.       Moreover, Government has already
demonstrated that it wants to continue to receive state-of-the-art advice in this field and has asked
an internationally recognized expert who was involved in the second stage consultancy to
continue to provide advice after the project is closed. The agreement between the Ministry of
Finance and the Bank of Mauritius regarding excess treasury issues, and treatment of resulting
government balances with the Bank of Mauritius is a good indication that the nature of the debt
management process has drastically changed in Mauritius.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

The Bank's performance during the lending process was satisfactory. Extensive analysis of needs
was conducted during the preparation stage of the project. An intensive dialogue with the
financial institutions took place. A careful evaluation of available options was made. A technical
analysis of existing debt and cash management arrangements was done. Lessons from past
experiences were also considered. As a result of this, the project was designed in such a way that
it ensured a speedy installation of a modern real-time gross settlement while operational flexibility
for the debt and cash management component was built in. Project risks were carefully identified
and mitigation factors were outlined in the project's appraisal document. Noting the need for close
supervision of implementation of the payments system component, significant advance planning
was made to ensure necessary and timely project support.

7.2 Supervision:

The supervision of the project was satisfactory. The project contained an innovative supervision
arrangement. Bank of Mauritius entered into a reimbursable technical assistance arrangement
with IBRD. Under this arrangement, IBRD provided technical expertise and project support to
monitor installation of the payments system and to facilitate dialogue between Bank of Mauritius,
vendor and financial institutions. This arrangement was the key to the success of the payment
system component.

The debt and cash management component was a difficult and sensitive undertaking as it required
fundamental changes to the arrangements for the implementation of monetary policy. Supervision



                                                  - 10 -

was focused on keeping the forward momentum and making sure that all key actors reached the
same long term vision. Implementation of this component had to be slowed down during the
elections. This was necessary as the key decisions such as creation of a new department and
hiring of senior staff inevitably required political commitment. In order to secure high level
political commitments, it was prudent not to preempt options of the new government and to wait
for the political process to take its course.

It should also be noted that the same Task Team Leader who prepared the project supervised it
from beginning to the end.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

The Bank's overall performance was rated satisfactory. Activities leading up to the project's
preparation and implementation were relevant. The Country Team provided sufficient resources
for these activities. The Sector Manager and the Country Director provided necessary support to
the Task Team. The Task Team followed the implementation process in a very cooperative
atmosphere with the Borrower. Close and cooperative working relations with the Borrower was
one of the key factors that created the foundation for the PERL. The disbursement process was
smooth and no major problems were encountered.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Given the limited capacity that existed in the payment systems and debt management areas, the
Bank's technical staff provided substantial support for the preparation. The Bank of Mauritious
and the Ministry of Finance provided all the data that were needed for analytical purposes. They
also facilitated dialogue with financial institutions and the private sector.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Mauritius worked closely with the Bank's Task Team during
the implementation process.       They created an excellent environment which was frank and
mutually respectful for the implementation of the project and monitoring its progress.
Procurement was carried out smoothly and transparently. The Borrower observed IBRD's
guidelines and the provisions of the project's legal agreement. All the necessary actions to
implement the project were taken by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Mauritius.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

Borrower is the implementing agency. See Sections 7.4 and 7.5 above.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

The Borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory. The Borrower maintained sufficient
commitment to the project from the very beginning.             The Borrower followed through the
implementation plan and took necessary actions.          The delays encountered in debt and cash
management were due to unforeseen circumstances. Nonetheless, the Borrower maintained the



                                                  - 11 -

direction with respect to debt and cash management under significantly different political
circumstances.     Thus, demonstrating that efficient debt and cash management systems are
essential to macroeconomic management and independent of the political power structure.

8. Lessons Learned

The project offers several valuable lessons:

   l High level commitment on the part of Government, Central Bank and financial institutions
        is essential for setting up systemically important payment systems;
   l Successful payment system initiatives require careful and detailed advance planning with
        participation of the key players;
   l Selecting a reputable vendor and proven systems are crucial for systemically important
        payment systems;
   l Simplifying procurement process and making key vendor(s) responsible for the functioning
        of the payments system are essential;
   l Making arrangements for close project support and supervision of system installation are
        crucial in environments where technical resources are not readily available;
   l Financial institutions must have sufficient competence in their IT departments and their
        internal systems must be made ready to utilize a real-time gross settlement system;
   l Legal and regulatory underpinnings of payment system must be established ahead of the
        installation of the system;
   l Introduction of intra-day liquidity support facility is crucial for large value real time gross
        settlement systems;
   l A cooperative environment where vendor(s) staff, the Central Bank's IT department and
        IT professionals of financial institutions work in harmony must be created. Everybody
        must be conscious of the fact that the system could not work without a high degree of
        commitment and care of everyone involved;
   l Setting up state-of-the art government's debt and cash management systems is a long term
        process and expectations and targets must be modest in the short-term;
   l Reforming the process of government's debt management require a commonly shared
        vision by agents of both fiscal and monetary policy;
   l Establishing government debt management systems requires availability of minimum skills
        to get the system initiated in the first place;
   l Investment in IT platform must be synchronized with the needs;
   l Investment in IT systems that are beyond the current needs and the capacity of debt
        management staff must be avoided;
   l A high level frank and trusting environment for policy dialogue between key actors is
        essential in reforming government's debt management systems;
   l The process of reforming government's debt management systems must be cognizant of
        political dynamics;
   l Debt management systems should be reformed without causing any disturbance in
        financial markets in open market economies;
   l Continuity in Task Team Leadership is essential for successful implementation of projects.
        The continuity becomes especially important for projects that aim to reform institutions
        and institutional relations. These reforms require establishment of a mutually trusting

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

Project's benefits are very difficult to quantify. However the following points might be helpful in bringing
an analytical perspective to the benefits:

a) The RTGS system which cost about $2.5 million is handling about MUR 1.5 billion (about $55
million) a day. Total value handled represents significant reduction of settlement risks for the Bank of
Mauritius (a reduction of risk equivalent to 5% of BOM's total assets per day)

b) Commercial Banks no longer use the colletaral fund (which should have been about $0.3 billion) to
cover settlement risk at the Port Louis Clearing House. So, an amount about 10 times of the cost of RTGS
is available for commercial purposes within the banking system indicating substantial improvement in
liquidity management.

c) Government is now earning interest on excess treasury bills issued by the Bank of Mauritius. The
yearly interest will be about MRU 750 million. In the long run, a reduction of 30 basis points on overall
debt which is about MRU .5 billion a year is expected. In addition, substantial reduction in risks is
expected.
