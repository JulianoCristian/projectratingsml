The lessons learned indicate that high level\n            commitment on the part of Government, Central Bank and\n            financial institutions is essential for setting up\n            systemically important payment systems; successful payment\n            system initiatives require careful and detailed advance\n            planning with participation of the key players; selecting a\n            reputable vendor and proven systems are crucial for\n            systemically important payment systems; simplifying\n            procurement process and making key vendor(s) responsible for\n            the functioning of the payments system are essential; making\n            arrangements for close project support and supervision of\n            system installation are crucial in environments where\n            technical resources are not readily available; financial\n            institutions must have sufficient competence in their IT\n            departments and their internal systems must be made ready to\n            utilize a real-time gross settlement system; legal and\n            regulatory underpinnings of payment system must be\n            established ahead of the installation of the system;\n            introduction of intra-day liquidity support facility is\n            crucial for large value real time gross settlement systems;\n            a cooperative environment where vendor(s) staff, the Central\n            Bank's IT department and IT professionals of financial\n            institutions work in harmony must be created. Setting up\n            state-of-the art government's debt and cash management\n            systems is a long term process and expectations and targets\n            must be modest in the short-term; reforming the process of\n            government's debt management require a commonly shared\n            vision by agents of both fiscal and monetary policy;\n            establishing government debt management systems requires\n            availability of minimum skills to get the system initiated\n            in the first place; investment in IT platform must be\n            synchronized with the needs; investment in IT systems that\n            are beyond the current needs and the capacity of debt\n            management staff must be avoided; a high level frank and\n            trusting environment for policy dialogue between key actors\n            is essential in reforming government's debt management\n            systems; the process of reforming government's debt\n            management systems must be cognizant of political dynamics;\n            debt management systems should be reformed without causing\n            any disturbance in financial markets in open market\n            economies; continuity in Task Team Leadership is essential\n            for successful implementation of projects. The continuity\n            becomes especially important for projects that aim to reform\n            institutions and institutional relations."}, "docdt": "2003-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
