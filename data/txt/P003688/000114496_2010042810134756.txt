assistance and equipment support for the Regulatory Unit within the Ministry of 
Information, Broadcasting, Television and Telecommunications.

proposes to reallocate $350,000 equivalent from the unallocated category to new 
categories ($250,000) for technical assistance and training, and for testing equipment
