MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO FIJI
FOR A THIRD TELMCOMKWNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Fiji for US$8.1 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be
for a 17-year term with 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate and would help finance a telecommunications project. Parallel
project financing would be provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and
Australia through its commodities assistance support program (GAS).
2.        Background.  Telecommunications services in Fiji are provided by two
entities: the Posts and Telecommunications Department (P&T), a department of
the Ministry of Communications, Transport and Works, provides domestic
services, and FINTEL, a private company, 51% government-owned, provides
international service. P&T also regulates the sector. Fiji has 4.7 direct
exchange lines (DELs) per 100 population, about average for South Pacific
countries. However, service quality needs improvement and demand for
services, particularly from businesses and in rural areas, is not being met.
P&T's status as a government department constrains its commercial efficiency
because (a) civil service personnel procedures restrict P&T's ability to hire
and motivate skilled staff; (b) government procurement procedures restrict
P&T's ability to respond quickly to custcmer requirements; and (c) annual
budgetary approvals preclude long-term planning and affect financial planning
and procurement eificiency. As well, P&T staff lacks commercial awareness and
a service orientation. After reviewing options for increasing sector effi-
ciency, the Government has decided to separate regulatory and operational
functions and to restructure P&T as a fully state-owned company established
under the Companies Act, in the process providing the option for future
private-sector participation. Given Government's decision, the proposed
project will focus on (a) establishing a policy and regulatory framework that
will provide incentives to entities in the sector to operate efficiently and
in line with government objectives, (b) taking prompt action to ease
managerial and technical constraints witlhin P&T during and after the
restructuring period, (c) ensuring a smooth transition from a government
department to a Companies Act company, and (d) ensuring adequate investment in
the network over the next five years to improve the quality of and access to
service.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The geographical dispersion within
Pacific Islands countries and the high proportion of the population in rural
areas make availability of efficient telecommunications services a high
priority. The Bank's sector strategy is to ensure efficient operation and
cost-effective development of the telecommunications infrastructure by
supporting improvements in the operating environment and institutional
efficiency of companies in the sector. Previous Bank operations in Fiji in
1972 and 1976 helped to expand basic services, strengthen P&T's project
implementation capacity and increase its financial autonomy. The proposed
project responds to Government's request for further Bank assistance to
explore options to increase sector efficiency Including policy, regulatory and



-2-
institutional reform, to implemant required changes, and to support
modernization and ex-,ansion of the infrastructure. During project
preparation, the Bank has helped Government review sector options. A Bank
paper outlining institutional alternatives contributed to Government's
decision to restructure P&T. A project preparation facility (PPF) of
US$450,000 is providing consultant assistance (para. 5). Continued Bank
support for the sector during and after restructuring is important to the
success of the Government's reform efforts.
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project, building on the
institutional and infrastructural base established under earlier Bank loans,
aims to improve the institutional environment of operating entities and build
the infrastructure, thereby improving availability of and access to modern
telecommunications services in Fiji. The project will (a) assist the
Government of Fiji to decide on and implement revised sector policies and
regulations, (b) help P&T evolve from a government department to a commercial
entity, and (c) help finance P&T's 1990-94 development program. The program
would allow connection of 15,000 new subscribers and extend services to rural
communities currently without service.
5.        Prolect DescriDtion.  Consultant assistance under the Bank PPF has
helped the Government to draft a sector policy paper, redraft legislation,
draft the company operating license and will help prepare a restructuring plan
for P&T with the objective of making the new company operational by late 1989.
The proposed project would (a) provide further technical assistance to help
build the managerial and technical capabilities essential for P&T's operation
as a commercial entity, including managerial training and a 'twinning
arrangement" to provide line staff and staff training, and (b) help finance
P&T's 1990-94 development program which includes iiivestments in switching
equipment and associated cables, distribution network, transmission
facilities, civil works for construction of buildings, computer software and
hardware facilities to establish computerized information systems, and
miscellaneous items. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$47.9 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$30.1 mil-
lion (63%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Fiji are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7548-FIJ dated April 14, 1989, is being distributed separately.
6.        Agreed Actions.  Submission to the Bank of a detailed implementation
plan for restructuring P&T and making arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
with a twinning organization would be conditions of loan effectiveness.
Establishment of the new company would be a condition of disbursement for
cable contracts. During negotiations the following agreements were reached:
(a) the Government will take all necessary measures to facilitate restructur-
ing of the telecommunications sector by November 30, 1989; (b) the Government
will cause the new company (the restructured P&T) to be established in
accordance with an implementation plan, satisfactory to the Bank, and will
enter into an on-lending and operating agreement with the company,
satisfactory to the Bank, that will include provisions for on-lending loan
funds from the Government to the new company on commercial terms and project



specific conditions (including financial and performance targets) originally
applicable to P&T; and (c) field demand surveys for exchange areas included in
the 1990/91 investment program to be completed by December 1989 and targets
for completing surveys required for later years to be established jointly with
the Bank during project implementation. Financial covenants require
maintaining a current ratio (excluding inventories) of not ]ess than 1.2,
debt-ser-ice coverage of not less than 1.5, and a rate of ruturn on average
net revalued fixed assets in operation of not less than 9%. Additionally,
operating performance targets for 1989 and 1990 were agreed with P&T.
7.        Benefits.  The institutional reform supported by the project will
result in more efficient use of resc-urces in the telecommunications sector and
increased transfers to Government. Economic benefits are expected to accrue
throughout the economy, in particular to emerging businesses in nontraditional
sectors and the tourist industry, through greater access to modern telecom-
munications services. Expansion of services to villages in rural areas and
outer islands will improve productivity of these communities through greater
access to market information and better coordination of transportation.
8.        Risks.  Possible project risks are (a) major delays in implementing
restructuring, (b) disruption of P&T's operations during the transition, and
(c) delays in identifying a qualified managerial team. To minimize the first
risk, a high-level steering committee has been established with working-level
support to oversee the process. The demonstrated strong commitment of both
Government and P&T to rapid change further minimizes the risk. To minimize
the second risk, major emphasis will be placed on personnel issues including
management training and development, and interim personnel policies to allow
smooth transfer of staff. To mitigate the third risk, a project coordinator
will help fill the managerial gap and support senior management in the event
of delays in identifying suitable candidates to fill key positions in the new
organization. There are no unusual risks associated with the physical
components of the project.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
