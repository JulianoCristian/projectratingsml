Some\n            lessons learned included: (a) implementation and the\n            achievement of development objectives are crucially\n            dependent on continuity of staff on the Bank's side, as\n            well as the frequency of Bank supervision visits and\n            consultations and the adequacy of the composition of its\n            mission teams. This is vital when the implementing agency is\n            going through a transition from public to private sector\n            orientation to customer service, evolving from public sector\n            personnel policies to a commercial operation, and is being\n            prepared for competition and privatization; and (b) the Bank\n            has a responsibility to educate the Borrower and the\n            implementation agency on the requirements of the legal\n            covenants and the implication of noncompliance and must play\n            a continuing role in assisting the Borrower in resolving\n            problems in meeting such covenants in a timely fashion."}, "docdt": "1997-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
