growth.

It supports the Government's program\n            to improve macroeconomic performance and reallocate public\n            spending to poverty-targeted sectors; and it addresses the\n            Government's reform agenda in three priority areas: 1)\n            public sector management; 2) public expenditure policy and\n            management; and 3) private sector development and export competitiveness."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
