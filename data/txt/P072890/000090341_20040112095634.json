were as\n            follows: the outcome was highly satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was unlikely, the institutional development\n            impact was modes, and the Bank and borrower performance were\n            both satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that\n            technical assistance should accompany adjustment reforms in\n            a country with relatively weak institutions. This is\n            especially true for second-generation reforms such as\n            competition policy, investment code, and privatization\n            reforms supported under ESAC. Maintaining a recent stock of\n            good analytical work is essential in a country where the\n            Bank provides development policy lending. In a Post-conflict\n            situation, early understanding is needed amongst all\n            partners, of the appropriate balance between financing\n            urgent needs and policy reforms. These two considerations\n            should shape the short and medium-term agenda for Bank\n            lending, and the appropriate choice of instruments. The\n            choice of adjustment lending instrument for a low income\n            country, and the design of Bank policy conditionality should\n            be CAS-based. This should take into account the maturity of\n            the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) reform program,\n            likely progress with critical reforms, and the need to\n            finance the PRSP. The Bank needs to actively manage &\n            supervise policy-based lending in uncertain policy\n            environments. The transition from Economic Rehabilitation\n            Support Credit (ERSC) to ESAC and from ESAC to PRSC shows\n            that where single tranching is chosen without a medium-term\n            reform agenda, strong prior actions and clear triggers for\n            future Bank policy-based lending are needed, and clear and\n            close monitoring and supervision is advisable. The tradition\n            of mistrust between the private sector and the Government\n            will require closer and more frequent dialogue, and should\n            be addressed by mapping out and adhering to a transparent\n            medium-term reform strategy with a sound legal framework,\n            and clarity on the role of government. As Ethiopia develops\n            accountable decentralized government, and as the\n            international community moves towards harmonized direct\n            budget support to assist them, the need for a transparent\n            dialogue around improved and more timely budgeting has\n            increased. More time is needed to test commitment to reforms\n            aimed at private sector development. But even where there is\n            clear political commitment to moving forward on a reform\n            path, the technocratic support to give the reforms impact\n            takes longer to develop."}, "docdt": "2003-10-06T00:00:00Z"}
