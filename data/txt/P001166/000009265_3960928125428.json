objectives, institutional\n            development was partially achieved, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, closer attention to EECI's parlous\n            condition during the design of the loan would probably have\n            improved the impact of the operation. Second, future Bank\n            operations should address the issue of funds being used for\n            non-project related activities. Third, regulatory issues\n            should have been foreseen at the time the loan was designed\n            and should be included in future Bank or IDA operations in\n            the sector. Fourth, the problems relating to the\n            introduction of a market-linked system for setting petroleum\n            product price ceilings and, to a certain degree, the lack of\n            progress in rationalizing the product storage and\n            distribution, point to the weakening effect that waivers may\n            have on the substance of the operation. Finally, initial\n            conditions for tranche release should probably have been\n            maintained, despite any delays that might have ensued."}, "docdt": "1993-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
