The main program\n            objectives are : 1) accelerating development of indigenous\n            energy resources, where possible with increased\n            participation of the private sector, 2) improving investment\n            planning, 3) increasing operational efficiency and\n            strengthening financial management of energy enterprises, 4)\n            improved resource allocation and 5) institutional\n            streamlining.  To this end, the program contains the\n            following elements: new contractual framework for\n            hydrocarbon exploration and development, review of the\n            energy project portfolio to define an optimum investment\n            program, internal reorganization and financial restructuring\n            of energy parastatals, selective energy price reductions and\n            clarification of Government responsibilities with respect to\n            policy making and supervision through legislation and\n            performance contracts."}, "docdt": "1989-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
