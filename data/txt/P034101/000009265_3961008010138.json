objective of\n            Telecommunications Regulatory Support Project is to support\n            the reform and efficient development of the Pakistan\n            telecommunications sector by implementing a suitable\n            regulatory framework for both public and private\n            telecommunications operators and the efficient allocation\n            and use of the radio spectrum. More specifically, the\n            project will assist in establishing the Pakistan\n            Telecommunications Authority (PTA) and the Frequency\n            Allocation Board (FAB). The project addresses the Government\n            of Pakistan's (GOP's) objectives and priorities\n            for the sector through the following components: 1)\n            technical assistance through a \"technical cooperation\n            arrangement\" with a reputable regulatory agency. Under\n            this arrangement, PTA's and FAB's priority tasks\n            will be to adopt appropriate organizational structures for\n            their entire range of regulatory activities; 2) staff\n            training for PTA and FAB will be incorporated in the\n            provision of technical assistance through the arrangement of\n            relevant courses and seminars in Pakistan, study trips\n            abroad, and training by the equipment suppliers; 3)\n            procurement and installation of an integrated radio spectrum\n            management and monitoring system designed as an integrated\n            network that will provide both administrative and technical\n            facilities and which can be easily expanded in the future as\n            the use of the spectrum increases; and 4) support to\n            GOP's sector reform program through studies of sector\n            issues tofacilitate the privatization process."}, "docdt": "1995-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
