Block Roads Project in Botswana. While the impact on the\n            natural environment by the development will be high during\n            the construction phase, this can be justified by the\n            socio-economic benefits over the long term. High adverse\n            impacts and their ameliorations include: a) geology &\n            soils - the removal of materials for road building, topsoil,\n            and vegetation cover, and use of crusher stone hill;\n            ameliorated by concurrent rehabilitation and erosion\n            management; b) surface hydrology - stream bed changes due to\n            bridge construction; ameliorated by minimizing run-off and\n            siltation; c) fauna - increased road accidents and drinking\n            holes; ameliorated by fencing of road and water source\n            management; d) flora - vegetation removal, dust, and bridge\n            construction; ameliorated by limiting work area size,\n            protecting special vegetation, and concurrent\n            rehabilitation; e) depopulation of villages; ameliorated by\n            broad Regional Plan for Development; and f) noise & dust\n            pollution; ameliorated by damping down during construction."}, "docdt": "1989-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
