constraints to the area's\n            emerging economic attraction to investors and will build on\n            previous Bank involvement in the road subsector by\n            strengthening the planning and maintenance capability of the\n            Roads Department.  The main objectives of the project are to\n            : a) provide road links necessary for the development and\n            integration of the Selebi-Phikwe area and its hinterland; b)\n            strengthen the capacity of the RD to organize and carry out\n            effective road maintenance at the increased level mandated\n            by the expansion of the road network; and c) improve road\n            planning and programming capability in anticipation of the\n            seventh National Development Plan in 1991. Project\n            components comprise the following : 1) construction of the\n            Sefophe-Martin's Drift road, 134 km, to bitumen\n            standard, and village access roads; 2) construction of the\n            Bobonong-Lekkerpoet road, 66 km, including two short access\n            roads to the villages of Molalatau and Mathathane; and 3)\n            consulting services for construction supervision and for\n            preparation of a study for a new maintenance management /\n            organization system for roads, combined with a network\n            planning study."}, "docdt": "1990-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
