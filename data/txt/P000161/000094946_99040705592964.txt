1.0     INTRODUCTION
This report is the result of a study commissioned by the
consultants Brian Colquhoun, Hugh O'Donnell and Partners,
Botswana, in fulfillment of a requirement set out in the Terms
of Reference that the impact of the proposed Sefophe -
Martin's Drift Road be investigated and that recommendations
be made with regards to monitoring and amelioration.
"Tbe objective of an Environmental Impact Assessment is to
define and evaluate the foreseeable immediate and long-term
effects on the physical environment, public health and welfare
of the population affected by a specific project during it's
entire cycle and following completion." (REQUIREMENTS OF THE
WORLD BANK - WORLD BANK 1984)
A complete assessment includes :
(i)     Identification of the proposed development
(ii)    Identification of relevant elements of the the
environment likely to be affected by the deve-
lopment
(iii)   Evaluation of the initial and subsequent
impacts
(iv)    Recommendations for the management of the
beneficial and adverse environmental impacts
generated by the planned and induced
activities deriving from the development
over time.
There are three major impacts: physical, ecological and
social/ economical.  These may be both beneficial and adverse
and may be classified as either primary or secondary in
character.
It is rare that all concerns are able to be accommodated and
the most salient areas of impact have to be identified early
on in the study.
In the case of the Sefophe - Martin's Drift Road, early
viability studies indicated an overriding need for a linking,
access infrastructure within the region. The benefits were
seen to be primarily socio-economic in that the road would
provide employment, access to further employment, link distant
villages and lands to main market centres, access schools,
clinics and encourage more efficient use of the natural
resource by promoting readily available markets.
The route alignment was chosen with the following in mind :           L_
I)   allowing areas of expansion around villages as opposed to       D
accessing through them directly



ii)  linking outlying villages by deviating the alignment to
accommodate as many as possible along the route
iii) avoiding areas of obvious importance such as
archaeological sites, vegetation of special
significance and agricultural lands which
would be destroyed by road dissection
Two phases of development were considered during
the impact assessment: construction and operational.
These were listed in conjunction with present conditions
and the potential for amelioration so that the impact
would be evaluated in its fullest context.
The following aspects of the environment were considered
in the impact assessment at each phase :
(i)   Landscape quality and geomorphology
(ii) Existing physical processes (erosion, drainage etc)
(iii) Air and water quality
(iv) Sound and visual quality
(v)   Fauna and flora
(vi) Historical, cultural, social and economic factors.
Recommendations for the amelioration, control and
monitoring of impacts were made and an executive
summary drawn up in conclusion.

2.0     METHODOLOGY
An inspection of the centre-line was carried out from 31 March
1989 to 3 April 1989 for observational purposes.
An "area of influence" was decided upon as that distance from
the centre-line that could be reached by donkey-cart during
the course of one day. (Figures 1 & 2).
A socio-economic study commissioned by the consultants was
carried out and the results and observations incorporated into
this study.
2.1     Data Collection
Data was collected from existing published texts, maps and
reports of visual observatious made from 31 March 1989 - 3
April 1989.

2.2     Description of Proposed Development
The proposed development consists of a new road with a
bitumous surface treatment. The proposed alignment extends
from Sefophe in the north to the settlement of Sherwood Ranch
in the south, as shown in Figure 2.
The road deviates westwards to access the villages of Mogapi,
Maunatlala,Lesenopole, Borakauelo, Seolwane and Lerala,
passing outside of the village limits in order to allow space
for growth towards the road.
A link road is proposed to access further villages such as
Kgagodi, Moakatimo and Mogapinyana both north-easterly towards
Sefophe and westerly towards Palapye. (See Figure 2).

3.0     DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENT
3.1     Physical Environment
3.1.1   Topography
The study area is characterised by flat, featureless terrain
with occasional rocky hills or outcrops and depressions
forming pans.
The Tswapong Hills, to the west of Maunatlala, constitute the
largest change In level of the landscape and form the visual
base of the area, creating a focus along the route.
3.1.2   Geology and Soils
The area from Sefophe south to Maunatlala consists of
alternate Banded Gneiss and Granitic Gneiss formations whilst
the area south of Maunatlala towards tartin's Drift consists
of Undifferentiated Grey Gneiss interspersed with Calcrete.
Outcrops of Red Jasper occur at river-crossings.
Surface soils alternate between Black Cotton and
Kalahari-Sand. Decomposed Calcrete occurs where Calcrete
formations are exposed to weathering.
These shallow, relatively infertile soils are particularly
susceptible to erosion due to their low permeability.
Stormwater run-off is enhanced, often resulting in severe
erosion and contributing to the silting up and redirection of
watercourses.
3.1.3   Surface Hydrology
Report pending
3.1.4   Climate
The climatic parameters which have been considered as
relevant to this study are rainfall, temperature,
evaporation and wind.
(i)     Rainfall
The annual rainfall of 400-450mm per annum is
relatively high for Botswana. The rainfall
pattern is sbort, heavy thundershowers
followed by hot sunshine in the summer.
The rainy season extends from October
to April with the dry period extending from
April to October.                                              E
[fi
t7



The rainfall pattern contributes significantly
to the erosion of topsoil especially wbere the
ground has been stripped of cover vegetation.
(ii)    Temperature and Evaporation
High ambient temperatures in summer (33
degrees average daily maximum in January)
raise ground temperature3 tLereby increasing
the rate of moisture loss from the soil.
Evaporation and transpiration rates will
frequently exceed the precipitation rate
with the result that little moisture
remains in the surface soil for any
appreciable time. This makes re-vegetation
of disturbed areas particularly difficult.
JANUARY (SUMMER)    JULY (WINTER)
Average Daily Maximum Temp:      33 degrees cent.    22 degrees cent.
Extreme Daily Maximum Temp:      43 degrees cent.    32 degrees cent.
Average Daily Minimum Temp:      19 degrees cent.       5 degrees cent.
(iii)   Wind
Wind strength - and direction -
together with seasonal fluctuations,
contribute greatly to dust pollution,
dessication and erosion of soils.
During the construction phase, the effects
of wind direction and speed will be
particularly important in relation to
the following :
a)  stripping and grading    - dust
b)  blasting, heavy vehicles - noise and dust
c)  machinery and site camps - odour, litter, smoke

May     (At 10 M.A.G.L.)                           5.2 m/hr
3.2     Ecological Environment
3.2.1   Fauna and Flora                                                        E
Information was derived primarily from visual observations
made during visits to the area.
TPI



(i)   Fauna
Little sign of large game species was apparent during
the site observation, although smaller game appeared to
be present.
Reptiles, birds and insects were abundant. By far the
largest populations of animals consisted of domestic
species such as cattle, goats, donkeys, poultry, sheep
and dogs with the population density increasing with
proximity to settlements.
Evidence of the above was observed throughout the route.
As on most roads in Botswana, free-ranging domestic
animals pose a serious threat to road safety. They also
cause a number of environmental problems particularly
around areas of permanent habitation and pans.
Evidence of overgrazing was apparent adjacent to the
route alignment with the severity increasing with
proximity to human settlement.
The higher rainfall of this region has attracted greater
densities of domestic animals in the past, only to be
followed by periods of extended drought which caused
pressure on land resources resulting in severe
overgrazing and erosion.
The ensuing flood years have exacerbated these erosion
processes resulting in even further degradation.
It is anticipated that the forthcoming years are once
again to yield high rainfall and are expected to attract
higher concentrations of people and domestic animals
before the degraded land resources can stabilise or
regenerate.
As is evident in Botswana's National Development Plans,
"development on a suitable basis" is an important maxim
in preserving and maintaining productivity of land
resources. Since the proposed development may impact on
the domestic animal population in the study area, it is
recommended that a study of the effects of this possible
impact on the environment be undertaken.
(ii) Flora
The study area is characterised by tree savannah with
Mopane. This vegetation type results from the
combination of climatic conditions and typically
shallow, sandy soils of low fertility.

There are minor localised changes of vegetation occuring
where soil type or depth changes. These were noted in
the vegetation survey and can be found in Fig. 3.
Certain areas show evidence of overgrazing.  This is
indicated by the presence of the species Acacia tortilis
and Dichrostachys cinnerea.
The land has been subjected to overgrazing to varying
degrees and where land has been most severely
overgrazed, Acacia tortills is the dominant species, and
in some places, the only species found in large areas
adjacent to villages.
As much of the area is already degraded and the natural
vegetation disturbed, the proposed development will not
be destroying pristine sites of major ecological
importance. However, there are areas worth preserving
along the route : (See Figure 3).
These include
-  pan-edge vegetation
-  riverine bush (rare in the region) .4
-  woodland stands
- individual trees or groups of trees
A list of tree species found along the centre-line is
contained in the Appendix.
3.3     Aesthetic Environment
The aesthetic environment is an important consideration in the
assessment of the impacts of any development.
The study area is characterised by flat terrain with
occasional attractive outcrops of rock and hills. The
Tawapong Hills are the most dominant feature of the landscape,
visible from great distances and aesthetically distinctive.
The road is therefore only likely to impact the area at a
localised level.
3.4     Human Environment
3.4.1   Archaeology (Flgure 4)
No professional archaeological survey of the route has been
conducted, although some data was received from Mr D Schermer
(BCHOD Materials Engineer).  He confirmed that the most
important known sites occurred on the western slopes of rocky          L
outcrops and hills as well as along water courses.                     l 
Great care was taken during the road survey to avoid obvious
archeaological sites and there is a commitment by the                    F
engineering consultants to research and report on the'
archeaology of the study area.

PRESENTLY KNOWN SITES of ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE FIGURE 4



- Chainage 79.230, west of the road is a Tuillere or
Iron-age smelting site. This site is very close
to the proposed route and should be carefully
protected during road construction.
- the hills around hogapi which are rich in archeaological
sites.
- Lefiswane Hill which has a "Tautswe"-style site and is
a rare example in the east of Botswana.
3.4.2   Population
Most people living along the route of the proposed development
belong to the Bangwato tribe. No data was collected on tribal
customs and social patterns although the proposed development
does not appear to have raised any concern with local tribal
authorities to date.
The population is heavily weighted towards children under
five, with many of the economically active age groups away in
towns. The rural areas are dominated by women
heads-of-household, old people and children.
3.4.3   Settlement
The study area falls into the Central region of the country
and a small portion to the south, into the Tuli Block. There
are several settlements of varying sizes and scattered
dwellings throughout the land areas and at cattle posts. The
area is relatively densely populated, with the majority of
inhabitants living in, or near to, the larger villages and the
town of Selebi-Phikwe (population 47,000).
The proposed development has sought to access many of these
villages but has by-passed them by a few kilometres, allowing
growth towards the road. These villages include Lerala,
Seolwane, Borakanelo, Lesenopole, Maunatlala and Mogapi. A
proposed feeder-link road will access additional villages such
as Kgagodi, hoakatumo and Mogapinyana further linking the road
with the west.
3.4.4   Economic Base of the Study Area  (See Figure 5)
Information was obtained from the consultants report "Economic
Review of the Sefophe - Martin's Drift Road".
The economic base of the region is dominated by migratory male
workers.  80% of the rural income comes from members of rural
families working in urban areas.                                      F

Livestock ranching and communal subsistence farming, mostly
sorghum make up the main economlc function of rural dwellers.
However, for many of these families, farming is an exercise in
money saving rather than money earning since it allows them to
purchase commodities other than food.
Service industries, trading and the mining operations at
Phikwe Mine provide work opportunities for thousands of
skilled and unskilled workers. The Industrial base of
Selebi-Phikwe is broad and the Regional Development Promotion
Unit is committed to further diversifying the economy change
back.
At present there is a lack of investment opportunity so that
people who have extra income tend to invest in more cattle.
This is partly a traditional expression of wealth and status
which is still prevalent in rural areas, and partly an
insurance against drought; the premise being that cattle last
longer than a field of sorghum during drought years.
This trend has repercussions for the environment in the event
of the proposed development stimulating growth and extra
income in the study area. As noted in Section 3.2.1 the area
is already badly overgrazed and an increase in cattle numbers
will only exacerbate this problem.
3.4.5   Health
Health care standards have risen considerably in the last
decade. Life expectancy is longer and the infant mortality
rate is proportionally very much lower than in other African
countries. However, medical care remains minimal for those
living in more isolated areas. There are rural clinics in
Lerala, haunatlala, Moakatumo and Sefophe.
The proposed road development will provide easier access to
these facilities and will also enable mobile health units to
reach previously inaccessible settlementirs .- - --
A general rise in health standards through education and
preventative medicine is expected to result indirectly from
the proposed road.
3.4.6   Education
The road will improve access to schools and training
facilities immeasurably.
Enrolment in schools in the area has increased faster than
population growth in the last 10 years and the government has
committed itself to increasing and improving education
facilities in the region.  Primary Schools exist in Sefophe,
Mogapi and ?aunatlals.                                               l   I

At present there are Secondary Schools at Sefophe, Maunatlala
and Lerala, and more proposed for hogapi and hogapinyana.
Limited tertiary training facilities are to be found in
Selebi-Phikwe.

4.0     EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
This evaluation considers those aspects most pertinent to the
assessment of impacts anticipated by the proposed development.
4.1     Overall Environmental Impacts
The impact on the natural environment by the development will
indeed be high during the construction phase. This can be
justified by the socio-economic benefits which will be derived
in the long-term.
Recommendations for the amelioration and monitoring of the
most adverse impacts is included in section 5.0

(iii)  Sites of crew-camps and estimated time of
habitation
(iv)   Sites of machinery - camps and estimated
time of habitation
(v)    Any other areas expected to be impacted
upon during construction
(vi)   Phasing details
This will enable detailed specifications for rehabilitation to
be drawn up for concurrent rehabilitation to occur.
5.1.2   Commitment to liaise at all times with relevant Land Board and
Tribal authorities in matters pertaining to land expropriation
and tribal dissatisfaction arising out of the proposed
development.
/ '~5.1.3   Commitment to concurrent rather than post-construction
rehabilitation.  (See 5.2)
1 5.1.4   It is strongly recommended that the hill marked for use
as a crusher-dtone source be re-evaluated for its
archaeological importance before being utilized by the
contractor.
5.1.5   Stripping of Vegetation
It is recommended that vegetation be stripped at relatively
short intervals ahead of over the length of the road section.
This will reduce the surface area of disturbed ground thus
reducing the vulnerability of that soil to erosion.                     Xl
10



This will also negate the need for the stripping of secondary
growth later on thus preventing further construction impacts
on the environment.
5.1.6   Storage of Topsoil
It is recommended that stripped topsoil be stored and
monitored in such a way as to preserve it and prevent it's
displacement by wind or water erosion. Existing disused
borrow pits along the route could provide suitable storage
areas.
5.1.7   Stripping of Understorey Vegetation
It is recommended that the stripping of understorey vegetation
inside the reserve be monitored so that care is taken not to
damage adjacent vegetation outside of the reserve.
It is recommended that, wherever possible, vegetation suitable
for use as fuel be deposited at specific sites for collection.
5.1.8 r Protection of Trees within Road Reserve
A It is recommended that certain trees, valuable species, or
trees of exceptional size and especially those described in
Figure8 3 & 6 be protected during construction of the road.
It is recommended that these trees be clearly marked before
the stripping phase and that the construction areas be
demarcated if necessary, to protect them from damage. It is
recommended, that responsibility and monitoring of this
process rest with the contractor and that it be clearly stated
in the contract documents, with the incorporation of penalties
against the contractor, should any trees be damaged.
5.1.9   Protection from Dust and Noise Pollution
It is recommended that unnecessary dust and noise pollution be
eliminated to protect the existing vegetation, animal and
human communities already present along the route.
The watering-down of existing and temporary dirt roads used as
access routes and the siting of crew and machinery camps away
from existing villages is recommended in this respect. The
monitoring of this shall rest with the contractor.

5.1.10 Building of Bridges
The occurrence of riverine vegetation In the region is rare,
and because such ecosystems are fragile, special attention
should be paid to encourage the preservation of sucb sites.
Where the construction of bridges occurs along the proposed
road, the contractor should be made aware of the importance of
these areas. Only the ares immediately affected by
construction should be disturbed.
Monitoring of this impact should be carried out during bridge
construction.
5.1.11  Creation of Cattle crossings and Accommodation of
Present Animal Movements
A study of local animal movements should be carried out and an
agreement reached with the local authorities as to where to
place cattle crossings. It is understood that this process is
generally carried out on an ad hoc basis while construction is
taking place.
The placement of fences and road crossings should accommodate
the position of veterinary fences.
At Chainage 19.100 there is a small, yet important, water
source in an otherwise dry region which attracts a large
number of cattle from the surrounding areas. For road safety
reasons it is recommended that animals be prevented from
crossing the road at this point to reach the pan, and that an
alternative source of water be provided on the other side of
the road.
An alternative to providing a second, artificial water source
might be an under-pass to enable continual access to the
present water source.
There being no data available on wild-animal behaviour along
the route it is not possible to make recommendations for their
protection.
5.1.12  Grading of Borrow Pits
It is recommended that all borrow pits be graded to return
them to the nearest as possible form of their original state.
Fill material could include non-toxic waste products and
displacement materials from the construction process.
PD



Where applicable, borrow pits could be transformed into water
holes or dams.
5.1.13 Rehabilitation of Road Reserves, Access roads, Detours and
Crew and Machinery Camp Sites
There are several alternatives in this respect Including :
(i)    Ripping ground to lessen compaction
(ii)   Hydromulching
(iii)  Hydroseeding
(iv)   Broadcast seeding
The type and method of rehabilitation should be determined by
the consultant and client prior to the tendering stage and
penalties for non-adherence agreed to and documented
accordingly.
Monitoring of this phase is very important, especially during
the rainy season when erosion risks are highest.
The method of rehabilitation should be appropriate to the
facilities available to the Botswana Roads Department who will
undertake maintenance of road reserves.
5.2     Operational Recommendations
5.2.1   Management and Maintenance of Road Reserves
Maintenance such as grass cutting, bush cleaning, weed-killing
of verges, litter removal, tree-protection and facility
maintenance (toilets, picnic spots, bus-stops, fences, gates
etc ...) will be the responsibility of the Roads Department.
It is recommended that a detailed Maintenance Schedule be
supplied by the Consultants to the Roads Department and that
the latter be well informed as to the importance and most
suitable methods of sustaining minimal impact on the
environment during maintenance routines.
Special care-should be taken to protect the trees remaining in
the road reserve and to ensure that herbicides and other toxic
materials utilised in the maintenance process be handled with
care.
The upkeep of fences and gates will be of prime importance
with regards to the control of animal movements as discussed
in 5.1.11.

5.3     Long-Term Recommendations
Whatever the impacts on each component of the environment, the
obvious concern is for the soclo-economic benefits of the
development to be imparted to the region.
The Sefophe - Martilns Drift Road must be part of a broader
regional development plan which allows for informed and
responsible future exploltation and conservation of resources.
It is therefore recommended that the Botswana Government give
due consideration to thls proposal.
The road would then contribute greatly to the successful
development of the region.

6.0     CONCLUSION -  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In early viability studies, the proposed development was found
to be highly desirable from a socio-sconomic point of view.
A central, linking road would access villages and lands to the
town of Sefophe as well as Palapye, Selebi-Phikwe, Francistown
and further on into the interior of the country.
Health, education and employment opportunities would arise as
a result of the road and the region as a whole could be better
utilized and managed.
An assessment of the impacts on the environment that would
arise out of the immediate and long-term effects of the road
was made.
It was concluded that the socio-economic benefits of the
development superceded the misgivings of certain negative
environmental impacts, most of which would occur at the
construction phase and could be ameliorated and monitored
successfully.
Recommendations for amelioration and monitoring were made,
together with further recommendations for the future
development of the region, to which the road from Sefophe to
Martin's Drift could contribute a major role.
