Project\n            for Botswana were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory,\n            project sustainability was likely, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also a\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:  insufficient\n            supervision cannot enhance sector policy dialog and\n            partnership. The project implementation becomes difficult\n            when a key component is affected by ministries other than\n            the implementing agency. It is difficult to evaluate\n            institutional capacity where no performance indicators were\n            established. Botswana is a case where regional\n            considerations need to be negotiated before setting up any\n            project and sector specific policy on the country basis."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
