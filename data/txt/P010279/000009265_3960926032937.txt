THIRD SMALL INDUSTRIES PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiaries:             Participating Credit Institutions (PCI) would include:
Allied Bank of Pakistan Ltd
Habib Bank Limited
Muslim Commercial Bank
National Bank of Pakistan
United Bank Limited
Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan
Amount:                    US$54 million equivalent
Terms:                     20 years of maturity including five years of grace
at the Bank's variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:           The Government would relend the proceeds of the
Bank Loan to the six PCIs at terms which would
provide a spread of 4.75% to the PCIs. The final
lending rate to subborrowers would be 14% p.a.
initially and would be reviewed and adjusted
periodically in conjunction with the review and
adjustment provided for under the Second Industrial
Investment Credit Project (Loan 2648-PAK/Credit
1646-PAK) for medium and large industry. The
Government would bear the exchange and interest
rate risks since the ultimate subborrowers are
small scale enterprises, which have relatively
little capacity to judge and hedge against foreign
exchange and interest rate risks. The PCIs would
repay their loans over 12 years, including a grace
period of five years.
Financing Plan:            Government of Pakistan               US$  1.0 million

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE THIRD SMALL INDUSTRIES PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed loan to Pakistan for US$54 million
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be lent at the Bank
standard variable interest rate, would have a repayment period of 20 years
including five years of grace and would help finance the Third Small
Industries Project.
2.      Background.  The Government defines small industry units as
industrial enterprises with fixed assets (excluding land and buildings) not
exceeding Rs 10 million (US$570,000). Currently, small scale industries
(SSI) contribute nearly 4.7% of GDP, 27% of industrial value added and 30X of
manufactured exports and employ about two million workers in over 100,000
establishments. The Government of Pakistan (GOP) continues to attach
priority to the SSI sector because of its importance in meeting social and
industrial development objectives of the country. Government policies for
industrial development allow SSI to set up and operate with little
regulation, and market signals are the main determinants of SSI investments
and their viability. However, until recently, GOP policy required the bank-
ing system to provide fixed investment credit to SSI at an interest rate of
11%, which is 3X lower than the current m4,rket rate, as a means of promoting
them. Considering the higher costs and risks of lending to SSI and the lack
of long term capital resources, this subsidy, which was borne mainly by the
banking system, had constrained lending to SSI. The Government recently
addressed this problem by allowing the banks to increase the interest rate to
14%, in line with the current market rate for industrial term lending. The
project will support this policy refort- by providing long term funds to the
banks for on-lending to SSI at the same rate of 14X; and by providing for an
annual review of the lending rate to ensure that it remains consistent with
market rates. Aside from inadequate access to investment funds, SSIs have
difficulty in availing themselves of technology and markets due to their weak
organizational capacities, their dispersed location and lack of effective
support mechanisms. The project will help address these problems by develop-
ing effective institutional support for SSI in acquiring technology and
expanding markets.
3.      Project Objectives.  The Bank has supported GOP's strategy for SSI
development by providing credit, technical and marketing assistance to SSI
and by improving the institutional arrangements for their delivery through
two SSI projects. SSI I and II have financed about 2,000 subprojects,
resulting in investments of about US$200 million and the creation of 33,000
jobs at a cost per job of about US$6,000. SSI I has been completed while
SSI II is fully committed. Collection performance has been satisfactory,
averaging 82%. In view of the success of the past SSI projects, GOP has
requested financing for a third SSI project to pursue expansion and modern-
ization of this sector in line with its potential. The specific objectives
of the Project are to: (a) encourage the banks to increase lending to SSI by
providing funds to finance SSI subprojects and by keeping the SSI lending



-2-
rate aligned with market interest rates; (b) strengthen the financial
institutions involved in SSI lending through technical assistance, training
and improvement of operating systems; (c) develop a strong export marketing
infrastructure through the promotion cf export houses; (d) improve the
efficiency of industrial units through a program of technology transfer; and
(e) improve the accuracy and reliability of SSI statistics for policy and
development strategy formulation.
4.      Project Description.  To meet the above objectives, the proposed
project would have the following components: (a) subloans for fixed invest-
ments and permanent working capital for SSI subprojects; (b) technical assis-
tance for the financial institutions to train staff and improve operating
systems and procedures with emphasis on their branch network; (c) technical
and financial assistance for the establishment of export houses; (d) a tech-
nology transfer program to promote technology and productivity improvements
for industrial enterprises; and (e) technical assistance to the Federal
Bureau of Statistics to improve SSI data collection, processing and analysis.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$180 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$58.5 million (33Z). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6399-PAK, dated May 22, 1987,
is being distributed separately.
5.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Inadequate access to investment
funds, technology and markets continue to constrain growth of the SSI sector.
The informal financial market still provides most of SSI financing needs at
very high interest rates, constraining investments and unduly increasing
risks of failure. The only other significant source of investment funds is
the Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCB). Yet the NCBs had been constrained
from expanding their term lending to SSI due to lack of long term resources,
the higher costs and risk associated with SSI lending and, until recently, a
Government mandated low interest rate for SSI term lending. The formal
financial markets are also not able to generate the appropriate funds; the
capital market in Pakistan is relatively underdeveloped and SSI debt instru-
ments would be particularly difficult to trade in the market due to risk
perceptions and traditional ownership structures. The recent increase in the
interest rate for SSI term lending will help encourage the NCBs to expand
their lending to SSI. Nevertheless, as in other countries, special efforts
will continue to be needed to mobilize investment funds for lending to SSI.
Thus there is a continuing need for the Bank to assist the Government in
providing long-term funds which the NCBs can blend with their short-term
resources to lend to SSI. In the area of technical and marketing services
for SSI, the present government channels have not been very effective in the
past in improving SSI's access to technology and markets. The Bank's role is
to assist in making them more effective through training and advisory serv-
ices in areas where they can be effective, and in developing other channels
in the private sector in areas where the government agencies are unlikely to
become effective due to inherent difficulties in staffing, policies and
procedures.
6.      Co-financing.  Grant funds from the Government of the Netherlands
(GON) in the amount of US$12.5 million equivalent (f. 25 million) will be



-3-
used to co-finance the proposed project, with US$5 million equivalent financ-
ing the technical assistance components and the balance of US$7.5 million
supplementing Bank financing of the subloan component. For this purpose, GON
and the Government of Pakistan would enter into a Development Grant
Agreement, which would spell out the terms and conditions of the grant and
specify that the execution of the proposed project would be in accordance
with the Loan Agreement and be administered by the Bank. The Bank and GON
would enter into an Administration Agreement which would spell out the role
of the Bank as administrator of the grant on behalf of GON.
7.      Agreed Actions.  GOP has agreed on the following:  (a) the raising
of the interest rate for SSI term loans from 11% p.a. to 14X p.a. to make it
conisistent with the rate for medium and large industry, reflective of the
current market rates for similar lending in the country and positive in real
terms; (b) as in other Bank loans for SSI, the Government would bear the
foreign exchange and interest rate risks because the ultimate subborrowers
are small enterprises which have relatively little capacity to judge and
hedge against exchange and interest rate risks; (c) an annual review :nd
appropriate adjustment of the on-lending interest rate in conjunction with
those required under the Second Industrial Investment Credit Project
(IIC IIt Lu. 2648); (d) as conditions of loan effectiveness, the signing of
subsidiary loan agreements between GOP and, at least, two participating
credit institutions (PCI) and of the administrative agreement between GOP
and Pakistan Banking Council (PBC) and approval by the respective boards of
the signatory PCIs and issue of circulars containing operating policies and
procedures, satisfactory to the Bank; and (e) as conditions of disbursement
of the Bank loan and Dutch grant funds: (i) for the export house component,
the issuance of a COP circular allowing suppliers to the selected export
houses to benefit from export incentives currently available to direct
exporters; the issuance of a policy and strategy statement, acceptable to the
Bank, by the Export Promotion Bureau for the TA component; and the signing of
a Development Grant Agreement between GON and GOP and of an Administrative
Agreement between CON and the Bank; and (ii) for the technology and produc-
tivity component, approval and issuance of statements of policy and strategy
by the development finance institutions concerned.
8.      Justification.  The proposed project would support GOP's strategy for
modernizing and expanding the sector by making investment funds more readily
available and by providing effective marketing and technical services. The
Bank Loan would fill a significant portion of the resource gap for SSI lend-
ing and help GOP and the banking system mobilize and allocate appropriate
resources for this sector. The commercial banks would blend their own
resources with those of the Ba k on a 40:60 basis thus encouraging prudent
term transformation in the banking system to support the small enterprise
sector. It is anticipated that about 1,300 subprojects would be financed,
resulting in investments of about US$160 million. As in the first and second
projects, it is expected that most subloans would be for smaller units, with
subloan amounts averaging about US$60,000. The subprojects financed are
expected to generate about 28,000 new full-time work places at a cost per job
of about US$6,000.
9.      Risks.  Aside from a possible economic downturn, there is a risk that
failure to maintain a rational interest rate structure could adversely affect
the project. Subsidized lending programs introduced last year by GOP, if
expanded, could affect the rate of utilization of the subloan component since



-4-
the subloan rate of 142 under the project would not be competitive. However,
the Government has advised the Bank that the size of these subsidized
programs is, and will remain, small and thus will have no appreciable effect
on the proposed project. The annual interest rate review, required under
this project and IIC Il, will be used to monitor continued rationality of the
interest rate structure and satisfactory interest rate levels.
10.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approved the proposed loan.
