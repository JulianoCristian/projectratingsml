The implementation of the compensation includes\n            two main stages. In the first stage, the affected households\n            are informed and the amount and method of compensation is\n            determined by the implementing agency. The stakeholders are\n            then informed of the results. In the second stage, the legal\n            procedure for the actual payment of the compensation is\n            carried out. The first stage starts by sending a letter of\n            invitation and a brochure which explains in simple language\n            the rights of affected population according to the category\n            of acquisition. In addition, each household is separately\n            approached by social workers and the situation is explained\n            in a face-to face discussion. Then two Land Acquisition and\n            Resettlement Committee (LARC) meetings are organized. At the\n            same time the village is visited by legal experts to\n            document the present condition of properties and determine\n            the price of property to be acquired and the compensation\n            method. This stage is finalized by informing the\n            stakeholders on the results of this assessment. In the\n            second stage if an agreement is reached with the stakeholder\n            on the amount and method of compensation, the necessary\n            legal documents are prepared and the compensation is paid."}, "docdt": "2007-07-03T00:00:00Z"}
