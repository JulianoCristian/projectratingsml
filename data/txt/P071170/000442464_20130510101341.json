Some lessons learned included: Integrated\n            Water Resources Management (IWRM) is an effective way to\n            promote coordination between the many and diverse government\n            ministries and institutions involved in watershed\n            management, irrigation and drainage, agriculture and\n            forestry, and municipal water supply within a basin. It is\n            imperative to fully identify land acquisition requirements\n            before commencement of project implementation and to\n            complete land acquisition as soon as possible after the\n            start of the project to avoid implementation delays. It is\n            imperative that irrigation and drainage projects have\n            up-to-date detailed civil works designs with up-to-date\n            project design cost estimates before loan effectiveness so\n            that tendering can start as soon as loan effectiveness is\n            declared to avoid cost increases for civil works. A strong\n            central Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) system within\n            the lead implementation agency should be standard in large\n            projects with multiple agencies involved so that problems\n            are detected early and signaled to the bank and to the\n            government. Capacity building through adequate training of\n            both staff and senior management at the outset, so that the\n            relevance and importance of M and E to project\n            implementation is understood, is key to M and E success.\n            Financial and economic analysis, aside from the rate of\n            return number itself, provides valuable information in the\n            form of various indicators (yield, income) that can be\n            tracked from appraisal through to project closing and that\n            show how the main beneficiaries (farmers) take part and\n            benefit from the project."}, "docdt": "2013-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
