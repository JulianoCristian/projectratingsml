                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project will assist the Islamic Republic of Iran in piloting basin-wide integrated water resources management (IWRM)in Mazandaran Province so that
                         lessons learned can be replicated in the rest of the country. The project's development objective is to demonstrate the benefits of the IWRM at the river basin level by:
                         (a) sustainably increasing agricultural productivity through the improved irrigation and drainage system and participatory management mechanism; (b) reducing soil
                         erosion and sediments yields into the Alborz Dam, which is currently under construction using the Islamic Republic of Iran's funds, through the improved upper
                         watershed management; and (c) protecting the water environment downstream of the Babol River and other water bodies through improved hydrological/water quality
                         monitoring reservoir operation, and pest management.
