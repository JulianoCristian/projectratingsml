NTRODUCTION
 
The Alborz Integrated Land and Water Management Project (AILWMP) was 
approved by the World Bank on May 26, 2005.  The project assists GOI in piloting a 
basin-wide Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) in Mazandaran Province 
so that the lessons learned can be replicated in the rest of the country.  The project’s 
development objective is to demonstrate the benefits of the IWRM at the river basin 
level by (a) increasing agricultural productivity through the improved irrigation and 
drainage system and participatory management mechanism; (b) reducing soil erosion 
and sediment yields into the Alborz Dam, which is currently under construction using 
GOI funds, through the improved upper watershed management; and (c) protecting 
the water environment downstream of the Babol River and other water bodies through 
improved hydrological/water quality monitoring, reservoir operation, and pest 
management.  
 
The primary beneficiaries of the project are farmers in traditional irrigation and rain-
fed areas (total around 77,000), foresters and herders in the upper watershed, 
fishermen in the ab-bandans and the basin population (total around 973,000) in 
general. In order to ensure the sustainability of the hydraulic infrastructures and 
economic efficiency of water use, the project works towards promoting local 
stakeholder participation in water allocation and distribution decisions at both the 
basin and farm levels, as well as the devolution of O&M responsibilities to users 
groups. 
 
Project Components: 
 
The project consists of the following five components: 
(a) Upper Watershed, Forestry and Rangeland Management; 
(b) Irrigation and Drainage Management; 
(c) Establish a Basin Water Fund (BWF); providing assistance for community-based 
activities for water and natural resource conservation; and establishment of a 
support system that enables the BWC to discharge its mandate; 
(d) Environment Management; and 
(e) Project Implementation and Coordination Support. 
 
Objectives of the report 
 
This report relates to the second component:  Irrigation and Drainage.  A Resettlement 
Plan was prepared and disclosed for the dam area; a social analysis of water use was 
carried out; and two resettlement policy frameworks (RPF) were prepared and 
disclosed for the irrigation and forestry before the appraisal. In addition to the 
resettlement underway for the dam, the irrigation and drainage networks also 
necessitate land acquisition and possible resettlement. As a result, now that the project 
is active and the extent of the impact in the irrigation network for the primary and 
secondary canals are better known, this resettlement plan (RP) for the irrigation area 
has been prepared. This report is the resettlement plan for the second phase of the 
irrigation area (component 2), including Raies Kola diversion weir and Halil Dasht 
pumping station and the related areas.  Previously, a resettlement plan was prepared 
for the first phase of the canal construction (MCC3) which serves as the model for 
preparing this resettlement plan and the ones for the subsequent parcels of the main 
channel as the project implementation progresses and additional data is collected.

As the acquisition not only affects direct income of the landowners but also the income which is 
generated through secondary occupation, it is also necessary to consider the occupation of the affected 
population. As shown by the table below, most of the people are farmers (76%) or wage-earners, i.e. 
retired, civil servant and workers (2.9%).  Farming is the secondary occupation of almost half of the 
non-farmer population.  The average monthly income of the affected households is Rials 1,569,853.

ATEGORIES OF LAND 
A
CQUISITION
 
The implementation of Raies Kola Diversion Weir and Halil Dasht Pumping Station 
requires 363036 square meters of private and public property in ten villages (see table 
below). This requires the acquisition of up to 36 hectares of land.  Most of this land is 
in form of Rice fields (56.6%) and land used for other agricultural products such as 
orchards and grazing (39.2%).  There is little barren land and residential land acquired 
by
the project (0.6%). Other types of land acquisition (3%) include roads, riverbeds, 
and other public property such as sport yards, etc. (0.6%).

OMPENSATION POLICIES
 
In Iran, acquisition of private lands and properties by the State is governed by the 
“Statutory Bill on Purchase and Acquisition of Lands and Properties for the 
Implementation of the General Development and Military Plans of The Government”
 
of
January 27, 1980
1
.
The Law, while allowing the government to speedily acquire 
private lands for economic development or military purpose, protects the rights of 
property owners and ensures just compensation. The important features of the Law are 
its efficient streamlined procedures; third-party arbitration in which both parties have 
a
representative; and the fact that it recognizes established customs and conventions 
with respect to ownership titles, lease rights and similar other rights. 
 
Nevertheless, the Law has some shortcomings when compared with the World Bank 
policies on involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12) which governs in all projects financed 
by
the World Bank. The important elements of discrepancy pointed out by the World 
Bank are the following: 
 
·
The primary focus of the Law is on acquisition of properties for public 
purpose and not on resettlement of project affected person or communities. 
Consequently, it explicitly does not assure restoration of the economic and 
social well being of project affected communities to pre-displacement levels; 
·
Other than the statutory compensation, the Law offers little support/assistance 
to facilitate reestablishment of affected community elsewhere after 
displacement (relocation sites, new shelters, productive assets, transportation 
arrangements, transition phase assistance, civic amenities etc.);  
·
The agency that acquires private property has no statutory responsibility for 
the resettlement of affected communities. Neither does the Law assigns this 
responsibility to any other agency or institutions. 
·
Communication between acquiring agency and the property owners is limited 
to formal notices and price negotiation. The law does not mandate a 
participatory approach and as a result, there is very little consultation between 
executing agency and the affected community.  
 
While it is not possible to make amendments or modifications to the existing law 
within the context of the proposed AILWM project, additional provisions should be 
made through appropriate administrative measures.  These include: 
 
·
Additional compensation for loss of income through land acquisition will be 
provided as explained in the section of compensation methods below; 
·
Remaining skewed parcels of land/structures that are left behind after 
acquisition of the main property will be acquired if the owner so desires and 
an additional compensation of at least 15% of the land price will be paid for 
those remaining skewed pieces of land which will still be usable; 
·
Special financial assistance will be provided to displaced landless wage 
earners; 
·
The project will also consider special assistance to other most vulnerable 
groups; 
1
See Appendix I for main provisions of the Law. 
Page  10
7
·
The project will give the choice for replacement land/relocation sites to project 
affected people; and  
·
Monitoring and grievance mechanisms will be created with adequate 
representation by affected people to further help information dissemination 
and better deal with complaints. These are explained in detail in the section on 
Implementation Mechanisms below. 
 
5. C
OMPENSATION PROCEDURES
 
The implementation procedures include two main stages. In the first stage, the 
affected households are informed and the amount and method of compensation is 
determined by the implementing agency. The stakeholders are then informed of the 
results. In the second stage, the legal procedure for the actual payment of the 
compensation is carried out. 
 
The first stage starts by sending a letter of invitation and a brochure which explains in 
simple language the rights of affected population according to the category of 
acquisition (a copy of the brochure is attached as Appendix III). In addition, each 
household is separately approached by social workers and the situation is explained in 
a
face-to face discussion. Then two Land Acquisition and Resettlement Committee 
(LARC) meetings are organized (see the sections below). At the same time, the 
village is visited by legal experts to document the present condition of properties and 
determine the price of property to be acquired and the compensation method. This 
stage is finalized by informing the stakeholders on the results of this assessment. 
 
In the second stage, if an agreement is reached with the affected people on the amount 
and method of compensation, the necessary legal documents are prepared and the 
compensation is paid. If however, the affected people does not accept the assessed 
compensation, the case is decided by a three-expert committee consisting of a legal 
expert and two experts each nominated by one of the parties. Again the stakeholder is 
informed about the decision of this committee and the legal documents are prepared 
and the compensation is paid (see figure 1 below).

6. C
OMPENSATION 
M
ETHODS
 
As shown in the table below, the compensation method varies according to the 
category of affected population. For those who lose excessive part of their land there 
are diverse options which range from receiving cash compensation to replacement 
land in Jooybar with an area equivalent to the evaluated price of the acquired land. 
The project will make arrangements to visit the replacement land proposed before the 
transaction is finalized. Other affected categories are usually compensated in cash for 
the value of land or building lost or the equivalent of a lost income. In case of 
residential buildings, in addition to the full compensation of the replacement cost, the 
affected person is entitled to receive an additional amount equal to 15% of the cost as 
a
moving allowance. Also for vulnerable households, the MRWC will ensure that the 
monthly assistance the household receives from the charity organizations is not cut, 
and in addition, a one-time cash payment up to an amount of USD 1000 will paid to 
the affected household. This information is also explained in a simplified language in 
the brochures which are distributed in the villages (a copy is attached as Appendix 
III).

Table 9 Compensation methods for affected categories 
Affected Categories 
Compensation method 
Land more than 25% 
One of the following methods as chosen by the affected person: 
1. 
Replacement land in Jooybar with an area equivalent to the evaluated price of 
the acquired land; exemption of network connection costs for agriculture; and the 
equivalent of two years of the value of the annual cropping income as assessed 
through the legal procedures. 
2.

assessed through legal procedures from land parcels available after channel 
construction finishes. 
Loss of land (less than 
25% of holding) 
Cash compensation as calculated through the legal procedures. The value 
determined this way should be equal to the replacement value for land similar to the 
one acquired.

MPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS
 
For an effective implementation of the Resettlement Plan, two committees will be 
formed:  
 
1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Committee (LARC); and 
2. Grievance Committee (GC).  
 
The members of LARC include: Mr. Naji, legal adviser and the head of MRWC legal 
department; Mr. Darvishi, technical expert, MRWC; and Mr. Tabandeh, agriculture 
expert. LARC will also be joined by the village representative who is an affected 
villager nominated by the Village Islamic Council. The latter member will change 
from one village to the next so as to give a voice to those affected in each village. 
LARC will meet twice, once in the affected area (possibly in the project site) and once 
in a mosque of the affected village, at a time which is suitable for the villagers. The 
schedule of LARC meetings is mentioned in the section below on Implementation 
Schedule. LARC will also consider the appeal of those who have been already 
compensated to provide them with necessary information and guidance. LARC will 
be
responsible for the following tasks: 
a. 
Provide adequate information on acquisition procedures and methods; 
b.  Take note of  the views and proposals of affected population and incorporate 
them during the implementation; 
c. 
Identify those affected according to each category; 
d.  Identify and register vulnerable groups in every village; 
e. 
Review all the primary and secondary sources of income and employment; 
f. 
Supervise the land acquisition and compensation procedures; 
g. 
Ensure that stakeholders’ rights will respected; 
h.  Examine the claims of those who have been compensated; and 
i. 
Provide for additional assistance to vulnerable groups by pursuing the matter 
through charity agencies. 
Grievance committee: The Grievance Committee includes the representative of 
executive director of MRWC; a NGO representative such as a representative of the 
Farmers; the representative of Provincial Government; and the representative of 
affected people or the Village Councilor. GC will meet once a month at the project 
area on a specified time (The first Wednesday of each month, starting on July 2, 2007) 
to examine the complaints of affected people households on a regular basis. 
 
A
Social worker, Mr. Esma’ili, has been appointed by MRWC to work closely with 
the project implementation authorities and serve as the main communication link 
between the affected people and official agencies. More specifically, the social worker 
will: 
 
·
Act as a strong communication link between the project organization and 
affected communities and provide all information related to land acquisition 
policy, procedures and other resettlement matters to the affected communities; 
·
Supervise and provide counseling for a better spending of compensation 
received by affected families;  
Page  14
11
·
Identify those project affected households who are eligible for further 
assistance in close consultation with Village Council and the Board of 
Trustees (
Hei
’at Omana
)
of
the local mosque and the charity organization 
(
Komiteh-Emdad)
;
·
Assist vulnerable families to make appropriate assistance requests; and 
·
Liaise with other government agencies and credit institutions to assist affected 
population in applying for loans and other assistance from such institutions.

ONITORING AND 
E
VALUATION
 
The implementation of the resettlement program would be monitored not only through 
internal and official institutional arrangements, but also by an independent entity.  As 
the contract for the NESPAK consultancy includes the monitoring of Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP) which is also inclusive of social aspects, the consulting firm 
will also be responsible for monitoring of the RP. A detailed task description for the 
monitoring agent is attached to the present report

MPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
 
As explained in section 4 above, in the first stage, the affected households are 
informed and the amount and method of compensation is determined by the 
implementing agency.  The stakeholders are then informed on the results. This stage 
therefore starts by sending a letter of invitation and a brochure which explains in 
simple language the rights of affected population according to the category of 
acquisition. Then LARC meetings are organized and the village is visited by legal 
experts to document the present condition. This stage is finalized by informing the 
stakeholders on the results of this assessment. The first stage of implementation from 
the point the brochure is sent to the stakeholders of the affected village until the 
stakeholders are informed of compensation method takes some 50 days.

In the second stage, the legal procedure for the actual payment of the compensation is 
carried out.  The legal documents are prepared for payment of compensation to those 
who accept the estimated amount of the compensation in 20 days since they are 
informed.  In case the stakeholder does not accept the assessed compensation, the case 
is decided by a three-expert committee consisting of a legal expert and two experts 
each nominated by one of the parties. This would take twice as long. The table below 
shows the schedule of implementation for the second stage. The second stage can only 
start after the formal publishing of the present document in
 
30/8/2007. Assuming this 
date as the starting date for actual implementation, the acquisition would commence 
in Daroon Kola Gharbi, village and is due to finish on 28/6/2008 in Malk Khial.

UDGET
 
The Compensation methods for affected categories have been mentioned in Table 9 
above. This is used as the basis of estimation for the budget needed for 
implementation of this resettlement plan. Table 12 shows the budget estimation for 
affected categories.  According to the table, the budget required amounts to a total 
of
Rials 33,883,507,131. Given a necessary additional 5% percent for contingency, 
the total estimated budget therefore is estimated to be Rials 35.6 billion.

CQUISITION
 
In Iran, acquisition of private lands and properties by the State is governed by the 
“Statutory Bill on Purchase and Acquisition of Lands and Properties for the 
Implementation of the General Development and Military Plans of The Government”
 
of January 27, 1980 (hereafter referred to as Land Acquisition Law or simply as Law).  
The main provisions of the Law as related to acquisition of private lands include: 
 
The Land Acquisition Law authorizes government agencies or “Administrative 
Organizations” to take over private land and other immovable properties if it has been 
determined that such lands and properties are required for public purpose. 
Administrative Organizations include ministries and organizations or government 
offices affiliated with government as well as municipalities, banks, state universities 
and other organizations named in the Law. Public purpose includes developmental as 
well as military projects that are deemed necessary and vital for public good and 
security of the country. 
 
Under the Land Acquisition Law, acquisition of private land and other immovable 
properties is allowed only when nationalized or state lands suitable for the project are 
not available. Acquisition of private property in such cases requires prior approval by 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development or other designated agencies. 
 
Acquisition process can be initiated only when (a) it has been authorized by the 
highest ranking official of the Administrative Organization and (b) the necessary 
funds for the purpose has been secured from the Bureau of Budget and Planning. 
 
Acquisition and compensation principles apply to all types of rights such as 
ownership rights, third party rights such as lease rights, business rights etc., as well as 
properties covered under religious endowment. 
 
The Law requires that the intention of the government to acquire a property is 
conveyed to the owner(s) of the property before initiating the acquisition process. 
Accordingly, Administrative Organization or the executive agency, after getting the 
status of the required land ascertained by the Bureau of Property and Title 
Registration, issues a notice to the owner(s) stating the intention of the government to 
acquire the property and inviting them to present their claims at the designated office 
in the prescribed manner within a month. In case the owner is not known or is 
unavailable, public notices are issued through local newspapers. 
 
The compensation is determined in accordance with the prevailing market price of the 
project operational district after taking into account the value of land, cost of 
structures & installations on the land and similar other damages. The effect of the 
project on the value of land will not be considered while evaluating the properties.  
 
If the proposed compensation is agreed to by the owner, the administrative 
organization may proceed directly with the acquisition and payment of compensation 
by issuing appropriate notification to the owners within three months. However, if the 
transaction fees or compensation for each of the owners exceed 1 million Rials, the 
price for the acquisition of the property or the amount of compensation and the 
Page  18
15
carrying out of the transaction should be approved by the specified board and in the 
case of municipalities; it should be approved by the city council. 
 
If an agreement on the value of the property under acquisition is not reached   
between the Administrative Organizations and the owner, the dispute shall be referred 
to a three-member tribunal of official experts from the Ministry of Justice. One of the 
experts shall be selected by the administrative organization, one by the owner or the 
person entitled to rights, and the third by both parties. The majority decision of the 
tribunal of experts is final and binding on both parties
3
.
Possession of lands and buildings before the completion of the transaction and 
payment of compensation is not permitted.  Where compensation payment and official 
transfer of the property is not possible due to reasons such as ownership dispute, 
unknown owner and absence or death of the owner, the executive may take possession 
of land to avoid delay in the construction of the project, after completing all special 
procedures prescribed in the Law
4
.
Under certain special circumstances government agencies are allowed to take 
possession of private property, on an emergency basis, without waiting to complete 
the entire legal transactions. Such emergency possession of land is allowed only if a 
delay in its execution will result in irrecoverable losses and the minister of the 
administrative organization deems it necessary and urgent.  In such cases, however, 
the acquiring agency is required to prepare an inventory on the status of the property 
in the presence of the owner (or his representative), the representative of the court of 
justice and the official expert before taking possession of the property. Further, the 
administrative organization shall have to deposit the compensation of the property 
within three months from the date of possession
5
.
If the property is a residence or a place of subsistence of the owner, compensation for 
the property shall be increased by 15%. The executive has discretion to decide 
whether the property is a residence or a place of subsistence. In case of dispute, the 
competent court of the district where the property is located shall finally determine 
the case.  
 
The land acquisition law stipulates that the compensation for the acquired property is 
paid as cash. However, the Administrative Organization is permitted to provide 
replacement land rather than cash provided that:  
 
·
rights owner desires to receive replacement land rather than 
cash compensation;  
3
If the disputants fail to agree on the appointment of experts, experts shall be appointed by the 
competent court of the district where the land is located.  In case there is no authorized expert in the 
area, the services of informed persons, approved by the court, shall be utilized. 
4
Upon determination of the fare value by the experts, the executive shall deposit the same in the local 
court. The court then shall appoint a representative to transfer the property to the executive on behalf of 
the owner. After this, the executive agency may take over the property as required. 
5
If the payment is not made within three months, the rights owner may refer to the competent court 
and request blockage of the administrative organization until the payment is made.  The competent 
judge should process the case without delay and issue the necessary order; if the specified price is paid, 
the blockage of the administrative organization shall be removed immediately. 
Page  19
16
·
replacement lands are lawfully transferable and is in the 
possession of the Administrative organization and;  
·
expert evaluation in the manner prescribed in the Law is carried 
out with respect to both the acquired and the replacement lands 
to arrive at the comparative prices and payment of differences.  
 
The Land Acquisition Law recognizes third party rights on acquired land and entitles 
such rights owners a share in the compensation. The types of rights recognized under 
the law includes (a) business or goodwill right (b) right of roots (c) right of 
development / standing Property (d) right of enjoyment / exploitation and (e) right of 
easement. Where third party rights exist, the apportionment of compensation between 
property owner and rights owner will be governed by instruments such as existing 
written agreements between the parties, expert assessment or the customary practice 
as appropriate. 
 
Religious laws and codes that govern religious endowments (properties dedicated for 
religious purposes) will be taken into consideration while acquiring endowment 
properties. If sale and transfer of an endowment is permitted by the religious laws 
under which it is endowed, those will be acquired in accordance with the regular 
provisions of the Land Acquisition Law. If such sale/transfer is not canonically 
permitted, the property is acquired on a long-term lease. In either case, the property is 
evaluated by legal experts and the compensation is paid to the 
beneficiaries/administrator of the endowment. 
 
If a property under acquisition belongs to a government organization or state agency, 
it may be taken over through an agreement between the ministries or directorates. If 
the land, structures, and installations belong to government companies which are not 
permitted to transfer property under the regulations of the company, its price shall be 
payable according to the determined price in the chart of the company.  In this case, 
the property shall be transferred to the administrative organization in an irrevocable 
manner.

Task Description for the Independent Monitor 
Implementation of the Raies Kola Diversion Weir and Halil Dasht Pumping 
Station Resettlement Plan 
 
Introduction
The Alborz Integrated Land and Water Management Project (AILWMP) was 
approved by the Board of Directors in 2005.  The project assists GOI in piloting a 
basin-wide Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) in Mazandaran Province 
so that the lessons learned can be replicated in the rest of the country.  The project’s 
development objective is to demonstrate the benefits of the IWRM at the river basin 
level by (a) increasing agricultural productivity through the improved irrigation and 
drainage system and participatory management mechanism; (b) reducing soil erosion 
and sediment yields into the Alborz Dam, which is currently under construction using 
GOI funds, through the improved upper watershed management; and (c) protecting 
the water environment downstream of the Babol River and other water bodies through 
improved hydrological/water quality monitoring, reservoir operation, and pest 
management.  
 
The primary beneficiaries of the project are farmers in traditional irrigation and rain-
fed areas (total around 77,000), foresters and herders in the upper watershed, 
fishermen in the ab-bandans and the basin population (total around 973,000) in 
general. In order to ensure the sustainability of the hydraulic infrastructures and 
economic efficiency of water use, the project works towards promoting local 
stakeholder participation in water allocation and distribution decisions at both the 
basin and farm levels, as well as the devolution of O&M responsibilities to users 
groups. 
 
Project Components:
The project consists of the following five components: 
(a) Upper Watershed, Forestry and Rangeland Management; 
(b) Irrigation and Drainage Management; 
(c) Establish a Basin Water Fund (BWF); providing assistance for community-based 
activities for water and natural resource conservation; and establishment of a 
support system that enables the BWC to discharge its mandate; 
(d) Environment Management; and 
(e) Project Implementation and Coordination Support. 
 
This report relates to the second component: Irrigation and Drainage. A Resettlement 
Plan was prepared and disclosed for the dam areas a social analysis of water use was 
carried out; and two resettlement policy frameworks (RPF) were prepared and 
disclosed for the irrigation and forestry.  In addition to the resettlement underway for 
the dam, the irrigation and drainage networks will also necessitate land acquisition 
and possible resettlement. Now that the project is active and the extent of the impact 
in the irrigation network for the primary and secondary canals are better known, there 
is a need for preparation of a resettlement plan for the irrigation area.

·
In the irrigation area, verify how many people opted for cash; how the affected 
people are compensated for the skewed land as it as noted in the RP, etc.  In 
the dam areas, verify the physical targets of people compensated i.e., how they 
are resettled, how many people received land, how many people opted for 
cash, etc.;
