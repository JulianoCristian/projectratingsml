          Systems Project is to support ongoing Government efforts to\n            design and implement a fully functional, automated treasury\n            system, that will service as an effective instrument for\n            budget execution and cash management.  The project will\n            provide technical assistance, computer equipment, software,\n            and training to enable the authorities to design, develop,\n            test, and implement processes, procedures, and systems,\n            related regulations and training programs for budget\n            execution and payroll management. The reforms will include:\n            a) development of a budget management law; b) adoption of a\n            budget classification system; c) implementing a transaction\n            based treasury ledger system; d) centralizing government\n            payments; e) reducing reliance on physical movements of cash\n            including implementing a direct deposit payroll system; and\n            f) conducting a functional review of the Treasury\n            Department.  The project will first assist in system design.\n            The system will then be implemented at a number of pilot\n            sites and, after the pilot exercise, replicated across the country."}, "docdt": "1998-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
