At the project level, all future Bank operations,\n            including their components and processes (e.g. consultations\n            on project design, hiring of consultants, procurement,\n            selection of trainees, choice of regulatory options, etc.),\n            should address the way to at least, avoid deepening\n            distrust, and if possible, serve to build trust across the\n            racial divide. Transparency should be the key watchword for\n            both the Government, and donors. In addition, more\n            diagnostic work on incentives, institutions, and social\n            capital is needed, with a view to identifying strategies,\n            and tactics for rationalizing incentives, building\n            sustainable institutions, and fostering social capital.\n            Understanding the political economy is essential to project\n            choice, and design."}, "docdt": "2004-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
