Lessons suggest the following. The Bank\n            should consider including in its legal covenants, provisions\n            which would avoid delaying project components if the\n            government chooses to substitute certain project activities\n            with grant funds, which had not yet been approved, nor\n            received. Therefore, the lack of grant money will not be a\n            factor delaying the execution of important project\n            components. In a small developing country striving to emerge\n            from poverty, with very limited capacity, it is unrealistic\n            to expect transformation of the financial sector into\n            institutional framework models that enable private sector\n            investment, all in a relatively short timeframe; rather, a\n            longer time-frame should be expected. Further lessons\n            address the need to design privatization programs in a\n            socially sensitive manner, e.g., by including in enterprise\n            sale contracts, clauses to protect workers and minority\n            investors; a technical assistance operation can be effective\n            and quickly disbursed if a previous lending operation, or\n            set of actions had already laid the ground for its prompt\n            implementation; and, project ownership and commitment is\n            critical to project success, in this case the task team\n            worked to ensure a consistent level of involvement of the\n            Government in project supervision, and monitoring."}, "docdt": "2003-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
