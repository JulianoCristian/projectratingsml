Project are: (a) to increase the effectiveness of the school\n            system, by upgrading physical facilities and increasing the\n            supply of material inputs; (b) to improve operational\n            efficiency through better management and supervision; (c) to\n            reduce large regional and local disparities in the quality\n            of schools; (d) to support decentralization of the school\n            system, and facilitate the transition to Provincial\n            Councils; (e) to strengthen educational planning capability;\n            and (f) to begin the process of adjusting the balance\n            between various types of education and training - to bring\n            them more closely in line with employment opportunities and\n            manpower requirements. The project consists of the following\n            three main elements: (a) physical facilities, an\n            infrastucture component; (b) management strengthening; and\n            (c) education policy development."}, "docdt": "1989-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
