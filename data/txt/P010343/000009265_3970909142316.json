The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been partially successful, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, there is a need for the Government to\n            address the lengthy period required to staff new project\n            implementation units. Second, clearer follow-up procedures\n            to address key policy recommendations of the National\n            Education Commission and studies need to be\n            institutionalized. Third, the membership of tender\n            committees needs to be further standardized by MEHE to\n            reduce the numerous and lengthy reviews and speed up the\n            procurement process. Fourth, joint efforts by GOSL and IDA\n            to standardize the content of progress reports should be\n            continued. Fifth, project performance and sustainability\n            increased when the operational unit responsible for\n            continuation of the activities was given implementation\n            responsibilities. Sixth, future investments in the education\n            sector should be based on clearly defined criteria and\n            measures to assess the impact of these inputs should be\n            developed. Finally, when IDA identifies a task manager\n            appropriately and gives the task manager sufficient\n            authority and resources to address policy and implementation\n            issues, increased consistency occurs and the implementation\n            of a project improves."}, "docdt": "1997-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
