was rated satisfactory. The project achieved most of\n            its objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            modest, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, organized,\n            long-term communication between ministries and regional\n            offices clearly improves implementation outcome. Second,\n            task manager diligence, knowledge, and implementation\n            orientation can significantly influence project outcomes.\n            Third, insufficient attention may be paid to the\n            instructional consequences of building designs. Projects\n            should study noise and heat levels in school rooms of\n            different types relative to instructional outcomes. Fourth,\n            remote schools are more likely to have cumulative problems,\n            including low-quality construction. More support in time and\n            effort should be made to supervise those sites. Finally,\n            instructional materials, particularly for science, may stay\n            unused until expertise and a real motive for using them\n            exists. In addition to a clear rationale for choosing each\n            item, training must be provided in their use and teacher\n            supervision must include the use of instructional aids."}, "docdt": "1998-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
