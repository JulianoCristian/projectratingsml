Lessons of broad applicability to\n            Bank-financed projects suggest that in countries with\n            limited natural resources, but with a highly literate\n            population, making the development of human resources and\n            the development of new technologies a priority, can deliver\n            dramatic results: improved management skills, combined with\n            new technologies can enable companies avoid bankruptcy, can\n            improve market focus, collaborate effectively with foreign\n            partners, and, improve quality standards for exports.\n            Nonetheless, it is important to tailor management training\n            programs to company size and category of management. Lessons\n            of specific applicability to private sector development in\n            Moldova suggest that participating companies have shown they\n            are willing to pay for training, and there appears to be\n            substantial potential for training on a commercial basis. In\n            addition, there is likely to be a sizeable market for\n            quality management certifications, particularly for\n            enterprises targeting export markets. Thus, management\n            training programs can be a viable means for Moldova to\n            regain access to foreign markets, find more reliable\n            suppliers, and forge joint venture partnerships."}, "docdt": "2005-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
