     satisfactory, sustainability likely, with only modest\n            institutional development impacts. Lessons highlight\n            primarily, the problem of the enormous macroeconomic burden\n            carried by Former Soviet Union countries in energy sectors,\n            specifically those like Georgia which are poor in primary\n            energy. The key issue is how to manage, and then eliminate\n            the deficits resulting from low collections, high commercial\n            losses, and low tariffs, which then translates into problems\n            with privatization, where the private sector assumes\n            bankrupt companies, but with limited government support. To\n            this end, governments should improve companies'\n            performance, and reduce financial deficits prior to\n            privatization, through good public governance, and a fiscal\n            support to investors, supported through higher level\n            coordination between governments, the International Monetary\n            Fund, and the Bank. The project confirmed the difficulty to\n            design and implement energy sector reforms, because of the\n            sector's political, economic and social implications.\n            Thus, dependent to a great extent on progress in other areas\n            of reform, and in the pace of adjustments in response to\n            those reforms, expectations on success in energy reforms\n            should be realistic, coordinated with overall economic\n            reforms, and leveraged with instruments in accordance with\n            government, and interest groups beyond the energy sector."}, "docdt": "2002-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
