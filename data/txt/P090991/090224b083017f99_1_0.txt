Comments        The project did not achieve the overall revised target. While Bogor is already at
(incl. %        the full- cost recovery tariff, Muara Enim and Kapuas will first increase revenue
achievement) through tariff restructuring.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of appraisal, Indonesia achieved impressive economic growth and poverty
reduction; and had re-emerged as a middle-income country. The water supply and sanitation sector
had not kept pace with the country’s remarkable economic performance. The sector remained
stagnant with historically low investment levels of about 0.5 percent of GDP. Water service
coverage was generally low; about 28 percent of the estimated population of 220 million had access
to piped water. In urban areas, only 35 percent had access to piped water and the percentage was
declining. In addition, water services were unreliable and often restricted to a few hours each day.
The operational and management efficiency of the majority of local water utilities, the Perusahaan
Daerah Air Minum (PDAMs) were low. Tariff setting was often politically- based. Non-revenue
water (NRW) was high and there were no incentives for reducing it. Rapid urbanization was also
posing as a challenge. Nearly half of the population lives in urban areas. Growing at a rate of 3.5
percent, the urban population was estimated to reach 167 million (60 percent of the total population)
by 2025. This meant additional demand for water supply services.

2.       The decentralization process that started in 2001 provided local governments, the
Pemerintah Daerah (PEMDAs), with greater autonomy and responsibilities. The provision of
water and sanitation services became responsibility of the PEMDAs, in line with modern practices
of moving services closer to consumers. For water supply services in urban areas, the PEMDAs
“handed over” this responsibility to the PDAMs. However, the incentives for PEMDAs to address
sector issues in a comprehensive manner were not aligned with their mandated responsibilities.
Central government resource transfers were based on the needs of sub-national governments
without consideration of their performance or compliance with national requirements and targets.
In addition, many of the PDAMs were not financially healthy. Around half of the 400 PDAMs held
outstanding loans. About 63 percent of these were in arrears or in default. The MoF accrued about
US$500 million of debt. Many PDAMs also struggled to cover their operating costs and very few
could generate funds to pay for debts or finance new investments. As a result, very little investment
was made for the sector for more than 10 years particularly after the economic crisis in 1997. Urban
piped water coverage was not only able to keep up with the increasing urban population, but it was
also declining.

3.       Recognizing the need to improve and expand water supply services, the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) planned to increase access to safe drinking water to 88 percent by 2015.
Considering the challenges faced by the PDAMs and PEMDAs, the GOI also embarked on a debt-
restructuring program that aimed to resolve PDAMs’ debt arrears and transform the PDAMs into
efficient and financially viable service enterprises that are responsive to consumer demands. The
GOI, through the MOF, also issued Decree No. 53/2006 laying out the procedures for channeling
loans and grants to PEMDAs. PEMDAs should settle past arrears or agree on an orderly debt
rescheduling with the MoF, before applying for a new loan or grant. In case of default, the MoF
can collect overdue debt services by intercepting the transfer of the general allocation funds to the
PEMDA-in-default. The project was envisioned to help GOI achieve its 2015 targets, however,
project preparation took five years to complete because Government’s appetite for official
development assistance was still relatively low during that time.

4.     The World Bank has been supporting the water sector in Indonesia over many years. The
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Indonesia 2009-2012 highlighted the need for investing in



                                                 1
Indonesia’s water institutions by improving services to the poor and addressing the deteriorating
conditions of PDAMs in order to facilitate delivery of water services and to help Indonesia achieve
its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. The Bank particularly attached importance to
this project, as this was the first lending project for the sector after the GOI enacted the
decentralization policy and after a decade of almost zero investment. This project was envisioned
to break the deadlock that prevented investments in the sector and contributed to the deterioration
of urban water supply services. This was also the second on-lending project of MoF to local
governments.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.      The PDO was to improve and expand water supply services in the project areas by
strengthening local water utilities to become operationally efficient and financially sustainable. The
PDO-level indicators were as follows:
    (a) Increment in capacity of production system;
    (b) Increment in number of connections;
    (c) Improvements in customer satisfaction in quality, service hours and reliability of water
        services;
    (d) Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) should be greater than 1.3 (for Bogor only);
    (e) Operating Ratio should not be higher than 1.0.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.      The PDO was not changed. However, the Results Framework was refined to (a) include a
core indicator; (b) clarify definitions of indicators and ensure consistency across all project
documents; and (c) correct and update baseline data and targets. See Section F of Data Sheet, page
7.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      The project did not explicitly identify the primary or secondary beneficiaries. However, it
can be gleaned from the PAD that the project would directly benefit the approximately 62,000
households in the three project areas with new piped water connections and improved water supply
services. It would also benefit the participating PDAMs through improved operational efficiency
and financial sustainability.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

8.      The project was to be achieved through the following:

Part 1: Kota Bogor (West Java) (US$10.95 million). Investments in Bogor comprised of
construction of new water treatment plant adjacent to the Dekeng water treatment plant; upgrading
of existing treatment plant, and implementation of NRW reduction program through the installation
of new water meters and replacement of old pipelines.

Part 2: Kabupaten Kapuas (Central Kalimantan) (US$5.65 million). Investments in Kabupaten
Kapuas consisted of improvements in the water distribution system including the construction of a
water reservoir and installation of water distribution pipelines




                                                  2
Part 3: Kabupaten Muara Enim (South Sumatra) (US$14.58million). Investments included (a)
upgrading and expanding of the Pelita Sari water treatment plant; (b) upgrading of the Talang Jawa
water treatment plant; (c) improving the water distribution network in the Muara Enim and Tanjung
Enim urban areas; and (d) upgrading the Karang Asam water treatment plant.

1.6 Revised Components

9.       The project components were not revised. Some savings from loan amount allowed the
project to finance additional activities. These include (a) new packages for NRW reduction and
new intake and water treatment plant in Bogor, (b) new reservoir in Kapuas, and (c) new
transmission pipeline in Muara Enim.

1.7 Other significant changes

10.     A Level 2 Restructuring was approved by the Country Director on December 22, 2013. It
mainly involved revisions in the Results Framework to ensure that a more efficient set of indicators
are applied during implementation and consistently presented in the Performance Agreements
between local governments and their PDAMs.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

11.      Soundness of background analysis. The project sufficiently captured the issues and
challenges in Indonesia’s water and sanitation sector at the time when decentralization reforms are
sweeping the country. Access to water supply was very low and even declining resulting from lack
of investments in the sector. The PDAMs were operating inefficiently and were financially
unhealthy. Meanwhile, the PEMDAs had deteriorating capital stock, limited resources for
infrastructure development, and weak capacities to implement infrastructure programs. Against this
backdrop, GOI carried out decentralization reforms that gave the PEMDAs more responsibilities
and authority in the delivery of basic public services including water supply. The aim was to make
public services closer and more responsive to the people. The Central Government transferred
ownership of the PDAM to the PEMDA. The PAD recognized the need to improve PEMDA
capacity to effect improvements in the operational and financial conditions of PDAMs and the
water sector in general. Lessons learned, however, were not adequately reflected in project design.
The PAD recognized the need for a careful approach combining reforms and investments for sector
interventions to be sustainable, but the project was designed to be purely capital investments.

12.      Assessment of project design. The PDO was to improve and expand water supply in the
project areas. The project originally envisioned two major sets of activities to achieve the PDO: (1)
technical improvements in water production and distribution (capital investments); and (2)
improvements in PDAMs operational and financial efficiency through capacity- building and
institutional strengthening (reforms). Government, however, had weak appetite in utilizing the loan
proceeds for the latter and decided to exclude this during negotiation. No adjustments were made
to the project design except for continuing to require PEMDAs and PDAMs to comply with
Performance Agreements as part of implementing institutional reforms; and to collaborate with the
Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) to tap the Dutch Trust Fund Indonesia Water and Sanitation
Program (WASAP) for improving the capacity of PDAMs. The collaboration was not properly
assessed and defined. Timing likewise was not aligned as the WASAP component designed to
assist the PDAMs, closed in December 2009, few months after the project became effective. The



                                                 3
project Results Framework, which organizes projects inputs and intended results, was also not
adjusted to take the changes into account. For instance, the project requires the PDAMs to achieve
certain levels of operating efficiency, staffing efficiency, NRW reduction, among others, but there
were limited activities supporting these results. This makes it difficult to link funding with the
reforms or outcomes that the project sought to achieve.

13.      The project was designed to be implemented by the PEMDAs as the final borrowers and
owners of the PDAMs. This was a new approach introduced by the project. The previous modality
was for the PDAMs to borrow directly from the MoF. The project gave sufficient consideration of
the existing conditions, capacities and implications for implementing this approach. It took serious
but conservative consideration of the readiness of PEMDAs and PDAMs to implement the capital
investments and undertake reforms to improve performance. The PAD noted that 20 PDAMs
expressed interest to participate, but only three PDAMs were able to complete the readiness
requirements of the project. The PEMDAs/PDAMs dropped out for various reasons including (a)
the proposed scope and activities did not match the criteria of the SLA, e.g., investment requirement
was too small and the PDAM could use internal funding, (b) project concept was rejected by the
Mayor/Bupati or by the local legislative and (c) lengthy SLA processing procedures.

14.     Risk Assessment. The project had taken into account many risks including: (a) high
connection fees and tariffs that could lead to lack of interest of households to connect; (b) corrupt
practices may delay project implementation and consequently diminish objectives; and (c) PDAMs
may sanction illegal connections, billing, or other corrupt practices. The overall risk of the project
was rated as Moderate, as most of the identified risks were rated Moderate.

15.     Risk mitigation measures were identified and effectively implemented. These include the
conduct of willingness-to-connect surveys and assessment of connection tariffs. These helped the
participating PDAMs to adopt different strategies to attract customers considering their varying
financial capacities, e.g., applying installment programs for those who have difficulties in paying
connection fees; and implement a mechanism (through the Hibah program) to provide connection
fee subsidy for poor households. In addition, procurement activities under the project were publicly
announced and all complaints were reported and properly responded. Finally, annual and audit
processes were conducted for PDAMs to ensure that funds are utilized for intended purposes.

16.      One risk, however, was underestimated at appraisal and the corresponding mitigating
measure was insufficient. This relates to the weak commitment and capacity of PEMDAs and
PDAMs to undertake reforms. To mitigate the impact of this risk, the project proposed to specify
the responsibilities of PEMDAs and PDAMs in achieving agreed benchmarks in the Performance
Agreements. However, there were no concrete measures to help the PEMDAs and PDAMs comply
with the Performance Agreements considering that the project already recognized substantial
capacity gaps. This significantly affected the viability and sustainability of the water supply
investments. For instance, the Performance Agreement require PDAMs to adhere to cost recovery
principles by controlling costs and increasing revenues. Tariffs particularly for Kapuas and Muara
Enim are still below cost-recovery levels, and staffing ratio remain high. Tariff increase in Muara
Enim and Kapuas is difficult as it is still requiring approval from the local legislative. One risk was
also not identified at appraisal but proved to be critical during implementation. This pertains to the
limited capacities of the PDAMs in project implementation particularly in reviewing technical
designs and managing contracts as well as lack of attention to some technical details during the
appraisal. Deficient technical designs required major adjustments, and issues of rights-of-way were
not adequately anticipated and mitigated. These resulted in construction delays and additional costs
that ensued from variation of plans.

17.      Adequacy of government’s commitment, stakeholder involvement and/or
participatory processes. Government commitment was sufficient during preparation. Central
Government was committed to its decentralization reform agenda. It unlocked major bottlenecks
relating to on-lending policies to PEMDAs that facilitated Board approval of this project. The
commitment of the three participating PEMDAs was also very strong. The project was designed to
be demand-driven and the PEMDAs responded with commitment and readiness as evidenced by
their full compliance with project requirements set up by the Central Government.

2.2 Implementation

18.       The factors that affect implementation and outcomes include:

Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencies

         Energy shortages and high petrol prices. The water supply systems in Kapuas and Muara
          Enim face significantly high operational costs as a result of energy shortages in the
          provinces. Black outs happen quite often requiring the PDAMs to use generators, which
          are expensive to operate because petrol prices have increased significantly. Some of the
          units located outside the main urban centers also do not have electricity connections; they
          rely entirely on generators to operate the water supply systems.

         Degradation of quality of raw water sources in Muara Enim and Kota Bogor.
          Significant land use changes in the upstream areas of Kota Bogor’s main water sources and
          increased illegal coal mining activities in upstream areas of one of Muara Enim’s main
          water sources have affected production capacity of both PDAMs. The significant seasonal
          raw water degradation has happened in the last three years and was not anticipated during
          project design and appraisal. The significant increase turbidity sometimes compels the
          PDAMs to temporarily shut down the operation of treatment plants.

Factors generally subject to government control

         Government commitment during implementation. GOI provided policy and
          institutional support to the project. It also provided counterpart funding, although there
          were some delays associated with government’s annual budget allocation process (DIPA).
          DIPA process for almost all lending projects was delayed, as it required legislative
          discussion and approval. There were also some delays resulting from the procedural
          changes at MOF in terms of fund channeling and payment process to the contractors. The
          PEMDAs and their PDAMs also demonstrated commitment to the project. At preparation,
          the PEMDAs hurdled the complicated, lengthy and costly process of sub-borrowing from
          the Central Government and successfully fulfilled all readiness requirements of the project.
          During implementation, they provided annual counterpart funding and in the case of Bogor,
          further expanded water supply investments using own funds. The PEMDAs and PDAMs
          also endeavored to comply with the Performance Agreements even with capacity
          limitations. Bogor managed to improve its Operating Ratio and Debt Service Coverage
          Ratio (DSCR) by expanding coverage, establishing mechanism for automatic tariff
          adjustment every two-year (subject to service improvement) and reducing operating
          expenses. Muara Enim and Kapuas only managed to have modest improved efficiency
          through reduction in NRW and staffing ratio. The PEMDAs were not able to adjust tariffs
          within the project timeframe, as they feel the need to improve water supply services first
          before increasing revenues to be able to generate support from their constituents.



                                                   5
Factors generally subject to implementing agency control

       Implementation capacities and arrangements. The project faced many implementation
        hurdles as a result of the inadequate implementation capacities of PDAMs combined with
        the limited capacity-building support under the project. Among these include substantial
        delays in implementation particularly during project startup. The reasons for the delays
        include the need to (a) rectify deficient technical designs and corresponding technical
        specifications and bill of quantities; (b) resolve right-of-way (ROW) and railway crossing
        issues in Muara Enim, which took more than two years; (c) re-bid procurement packages
        in Muara Enim, among others. Implementation issues were envisioned to be mitigated or
        addressed through the technical support of the PCU Advisory Consultant. However, the
        capacity of the consultant in terms of quality control is limited, possibly because of the
        arrangements of consultant support under the project. Consultancy services under the
        project were to be financed by Government counterpart funds following Government
        procurement procedures. There were limitations in hiring multi-year contracts for
        consultants under GOI regulation. As a result, contract assignment of the consultants did
        not cover the whole project period and there were gaps of consultancy services usually in
        the beginning of calendar year as the contracts had to wait for the activation of government
        budget. Consultant contracts in all project sites ended prior to the completion of
        construction activities. This exposed the project with risk of insufficient monitoring in
        terms of quality of works. Under these circumstances, the Bank Task Team put extra efforts
        in reviewing all technical designs, providing support and training on procurement, financial
        management, environmental and social safeguards and all aspects of project management
        and in the overall PDAMs’ operations.

19.      Mid-term review (MTR). The Task Team conducted the MTR only in December 2013;
three years after loan effectiveness and one year before loan closing. The MTR focused on
unlocking the bottlenecks in implementation, which proved very helpful in completing project
activities and disbursing project funds. Insufficient attention, however, was given in terms of
assessing the relevance, adequacy and appropriateness of project design. Capacity and institutional
issues (linked to the achievement of the PDO and sustainability of outcomes) that emerged during
implementation could have been reviewed and measures to address them could have been
formulated.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

20.      M&E Design. The PDO was to improve and expand water supply in the project areas by
strengthening local water utilities to become operationally efficient and financially sustainable. As
earlier mentioned, the absence of a capacity-building and/or institutional strengthening component
disrupted the logical links between project inputs to envisioned project outcomes. The project did
not have any clear intervention in this aspect except for requiring the PDAMs to comply with
Performance Agreements with their respective PEMDAs but the M&E design includes monitoring
of PDAMs’ improvements in operational efficiency and corporate management. Progress in these
areas could therefore be weakly attributed to the project. Some indicators had flawed or non-
existing baselines and targets; and some were also difficult to quantify and monitor. There are no
indications that the M&E design is well- embedded in the institutional structure of the PDAMs.

21.     M&E Implementation and Utilization. There were difficulties in operationalizing the
key indicators thus; baseline and progress data collection was a struggle. The Task Team and the



                                                 6
PCU refined the Results Framework to clarify the definitions of indicators; ensure consistency
across all project documents; and correct and update baseline data and targets. However, the
structural issues in project design were not addressed.

22.      M&E was planned to be carried out by the PDAM-PIU. Specific persons were put in charge
for technical, financial management and M&E, but they only work on part-time basis because they
are also involved in other PDAM activities. With the PDAMs’ lack of leadership and management
capacity, the structure was not functioning effectively, especially in Muara Enim. Data gathering,
documentation, and reporting both in terms of implementation progress (technical, fiduciary and
safeguards implementation) and achievement of development objectives (results framework)
became a major challenge during implementation. There were delays in submission of reports and
quality of reports was often deficient particularly during the first few years of implementation. The
Task Team carried out, however, intensive supervision to address issues in documentation and
reporting. M&E implementation has significantly improved during the last two years of
implementation. Based on available information, M&E implementation by the PCU and PIUs,
particularly in the early years of implementation, was not adequate and there was limited indication
that M&E data were used to inform project decisions.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

23.      Social Safeguards. The project triggered OP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement. The project
consisted of works with small reversible and easily manageable impacts that were limited mostly
to the construction phase. During project preparation, the Borrower adequately identified potential
adverse project impacts. As project sites were already identified at appraisal, the project prepared
a simple Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (LARAP) for Kabupaten Muara Enim
and land purchasing letter for Kabupaten Kapuas. The LARAP was reviewed and was found to be
consistent with OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. With such simple LARAP, the PDAM- PIUs
capacity to implement it was assessed and found to be adequate.

24.      During implementation, the project complied with the Bank social safeguards policies and
the impacts were adequately managed. Two implementation challenges were identified. The first
relates to the delays relating to the ROW issue under the Muara Enim sub-project. Negotiations to
use the land for transmission pipes between the PEMDA and the railway enterprise took more than
two years, which had considerable impacts on the progress and completion of civil works. And
second, there were documentation and reporting issues at the beginning of the project, especially
concerning safeguards-related issues, including land acquisition. These issues were addressed
during supervision, but these indicated the weak capacity for safeguard implementation, which is a
result of the weak implementation arrangements under the project. Coordination between the PCU
and the PDAM-PIUs in dealing with safeguard issues was wanting. There was no provision in the
project to assign a specific PCU staff to manage safeguards issues, leaving the issue uncovered.
The PIUs’ awareness of the importance of safeguard compliance was likewise inadequate, possibly
due to PCU staffing deficiency and ensuing limited supervision. Staff turnover of PDAM’s during
project preparation and implementation compounded the above issue. The limited safeguard
supervision from the Bank particularly during the early years of project implementation left the
Borrower with limited implementation support. But since the scale of land acquisition is small with
minor and manageable social impacts, with the above issues, the project did not encounter any
social problems during the implementation. From the social safeguard point of view, the project is
moderately satisfactory. It complied with project requirements, only lacking in the quality of
reporting.

25.      Environmental Safeguards. The project was classified as Environmental Category B and
triggered Environmental Assessment (OP4.01). The project was expected to have positive
environmental effects as a result of increased access to potable water. The main environmental
issues envisaged during implementation were water extraction and increasing water demand,
conflict with irrigation, reduced groundwater and surface water level, and increased amount of
wastewater. The PDAMs prepared Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) except for Muara
Enim, which did not require an EMP since investments comprised mainly of small civil works. The
required EMPs (Bogor and Kapuas) were disclosed in the Public Information Center.

26.      One issue that was reported was the landslides caused by heavy downpour at the new water
sources of Bogor and Muara Enim. This delayed the completion of source development activities,
as it required clearing and redesigning of the alignment of transmission pipelines and access road,
which consequently introduced variations to the contract and additional investment cost. In Bogor,
the request for contract variation also identified potential risk because the financing of the
transmission pipeline that links the Bank-funded source development and the distribution system,
including the treatment facility, was assigned as equity of the PDAM. At closing date, the source
development was completed but could not function because the client counterpart had not yet
completed the pipe laying of the transmission pipelines. Likewise, the re-design included the
cutting of the hillside for slope stabilization and access road. The project has addressed the potential
environmental impacts (i.e., the landslide had been cleared) and measures to further manage these
were communicated to PDAM management.

27.      Procurement. The project generally complied with World Bank procurement rules. All
contracts included in the Procurement Plan were awarded. Significant guidance was provided by
the Bank due to the inadequate knowledge of the PIUs of World Bank procurement policies and
procedures and they were expected to procure large number of civil works contract packages. Only
two packages of construction works in Muara Enim required rebidding due to unsuccessful bidding
and these were also subsequently awarded. Mitigation measures were adopted for the rebidding,
and resulted in assignment of new procurement committee, hiring procurement consultants to
provide support, repackaging the contract packages. There were also substantial post-review
findings including cases when the lowest price bidders were disqualified without adequate
justification and these were diligently followed up by the Bank team, clarifications were sought
from PIUs and the Bank provided trainings and advised close attention. To address this, training
on World Bank procurement procedures were provided to the procurement committees. The PIUs
also provided clarification requested by the Bank. The Bank also recommended PCU and PIUs to
provide closer attention to all bidding process to ensure compliance with the requirements set forth
in the Loan Agreement and to avoid repetition of mistakes found in the previous post review audit.

28.      Financial Management. Financial management performance was rated Moderately
Satisfactory and risk rating was Moderate all throughout the life of the project. The project was
consistent in submitting interim financial reports, audit reports on time and in good quality. Follow-
up actions on audit findings were also carried out. In addition, the project always maintains
sufficient record keeping of all transactions. Audit reports were submitted to the Bank on time and
always with unqualified opinion. At the local level, however, accounting for project activities
varied in all project location. PDAM Kuala Kapuas and Muara Enim have not recorded the asset
and local government’s share in PDAM incurred from on-lending activities while PDAM Bogor
has recorded the assets and loan incurred into local government’s financial statements.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

29.      The three PDAMs that participated in this project have been linked to other Government’s
and/or other donor’s programs either as incentives/rewards for PEMDA support in investing for
the sector and/or as assistance to ensure that the investment from this project could be utilized
effectively to further increase service coverage and revenue of the PDAMs that hopefully will lead
to improved overall performance. The Task Team has also been discussing with PEMDAs and
PDAMs for the development of exit strategy as well as discussing with Central Government in
possible follow up activities that could be implemented through the regular technical assistance
from the DG Cipta Karya. Key activities that should be included as priority in each PDAM have
been identified and conveyed to the PEMDAs and PDAMs during the last mission and will be re-
stated in the planned closing workshop of the project. The Bank is also in discussion with the
Government in establishing a more systematic and continuous M&E mechanism as part of the
proposed National Urban Water Supply Development Project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

30.      Relevance of objectives is High. The PDO was highly relevant to the country conditions
at the time of appraisal and remains highly relevant when the project closed in December 2014.
The need to improve and expand water supply services remains a high priority of the GOI. GOI
planned to reach 88 percent to increase access to safe drinking water by 2015, but its current
achievement is reported at 68 percent; thus, having a gap of 20 percent. The PDO is also fully
aligned with the World Bank Country Partnership Strategy for Indonesia for 2013-2015. It supports
the ‘Infrastructure and Strengthening the Public Sector agenda’ of the Pro-Growth pillar and
‘Improving Health Outcomes agenda’ of the Pro-Poor pillar of the Strategy. The Bank indicated
continued support to GOI increasing access to safe water and sanitation as a means of achieving
better health and overall welfare of Indonesians.

31.      Relevance of design and implementation is Modest. The project was designed as largely
capital investment. This remains essential to improve and expand the provision of water supply
services in Indonesia. However, the project would have been more relevant and its outcomes are
more likely to be sustained when capital investment is accompanied by support for capacity
building and institutional strengthening. The GOI provided funds for capacity- building, but
implementation was constrained by government budget processes. During implementation, it
established, through the MoPW, collaboration between the project and other programs to provide
technical assistance and capacity-building programs conducted by DG Cipta Karya and Badan
Pendukung Pengembangan Sistem Penyediaan Air Minum (BPPSPAM). It would have been more
relevant and effective if these efforts designed and carried out to take into account the capacity
requirements of the participating PEMDAs and PDAMs under the project.

32.     Physical investments were implemented within the agreed timeframe and without major
hurdles. The project was able to achieve most of its physical targets. In the case of Bogor, the
PDAM was able to achieve targets for cost recovery and operating ratio due to increase in service
improvements (coverage) facilitated by the project. During restructuring additional funds were
allocated to activities aimed at reducing NRW to improve operational efficiency.




                                                9
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

33.     The PDO was to improve and expand water supply services in the project areas by
strengthening local water utilities to become operationally efficient and financially sustainable.
PDO achievement was envisaged to be measured using the following indicators: (a) increment in
capacity of production system; (b) increment in number of connections; (c) improvements in
customer satisfaction in quality, service hours and reliability of water services; (d) DSCR should
be greater than 1.3 (for Bogor only); and (e) Operating Ratio should not be higher than 1.

Objective 1: Improve and expand water supply services in the project

34.       Achievement of the project for first objective is rated Substantial based on the following:

         The project originally targeted to increase production capacity by 2,990 l/s. The target was
          increased to 3,267 during restructuring. At completion, the installed overall production
          capacity of the water supply systems rehabilitated/constructed under the project was
          increased by 2,935 l/s. The project achieved 90 percent of the revised target and 100 percent
          of the original target. For Muara Enim, the total production capacity has decreased despite
          the additional new treatment plants built under this project. This is because some areas
          previously served by PDAM Muara Enim have been transferred to a new district. The
          targeted production capacity in Bogor could not be achieved, as there was an
          underestimated design factor. It was expected that the additional filter, backwashing
          facilities and rehabilitation of sedimentation to uprate the existing Dekeng 1 WTP could
          increase the production capacity up to 1,400 l/s from 1,000 l/s. However with the
          degradation of raw water sources (average turbidity is worse than the design), this designed
          capacity could not be achieved.

         The original target for total household connections was 162, 238. This was increased to
          173, 808 during restructuring. At completion the project achieved 173,547. This reflects
          99.6 percent of the revised target and 107 percent of the original target.

         The project did not have targets for new household connections. The target adopted at
          restructuring was 26,650. The project achieved 190 percent of this target.

         There were no targets for improvements in customer satisfaction at appraisal. During
          restructuring, the project targeted to achieve: (a) 100 percent satisfaction in water quality,
          (b) 17- hour of water supply services; and (c) 93 percent satisfaction in terms of complaint
          handling. A beneficiary survey was conducted in February 2015 to assess the level of
          satisfaction of households in water supply provision under the project. The survey covered
          409 respondents selected through clustered random sampling in areas directly affected by
          the project. Results show that 89 percent of the respondents are satisfied with the improved
          water supply services. Almost all respondents in Bogor (97 percent) expressed that they
          are satisfied with the PDAM’s water supply services. In Kapuas and Muara Enim, the
          percentages are lower at 81 percent and 75 percent, respectively. Almost all respondents in
          Bogor are enjoying 24 hour of water supply per day. They consider water pressure as
          medium to high and water quality as good. In Kapuas, 85 percent consider water pressure
          as high to medium and only 66 percent consider water quality as good. Respondents in
          Muara Enim expressed low satisfaction because of the limited service hours of water
          supply, i.e., 8 hours a day only. Only 58 percent consider water quality as good. Some
          respondents reported that water has bad smell and is turbid especially during rainy season.



                                                   10
          The survey also showed that majority of the respondents felt improvement in PDAM’s
          services in the last three years. The highest was given in Bogor (99.6 percent), followed by
          Kapuas (92 percent) and Muara Enim (85 percent). Finally, water tariff is considered fair
          and affordable by 87 percent, 78 percent and 77 percent of respondents in Bogor, Muara
          Enim and Kapuas, respectively.

         The survey further showed that households consider making water services regular and
          providing safe and clean water as the most important benefits resulting from the project.

         Women are also perceived to have benefited the most from water supply improvements as
          reported by 88 percent of the respondents because direct access to water supply helps them
          in doing households chores. It is also more convenient and safe to have running water
          inside of the house as they do not have to go outside especially at night.

         Furthermore, the survey revealed that there were significant changes in sanitation behavior
          of household- respondents. The percentage of ownership of household sanitation facility
          has increased from 74 percent to 93 percent in Bogor, 96 to 99 percent in Muara Enim and
          70 to 89 percent in Kapuas. Having house connection to piped water supply has triggered
          the households to also invest in sanitation facilities. The increase in access to improved
          sanitation will likely increase wastewater generation. This will have to be addressed in the
          immediate future so as not to aggravate pollution in groundwater and surface water.

Objective 2: Strengthen water utilities to become operationally efficient and financially
sustainable.

35.       Achievement of the project for second objective is rated Modest .

         In terms of financial viability indicators, Bogor achieved an Operating ratio of less than 1.
          The achievement is even less than the baseline value. Bogor also achieved DSCR of 3.28.
          Bogor achieved operational efficiency as a result of service improvements fostered under
          the project. It was also able to improve its financial efficiency because tariffs are set at cost
          recovery levels and there is already mechanism for automatic tariff adjustment every two-
          years subject to PDAM’s performance improvement. Thus, revenue stream became robust.
          The PDAM was also able to reduce operating expenses. For operating ratio, Muara Enim
          only achieved the original target Ratio while Kapuas did not achieve agreed original and
          revised targets.

         There was reduction in NRW as a result of the capital investments under the project even
          as the project did not achieve the agreed target for NRW reduction. Bogor managed to
          reduce NRW by 1.3 percent, Kapuas by 10.8 percent and Muara Enim by 1.8 percent.

         Bogor achieved staffing per 1,000 connections with 4.43 staff per 1,000 connections
          against the target of 5 staff per 1,000 connections. Kapuas has showed improvements from
          10.13 to 8.53 staff per 1,000 connections and has almost achieved the target of 8.53 staff
          per 1,000 connections. Muara Enim has also improved from 9.07 to 8.87 staff per 1, 000
          connections and almost achieved the target of 7.28 staff per 1000 connections. Kapuas and
          Muara Enim need to rationalize staffing further.

         Kapuas achieved tariff collection efficiency while Bogor and Muara Enim need to improve
          further.

3.3 Efficiency

36.      Economic and Financial Analyses. At appraisal, economic analysis was conducted for the
three project areas: Bogor, Kapuas and Muara Enim. Quantifiable benefits were assumed to accrue
from (a) increased consumption due to improved services and accessibility by existing and new
customers; (b) saved water due to improved efficiencies; (c) amount of water consumed with the
new connections valued at the difference between the price charged and cost of water without
connections; and (d) time saved from collecting water at the minimum income prevailing in the
area. Quantifiable costs included investment costs (capital expenditures) and operating costs.
Inflation, depreciation and taxes were deducted. The investment period is 20 years.

37.     Financial analysis was also carried out. Quantifiable financial benefits were assumed to
come from additional water sales over the 20- year period and the connection fees collected during
the project period while financial costs covered investment costs, incremental power and chemical
costs and salary costs. Salary costs, power and chemical costs were assumed to increase with
production and inflation. At completion, economic and financial analyses were carried out. The
analyses followed the same methodology at appraisal to make better comparison between appraisal
stage and completion stage. Many of the assumptions during appraisal, particularly for Muara Enim
and Kapuas, no longer hold at completion. For instance, revenues are expected to increase based
on tariff increases. There were no tariff increases within the project implementation period.
Chemical and electrical costs are expected to increase at the rate of inflation. However, this was
not the case during implementation. The PAD noted that these were major assumptions given the
financial history of the PDAMs and were deemed necessary to reach operating ration less than 1.

38.      Results show that Bogor, Kapuas and Muara Enim still have positive ENPVs and EIRRs
indicating evident combination of direct benefits, consumer surplus and time savings. The NPV
and EIRR are particularly high in Bogor because of the higher actual number of household
connections. Bogor only intended to reach 114, 988 connections as indicated in the PAD, but it
actually achieved 129, 312 connections as of loan closing.

39.      The financial analysis showed mixed results. In the case of Bogor, the FNPV and FIRR
remain positive. Bogor was able to improve operating efficiency by automatically increasing tariffs
annually at the rate of inflation. Tariff rates in Bogor are set at cost-recovery levels. Bogor was also
able to reduce operating expenses. The FNPVs in the case of Muara Enim and Kapuas are negative
and the FIRRs lower than the hurdle rates. The PDAMs in these areas were unable to adjust tariffs.
Current tariff levels are set at low levels that the PDAMs are unable to recover costs. In addition,
operational expenses are unsustainably high because of high-energy costs. The table below shows
the financial and economic IRR and NPVs for all project sites at appraisal and at completion.

 FIRR (%)               22            15            19          -            26          -

40.     Unit Cost Analysis. The table below shows that the cost per household connection in Bogor
in the amount of IDR 14.87 is lower than the average for all PDAMs in Indonesia. On the other
hand, cost per household connection in Muara Enim is higher than the average. In the case of
Kapuas, unit costs is more than twice the average for all PDAMs in the country. These results are


                                                  12
consistent with the economic and financial analyses above. Bogor has achieved economies of scale
and financial viability while Muara Enim and Kapuas would need to improve their operations and
expand connections. However, the PDAMs are severely constrained by increasing electricity costs.

       increase in investments in a year over additional number of connections. Unit cost assumed
       to increase at the annual average rate of inflation.

41.      Efficiency in Implementation. The project was completed within the timeline determined
at appraisal. The MoF considers this as commendable considering that 60- 70 percent of projects
supported by official development assistance require project extensions. The project was also able
to generate savings, which were used to finance additional activities in all project locations that
will allow the three PDAMs to further improve services (more continuous supply) and additional
potential new connections.

42.     Efficiency is rated Modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

43.     Overall Outcome Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

44.      The PDO remains highly relevant to the current priorities of GOI. It is also well aligned
with the World Bank’s strategy for Indonesia. However, the project did not fully take into account
lessons from previous experiences, and there were shortcomings in project design. Thus, Relevance
of objectives was rated High and relevance of design and implementation was rated Modest. In
terms of achievement of objectives, the improvement and expansion of water supply is rated
Substantial, whereas the strengthening of water utilities is rated modest. The overall efficiency is
rated as Modest. Results show that Bogor, Kapuas and Muara Enim have positive ENPVs and
EIRRs indicating evident combination of direct benefits, consumer surplus and time savings.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

45.     The project has contributed to improving the quality of life of residents in Bogor, Muara
Enim and Kapuas by increasing access to water supply services. Poverty considerations were
included in setting the affordable level of water tariffs. Water expenditures should not exceed 4
percent of monthly income or expenditures of households belonging to the lowest quintiles. Results
of the beneficiary survey show that water expenditures shares around 3 percent of total household
expenditures, which remain below the nationally set level of 4 percent.



                                                  13
46.     The project also facilitated access of women to water supply services. Women are
considered to have benefited the most from improved water supply, as revealed by the beneficiary
survey. Having running water inside the house helps with household chores. It also provides safer
and more convenient water sources, as they do not have to go outside to fetch water, especially at
night.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

47.      The project had limited, if not, negligible impact on longer-term capacity and institutional
development of PEMDAs and PDAMs. Central Government through the DG Cipta Karya of
MoPW attempted to provide technical assistance and capacity buildings to the PDAMs through
their various technical assistance programs funded by other donors or by central government budget.
However, these TAs and capacity- building activities were only for specific topics (NRW reduction
and GIS development), conducted only over short period, and was more in ad-hoc basis. Also, there
was no M&E of the impacts of these activities and on whether PDAMs implement actions to follow
up and/or to further develop and utilize the technical assistance.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

48.      The three participating PDAMs were able to generate savings. These were used to finance
additional water supply investments that will bring additional benefits in terms of increased access
(new household connections) and/or extra storage to allow longer operational hours. In Kapuas,
savings were used to build a new 500m3 reservoir in Anjir, a fast growing new area, allowing longer
operational hours and increasing the number of connections in this area. In Muara Enim, savings
were used to connect distribution system to reservoir built by APBD to allow more storage and
reliable system. In Bogor, savings were used to finance investments in NRW reduction and new
intake and water treatment plant.

49.     Participation in this project was also used to leverage funding from Central Government
and other donors. The three PDAMs received incentives from the Hibah program to allow PEMDAs
(through PDAMs) to provide connection for the poor households. PDAM Muara Enim and Kapuas
also received incentives through the IKK program to increase their production capacity to enable
them to expand service area outside of the main urban center.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

50.     Results of social benefit survey revealed that there is generally positive perception on the
impact of the project to the communities. In all locations, most respondents said that water supply
condition is better or at least stable compared to three years ago. Very small proportion mentioned
that supply is worse and these are mainly from the locations of where new facilities are not in full
operation yet (Muara Enim Zone in Muara Enim and Anjir Zone in Kapuas).

51.      Inputs from the stakeholder workshops also revealed positive perceptions from the
PEMDAs and PDAMs. Especially in Muara Enim and Kapuas, through this project, PEMDAs and
PDAMs have gained new experience and knowledge especially in managing and implementing
relatively big investments, boosting their confidence in further improving and expanding their
water supply services. However, PEMDAs and PDAMs expressed their hope of more guidance and
support from the Central Government especially in the monitoring and evaluation, as well as in

Workshop

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

53.     The degrees of sustainability of the development outcomes generated by the project are
uneven, with Bogor showing high likelihood of sustainability and less likelihood for Muara Enim
and Kapuas. Key elements necessary to sustain and expand water supply are present in the case of
Bogor. Production volume of water has increased through the project, which can still be used to
expand water supply coverage. The PDAM has already started to expand water supply services.
Bogor is relatively in good financial standing. Tariffs are set at cost-recovery level and adjustments
are automatically carried out yearly based on inflation rates. Revenues are more than sufficient to
cover operating costs.

54.     In Muara Enim and Kapuas, the risk that development outcomes is not sustained is high.
The PDAMs continue to operate at unsustainable levels. Operating costs are higher than revenues.
Tariffs are yet to be adjusted to cost-recovery levels. The PEMDAs and PDAMs expressed
commitment to improve customer database and adjust tariffs, however, unless these actions are
materialized in the near future, the benefits generated by the project will not be sustained. Muara
Enim and Kapuas need to further exert effort to improve their financial situation.

55.      The lack of a mechanism to monitor and follow up compliance of participating PEMDAs
and PDAMs with the Performance Agreement after the project has closed. This also poses as a
significant threat to sustainability. There is a need for the PEMDAs and the PDAMs to sustain
efforts to comply with the agreed actions outlined in the Agreement including: (a) maintaining the
principle of financial and administrative autonomy from the PEMDAs; (b) adhering to cost
recovery principles by controlling costs and increasing revenues; (c) reducing the rate of NRW to
an acceptable level; (d) expanding coverage; and managing staffing costs.

56.      The participating PEMDAs and PDAMs likewise need to institute stricter policies in
dealing with non-paying and late payment of customers so that they will be able to improve
collection efficiency.

57.     Scaling up the gains initiated by the project on a national scale is not likely to happen in
the short term and this may further delay the achievement of the development goals in the sector
towards achieving improved access and expanded water supply and sanitation services, unless key
reforms (i.e. financial, institutional and regulatory) are instituted.

58.     Overall risk to development outcome is rated High.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

59.       Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
Bank Team did sound background analyses of the water supply and local government sectors. It
was also able to correctly assess the needs and shortcomings of the sectors. The Team particularly
identified the need for reforms and capacity building to address the weak capacities and
unsustainable operations of the PDAMs. However, these were not incorporated in project design.
The Results Framework did not follow a logical sequencing of activities, outputs and outcomes
because of the absence of the institutional strengthening/capacity-building component, which is
critical in achieving and sustaining project outcomes. Consequently, the M&E framework for the
project became flawed.

60.     The Team did not make any adjustments in project design when the capacity-building
component was dropped as a result of government’s weak appetite to utilize the loan for this
purpose. Capacity building was linked to WASAP, but there were no strong linkages to reforms
during the project implementation, thus, leaving the Project as purely a capital investment program.
It was clear that the reforms are critical elements to achieve efficiency and sustainability. As this
was already identified during the appraisal stage, the Bank and the Task Team should have
proactively convinced the GOI not to drop this critical component

(b) Quality of Supervision

61.      Bank performance at supervision is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Bank supervision
was weak and limited during the early years of project implementation. This was exacerbated
several changes in Task Team Leaders and team members. Supervision significantly improved in
the latter years of project implementation, as the frequency of supervision missions increased. The
Task Team was proactive in addressing challenges. Supervision inputs were considered useful by
implementing agencies. The project was completed within the timeframe determined at appraisal.
The Task Team also continues to provide technical support even after loan closing to ensure
adequate transition. The conduct of the MTR was delayed and focused only on resolving
implementation issues. The failure to conduct the MTR on time and revisit project design including
M&E was a missed opportunity for the Task Team to formulate measures or redirect the project to
generate greater and more sustainable outcomes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

62.    Bank performance in ensuring quality of entry and the quality of Bank supervision are rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory. Overall Bank performance is, thus, rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

63.     At the national level, MoF, as the Borrower, and MoPW, through the PCU as the oversight
agency, demonstrated commitment to implement a decentralized approach to water supply
provision. It provided policy and institutional support and counterpart funding to the project.




                                                 16
64.      GOI was not fully prepared to help PDAMs carry out reforms. The MoPW focused more
on physical accomplishments and completion of activities. It did not give adequate attention on the
soft interventions. The MoPW, which heavily relied on consultants, which limited GOI’s capacity
to strengthen the PEMDAs and PDAMs. GOI’s lack of appetite to utilize loan to provide technical
assistance and capacity- building was unfortunate, as it was a missed opportunity to initiate and
institutionalize reforms in the water sector.

65.     Government performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
66.      Following consultation with the beneficiaries/stakeholders of the water utility, PDAM
committed itself to enter into Performance Agreement with PEMDA which confirmed participation
in the project, including agreement to borrow, to allocate funds from the local budget, and to agree
to the use of the intercept provision. PEMDA’s loan from MoF is then passed on to PDAM
mirroring the terms of the loan as well as the obligations towards achievement of development
objectives. As a pilot facility, Project implementation experienced snags and obstacles to initiate
sub-project activities, including its readiness to enter into a subsidiary loan agreement and the lack
of competent unit and staff to implement the projects. Even with the commitment to resolve issues
in a timely manner, the lack of technical capacity to comply with the covenants (i.e. fiduciary,
safeguards and M&E) has further drawn back project execution. Supervision shortcomings were
complemented by consultants who are time bound. The Bank task team has to extend continued
advisory support to the participating PDAMs and PEMDAs to ensure efficient transition
arrangements after the loan closing. As there were significant shortcomings, which could have
been immediately addressed, implementing agencies performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
67.     Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The implementing
agencies were unable to create a dedicated unit with competent staff to strengthen its capacity are
seen as significant shortcomings.

6. Lessons Learned

68.     The following lessons generated from the project may be considered in shaping the design
and implementation of future programs and projects in Indonesia’s water supply and sanitation
sector.

a) The absence of reform component accompanying public investment is likely to result in
   unsustainable improvement and expansion of water supply. This ICR reiterates the lessons
   identified at appraisal that the gains generated through capital investments can only be
   sustained when accompanied by reforms to improve the financial and operational capacities of
   the PDAMs. The technical assistance component initially proposed by the project should have
   been retained to enhance the performance of the participating PEMDAs and PDAMs
   particularly in complying with the principles outlined in their respective Performance
   Agreements. The absence of this component delayed the project implementation to resolve
   financial and institutional capacity issues during the initial years of implementation. These
   obstacles affected the delivery of the project outcomes and were not able to sustain as a national
   program. As the sector issues remain relevant to date, future operations should institute sector
   reforms to complement the roll out of a performance-based type of programs to improve and
   expand WSS services. This component could have been also used to set a mechanism linking
   the Central Government, PDAMs and PEMDAs in monitoring and following up compliance to


                                                 17
      the Performance Agreements even after the project has closed. The GOI may consider
      designing a holistic reform program that will complement any investment in the water sector.
      Sanitation should be an integral part of the program to optimize the development impacts of
      the reforms and investments. In addition, it may consider the establishment of Performance
      Audit System at the PEMDA- level on water and sanitation to monitor the performance of
      PDAMs that dovetails the Performance Agreements between PEMDAs and PDAMs.

b) The varying financial and implementation capacities, and creditworthiness PEMDAs and
   PDAMs will require different levels and forms of financing and technical support. The
   design of any policy, program, project or financing arrangements should carefully take this into
   account. The sub-loan agreement (SLA) arrangement that focuses only on physical investments
   may be more suitable for PEMDAs and PDAMs with relatively strong capacity. The amount
   of investment should be adjusted depending on the management capacities of the
   PEMDAs/PDAMs.

c) Under the decentralized environment wherein PEMDAs have more responsibilities in the
   provision of water supply services, the Central Government still continues to play a role
   particularly in initiating sector reforms, incentivizing and regulating the performance of
   PEMDAs. In so doing, Central Government agencies also need continued capacity
   strengthening support. Experience from the project reveals that Central Government oversight
   agencies should initiate the reforms such as the strengthening of sector units within MoPW on
   its technical and oversight functions, MoF on the policy and financing responsibilities, and
   PEMDAs in their supervision accountability over PDAMs to ensure efficiency and
   sustainability of future programs. There is a need to develop a financing framework for the
   water supply and sanitation sector that enables the Central Government to map and categorized
   PEMDAs and PDAMs capacity and provide the financing/investment mechanisms in
   accordance to the capacity. The GOI should also consider the institutionalization of an
   independent national regulatory office to ensure that national targets and performance
   standards are met.

d) While leveraging and collaboration with other programs are generally beneficial as these
   allow projects to generate opportunities for expanding financial and technical resources
   and create greater synergy and wider impact, it is important to carefully consider and
   define the timing, resources, design and arrangements for collaboration to ensure that
   intended objectives are met. Capacity-building and institutional strengthening activities were
   envisioned to be implemented through collaboration with the WSP- WASAP. However, timing
   was not aligned; the WSP-WASAP closed few months after the project became effective. The
   Bank Team and GOI were unable identify and recognize the impact of the failed collaboration.
   This became detrimental to the project, as the collaboration was vital to fully achieving and
   sustaining project development outcomes.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analyses

1. Economic and financial analyses were conducted for water supply investments in three project
   areas: Bogor, Kapuas and Muara Enim. The total project costs covered by the analyses during
   PAD preparation is USD 23.6 million (100%) and USD 20.49 million (87%) at project
   completion.

2. The analyses followed the same methodology at appraisal (incremental economic analysis) to
   make better comparison of project efficiency between appraisal stage and completion stage.
   For economic analysis, the impact of the project on the economy is based on the incremental
   benefits and costs.

3. Quantifiable benefits include: (a) increased consumption due to improved services and
   accessibility by existing and new customers, which is computed in terms of the additional
   amount of water consumed by existing and new customers multiplied by the average tariff of
   water; (b) consumer surplus or the amount of water consumed with the new connections valued
   at the difference between the price charged and cost of water without connections; (c) time
   saved from collecting water, which is measured as the average amount of time that households
   saved multiplied by the prevailing minimum household income in the area; and (d) saved water
   or the value of the reduction of NRW. For benefit (a) and (d), the analysis used historical data
   provided by the three PDAMs. For benefit (b), the appraisal did not provide the assumptions
   for arriving at the “cost of water without connections”. The analysis therefore used proxy value
   on the cost of water without connections, that is, a fraction (conservatively set at 10%) of the
   average expenses incurred by households using generators. Information on household expenses
   on water was provided by a study conducted by the Water and Sanitation Program. For benefit
   (c), time saved is conservatively estimated at 30 minute/day. The Beneficiary Survey provided
   information on the minimum household income in the project sites.

4. Quantifiable costs included investment costs (capital expenditures) and operating costs.
   Inflation, depreciation and taxes were deducted. The investment period is 20 years. External
   additional benefits including those of improved health and environment were excluded. At
   appraisal, there was no discussion as to how much taxes were deducted. At ICR, it assumed to
   be 10 percent of the investment and operational costs.

5. For financial analysis, quantifiable benefits were assumed to come from additional water sales
   over the 20- year period and the connection fees collected during the project period while
   financial costs covered investment costs, incremental power and chemical costs and salary
   costs. Salary costs, power and chemical costs were assumed to increase with production and
   inflation.

6. Many of the assumptions during appraisal, particularly for Muara Enim and Kapuas, no longer
   hold at completion. For instance, revenues were expected to increase based on tariff increases.
   There were no tariff increases within the project implementation period. Chemical and energy
   costs were expected to increase only at the rate of inflation. However, this was not the case
   during implementation. Costs of electricity were higher that anticipated at appraisal. Reduction
   in staffing that would help the PDAMs reach an operating ratio less than 1 was also not reached.

Results

7. Results show water supply investments in all project sites still have positive ENPVs and EIRRs
   indicating evident combination of direct benefits, consumer surplus and savings in time and
   water. The NPV and EIRR are particularly high in Bogor because of the higher actual number
   of household connections. Bogor only intended to reach 114, 988 connections as indicated in
   the PAD, but it actually achieved 129, 312 connections as of loan closing.

8. The financial analysis showed mixed results. In the case of Bogor, the FNPV and FIRR remain
   positive. Bogor was able to improve operating efficiency by automatically increasing tariffs
   annually at the rate of inflation. Tariff rates in Bogor are set at cost-recovery levels. Bogor was
   also able to reduce operating expenses. The FNPVs in the case of Muara Enim and Kapuas are
   negative and the FIRRs lower than the hurdle rates. The PDAMs in these areas were unable to
   adjust tariffs. Current tariff levels are set at very low levels that the PDAMs are unable to
   recover costs. In addition, operational expenses are unsustainably high because of high-energy
   costs. The table below shows the financial and economic IRR and NPVs for all project sites at
   appraisal and at completion. For the water supply systems of Muara Enim and Kapuas to be
   financially viable, the PEMDAs and PDAMs will need to implement the actions in the
   Performance Agreement including increasing tariff rates, and reducing staffing ratio, among
   others.

9. Unit Cost Analysis. The table below shows that the cost per household connection in Bogor in
   the amount of IDR 14.87 is lower than the average for all PDAMs in Indonesia. On the other
   hand, cost per household connection in Muara Enim is higher than the average. In the case of
   Kapuas, unit costs is more than twice the average for all PDAMs in the country. These results
   are consistent with the economic and financial analyses above. Bogor has achieved economies
   of scale and financial viability while Muara Enim and Kapuas would need to improve their
   operations and expand connections. However, the PDAMs are severely constrained by
   increasing electricity costs.

10. Efficiency in Implementation. The project was completed within the proposed timeline. There
    were no extensions. The MoF considers this as commendable considering that 60- 70 percent
    of projects supported by official development assistance require project extensions. The project
    was also able to generate savings, which were used to finance additional activities in all project
    locations that will allow the three PDAMs to further improve services (more continuous
    supply) and additional potential new connections.

11. Efficiency is rated Modest.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1. A Social Beneficiary Survey was conducted to assess potential outcomes and impact of
   project’s interventions as perceived by the main project’s beneficiaries, i.e., communities
   served by the PDAMs. The quasi- quantitative-qualitative approach was applied to capture the
   perceived project benefits and outcomes. A set of questionnaire was prepared . The survey was
   conducted in February 2015, about two months after project completion, in Kota Bogor,
   Kabupaten Kapuas and Kabupaten Muara Enim. Respondents were selected using clustered
   random sampling from the areas directly affected by the project and purposively heavy on poor
   to middle income households. A total of 409 households were surveyed, consisted of 209
   households in Kota Bogor (Zone 3 and 4), 80 in Kapuas (Kuala Kapuas, Barimba and Anjir)
   and 100 in Muara Enim (Muara Enim and Tanjung Enim).

2. Kota Bogor is a municipality located in West Java, a short drive from Jakarta. Muara Enim is
   a district located in South Sumatera, about six hour drive from the province’s capital and
   nearest airport. Kapuas is a district in Central Kalimantan but it is located near the border, along
   the Trans Kalimantan Road about two hours from the nearest airport. As a municipality in West
   Java, Bogor is fully developed in term of basic services compared to other two locations.
   Kapuas is the least developed area. In Bogor, poor households are spread across the city while
   in Muara Enim and Kapuas the concentration of poverty is mostly in rural areas. Average
   household size in the three locations is 5 people per household. Some houses are occupied by
   more than one family.

3. PDAM Kota Bogor has already a well-established tariff structure to accommodate various
   household conditions and category of consumption. In Muara Enim and Kapuas, tariff structure
   is not yet well developed and they only have one tariff category for domestic customer
   regardless different class of welfare and/or conditions. In Kota Bogor, tariff R1 and R2 are
   applied for low income to middle income households. In Muara Enim and Kapuas, tariff for
   low- income households is classified as social tariff and only exist for sub-district water supply
   systems outside the urban centers.

4. The average household expenditure for water in all three locations is still below the national
   standard of maximum 4 percent. In Kota Bogor, the households spend in average 2.50 percent
   of their expenditure to buy or pay for water services. In Muara Enim and Kapuas, the average
   expenditure for water is 2.45 percent and 1.78 percent respectively.

5. Results of Socio-Economic Benefit Survey

    a) Dependency on Piped Water Supply. In all three locations, dependency to piped water
       services from PDAM is relatively high, especially in Kota Bogor. Some respondents still
       use clean water from other sources as well depending on location and season.

    b) Perception on Tariff, Water Quality and Continuity of Supply. Majority of respondents
       perceive the current water tariff in all three locations as fair. Only 20 percent of respondent
       in Muara Enim perceived water tariff as expensive, 17 percent in Kapuas, and only 7
       percent in Bogor.

    c) In term of water quality, almost 100 percent respondents Bogor received good water quality.
       Only about 3 percent complained about chlorine taste and smell or turbidity. In Kapuas and
       Muara Enim, less respondents are satisfied with water quality, only 66 percent in Kapuas
       and 58 percent in Muara Enim. Most complaints were due to the turbidity. However, water


                                                  26
    quality test results done by the local health department showed that water quality supplied
    by the three PDAMs are in compliance with the national drinking water standard.

d) Continuity of supply is still an issue especially in some locations in Muara Enim and
   Kapuas. 80 Percent of respondents in Muara Enim have less than 12 hours supply and only
   8 percent receive 24 hours supply. In Kapuas, only 33 percent receive 24 hours supply and
   there are still 22 percent have less than 12 hours of supply. Kota Bogor has a better situation
   with all respondents have more than 12 hours of supply and 85 percent already received
   continuous supply for 24 hours per day.

e) Perception on Project Impact. Perception on project’s impacts/benefits is assessed by
   comparing the PDAM service after project completion (during survey period) and three
   years ago when construction activities were mostly not started. The respondents were asked
   on the level of satisfaction on PDAM’s service and the reasons of dissatisfaction, water
   supply condition, as well as the benefits of having access to piped water services.

f) Compared to three years ago, majority of respondents feel that water supply condition is
   better or at least the same. More than 75 percent of respondents are satisfied with water
   supply condition and more than 82 percent said that PDAMs’ service is satisfactory. The
   level of satisfaction is influenced by water quality, reliability of water supply, respond from
   PDAM and availability of information received by the customers. The top three reasons
   for dissatisfaction include inadequate respond, meter inaccuracy and inadequate
   information/communication.

g) Most respondents mentioned that having PDAM water connection provide more
   convenient access to clean and safe water at home, family members become clean and
   healthy and reducing water borne diseases. Having water connection at home also helps
   women in household chores providing more productive time for adults and more time for
   children to learn and play.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1. Stakeholder workshops were conducted in Kapuas (on April 29, 2015), Muara Enim (on May
   5, 2015) and Jakarta (June 4-5, 2015). All workshops were well attended by the PCU and PIUs,
   high level officials from the local governments, representatives from local parliaments and
   PDAMs. Workshop in Jakarta was intended as closing workshop, opened by the Director of
   Water Supply Development of DG Cipta Karya, Ministry of Public Works and Housing
   (MoPWH) and attended by representatives from the Ministry of Finance (MoF), BAPPENAS,
   and Directorate Program Development of DG Cipta Karya. During the Jakarta workshop,
   participants from Muara Enim and Kapuas also had an opportunity to visit and learn from
   PDAM Kota Bogor.

2. Through the workshops, draft ICR from the Bank team and PCR from the PCU were shared
   and discussed with the PIUs, Local Governments and PDAMs to provide them better
   understanding of the evaluation and assessment process of project design and implementation.
   The workshops also provided opportunities for the PIUs to share their experiences and lessons
   learned from the project, as well as to identify their next steps and follow up actions to ensure
   sustainable utilization of the facilities built under the project.

3. In the closing workshop in Jakarta, a panel discussion with Central Government officials (from
   DG Cipta Karya of MoPWH, Bappenas and MoF) and representatives from local governments
   was conducted to provide opportunity for them to share their views on the project starting from
   the preparation until project completion. Through the discussion, lessons learned from the
   project have been identified that could provide valuable feedback for better design and
   implementation of the future programs.

4. Results from the three workshops could be summarized as follow:

    a) The project has been considered to be successful in terms of timely completion and good
       disbursement rate. Despite years of preparation and delays in project commencement
       (particularly for Muara Enim), the project was completed as planned in December 31, 2014
       without extension. About 60-70 percent of projects funded by loans require extension and
       have slow disbursement rate.

    b) There were issues and challenges that impacted project preparation and early stage of
       project implementation. The project was prepared at the time where the use of loan funds
       only allowed for revenue generating sectors (i.e. water supply, market and bus terminal).
       The project was initially planned to work with over 20 LGs/PDAMs but the implementing
       regulation for fund channeling from MOF to LGs was not yet developed. As the result,
       project preparation was not progressing. Only in 2006, when the MOF decree on fund
       channeling to LGs was enacted, the project preparation was continued. However, this MOF
       decree was accompanied with stricter readiness criteria. As the result, only three LGs could
       meet the readiness criteria to participate in this project. The introduction of the stricter
       criteria to include approval from the local parliament (DPRD) and intercept of general
       budget allocation by MOF in the case of loan default, was seemed to be necessary by the
       MOF to ensure LGs/PDAMs commitment in fulfilling their obligation in loan repayment
       and to reduce the risk of outstanding debt. Under this regulation also, the loan could not be
       passed directly to PDAM but it has to be through local government, which then could
       channel the fund to PDAM as sub-loan or as equity grant. However, although the PDAM
       is not direct borrower, the MoF still urged PDAM to improve their financial capacity so
       PDAM could contribute to their respective LG for loan repayment.


                                                28
   c) There were some common problems faced by all PIUs during project implementation that
      caused delays in constructions, these included the lengthy process of obtaining permits for
      constructions on the national roads and railway crossings. Unfamiliarity with Bank’s
      procedures on procurement and safeguards, as well as poor quality of DED and bidding
      documents have also resulted in delays of project implementation, especially in the first
      two-years. Difficulties in obtaining multi-years permit for consultant services also resulted
      in some gaps in project management and supervision.

   d) There were some concerns in ensuring future support from the local parliament to obtain
      approval on local government budget allocation for loan repayment. The PDAMs and LGs
      need to always demonstrate that the investments made have provided benefits to the people
      and improve local government’s performance in providing basic services.

   e) The project has resulted in improved and expanded water supply services benefitting
      communities with better access and more reliable water supply. However, the technical
      assistance in this project covered only project management and supervision of construction
      activities. There was lack of technical assistance provided to build capacity of PDAMs to
      improve their performance and to have more efficient operation. As the results, many
      targets of KPI related to PDAM’s performance could not be fully achieved.

   f) The workshops also facilitated discussion between LGs and their respective PDAMs to
      develop a new Performance Agreement that include new Key Performance Indicators
      target for the next five years. All three LGs and PDAMs prepared their new KPI targets
      that later would be followed up and monitored by the Directorate of Water Supply
      Development of DG Cipta Karya.

5. In general, lessons that can be learned from the implementation of UWSSP can be summarized
   as follow:

   a) The project was completed on time, with no loan extension, the project design (i.e. cities
      were firstly selected and prepared prior to loan negotiation) is considered as appropriate.
      However, business process needs to be improved to shorten preparation phase.

   b) High commitment from the head of local governments (Bupati/Walikota) and full support
      from the local parliament (DPRD) assures the project proceeds, but the PDAMs need to
      continuously improve their performance even if they do not have direct obligation in loan
      repayment (case of Muara Enim and Kapuas).

   c) Linking the project with the Water Hibah program to reward LGs’ commitment to invest
      in the sector is a good incentive mechanism.

Annex 7. Executive Summary of Borrower's ICR

1. On September 1, 2009 the Government of Indonesia, represented by the Ministry of Finance
   signed a loan agreement with the World Bank of USD 23.56 million. The loan was effective
   on November 25, 2009 with closing date at December 31, 2014. The loan was used to finance
   the Urban Water Supply Sanitation Project (UWSSP) in Kota Bogor (West Java Province),
   Kabupaten Kapuas (Central Kalimantan), and Kabupaten Muara Enim (South Sumatera).

2. The main objective of the Project is to improve and expand water supply services in the Project
   Areas by strengthening local water utilities to become operationally efficient and financially
   sustainable.

3. The loan is sub-lent (through establishment of PEMDA Subsidiary Loan Agreement / SLA) in
   rupiah at IDR 223.21 billion to the three selected local governments, namely Kota Bogor,
   Kabupaten Muara Enim and Kabupaten Kapuas. These three Local Governments has passed
   through the selection process conducted by the Ministry of Public Works to 20 other applicants
   of the Project. PEMDAs of Kabupaten Muara Enim and Kabupaten Kapuas passed on their
   PEMDA SLAs as equity contribution to their respective PDAM. Kota Bogor was passed on
   the PEMDA SLA to PDAM Kota Bogor through the establishment of PDAM Loan Agreement
   with PEMDA of which 15 percent of the loan is passed on as PEMDA’s equity contribution
   while the PDAM Kota Bogor is responsible for the repayment of the remaining 85 percent on
   terms and conditions as set out in the PEMDA Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The main objective
   of project funding through SLA scheme is to create more independent PDAMs in managing
   their drinking water business, and ultimately will not continuously depend on equity
   contribution from the LG.

4. The project preparation was started in 2006. Loan Agreement was signed on September 1, 2009
   and effective by November, 2009. The long preparation period was caused by the changing of
   on-granting and on-lending funding regulation in Ministry of Finance, and also by the lengthy
   process of getting approval from local parliamentary (DPRD) which is one requirement of
   Local Governments borrowing through SLA.

5. Directorate General of Human Settlements (DG Cipta Karya) was the Executing Agency (EA)
   of this project. Directorate of Program Development was in-charge in project preparation and
   monitoring, while Directorate of Water Supply Development was in charge for project
   implementation. Project Coordination Unit (PCU) as a functional body attached in Directorate
   of Water Suply Development (DitPAM) was established for the day-to-day project
   coordination, implementation and management based on decree of DG Cipta Karya. Project
   Implementation Units(PIU) is a functional body at LG level consisted of PDAM and LG staff
   and is assigned to implement and manage the Project activities in their area. PIU was
   established based on decree of Walikota/Bupati.

Project Funding

6. In addition to SLA funding, PEMDAs through their local budget contributed about IDR 70
   billion to support Project’s activities. Central Government through APBN also provided
   Management Support funding to finance the supervision consultants, PCU Advisors, PCU
   operational cost and capacity building activities amounting to IDR 70 billion. Directorate
   General of Water Resources Management (DG PSDA) through the APBN provided IDR 85
   billion to finance the construction of transmission lines and water intake in Palingkau,
   Kabupaten Kapuas. Water Hibah program from DG Cipta Karya provided incentives to the


                                               30
    three PEMDAs as a reward on their strong commitment in supporting their PDAMs and in
    providing investment in the sector. The grant from Hibah program could be used to extend
    water supply services to the poor households. The three PEMDAs received the Hibah program
    from 2013 to 2015 with a total grant amounting to IDR 40,9 billion.

7. The progress of project implementation in the early years (2010-2011) was very slow. There
   were several constraints: (a) lack of experience of PIU staff in managing loan; (b) significant
   Detailed Engineering Design (DED) revisions; (c) delayed DIPA (government budget
   allocation) approval process; (d) difficulties in reporting and M&E, especially for KPI
   assessment; (e) rebidding process in Kabupaten Muara Enim; and (f) other constraints related
   to unfamiliarity of PDAMs/PEMDAs with WB procedures. To address these constraints, PCU
   and PCU Advisory Consultant had to provide intensive support and work closely with the
   PEMDAs to assist the PIUs. World Bank team provided support in technical aspect in field
   (through mission, intensive communication and coordination, etc.) to accelerate the
   implementation of the Project.

8. The 3rd, 4th and 5th years was the busiest years of the Project implementation where all
   physical works funded by loan and APBD was running in parallel. Supporting activities to
   ensure fiduciary compliance i.e. procurement, social and environmental safeguards, were also
   conducted. Unfortunately, there were difficulties in obtaining multi-years contracts for
   supervision consultant and PCU Advisory Consultant. As the result consultants contracts did
   not cover the whole project period and there were some gaps on construction supervision and
   project management.

9. Results of the construction works are generally good in quality and quantity aspects, including
   its commissioning process. Although there were shortages in some construction, but all had
   been repaired and are now operated. The closing date of the loan was not extended.

10. Loan disbursement of the Project is very high, 99% in IDR. However, due to the increasing
    exchange rate of USD against IDR, the total loan absorption in USD is 88% (USD 20.73
    Million)

11. The remaining loan of Bogor City is IDR. 0,- out of total loans of IDR 86.98 billion, Kabupaten
    Muara Enim is IDR 0,16 billion out of IDR 97.3 billion and Kabupaten Kapuas is IDR 0,05
    bilion out of of Rp 39 billion

12. Key Performance Indicators had been agreed by PCU and PIU and included in the Performance
    Agreement between PEMDA and PDAM which was attached to the PEMDA Sub Loan
    Agreements with the Ministry of Finance. KPI was revised during the Mid Term Review
    mission (2013). Baseline data (2009) was revised based on facts and PDAM’s performance
    audit reports and term of some KPI’s points were clarified to avoid any misinterpretation. Final
    results of KPI achievement is 66% of the target and the remaining targets are predicted to be
    achieved (on-track).

13. The implementation of social and environmental safeguard is good, no significant environment
    impacts and all land acquisition documentation were well documented by PDAM. There was
    no local people relocation caused by the Project. Vulnerable people were not found in project
    areas.

14. After project completion, Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH) will continue
    providing support to the three PDAMs/PEMDAs (at least until 2016) with Water Hibah


                                                31
    program in order to utilize the increased production capacity and also to accelerate the
    increment of house connections. PDAMs committed to achieve KPI targets by end of 2015.

15. In the closing workshop, the three PDAMs/PEMDAs prepared the draft of their new
    Performance Agreement which would be used by PDAM and PEMDAs in monitoring the
    agreed targets. This new Performance Agreement will also be used by (MoPWH) to monitor
    the Project results and also as consideration in determining further program support that could
    be provided to the PDAMs/PEMDAs.

16. PCU rated the project preparation process as Moderately Unsatisfactory with the following
    arguments: (a) Project was conducted only in three LGs, (b) loan was used only for capital
    investment; (c) capacity building activities were not well-planned and clearly defined in project
    categories in Loan Agreement/PAD/other planning documents; (d) assessment was not
    adequately and thoroughly conducted on the competency and capacity of PDAMs/PEMDAs in
    managing and implementing the Project; (e) SLA process was complicated and lengthy (one of
    the readiness criteria is approval from DPRD which is relatively difficult and costly to obtain).

17. PCU rated the project implementation as Moderately Satisfactory with the following
    arguments: (a) strong support and commitment from central stakeholders (Central Government
    and the Bank) to support local government, especially in the beginning of the project; (b) KPI
    revision during Mid Term Review in 2013 resulted in more realistic baseline data and
    achievement targets; (c) project is completed in accordance with schedule without loan
    extension; (d) all infrastructures built under the project are already in operation; (e) KPI target
    achievement is on-track; (f) good financial absorption; (f) intensive monitoring and evaluation
    activities from PCU and the Bank.

18. PCU rated the post-project activities as Moderately Satisfactory with argument of the presence
    of commitment and awareness from central and local government to continue and sustain the
    Project results.

19. Overall, PCU rates this project as Moderately Satisfactory.

20. Important lesson learned and recommendation from the Project:

    a) Preparation phase was too long, more than three years, and “only” enlisted three
       participants, and this could be assumed as inefficient management aspect. It is
       recommended to Executing Agency (EA) in managing SLA (on lending) funding to apply
       this approach only to PEMDAs and PDAMs who have sufficient capacity (DSCR > 2.5),
       while for other PDAM can utilize on-granting scheme.

    b) Loan Agreement did not provide funding for capacity building activities, thus APBN
       should cover this cost on ad-hoc basis. This condition causes difficulties in preparing and
       implementing Capacity Building Plan. It is recommended that Loan Agreement should
       clearly mention or include funding and define funding sources for capacity building
       activities.

    c) PDAM must thoroughly reviewing DED documents prepared by Consultant. If PDAM has
       lack capacity to review, they may ask for assistant from Provincial Satker Air Bersih-PLP.

    d) Lack of review on PDAM staff capacity causing delays on project implementation in the
       beginning. It is advised that a thorough PDAM human resources review should be


                                                  32
    conducted and also there should be provision of individual consultant attached to
    PDAM/PIU if necessary.

e) Supervision Consultant and PCU Advisory Consultant were not directly contracted for the
   whole project life-span (five years) because APBN disallow multi-years contract. It is
   advised that in next similar project, term and condition of the contract should be looser and
   provides alternative funding source to finance consultant from loan.

f) Although the social and environmental impacts is categorized as undemanding, it is advised
   to create a position for special experts in central level to handle safeguard issues, thus the
   PDAM/LG may have adequate direction on the issues.

g) Head of PCU is recommended from a minimum Echelon 3 level to ensure adequate
   authority to facilitate control of the cross-Sub Directorate team management and the ease
   of managing the budget.
