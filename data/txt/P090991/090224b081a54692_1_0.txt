                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Good progress has been made toward improving and expanding water supply in the three targeted districts, though data is not yet available to clearly measure associated outcomes.
                         Most of the physical works (such as water treatment plants, reservoirs, and distribution network) planned for Kota Bogor and Kabupaten Kapuas have already been completed. While
                         some works in Kabupaten Muara Enim are also completed, most are still either underway or in the contracting stage. Activities aimed at strengthening local water utilities and
                         improving their efficiency and sustainability are proceeding as planned.
