A. SUMMARY

The proposed restructuring involves revision and update to the Results Framework and its
key performance indicators described in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) to ensure
that a more efficient set of indicators are applied during project implementation and they
are consistently presented in the Performance Agreements between Local Governments
and their respective PDAMs. This revision will also include retrofitting inclusion of the
core indicator for water supply, and to make correction and update to the baseline data
and targets. This restructuring will better reflect progress of project implementation and
its impact in improving service performance.

The proposed restructuring does not involve changes to the project implementation
period, the total loan amount, loan allocation between different categories, or changes to
the mechanisms to ensure compliance with the safeguard policies. The proposed changes
will also not result in change of impact in any other sections of the PAD.


B. PROJECT STATUS

Based on the latest implementation support mission conducted in April and May 2013,
project implementation progress is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory”.

The project is currently rated as Satisfactory towards achievement of its Project
Development Objectives and overall Implementation Progress is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. All other ISR ratings are either S or MS and there are no major issues
pending. Procurement processes and implementation of construction contracts have
started and are progressing in all locations (some are already completed). Disbursements
have been improving and will continue to improve in the future. Disbursement rate is at
59.93% and with completion of most project activities by end of June 2014, it is very
likely that all funds will be used by closing date. All budgets to fund project activities has
been fully allocated in the government’s budgeting system (DIPA allocation) and all key
ingredients for project implementation are in place (the Project Management Manual, the
Project Coordination Unit – PCU, the PCU Advisory Consultant, the Project
Implementation Units – PIUs and their supervision consultants). There are still delays in
some construction activities although there will still be adequate time to complete all
constructions prior to the end of project period. The PCU and PIUs are still having issues
with monitoring and evaluation and reporting the progress of Key Performance Indicators
achievement due to some confusion caused by inconsistencies of definition between the
KPIs stated in their respective Performance Agreement and the definition stated in their
regular reporting systems, as well as in the PAD

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

The proposed changes to be included in this restructuring include: (i) revision and update
of the Results Framework (description and definition of Key Performance Indicators to
include core indicator and to ensure consistency between all project documents); and (ii)
to correct and update baseline data and targets.

The changes are proposed to assist the PCU and PIUs in having more clarity and
streamlined monitoring and evaluation process, thus improving the project’s reporting
mechanism. With this improved monitoring and evaluation process, the project will be
better positioned to reflect the progress of implementation and its impact. Changes to the
results/indicators include clarification of the definitions, correction and updating baseline
data and targets, as well as inclusion of core indicator of water sector. The new sets of
indicators are realistic, achievable and measurable, and take into account the capacities of
the PIUs. The changes to the results/indicators are shown in the Annex 1.
