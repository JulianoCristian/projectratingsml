                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         All project activities are expected to be completed before end of 2014 and the project will not be extended. The overall project development objectives in improving and expanding
                         water supply services will be achieved. However, the objective of strengthening water utilities capacity may not be fully achieved as demonstrated by some targets of the key
                         performance indicators that will not be met by end of project period. Action plan to continue performance improvement and to accelerate achievement of the targeted indicators will be
                         included as part of exit strategy and will be monitored closely by the Executing Agency through the regular technical assistance programs.
