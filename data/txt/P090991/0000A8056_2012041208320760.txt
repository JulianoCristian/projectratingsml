                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Good progress is being made toward improving and expanding water supply in two of the targeted districts (Kota Bogor and Kabupaten Kapuas), but implementation of construction
                         activities is still delayed in the third district (Kabupaten Muara Enim). Activities aimed at strengthening local water utilities and improving their efficiency and sustainability are
                         proceeding as planned, but it is still too early to measure results.
