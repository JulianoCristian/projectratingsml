Pakistan has a\n            population of over 162 million, with over 60 percent living\n            in rural areas. Rising food prices, the energy crisis, and\n            other inflationary pressures have not only pushed more\n            people below the poverty line, but have increased\n            vulnerability of the ultra-poor to an unprecedented level.\n            The rising levels of ethnic and religious strife, conflict\n            and insecurity, and recurring natural calamities have\n            further limited the country\u2019s capacity to deal effectively\n            with persistent poverty. The International Development\n            Association financed Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund\n            (PPAF) in 1999 to support government efforts to empower poor\n            people to achieve sustainable livelihoods. The objective was\n            to increase their incomes, improve their productive\n            capacity, and provide them better access to services. The\n            project facilitated the formation of inclusive community\n            groups, with the aim of increasing economic activity, skills\n            enhancement, asset base, infrastructure access, and market\n            linkages. The third PPAF (PPAF III) project was launched in\n            2009, built on successful PPAF experiences and further\n            targeted marginalized groups of the most vulnerable and\n            poorest households, including women. PPAF III promoted\n            stronger community institutions, particularly their ability\n            to manage their own development and to access services.\n            Access to social and physical infrastructure were fully\n            integrated to maximize the impact on poverty. Furthermore,\n            there was a major effort to provide increased occupational\n            skills training, with the goal of spurring exponential\n            growth in micro-enterprises."}, "docdt": "2009-09-17T09:07:02Z"}
