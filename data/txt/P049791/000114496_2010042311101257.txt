Project Agreement (the PA) between the Association and the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, 
both dated July 7 1999, for the above-referenced Project, as amended. We also refer to the letter 
dated January 22, 2001, from Mr. Idris, Economic Affairs Division (EAD), Ministry of Finance 
&
Economic Affairs, requesting the Association to reallocate the proceeds of the Credit, modify 
the definition of incremental operating costs, the financing limit for small-scale community 
infrastructure development projects under Part A (ii) of the Project, and the eligibility criteria for 
partner organizations. 
 
The Association, after due consideration, has decided to accede to your request, and  
consequently hereby amends the DCA and the PA as follows:

Section 1 of Part A of Schedule 1 is amended as set forth in the Attachment to this
