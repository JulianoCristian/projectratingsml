These include: 1) needing a holistic approach to\n            improve access to services and reduce poverty which combines\n            micro-credit with small scale infrastructure, education, and\n            health facilities as well as skill development; 2) autonomy\n            and freedom from political pressures; 3) the need for\n            Institutional development of pro-poor institutions,\n            including strategic reviews, SWOT (strength, weaknesses,\n            opportunities and threats) analysis, mandatory submissions\n            of business plans, targeted training, capacity building of\n            staff, and strengthening of financial and monitoring\n            functions; 4) the ability of decentralization to enable\n            organizations to respond rapidly and successfully to\n            community needs; 5) the hiring of staff by PPAF through a\n            transparent and merit based procedures with policies of\n            compensation and staff development clearly articulated and\n            reviewed to keep staff motivated; and 6) making program\n            interventions demand driven.  Other key lessons cited are:\n            Government support is absolutely essential for the success\n            of the apex institution. The level of donor support and\n            facilitation, or the absence of it, can make or break the\n            project. A competent and committed Board of Directors makes\n            the task at hand much easier. A fully competent Chief\n            Executive can achieve better and quicker results. Building\n            of trust is the key to achieving sustainable development.\n            Development is an on-going process which is continually evolving."}, "docdt": "2005-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
