                                    RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY
1. The Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) and the
   Honduran Secretariat of Natural Resources and Environment (SERNA),
   implementing agencies of the GEF-financed Corazon Transboundary Biosphere
   Reserve Project, have requested the Bank, through the Central American Commission
   for Environment and Development (CCAD), recipient of the grant, to carry out a
   restructuring of the Project, with the following objectives:
         i)   Extension of the closing date from August 1, 2012 to December 15, 2012 - The
              purpose of the extension is to ensure that the results of the Project are
              adequately measured and that the lessons learned are captured and
              disseminated. As per Annual Operation Plans approved earlier this year, both
              countries are set up to complete their planned activities by the August closing
              date, in line with the commitments made during the restructuring. However,
              doing so will not allow them to reflect on the final impacts and to capture
              results through the management effectiveness tools that were set up for the
              Project. This four month extension will be the first and only extension
              requested for this Project1.
        ii)   Reallocation of disbursement categories – Following a review of expenditure
              categorization in both countries, it was determined necessary to transfer funds
              from Category II to Category I. The former includes only expenses disbursed
              directly to the communities or groups implementing subprojects or receiving
              grants, and it does not include consulting services associated with technical
              assistance (TA) and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of subprojects. These
              TA and M&E activities are integral to the successful implementation of
              subprojects, but according to the Grant Agreement they must be classified as
              expenditures under Category I. The reallocation of grant proceeds is thus
              needed to ensure that TA and M&E expenditures related to implementation of
              subprojects are accounted for consistent with disbursement categories specified
              in the Grant Agreement. This reallocation does not impact the amount of
              funding approved per component, and specifically funding approved for
              subprojects and grants. The reallocation only affects the categories of
              expenditure as defined in the Grant Agreement.

B. PROJECT STATUS
2. A Level 1 restructuring of the Project was carried out in 2011, which resulted in the
   simplification and streamlining of components, as well as in the thorough revision of
   results framework. By the second semester of 2011 there were clear signals that the
   Project was making steady progress. During supervision missions to Honduras and
1
    Project Management costs approved by the GEF will not be affected by the extension.
                                                      5
    Nicaragua in the first trimester of 2012, consolidated monitoring reports show very
    positive results being achieved in both countries. Disbursement levels2 more than
    doubled over the past year reaching almost 81%. All activities are scheduled to be
    completed and all funds are expected to be disbursed by the closing date. Co-
    financing commitments have already been met in Honduras and will be met by
    Nicaragua when all data are consolidated. The Project’s performance rating has been
    upgraded to satisfactory following the last mission.
3. The latest monitoring matrix shows that all of the restructured Project targets will be
   met, and in fact, that the majority of them will be exceeded. Some of the most
   relevant indicators include: (i) over 5,000 hectares of deforested land currently
   undergoing rehabilitation; (ii) 100 and 85 percent of the indigenous communities that
   live within the Corazon Reserve in Honduras and Nicaragua, respectively, benefitting
   directly from subprojects and training provided by the Project; (iii) over 10,000
   families living in the Reserve benefitted from roughly 250 sub-projects in Honduras
   and Nicaragua; (iv) more than 30 percent of the beneficiaries are women; (v)
   approximately 30 protective area management tools (e.g. manuals, measurement
   toolkits) developed, tested and mainstreamed in MARENA and SERNA; (vi)
   biodiversity indicators and information management systems in place and under
   monitoring; and (vii) capacity and accountability developed at the national level and
   across the Reserve, at the level of the communities, to prepare projects, manage
   funds, and report results.
4. The Project teams have started to compile experiences and to document results and
   lessons learned. Best practice notes are being prepared, which will be used as
   communications materials and as knowledge products that will be disseminated
   before the Project’s proposed revised closing date. Dissemination events are being
   planned by the three implementing agencies in the second semester of 2012, once all
   the Project’s objectives have been met.
5. There are no outstanding safeguards, financial management (FM), or procurement
   issues. With regards to project ratings: (i) Progress towards achievement of the PDO
   and Overall Implementation Progress are currently rated as satisfactory; (ii)
   Procurement is moderately satisfactory; and (iii) financial management is moderately
   unsatisfactory – this low FM rating was assigned to the overall project during the
   December 2011 ISR, and resulted from the fact that the Honduras 2010 audit report
   was pending and that the FM Officer position within SERNA’s Project
   Implementation Unit was vacant. No issues were identified at the time for CCAD or
   MARENA. To date, both of the Honduras FM-related issues have been resolved in a
   manner acceptable to the Bank. Moreover, a Financial Management post review
   mission is scheduled for June 20123, after which it is expected that the FM rating will
   be upgraded.

 As of May 23, 2012

 The regular FM post review mission that was originally planned for the first trimester of 2012 had to be
postponed, and the earliest it could be rescheduled was June 2012.
