                         A recent supervision mission was carried out in El Salvador (July 20-22, 2011). That was the first time all executing agencies and the Bank team were able to meet during a
                         supervision mission. With all activities underway and tangible results in both countries, there is a strong momentum and a sense of accomplishment from all those involved. The

                         teams are collaborating and exchanging experiences, and CCAD has taken on a much more active role of coordination and M&E support. All parties were pleased to hear that the
                         GEFSEC cleared the restructuring proposal on July 28, 2011. The team is therefore proceeding in the restructuring process. Although the project shows progress, especially in terms
                         of project management, the results framework of the project, along with the adjusted indicators, cannot be changed until the entire restructuring process is approved. The next ISR
                         will be able to capture even more positive impacts of the project which the current results framework does not do.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It is expected that over 150 subprojects will receive financing under the Project, and the majority of those will be ongoing by the end of 2012. Close monitoring of these subprojects

                         will be critical to avoid implementation delays, therefore ensuring that they are all completed by the first quarter of 2012. Two of the three updates of management plans for Protected
                         Areas tin Honduras that need to be completed by the end of the Project have not yet been contracted. This is a critical output of the Project and close supervision of this contracts will
                         be needed to ensure they are completed in a timely fashion.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
