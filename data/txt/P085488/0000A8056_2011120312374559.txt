                         This ISR has been completed following Board approval of the Level 1 restructuring of the Project. The Grant Agreement has been signed by LC2 Country Director and it has been
                         received by CCAD for countersignature. The improved ratings in this ISR reflect the fact that the results framework was updated to better capture what has been accomplished under
                         the Project. In spite of the significant progress that has been made and on the very good results that are being achieved, the rating is not higher than MS, because of delays in some
                         critical activities in Honduras. Indeed, although the results framework clearly separates the performance of each country, the overall ISR ratings are still global. The performance in

                         Nicaragua is satisfactory across all components. In Honduras, activities under components 2 and 3 are progressing well. However, critical activities under component 1 are not
                         advancing as well as expected, and this could have substantial implications on overall project results. It is for this reason that the project rating is impacted.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1) Roughly 150 subprojects in the two countries are ongoing and will not close until April-May 2012. Close monitoring of these subprojects will be critical to avoid implementation
                         delays, therefore ensuring that they are all completed before the end of the project.
                         2) Two of the three updates of management plans for Protected Areas in Honduras that need to be completed by the end of the Project have not yet been contracted. This is a critical
                         output of the Project and these contracts need to be issued before the end of 2011.
                         3) The recent departure of the Procurement and Financial Management Officers from the Honduras PIU could have a very significant impact on the Project, given that there are only
                         10 months remaining of implementation, and thus new officers must be hired as soon as possible.
