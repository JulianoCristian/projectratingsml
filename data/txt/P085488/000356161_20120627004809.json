The closing of the project will be\n            extended from from August 1, 2012 to December 15, 2012.

The reallocation of\n            grant proceeds is thus needed to ensure that Technical\n            Assistance (TA) and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            expenditures related to implementation of subprojects are\n            accounted for consistent with disbursement categories\n            specified in the grant agreement. This reallocation does not\n            impact the amount of funding approved per component, and\n            specifically funding approved for subprojects and grants.\n            The reallocation only affects the categories of expenditure\n            as defined in the grant agreement.
