{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Nicaragua and Honduras\n            Corazon Transboundary Biosphere Reserve Project for Central\n            America were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to global environment outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the development of operational\n            tools that take into account the local socio-environmental\n            realities is critical to ensuring that operations in\n            difficult contexts can be executed in reasonable times.\n            Direct sub-project implementation by local governments and\n            communities requires previous investments in capacity\n            building. Assessment of operational risks under bi-national\n            projects must take into account overall political conditions\n            and should offer options to surpass barriers and ensure\n            continuity of activities. Understanding the indigenous Cosmo\n            vision is central to the participation of indigenous peoples\n            in projects' execution and to the sustainability of\n            interventions. Minimum of 13 percent of the total investment\n            is required to cover the costs of adequate monitoring of\n            sub-projects in remote areas. Setting explicit targets for\n            women participation in implementation of sub-projects in\n            indigenous communities ensures their involvement and\n            promotes empowerment. The Program Assessment of the Regional\n            Environmental Program (PROARCA) and global environment\n            facility (GEF) tracking tools can be adapted to better\n            capture the socio-environmental conditions of local\n            protected areas."}, "docdt": "2013-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
