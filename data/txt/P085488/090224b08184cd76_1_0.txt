                         The Project closed on December 15, 2012 and the Grace Period extends to April 15, 2013. This ISR is being prepared after having completed the final supervision missions to
                         Honduras and Nicaragua, which took place Oct. 23-25 and Nov. 26-28, respectively.

                         Since the last mission, the focus of the TT and of the PIUs has been to complete all of the activities identified in their Work Programs, such that project objectives are achieved. The

                         results of these combined efforts are, overall, very positive, although there are some variations in the performance of the three PIUs. Some highlights are included below:

                         - NICARAGUA: MARENA completed all the activities that it committed to delivering, including: The management plan for the BOSAWAS Protected Area was completed, consulted
                         and endorsed by all indigenous and mestizo territorial governments; 124 subprojects were completed successfully (of which 50% in indigenous communities and 54% beneficiaries
                         are women), where roughly 3,100 hectares of protected land are under rehabilitation/protection and sustainable use as a result of activities financed under the project. The project
                         successfully developed and implemented a decentralized system for subproject implementation, which for the first time in Nicaragua allowed remote communities to receive and
                         directly execute resources. MARENA maintained very close supervision of, and provided TA to all subprojects.

                         - HONDURAS: SERNA completed all the activities that were planned, achieving some very significant results, which included: update and endorsement of three Protected Areas
                         Management Plans (Parque Nacional Patuca, Reserva Rio Platano, Reserva Tawahka); 115 completed subprojects (benefiting 81 of indigenous communities in the area, 35% of
                         beneficiaries are women), where roughly 4,100 hectares of land are under rehabilitation/sustainable use; the national protected areas system was strengthened through the
                         establishment of an Endowment Fund that will finance management effectiveness assessments in protected areas. The PIU deployed an extensive network of field technicians to
                         provide assistance to communities in the development and implementation of subprojects, which made it possible for these communities to execute grant resources in activities with
                         direct local impacts.
