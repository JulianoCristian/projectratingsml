                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is preparing to undergo a first order restructuring, following recommendations of the MTR carried out in October 2010. The restructuring aims at: 1) reducing the scope of

                         binational commitments; 2) simplifying project activities and components, makingthem more streamlined and more likely to complete by Project's closing date; and iii) redefining
                         indicators and monitoring arrangements to better connect Project activities to global objectives. A restructuring mission is planned for January 24-February 3, 2011 finalize the
                         restructuring paper with both countries and CCAD, approve the 2011 POAs and PACs, and review progress in various components since the last mission. Field visits to sub-projects
                         in Honduras will be carried out.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A restructuring proposal is being prepared by the Bank, in consultation with MARENA, SERNA and CCAD and following recommendations of the recent mid-term review. The
                         proposal will be presented to the GEF and the Bank Board for approval upon return. The ISR will be updated in order to reflect the changes to the project based on the final
                         restructuring.

                         Restructuring History
