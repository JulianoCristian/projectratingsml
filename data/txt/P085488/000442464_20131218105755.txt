   1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
   1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. The Corazón Transboundary Biosphere Reserve (CTBR), the “Corazón Reserve” is the
   largest remaining area of humid tropical forest in Central America, located at the “heart”
   of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), straddling Nicaragua and Honduras.
   This area harbors many threatened and endangered species that require large intact areas
   of pristine forest to survive, such as Harpy eagles, jaguars, and tapirs. With natural areas
   increasingly fragmented in Mesoamerica, the Corazón Reserve is the last refuge for many
   species in the region dependent on large areas.
2. The Project area spanned 34,595 km2 (3.46 million ha) along the Honduras-Nicaragua
   border, and encompassed four established protected areas: the BOSAWAS Biosphere
   Reserve in Nicaragua (20,008 km2 or 2.0 million ha), and in Honduras, the Tawahka
   Asagni Indigenous Reserve, the Patuca National Park, and the Río Plátano Biosphere
   Reserve (with a combined total of 14,587 km2 or 1.46 million ha). The CTBR is home to
   approximately 70,000 indigenous peoples from five ethnic groups including the
   Tawahka, Mayangna, Pech, Garifuna, and Miskito peoples. Roughly the same number of
   mestizo settlers also live in the Reserve.
3. The existence of protected areas has not been sufficient to protect the ecosystems and
   populations within the Reserve from encroaching threats. The National Protected Areas
   Systems (Sistema Nacional de Areas Protegidas, SINAPs) of Nicaragua and Honduras
   are staffed by dedicated professionals, but they are underfunded and lack the capacity and
   legal frameworks necessary to carry out their mandate.
4. Therefore, despite a concerted effort by national and local authorities, and technical and
   financial assistance from international donors, the area’s integrity is threatened,
   primarily, by a lack of sustainable income-generating activities and weak protection and
   enforcement practices. Deforestation is a major problem, with rapid losses still occurring
   at the agricultural frontier. While local agricultural and forest management techniques are
   partially responsible for the loss of forest cover, the greatest problem is seen along the
   western agricultural frontier, where recent arrivals are clearing land for farming and cattle
   ranching at alarming rates. Among the indigenous communities, poverty and a lack of
   economic options contribute to suboptimal land use practices.
   Rationale for Bank Engagement
5. To address these challenges, the governments of Honduras and Nicaragua requested the
   assistance of the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for the
   implementation of a project that contributed to efforts to reduce rural poverty, strengthen
   protection for vulnerable groups, and enhance environmental sustainability in the CTBR.

   1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators
6. The Project’s 1 original GEO was the conservation of the globally critical biodiversity of
   the CTBR through more effective protection, and improved, sustainable use of natural
   resources within the project area. Given that the Reserve lies along the border between
   Nicaragua and Honduras, and that there is a continuity of ecosystems and populations
   across the region, a promising element of the Project’s original design was its binational
   approach that aimed at promoting a better coordinated, more consistent and thus more
   effective management and conservation of cross-boundary natural resources.
7. The original Project Development Objective (PDO) was: To improve the national and
   binational management of the area of the proposed Corazón Transboundary Biosphere
   Reserve, respecting the rights of traditional populations.
8. The original key PDO indicators included:
    • The management effectiveness rating of the CTBR area improves from an estimated
       baseline rating of Poor (1) to Regular (2) using the ratings of the Regional
       Environmental Program (PROARCA) scorecard system in use in Central America.
       The baseline value is to be confirmed at a workshop within two months of project
       start-up. The GEF Protected Areas Tracking Tool values would also be revalidated
       during the same workshop.
    • The percentage of indigenous residents in the CTBR which participate fully in the
       implementation of management plans for their respective protected areas increases to
       at least 75 percent by end of Project EOP (based on viewpoints of organizations
       representing local indigenous populations).
    • Deforestation rate of core areas of the Reserve declines by at least 25 percent from
       the baseline value to be determined at project start-up (biannual measures to be made
       by the National Environmental Information Systems of each country).

   1.3 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/justification
9. The Project’s mid-term review 2 (MTR) concluded that while the Project had significantly
   contributed to improving the management effectiveness in the area of the CTBR, and that
   it was contributing to the conservation of this global asset, it would likely not achieve its
   original PDO in terms of binational, coordinated management efforts. As a result, a Level
   One restructuring was carried out 3, which: (i) modified the PDO; (ii) simplified Project
   design; (iii) reallocated resources; and (iv) better aligned the Project’s monitoring
   framework with its objectives. The Project’s GEO remained unchanged.
10. Revised PDO (after restructuring) - To improve the national management of the area of
    the proposed Corazón Transboundary Biosphere Reserve (CTBR), in Honduras and
    Nicaragua, respecting the rights of traditional populations.

     The Project was approved on June 13, 2006 and became effective on November 22, 2006. The original
   closing date was August 1, 2012.

     The restructuring proposal was in development throughout 2011. It was approved by GEF on September
   12, 2011 and by the World Bank’s Executive Board on October 7, 2011. The restructured Project became
   effective on January 6, 2012.
                                                     2
11. The restructured indicators included:
     • Targeted protected areas (4) within CTBR more effectively managed for
        conservation outcomes, with a rating of 2 (Regular) as measured by the PROARCA
        and GEF Tracking Tools.
     • Increased participation by 60 percent of local communities, in both Nicaragua and
        Honduras, engaging in sustainable conservation activities related to management
        plans in order to reduce pressure in the target area.
     • Institutionalized participatory management processes and policy instruments
        consistent with protected areas management plans.

   1.4 Main Beneficiaries
12. Primary beneficiaries of the Project were poor communities of the Corazón Reserve. The
    operations and subprojects manuals defined as Project beneficiaries the inhabitants of the
    Project’s area of influence, within their respective constituencies, which included: i)
    indigenous communities represented by their territorial governments; ii) farmers
    associations and/or cooperatives; iii) indigenous women organizations; and iv) women
    farmer organizations.
13. SERNA and MARENA were the central government institutions that benefitted from the
    Project in Honduras and Nicaragua, respectively. The Central American Commission for
    Environment and Development (CCAD) was the recipient of the Grant, responsible for
    overall regional coordination. As a whole, the National Systems for Protected Areas in
    both countries were targeted indirect beneficiaries.

    1.5 Original Components
14. Originally, the Project included the following six components:
      i. Consolidation of the CBTR - Activities aimed at supporting the creation,
         consolidation, and strengthening of binational coordination mechanisms for the
         Reserve, permitting the involvement of all stakeholders.
     ii. Strengthening of the National Protected Areas Systems - This component aimed at
         ensuring the financial sustainability of the Nicaragua and Honduras SINAPs, thus
         contributing to the sustainability of the CTBR.
    iii. Implementation of Protected Area Management Plans - Activities aimed at financing
         the implementation of protected areas management plans through community-based
         co-management initiatives.
    iv. Community-Based Natural Resource Management - This component focused on
         community-level management of natural resources as a tool to mainstream
         biodiversity conservation into productive activities.
     v. Monitoring and Information Management - Funding was provided to strengthen
         biological monitoring programs for the entire project area.
    vi. Project Administration - This component supported the administration and operation
         of the Project.

   1.6 Revised Components
15. Simplifications to Project design were undertaken as part of the restructuring, in order to
    focus on activities and components that were progressing well at mid-term, and for which
    results had been achieved. Specifically, modifications included:
     i. Elimination of Component 1 – The MTR concluded that the consolidation of the
         CTBR could not be achieved by EOP due to the difficulties and delays in binational
         coordination. Some of the activities that remained relevant were reallocated to
         Component 2.
    ii. Component 2 further focused on strengthening of National Protected Areas Systems
         – The revised scope focused on two priorities: (a) updating and developing policy
         instruments for the management of protected areas, including management plans for
         protected areas, and promotion of binational coordination activities at a technical
         level; and (b) strengthening of financial mechanisms, particularly in Honduras, with
         the endowment of the Protected Areas Fund. Most of the resources originally
         approved for the creation of the Fund in Nicaragua were reallocated to finance
         additional sub-projects;
   iii. Merging of Components 3 and 4 – The focus of the new Component 2 was on: (a)
         implementation of sub-projects (without distinction between protective area
         management and natural resource management); and (b) local governance initiatives
         including scholarships, limited research, knowledge management and support to the
         governments of Nicaragua and Honduras on matters related to land regularization in
         indigenous communities within the CTBR;
    iv. Reduction of scope of Component 5 in Honduras – Activities focused on the
        development and dissemination of a strategy for the creation of a national
        environmental information system.

   1.7 Other significant changes
16. The following changes were also introduced to the original Project design during
    restructuring:


                                                4
         i.   Monitoring framework – The monitoring and evaluation framework was modified
              to better capture results. This involved: (a) improving consistency between
              intermediate indicators and scope of components; (b) disaggregated, country
              specific indicators; (c) inclusion of baselines; (d) establishment of monitoring
              framework for sub-projects; (e) definition of monitoring arrangements; and (f)
              establishment of budget for monitoring and evaluation.
       ii.    CCAD’s role - The overall role of CCAD was redefined to focus on the following:
              (i) coordination of technical teams; (ii) processing the application to UNESCO for
              Biosphere Reserve Status; (iii) monitoring results from sub-project
              implementation and compiling overall global indicators; (iv) training of field
              personnel and sub-project beneficiaries on monitoring; (v) knowledge
              management and (vi) administrative/ reporting responsibilities.
       iii.   Closing date - The Project’s closing was extended to December 15, 2012 during a
              subsequent Level Two restructuring that was approved on June 25, 2012.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
   2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
17. The preparation of the Corazon Project was done as a careful effort to incorporate a
    number of converging interests, including: i) national conservation policies of Honduras
    and Nicaragua, which aimed at using the Project to improve protected areas management,
    with a focus on promoting decentralization of responsibilities to local governments and
    traditional authorities; ii) the needs and demands of indigenous leaders, which saw the
    Project as an opportunity to increase the role of indigenous peoples in management of
    protected areas, as well as to improve the living conditions of communities in the
    Reserve; and iii) donor strategies and priorities in the area. Participation of local
    communities and national governments was therefore maintained throughout
    preparation4, and commitments were made to sustain the involvement of the various
    actors throughout implementation.
18. A detailed and participative preparation resulted in the identification of multiple needs
    and areas for involvement, in both countries. Unfortunately, the final Project’s scope was
    overly ambitious and it aimed to address too many of these needs. The complexities of
    implementation were underestimated, in spite of the efforts to build on local knowledge
    and experience from previous operations in the region, and this had a significant impact
    on the pace of implementation and on results during the first two years. Specifically:
       • Complexity of design - The Project involved a two-country initiative, which
            included six components, 17 sub-components and 52 individual activities. The
            scope of these components was too complex and diverse;




   4
     Over 800 people representing civil society, indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders participated in
   consultation meetings on Project design from August 2004 to January 2006. Over 45 representatives of all
   major indigenous and ladino stakeholder groups in both countries, as well as from CCAD, national
   governments, and the World Bank, met in Ocotal, Nicaragua on January 2006 to discuss the proposed
   Corazón Project. At the end of this meeting, representatives of all stakeholder groups signed the "Ocotal
   Declaration" in support of the Project.
                                                      5
      •    Extensive area of influence – The target area was roughly 34,595 km2 in
           Nicaragua and Honduras, consisting of very remote areas with very limited
           access. This made it very difficult to maintain a presence throughout the area, and
           made it costly to reach potential beneficiaries;
      •    Limited budget – The complexities described above were further compounded by
           a budget that was relatively small, given the expected scope of the Project. The
           US$5.4 million corresponding to each country was divided between many
           activities, which made implementation difficult.
19. Risks identified during preparation primarily involved the limited capacity of
    implementing agencies and potential risks due to inadequate participation of relevant
    stakeholders in such a widespread, binational effort. Measures were put in place to
    mitigate these risks, which proved to be insufficient and/or inadequate to address the
    difficulties of implementing such a complex Project. Specifically:
       •   Inadequate coordination at Project level – The agency that was selected to be in
           charge of binational coordination was the Central American Commission for
           Environment and Development (CCAD). An assessment of CCAD’s presence in
           the region and expertise was deemed adequate, and thus it was given the mandate
           to lead all coordination efforts between the two countries, including the
           presentation of the CTBR as a Biosphere Reserve to UNESCO. However, the
           agency’s capacity to coordinate the development and implementation of
           binational strategies and action plans was highly overestimated. The role
           ultimately played by CCAD was primarily administrative, and its impact in terms
           of driving policy dialogue at a high political level was minimal.
       •   Ineffective coordination at the regional level – The binational nature of the
           Project and the complexities this involved were addressed primarily in terms of
           avoiding potential conflicts along the borders, i.e. supporting participative
           mechanisms for indigenous peoples in border areas. However, the political
           relationship between the two countries, and the need to ensure adequate high level
           coordination was not sufficiently built into the design. The strained political
           relations between Honduras and Nicaragua between 2009 and 2010 had a
           significant impact on the Project, as diplomatic tensions resulted in major
           setbacks to all activities with a binational scope. CCAD was not able to mitigate
           the impacts of that political impasse.
       •   Reliance on ineffective participative mechanisms – The mechanisms established
           during preparation to ensure binational participation of indigenous peoples proved
           difficult to implement and lacked the strategic focus that would have made them
           useful to support Project objectives. Indeed, the Binational Forum and the
           Binational Indigenous Coordination (Muika) were created by CCAD without
           clear objectives, no operational structure, and without a framework for
           coordination with MARENA and/or SERNA. Moreover, members of these groups
           often did not represent the interests of indigenous communities in the Project area.
           The Forum and Muika were maintained without a definite role, and thus their
           actions were ultimately not relevant to the overall objectives of the Project.
       •   Ambitious and impractical participative decision-making processes – During
           preparation, expectations were raised that annual operating plans would be
           prepared during consultative meetings with binational indigenous representation.
                                                6
           While this was presented as a participatory mechanism aimed at better integrating
           the binational dimension, in reality, it became an inefficient process that lacked
           leadership, coordination with national priorities, strategic focus, and that did not
           contribute to overall Project objectives;
       •   Low capacity of implementing agencies - The experience and the capacity of
           MARENA and SERNA to implement the Project as designed were rated low at
           appraisal. Mitigating efforts to strengthen that capacity were not sufficient, and
           this resulted in major delays during the first years of implementation. Main
           difficulties primarily involved: (i) insufficient management, technical and
           fiduciary capacities of PIUs; (ii) lack of established framework to decentralize
           tasks to communities and local governments; (iii) inability to communicate with
           local populations in their native languages, particularly in remote areas; and (iv)
           insufficient budget to provide assistance to and to supervise operations in
           communities.
20. One issue that was not identified during preparation, and that the original Project was not
    equipped to address, was the significant differences in capacities of the two implementing
    agencies. MARENA has a central role as the agency that coordinates the environmental
    agenda, including management of protected areas and biodiversity. The PIU was fully
    integrated to the administrative protocols and institutional responsibilities of MARENA.
    In Honduras, SERNA is also an important player in the environmental policy arena, but
    responsibilities are shared with other agencies, notably the Institute for Forestry
    Conservation (ICF), which is responsible for the management of protected areas. This
    creates coordination issues at times, and results in the division of limited funding that is
    allocated for conservation and natural resource management between multiple agencies.
    In Honduras, the PIU was created as an external, consultant-staffed unit, physically and
    institutionally detached from SERNA.
21. This disparity was difficult to capture and to address through a Project where results
    indicators were defined in an aggregated manner, and where the performance of each
    country towards Project objectives could not be tracked independently. The restructuring
    addressed this problem essentially by separating the Project into two simultaneous,
    parallel operations, with binational objectives to be pursued jointly and with a
    coordination component handled by CCAD. This allowed both countries to move forward
    independently within their existing institutional structure. Ultimately, the targets agreed
    at restructuring were achieved by EOP. However, this difference of institutional
    framework was not addressed, and thus the long-term sustainability of the results will
    likely be different in the two countries.

   2.2 Implementation
22. Since its effectiveness in November 2006, overall Project implementation was slow.
    Implementation progress was rated satisfactory in early 2007, moderately unsatisfactory
    by the end of 2007 and unsatisfactory in December 2008. Performance remained
    unsatisfactory until August 2011. PIUs were changed in 2009 in Nicaragua and in the
    CCAD, and in 2010 in Honduras.
23. Changes to Project implementation as a result of restructuring were introduced in 2011 as
    the 2011 Operating Plans were prepared. Priority was given to improving the efficiency
    of subproject approval and implementation, by reinforcing support and capacity of the
                                                 7
   PIUs and field staff, strengthening monitoring and ensuring consistency between local
   needs and Project objectives. The results of these changes were clear within one year: by
   the end of 2011 disbursement rates had doubled, morale in Project Units was high,
   binational coordination improved significantly, progress was made under all components,
   and overall performance improved. Implementation progress was rated moderately
   unsatisfactory 5 in August 2011, moderately satisfactory in December 2011, and
   satisfactory from June 2012 until Project closure.
24. Implementation of the Corazón Project can be divided into two phases. During the first
    phase, from approval to mid-2010, implementing agencies struggled with a Project that
    was of high priority for both countries but failing. This affected the dialogue between the
    Bank and the governments and impacted the morale of Project teams. By late 2010 the
    Project was on the verge of being cancelled. However, during this first phase, the
    foundations for achieving the PDO were laid out, at least in some components, which
    made it possible to propose a restructuring that was ultimately successful. As part of the
    restructuring the countries committed to working within a simplified scope and to
    demonstrate results within tight deadlines. During its final two years (2011-2012),
    implementation advanced at a fast pace. Disbursements increased, results in the field
    became evident, the PIUs worked effectively and focused on results, morale was high,
    communication within teams increased, and the dialogue between the Bank and the
    agencies improved.
25. While this ICR presents information relevant to the Project’s performance from approval
    to closure, it is important to highlight the fact that the large majority of the results were
    achieved in the last two years of implementation. Indeed, by December 31, 2010 when
    the MTR was completed and the restructured design was proposed, less than 40 percent
    of the total grant resources had been disbursed, and a quarter of those had been spent on
    management costs. Half of the resources had been spent on implementation of
    community sub-projects, but no link had yet been drawn between results of individual
    sub-projects and overall Project development objectives. Moreover, no progress had been
    achieved in any of the critical components aimed at straightening management of
    protected areas (in either country) or natural resource management.

   2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26. The MTR concluded that a major problem associated with the design of the Project
    involved the framework for monitoring and evaluation, including the monitoring
    arrangements, which made it challenging to quantify the progress under the various
    components towards the global objectives of the Project. Important modifications were
    made to improve the M&E system, including: (i) Improved consistency between
    intermediate indicators and scope of components; (ii) Disaggregated indicators by
    implementing agency; (iii) estimation/confirmation of baselines; (iv) establishment of
    monitoring framework for sub-projects, linked to Project’s targets; (v) definition of
    Monitoring arrangements; and (vi) allocation of budget for monitoring and evaluation.


   5
     Although results were already noticeable in August 2011, the Project’s indicators had not been formally
   restructured, and thus progress could not be adequately captured. Ratings by the end of 2011 were
   evaluated using a revised results framework.
                                                      8
   2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
27. Safeguards - The project was classified as Category B. In accordance with OP 4.01, an
    Environmental Analysis was carried out. The Project’s Operations Manual defined
    mechanisms for implementation and monitoring of social and environmental safeguards
    that the Project and sub-projects were required to follow. With regards to sub-projects, a
    screening mechanism was established, through which sub-project Evaluation Committees
    reviewed and assessed (with the help of a standardized evaluation matrix) the potential
    environmental and social impacts of each proposal. Those that would have had negative
    impacts that merited mitigation plans were not selected for financing under the Project.
    With its screening mechanisms in place, environmental safeguards were well managed
    throughout implementation, and compliance was considered satisfactory.
28. Fiduciary compliance – Supervision of fiduciary compliance for this Project was
    challenging, as insufficient capacity of the three implementing agencies during the early
    years of implementation created significant needs for support from the Bank team.
    Fiduciary risks were rated high at preparation and accordingly, mitigation measures were
    incorporated throughout the lifetime of the Project to assist Implementation Units with
    their fiduciary controls. Indeed, special provisions were taken to address the exceptional
    characteristics of the Project (e.g. remoteness of subprojects, limited availability of
    financial services, limited capacity of beneficiaries, limited suppliers and logistical
    options) in sub-project manuals, and standardized operating guidelines.
       •   Financial management – The performance of the various country units at the start
           of the Project was rated low. After the second year of the Project, MARENA put
           in place a solid Financial Management structure which performed in a satisfactory
           manner through the end of the Project. CCAD and SERNA’s FM teams changed a
           few times during implementation, and this caused repeated disruptions and
           difficulties at the end of the Project. In Honduras, this led to requiring more
           Project implementation support, including unplanned procurement reviews and
           addressing red flags for increased risks to project management to meet objectives.
       •   Procurement - Both country teams faced procurement challenges during the first
           two years of implementation, although these were overcome with the hiring of
           qualified Procurement Specialists. Changes in the procurement team in Honduras
           during the final year of implementation resulted in delays, which contributed to
           the inability to use the total amount of funding. Procurement capacity at CCAD
           was adequate.

   2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
29. The sustainability of Project outcomes will depend on: (i) the governments of Nicaragua
    and Honduras ability to maintain biodiversity conservation policies in the CTBR through
    agencies with the human and technical capacity to develop and implement these policies;
    (ii) continuous institutional support in both countries to communities and local
    government in the Reserve; and (iii) availability of resources to continue financing
    initiatives that promote sustainable management of natural resources and good
    environmental practices.
30. Substantial efforts were made during implementation to: (i) promote the
    institutionalization of procedures, methodologies, guidelines and results developed under

                                                9
   the Project to ensure that lessons learned would be preserved and could be replicated; (ii)
   create institutional mechanisms for decentralization of protected areas management that
   used local governments and organizations that would remain in place by EOP; (iii)
   promote activities based on local knowledge, incorporating cultural elements and known
   practices, which would guarantee continuity after Project completion; and (iv) set up
   mechanisms to ensure the financial sustainability of protected area management systems
   (i.e. national endowment funds). As described in detail in later sections, the Project
   contributed in a major way to developing mechanisms and instruments that would
   support all of these efforts.
31. The issue of institutional sustainability, as indicated earlier in the document, will likely
    not be a concern in Nicaragua. The Project’s PIU was well integrated within MARENA,
    both at the central level with the BOSAWAS Technical Secretariat (Secretaría Técnica de
    BOSAWAS, SETAB), and with the seven territorial delegations that are responsible for
    decentralized management of protected areas. Therefore, the outcomes and the
    institutional legacy left by the Project in Nicaragua will likely remain relevant in the
    medium to long term.
32. In Honduras, the future of the outcomes that were achieved will be more uncertain, as the
    legacy of the Project within SERNA and ICF, in the absence of the PIU, does not have a
    clear repository. The instruments developed were disseminated within the agencies and
    will remain available, but it will be difficult to determine how much they will be used in
    the future. It is expected that the Fund for Protected Areas and Wildlife of Honduras
    (FAPVS) established under the Project will provide a minimum amount of resources to
    ensure that ICF can carry out basic management actions in priority areas.

   3. Assessment of Outcomes
   3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
33. The Project design was fully consistent and complementary with the National Poverty
    Reduction Strategies of Honduras and Nicaragua as well as with their Environmental
    Strategies, in terms of enhancing the sustainability of National Protected Areas Systems
    of through a highly participatory and inclusive process with the communities of the
    Reserve, especially indigenous.
34. The objectives of the Project remain well framed within the current National Human
    Development Plan of Nicaragua (2012-2016) and the National Plan of Honduras (2010-
    2022), which focus on promoting new approaches to poverty reduction, through equitable
    and sustainable economic transformations that foster equal opportunities for the common
    good of communities. The promotion of conservation and sustainable use of natural
    resources and biodiversity are some of the strategic lines of action of these Plans, which
    further set specific targets related to providing assistance to poor indigenous
    communities. These objectives are fully consistent with those of the Corazón Project.
35. Given the alignment of Project objectives with strategic priorities of Honduras and
    Nicaragua, as outlined in their PRSPs at the time of Project appraisal and prior to
    restructuring, as well as in their current national development strategies and after
    restructuring, the ICR rates the relevance of the Project as “High”.



                                                10
   3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
36. The Corazón Project achieved satisfactory results in terms of promoting the sustainable
    use of natural resources in a critical area for global biodiversity. This was accomplished
    through the combination of actions aimed at: (i) strengthening institutional local
    capacities for the management of protected areas; (ii) promoting initiatives for
    participative management of natural resources and protected areas through community-
    based sub-projects; (iii) promoting conservation of ancestral territories through joint
    efforts with communities, local and indigenous governments and federations; and (iv)
    supporting the national and binational dialog for the protection, conservation and
    sustainable development of shared natural resources. More specifically the Project’s GEO
    was achieved, as the Project:
       a. Promoted the conservation of biodiversity of the Corazón Reserve, as demonstrated
          by the following indicators:
            i. Management effectiveness assessments measured with PROARCA tracking
               tool for the protected areas within the area of influence, which had an average
               rating of “Poor/Fair” at the onset of the Project improved to an average rating
               between “Fair” and “Good” during Project implementation, and this rating was
               maintained until EOP. Improving and maintaining the management
               effectiveness rating of the CTBR means retaining the attributes of its protected
               areas that will make them eligible to receive the designation of Biosphere
               Reserve, demonstrating successful conservation and natural resource
               management action in these areas;
            ii. Low deforestation rates were measured in nucleus areas of the Reserve during
                Project execution, with primary forest cover rates reaching high values of 81
                and 94 percent in Nicaragua and Honduras, respectively. The implementation
                of sub-projects in mestizo buffer zones, where deforestation rates are the
                highest, promoted the incorporation of best practices in productive systems and
                contributed to reducing pressures on biodiversity and conservation, both on
                buffer and on nucleus zones;
           iii. Good quality of primary forest cover, as demonstrated by research studies on
                the presence of jaguars in protected areas within the Project’s area of influence.
                Forested areas in the Reserve are linked across the Rio Coco maintain
                connectivity, mobility, and sustain adequate reproduction of emblematic,
                native species (i.e. sub-projects for ecological restoration and promotion of
                productive systems had positive impacts on forest cover, which contributed to
                maintaining jaguar corridors in the area 6).




   6
     Research studies carried out during Project implementation confirm that there is still a presence of jaguars
   in the Reserve. While no specific study demonstrates a direct link between activities financed under the
   Corazón Project and the jaguar population, the increased forest cover supported by sub-project activities is
   expected to contribute to maintaining jaguar habitats in the Reserve.


                                                        11
       b. Through more effective protection and sustainable use of natural resources in
          Honduras and Nicaragua –
        The high participation and involvement of local communities in Project activities
        resulted in effective experiences in terms of decentralized, participatory, and
        multiethnic management of protected areas. The protection of natural resources is
        integral to the vision of native communities of the Reserve, which became a central a
        pillar of initiatives supported by the Project. Specifically, 647 local communities in
        both countries participated in the implementation of 247 sub-projects, which covered
        roughly 7,205 hectares, and benefitted 11,629 families. More than 50 best practices
        for sustainable management of natural resources were demonstrated, and can be
        replicated.
        Moreover, the empowerment of communities and their participation in the
        development of tools for managing protected areas contributed for the first time to
        integrating the local context and local needs into government-led strategies of
        biodiversity conservation and use of natural resources. This will contribute to
        ensuring that proposed policies for the Reserve will be more relevant to local
        communities, making them more sustainable in the long term. Specifically, the
        Project contributed to: (i) promoting participation of communities within the Reserve
        in the development of four management plans and in the assessment of protected
        areas management effectiveness; (ii) building capacity in local communities through
        407 workshops in both countries. These capacity building activities contributed to the
        promotion of environmental governance and to the removal of barriers for
        administrative processing that prevented direct involvement of the communities in the
        development and implementation of their own projects of participatory resource
        management; and (iii) strengthening the SINAP in technical and financial
        management matters, through 47 management tools that are widely applicable in all
        protected areas and were made with highly participatory processes 7.
37. The Project’s revised PDO that aimed at improving the national management of the
    Corazón Reserve, respecting the rights of traditional populations, measured through three
    PDO indicators, was achieved by EOP, as summarized in datasheet and Annex 2. In
    addition, targets for all intermediate indicators were met and/or exceeded, as is reported
    in detail in Annex 2. Considering these outcomes, the efficacy in achievement of GEO
    and PDO is rated as “High”.

   3.3 Efficiency
38. Net Present Value (NPV) was not estimated at the beginning of the Project. An ex post
    analysis of two activities financed under the Project was conducted, where efficiency is
    assessed by evaluating the extent to which these activities contributed to achieving the
    GEO and PDO. Specifically:




   7
    The GEO baseline for management effectiveness was developed using the methodologies PROARCA and
   GEF tracking tool. Deforestation rates were estimated following multi-temporal analyses of land use before
   and after the project in both countries. Social assessments carried out prior to the implementation of the
   Project determined the total number of communities in the area of influence.
                                                      12
     i. Cost- benefits of sub-projects implemented in protected areas - The analysis was
        conducted on the portfolio of sub-projects that financed agro-forestry systems (AFS)
        based on cocoa crops in association with plantain and timber trees. This specific
        portfolio represents roughly 17 percent of all the sub-projects financed under the
        Corazón Project, corresponding to approximately US$1.2 million, and impacting an
        estimated area of 1,198 ha. NPV was estimated for local and international market
        scenarios, both of which were encountered during Project implementation. The
        extent of the assistance provided by the Corazón Project amounted to US$991 per ha.
        Beneficiaries consisted of poor families in protected areas with limited access to
        financing. The assistance received contributed to the implementation of sustainable
        practices within the Reserve, promoting conservation and contributing to
        reforestation. Moreover, it gave beneficiaries the possibility to carry out sustainable,
        income-generating activities (see Annex 3 for details).
    ii. Cost-benefit analysis of monitoring sub-projects follow-up activities - Close
        monitoring and follow-up of sub-project activities has been identified as one of the
        supervision activities that contributed the most to the successful achievement of
        Project objectives. The total costs of sub-project monitoring were estimated as
        roughly US$1 million, which correspond to approximately 13-16 percent of the costs
        of individual sub-projects (see Annex 3). The added costs of monitoring are a
        necessary and useful tool to avoid costs of failed sub-projects, or sub-projects that do
        not contribute to Project objectives.
39. On the basis of the analysis of two types of activities financed under the Project, the
    ICR’s rating for efficiency is “Modest”.

   3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
40. The ICR also assessed project outcomes against original project objectives. At the time of
    Project restructuring, 38.7 percent of all approved funds had been disbursed and
    performance was rated “Unsatisfactory”. The ICR rates the overall outcomes of the
    Project with restructured project objectives as Satisfactory based on a “High” rating for
    relevance, “High” rating for efficacy and “Modest” rating for efficiency. After
    restructuring, additional 55 percent of the Grant was disbursed.
41. Based upon these two ratings, the resulting overall Project outcome rating, estimated on
    as the weighted average of performances pre and post restructuring is “Moderately
    Unsatisfactory”.

   3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
    (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
   Poverty Impacts
42. In the short term, the Project contributed to ensuring food security in very poor
    communities, through financing sub-projects that promoted productive crop
    diversification, as well as agricultural activities that led to the production of basic grains
    and fruits. The Project contributed modestly to the generation of additional incomes in
    local communities. In the medium to long-term, sub-projects may represent potentially
    significant financial contributions to local economies, from the adoption of best practices
                                                 13
   in agricultural activities, to the sale of seedlings, wood and agricultural crops. Sub-
   projects that financed the production of cocoa and coffee represented particularly higher
   opportunities of income generation within local communities given the higher prices that
   can be obtained from these commodities, particularly when commercialized through
   cooperatives, and/or when products were branded, certified as organic and exported.
43. Other sub-projects that promoted cultivation of medicinal plants, ecotourism activities
    and the production of handcrafts represented alternative options for local communities.
    These types of sustainable production sub-projects were popular in both countries and
    have more opportunities to increase the investment with additional financial sources. In
    Nicaragua, for example, 35% of the beneficiaries of Corazón Project are receiving
    additional resources from the projects to complement their economics activities.
   Gender Aspects
44. The Project promoted gender equity by strengthening the capacity of 14,248 women
    (2,946 in Nicaragua and 11,302 in Honduras). The Project established a minimum female
    participation target of 20% of sub-project beneficiaries. This target was broadly
    surpassed, ultimately reaching 45% of women beneficiaries in both countries (54% in
    Nicaragua and 35% in Honduras). Women executed sub-projects that supported
    productive activities such as ecotourism, medicinal plants production, chocolate
    production, handcrafts and others.
45. The Project supported activities that empowered women, particularly in indigenous
    communities, demonstrating their potential to have leadership roles within their
    communities. Indeed, the Project acknowledged and sought out indigenous women
    organizations and associations as important partners for sub-project execution, giving
    them a platform to carry out activities in their communities that traditionally would have
    exclusively reserved to male leaders (e.g. productive activities, territorial limit patrols,
    management of financial resources, and administration and execution of sub-projects).
   Social Development – Indigenous peoples
46. The Project established direct links with Territorial Governments and Indigenous
    Federations, which represent the indigenous communities in Nicaragua and Honduras,
    respectively. This close relationship and continuous coordination throughout Project
    implementation guaranteed the participation of indigenous communities in activities such
    as: i) formulation and approval of Protected Areas Management Plans; ii) formulation
    and endorsement of the UNESCO file for nomination of the Reserve as a Biosphere
    Reserve; iii) socialization of Project Operations, sub-projects and scholarship manuals;
    iv) cooperation in the preparation, approval and implementation of 124 sub-projects
    implemented by indigenous communities in the Reserve.
47. A concerted effort was done in both countries to incorporate elements from local
    indigenous cultures in the design and implementation of activities. As a result, sub-
    projects responded to community demands in a manner that was consistent with their
    local beliefs and traditional practices for the management their vital natural resources. In
    the end, roughly fifty percent of all sub-projects that received financing were
    implemented by indigenous peoples. The Project supported the strengthening of
    administrative capacities for the formulation, and execution of sub-projects as well as to
    the management of economic gains that resulted from the activities.

                                                14
48. The Project contributed in a modest way to the regularization of indigenous lands. In
    Nicaragua, support was provided for demarcation of indigenous lands and for conflict
    resolution activities between various stakeholders. In Honduras, the project supported a
    consultation process on the mechanisms for regularization of ancestral lands.
    Specifically, the Project financed the preparation of background documentation aimed at
    informing a debate at the nation’s Congress on land titling reform for indigenous people.
49. In Nicaragua, the Project supported the creation of the first Indigenous Office for
    Environmental Management in the BOSAWAS Reserve. This office coordinates efforts
    between indigenous communities and MARENA and provides a number of specific
    services to the communities of the Reserve (e.g. volunteer fire fighters). In Honduras, the
    Project supported the first SEDINAFROH territorial office in the Mosquitia, an
    institutional presence in a remote area of the country, with the objective of providing
    assistance to indigenous communities.

   (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
50. The Project supported institutional strengthening efforts in Honduras and Nicaragua,
    including: (i) SINAPs through the development and/or update and validation of 47 policy
    instruments (25 in Honduras and 22 in Nicaragua), which will contribute to improving
    management of protected areas. Most of these instruments were endorsed and
    incorporated into the administrative and technical areas of MARENA and SERNA and
    will be available to be reused in years to come; (ii) capacities in local governments and
    in communities were strengthened, procedures were demonstrated, administrative and
    institutional barriers were resolved, and best practices were disseminated, which will
    allow communities of the Reserve to replicate past experiences, and potentially to access
    other sources of funding; (iii) participatory processes were supported at each step of
    implementation, making sure that local communities, indigenous peoples, women, and
    local governments had an active role in the development and application of policy
    instruments, aiming at making these instruments relevant and sustainable; and (iv) the
    National Fund for Protected Areas was established in Honduras, which will provide a
    small but consistent source of funds to ICF for carrying out annual evaluations of
    management effectiveness in protected areas.

   (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
51. The project strengthened the Mesoamerican Environmental Information System (SIAM-
    CCAD) by establishing a platform for knowledge sharing and partnership between
    SINIAs in Nicaragua and Honduras. The design and management experience of a more
    developed system in Nicaragua was transferred to Honduras. As a result, the SINIA-HN
    was strengthened through internships and workshops that facilitated information sharing
    on management tools and coordination of national information networks. This in turn
    strengthened the overall regional (Central American) system.

   3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
   Beneficiary survey
52. A limited beneficiary survey was conducted, which covered a sample size of 57 people
    (24 in Honduras and 33 in Nicaragua). Approximately 42 percent those interviewed were
    representatives from indigenous groups and 39% were women. Table 2 summarizes the
                                                15
   main results of the survey. The questionnaire, list of people interviewed, and a detailed
   presentation of results are included in Annex 5.
53. Overall, beneficiaries noted that the Project had contributed in a substantial way to its
    objectives of biodiversity conservation and protected area management. Most of the
    beneficiaries interviewed rated as high the incidence of sub-projects on conservation (68
    percent) and on rehabilitation of degraded areas within the protected areas (54 percent).
    Sub-projects promoting agroforestry practices and reforestation systems were the ones
    believed to have the highest impacts.
54. Roughly 89 percent of those interviewed stated that the Project had supported activities
    that respected indigenous rights, also critical to the Project PDO. Opinions varied on the
    economic impacts of sub-project, in terms of their potential to increase incomes of people
    in the Reserve in the longer term. In the short term those interviewed considered that the
    Project had positively contributed to generating income-generating activities. In the long-
    term, factors such as local market prices, availability of technologies, options for
    additional investments, access to markets and commercialization strategies are still
    important challenges to address in order to ensure the sustainability of financial gains.

   Stakeholder workshop
55. A final stakeholder workshop was carried out Managua, on November 28, 2012, which
    included participation of the entire technical teams from Honduras and Nicaragua, and
    limited participation from CCAD. The main objectives of the workshop were to review
    the overall results of the Project, to exchange lessons learned, and to collect additional
    information needed to prepare the Project’s ICR. The workshop was an opportunity for
    field and technical staff to meet for the last time, to reflect on the history of the Project
    and on the accomplishments achieved, and to reinforce plans for sustaining binational
    cooperation and exchanges. Detailed information about the event in included in Annex 6.

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Significant
56. In spite of Project achievements, there are significant risks that Nicaragua and Honduras
    may not be able to sustain some of the gains in the long term. While the Project attempted
    to put in place actions to help mitigate these potential risks, there was limited opportunity
    to address financial and political uncertainties that are outside of the control of the
    implementation agencies. The risks vary by country, and they are more significant in
    Honduras than in Nicaragua. Specifically:
57. In Nicaragua, main risks are related to the availability of funding for MARENA to
    maintain a visible presence in BOSAWAS Reserve, both in terms of management actions
    and of development and monitoring of community subprojects promoting conservation
    and natural resource management. BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve amounts to 91% of the
    total protected areas in Nicaragua. In the current context of limited resources, in spite of
    the high priority level of natural resource management to the government, less funding
    will be available to continue the work in the Project area and this will have a direct
    impact on future conservation efforts.
58. There are three important mitigating circumstances: (i) the Corazon Project team, whose
    leadership and commitment to the objectives of the Project were outstanding, remained in
    MARENA and is currently implementing a Climate Change project 8. This implies that
    there is continuity in the policy efforts, and that mechanisms developed under the Project
    will in fact continue to be used and perfected by MARENA; (ii) efforts that were made to
    strengthen local capacity at the community level within BOSAWAS were fruitful. There
    are documented cases of local associations and communities that have received funding
    from other donors to continue working in sustainable productive activities within the
    Reserve, such as organic crops, crafts and others. The scale of these activities will be
    much smaller than those financed by the Project, but is expected that they will continue.
    Moreover, the results in terms of improvements of protective area management tools will
    remain (i.e. participative mechanisms, incorporation of local characteristics) and will
    continue to support the gains that were obtained through the Project; and (iii) the Project
    contributed to defining the action plan to set up and the operations manual to manage an
    National Environmental Fund (Fondo Nacional del Ambiente, FNA), which will have
    protected areas management as one of its areas of priority. While the FNA was not
    established under the Project, discussions between MARENA and the Ministry of
    Finance are underway regarding the capitalization of the Fund. If the FNA is successfully
    established in the medium term, some financial risks identified above may be reduced.
59. In Honduras, the risks that development outcomes are not maintained are more
    significant. These risks are driven by limited financial resources, the level to which the
    results of the Project will be continued within SERNA, and even more so within the
    Institute of Forest Conservation (ICF), the agency with the actual mandate to oversee
    protected areas and the SINAPH, are not known. The Project area represents 77% of the

     The Project Adaptation of Nicaragua's Water Supplies to Climate Change, financed by the Special
   Climate Change Fund (SCCF) was approved in 2012. The approved amount of this grant was US$ 6
   million.
                                                  17
   total protected areas in Honduras, and ICF’s financial situation is very weak. Therefore,
   in the absence of GEF funds, the continuation of activities will be challenging.
60. Throughout Project implementation, the sustainability of results beyond the Project was
    always highlighted as a concern. Explicit efforts were made, in addition to strengthening
    local governments in the protected areas and updating management tools, to promote
    institutional coordination between SERNA and ICF, team building, and institutional
    uptake of procedures and guidelines. Moreover, one potentially significant result that
    may mitigate some of the risks to sustainability of Project outcomes was the
    capitalization of the Fund for Protected Areas and Wildlife of Honduras (FAPVS) 9 .
    Annual interests generated by this Fund 10 are earmarked for management effectiveness
    evaluations, as per SINAPH’s Strategic Plan, guaranteeing that a minimum number of
    policy-level actions will be maintained, in support of protected area management.
61. The risks that results pertaining to binational coordination and are not maintained beyond
    the Project are very substantial. While political relations between the two countries are
    stable and high level dialogue is possible, little is expected in terms of joint management
    of the CTBR, even with the process to UNESCO underway. Coordination between
    indigenous leaders has been suspended in the absence of funding. While there are lessons
    learned in terms of approaches that would work in the future to facilitate binational
    coordination, these are unlikely to continue beyond the Project.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance
   5.1 Bank
   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
62. Project preparation was detailed, highly participatory and well-coordinated with
    stakeholders. A comprehensive assessment of issues was carried out, and priorities for
    involvement were determined. However, Project design was overly ambitious and
    complex, and it failed to prioritize the top issues that could realistically be tackled by an
    intervention of regional scale, constrained by capacity, financial resources and time. The
    known capacity limitations of the main implementing agencies were underestimated,
    particularly in terms of the effort required to set up an adequate framework for
    decentralizing management of subprojects to local communities. The difficulties of
    working in a regional initiative were underestimated, and the agency that was selected to
    oversee binational coordination was highly inadequate and unable to fulfill its
    responsibilities. Overall, although assessed as high, the risks of implementation were
    underestimated and mitigation measures were not sufficient to address all challenges in a
    timely manner. These shortcomings in preparation had a substantial impact on Project
    performance for the first years of implementation.

      The Fund is managed by BANADESA, under the supervision of a Steering Committee including
   representatives from SERNA and ICF.
   10
      The principal of US$500,000 provided by GEF cannot be spent, only the annual interest is available to
   the Steering Committee, to be used according to a set of eligibility criteria and guidelines included in the
   Operations Manual.
                                                       18
   (b) Quality of Supervision
   (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
63. As is the case of Project implementation, the quality of Bank supervision needs to be
    evaluated in two phases: a first phase spanning from 2007 to late 2010, and a second
    phase from early 2011 until Project closure. During the first phase, the Project faced a
    series of challenges related to implementation pace, procurement, financial management
    and broader institutional issues. Through that period, this ICR rates quality of supervision
    as Unsatisfactory. Indeed, while some of the most significant challenges to
    implementation were identified during these first years of Project execution, the measures
    taken were not sufficient to address the challenges that Honduras and Nicaragua were
    facing. The countries’ perception of this period is that the Bank was not sufficiently
    responsive to the capacity gaps that existed, and that they were largely left alone to
    address the problems.
64. By early 2011 a first level restructuring was undertaken, the Project was simplified and
    support was provided to country teams to improve implementation. With a revised
    Project scope and with continuous technical and fiduciary support from the Bank’s team,
    most administrative, technical and operational issues were resolved. Close contact with
    country units, and an overall intensive quality of supervision was maintained during the
    final two years of implementation. Results were a turnover in execution and overall
    Project implementation: objectives were achieved, and there was a significant
    improvement in the relationship between the Bank and MARENA/SERNA. This ICR
    rates quality of supervision during this second phase as Satisfactory.
65. Considering that Project supervision was rated Unsatisfactory over the first four years of
    implementation and Satisfactory during the final two, the overall rating given by this ICR
    to supervision is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
66. The ICR rates the overall Bank performance as Moderately Unsatisfactory given that
    Bank performance during preparation and during overall implementation has been rated
    Moderately Unsatisfactory.

   5.2 Recipient
   (a) Government Performance
67. The performance of both government agencies (MARENA and SERNA) and that of
    CCAD are evaluated in the next section.

   (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
68. MARENA’s Performance was split into two distinct phases. During the first part of
    implementation, prior to restructuring, the Project faced significant delays and
    inefficiencies related to insufficient capacity of the PIU to execute the various activities.
    The agency’s performance during that first phase is rated as Unsatisfactory. During the
    second stage of implementation, after restructuring, MARENA overcame all its earlier
                                                 19
   challenges, and within the context of the restructured operation, it completed all
   commitments without delays. Moreover, MARENA’s implementation strategy, with its
   mainstreaming of the PIU, made it likely that institutional strengthening efforts will be
   sustainable in the future. This ICR rates MARENA’s performance during that second
   phase as Satisfactory.
69. SERNA faced similar circumstances as MARENA during the first phase of
    implementation, and therefore the overall performance of the agency prior to
    restructuring was rated Unsatisfactory. During the second phase, after restructuring, in
    spite of improvements on implementation, SERNA was not able to address all the issues
    and overcome the delays, and ultimately 12% of the funding was not disbursed.
    Moreover, SERNA’s implementation strategy did not aim at incorporating the PIU into
    its institutional framework. Administrative weaknesses and ineligible expenditures were
    identified during the final year of implementation 11. This led to requiring more Project
    implementation support, including unplanned procurement reviews and addressing red
    flags for increased risks to project management to meet objectives. This ICR rates
    SERNA’s performance after restructuring as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
70. CCAD’s performance did not meet expectations during the first phase of Project
    implementation. The agency’s role as coordinator of binational efforts and policy
    dialogue between Honduras and Nicaragua was not carried out effectively, and the
    agency did little more than fulfilling administrative obligations. CCAD’s performance
    after the Project was restructured continued to be unsatisfactory, even after the scope of
    its actions had been greatly reduced. CCAD failed to meet the fiduciary obligations it had
    been assigned under the Grant Agreement and did not carry out the activities it
    committed to completing during the last year of the Project. This resulted in undisbursed
    funds and in one unfulfilled Project indicator for which the agency was responsible. This
    ICR rates CCAD’s overall performance Unsatisfactory.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
71. The ICR rates overall Recipient performance, calculated as a weighted average of the
    three agencies’ performance before and after the restructuring, as Moderately
    Unsatisfactory.

    6. Lessons Learned
72. Lesson #1 – The development of operational tools that take into account the local socio-
    environmental realities is critical to ensuring that operations in difficult contexts can be
    executed in reasonable times. The majority of the beneficiaries of the Project live in very
    remote areas, some of which are days away from the nearest bank and/or supplier. Given
    the difficulties in accessing and in transporting goods to these areas, a number of
    adjustments were made to Bank guidelines, aimed at facilitating processes. These
    adjustments, for example, eliminated the requirement of having bank accounts, made it
    simpler to utilize local providers, reduced the number of disbursements for individual
    sub-projects, and simplified the format of some of the documents needed to document


   11
    In the weeks prior to ICR delivery the Bank notified the Government of Honduras of expenditures that
   were not adequately documented and were therefore considered ineligible.
                                                    20
   payments. All adjustments to Bank procurement and disbursement guidelines maintained
   the principle of the original guidelines and included sufficient provisions to allow
   accurate documentation of expenditures. These adjustments were documented in Sub-
   Projects Manuals, and were approved and controlled by the World Bank team. They
   revised very strict guidelines that were impossible to implement in a very difficult local
   context, ensuring that fiduciary responsibilities and accountabilities were maintained.
73. Lesson #2 – Direct sub-project implementation by local governments and communities
    requires previous investments in capacity building. The Project was expected to achieve a
    high level of community participation. However, local communities within the area of
    influence of the Project did not have the capacity to prepare and directly implement their
    own sub-projects. Even though a number of earlier Projects have been implemented in
    the area, the typical mechanism used was to contract intermediaries and third parties, who
    would manage funds on behalf of the communities and assist them in the implementation
    of their sub-projects. The Corazón Project is the first to have transferred resources to the
    communities for their direct implementation of activities. However, given the local
    poverty and education levels in the area, it would have been impossible to carry out direct
    execution of activities without first ensuring that capacity was built in these communities
    for management of protected areas, formulation of sub-projects, administrative processes,
    procurement, financial management and monitoring and evaluation, among others.
74. Lesson #3 – Assessment of operational risks under binational Projects must take into
    account overall political conditions and should offer options to surpass barriers and
    ensure continuity of activities. During Project implementation, and particularly during the
    time of political tensions between Nicaragua and Honduras, political barriers arose that
    were not considered in the analysis of risks of the Project. It was important to have
    binational coordination mechanisms at the technical level in place, even though at a
    higher political level relationships were difficult. The technical coordination that was
    maintained throughout implementation of the Corazón Project was important to ensure
    continuity of ongoing initiatives, and to advance on established agreements while the
    complications at a higher political level were resolved.
75. Lesson #4 – Understanding the indigenous cosmovision is central to the participation of
    indigenous peoples in Projects’ execution and to the sustainability of interventions. The
    involvement of National Secretariats of Indigenous People and representation from
    Territorial Governments and Indigenous Federations at various stages of Project’s
    implementation, including sub-project preparation, evaluation and execution, facilitated
    the comprehension of the indigenous cosmovision and a better understanding of the
    communities’ needs, demands, and sustainable ways to address them. The strong
    participation of indigenous communities in the overall Project is a result of the attention
    that was given to incorporating their cultural and social concerns in the development of
    sub-projects, generating a sense of community ownership and relevance for the activities
    that were financed and for the results obtained.
76. Lesson #5 – A minimum of 13 percent of the total investment is required to cover the
    costs of adequate monitoring of sub-projects in remote areas. Close and continuous
    monitoring of sub-project implementation emerged as critical to ensuring adequate
    provision of technical assistance to beneficiaries, a good implementation of sub-project
    activities, and adequate fiduciary management of funds. The cost of monitoring the
    subprojects was between 13 and 16 percent of the total project investment in both

                                                21
   countries. A standardized format was designed for sub-project monitoring, which
   included a detailed questionnaire applied to beneficiaries. The majority of sub-projects
   were visited three times (at the onset, mid-term and closure of the sub-project), and only
   those in the most remote areas were visited twice. These scheduled visits allowed
   executing agencies to establish baselines for each subproject, to assess the progress of
   each activity, to measure final results and to establish each sub-project contribution to the
   macro indicators of the Project.
77. Lesson #6 – Setting explicit targets for women participation in implementation of sub-
    projects in indigenous communities ensures their involvement and promotes their
    empowerment. The Project’s requirement that 20 percent of all sub-project beneficiaries
    were women in order for the communities to have access to sub-projects funds initiated a
    necessary reflection within these communities about the roles of women, their capacity
    and leadership potential and their ability to contribute to sustainability of the Biosphere
    Reserve. Groups of women organized themselves and obtained legal documentation that
    allowed them to become direct beneficiaries as well as financial administrators of their
    own sub-projects. By doing this, the Project empowered indigenous women,
    demonstrating they eagerness to become more actively involved in community matters,
    their organization skills and their capacity to execute sub-projects that resulted in
    concrete impacts to their families and the environment.
78. Lesson #7 – The PROARCA and GEF tracking tools can be adapted to better capture the
    socio-environmental conditions of local protected areas. In Nicaragua, the PROARCA
    tool was revised and adjusted to achieve separate evaluations of management
    effectiveness accounting for natural resources and the biodiversity criteria, as well as risk
    management criteria that allowed evaluating actions relevant to climate change
    adaptation. The tool was also modified to include an indigenous focus, included local
    socio-economic criteria that made results more relevant to the area of the Project, such as:
    a) management of indigenous territories and communities; b) territorial and indigenous
    community governability; c) sustainable development and the treatment of Mother Earth;
    and d) vulnerable zones, emergencies and community prevention in indigenous
    territories.

   7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

   (a) Borrower/implementing agencies
79. Annex 8 transcribes the comments received from MARENA and SERNA. No comments
    were received from CCAD. MARENA rated overall Project performance as Highly
    Satisfactory, in terms of government ownership, commitment and achievement of PDO.
    The participatory nature of the Project and the integration of local considerations
    (including indigenous) in the design and implementation of sub-projects were highly
    rated. The ability to respond to specific implementation needs, in terms of capacity,
    methodologies, procedures and instruments for project execution was perceived as a key
    element to the success of the Project. The World Bank performance was rated as
    Moderately Satisfactory prior to restructuring and Highly Satisfactory following the
    restructuring. Challenges faced during the first years of implementation were recognized,
    but the support of the Bank throughout implementation was acknowledged.


                                                 22
80. SERNA rated overall Project performance as satisfactory, but identified serious
    challenges and limitations with the original design and funding allocation. The
    performance of the Bank was rated as Unsatisfactory in the period preceding the MTR
    and restructuring. A notable improvement in the level of support provided to the agency
    following the restructuring was recognized.

Component 1: Strengthening of National Protected Areas Systems (Sistemas
Nacionales de Áreas Protegidas, SINAPs)

Component 1 contributed to strengthening the Honduras and Nicaragua SINAPs through
the development and/or updating of technical instruments aimed at promoting effective
management of Protected Areas (e.g. Management Plans, manuals, guidelines, and
management effectiveness evaluations). These tools were developed through highly
participatory mechanisms. The active participation of communities and local
governments in the various activities funded by the Project was one of the most
remarkable and most effective achievements of this component.
The Project also contributed to the development of financial tools aimed at providing
sources of funding to ensure the sustainability of the SINAPs. In Nicaragua, an
operations manual and an action plan for the establishment of the National Protected
Areas Fund (Fondo Nacional de Áreas Protegidas, FNAP) were prepared under the
Project, and policy dialogue was carried out to support its creation. In Honduras, the
FAPVS was capitalized with one million dollars (50% GEF resources and 50% of
government counterpart). The governance structure for the FAPVS Honduras involves a
Steering Committee that includes participation of SERNA and ICF, and which
periodically reports to a Ministerial Committee.

1.1. Updating Protected Areas Management Plans and Development of Management
Tools for the SINAPs

Indicator #1 – Achieved: Management plans for the four (4) protected areas in
the Corazón Reserve were updated under the Project
   •   In Nicaragua, the management plan “Plan de Protección y Manejo Conjunto de la
       Reserva Biosfera de BOSAWAS (RBB)” was updated, respecting the rights and
       integrity of the 7 indigenous territories that live in the Reserve. This involved
       incorporating indigenous environmental standards (normas ecológicas) and
       development plans, as well as their customs, beliefs, and communal organization
       structure, underpinned by their consmovision and respect for Mother Earth. The
       updated plan is a new system of joint management that was agreed by government
       and indigenous peoples, with the objective of ensuring equal participation in the
       decision-making process of initiatives, actions and investments aimed at
       improving the management effectiveness of the RBB.
   •   In Honduras, the process of upgrading of the management plans for the three
       protected areas (Reserva del Hombre and Biosfera del Río Plátano, Reserva de
       Biosfera Tawahka Asangni, and the Parque Nacional Patuca) was also carried
       out ensuring wide participation of actors at regional and local levels, involving
       state agencies, local governments, academia, civil society, business and
       production industry, and local communities (indigenous and Ladino). The update
       of the management plan of the Reserva de Biosfera Tawahka Asangni was
       particularly important, as it was done under the leadership of the NGO Alianza
       Verde, of Tawahka origin. For the first time in the history of Honduras, an
                                          29
       indigenous federation became responsible of the preparation of the management
       plan for their own ancestral land, with full support and endorsement from the
       central government.
   In both countries, organized training to communities, local governments, indigenous
   federations and indigenous territorial governments was carried out during the
   formulation of these plans, as well as during activities leading to the measurement of
   management effectiveness of the protected areas. Other relevant central institutions
   (in addition to MARENA and SERNA) participated and became partners in the
   process of updating these management plans, including, ICF and SEDINAFROH in
   Honduras, and the Secretariat of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua

Indicator #2 – Achieved: 47 policies and/or instruments for protected area management
developed and/or updated under the Project in the two countries.
The actions of SERNA and MARENA, SINAP coordinators in Honduras and Nicaragua,
respectively, were strengthened through the development and/or update of 47 protected
area management tools (22 in Nicaragua and 25 in Honduras). These instruments
includes: (i) operations manuals to strengthen the technical and financial management of
the SINAPs, such as guidelines for development of management plans for protected areas,
for farms within the Reserves; (ii) operations manuals for sub-projects, highlighting good
practices in terms of local development and community participation; (iii) updated
environmental standards; (iv) technical and scientific information used in the generation
of baselines; (v) monitoring systems for biodiversity, land use and forestry; (vi) materials
for environmental education; and others. Included among these instruments are 25
manuals for participatory management processes (8 in Nicaragua and 17 in Honduras),
which were generated and validated with local communities. Through this formalization
of combined of technical and scientific knowledge with local, traditional knowledge, the
Project aimed at promoting sustainability in the application of these tools in the long term.

Indicator # 3 – Achieved: Improvement in the management effectiveness rating of the
two National Protected Areas Systems (SINAPs) according to the PROARCA
methodology.

The management effectiveness rating of the four protective areas show the contributions
made to biodiversity conservation by sub-projects that supported participatory
management and community governance. The same positive assessment is given to
Project investments that focused on strengthening organizational structures and supported
training for administrative and business management in the territories.
   •   The Reserva Biosfera de BOSAWAS (RBB) is being managed more effectively,
       with an “good” rating in the areas inhabited by indigenous populations, and it has
       maintained a score of “fair” in areas inhabited by mestizos. These ratings were
       consistent in every monitoring of management effectiveness conducted annually
       under the Project since 2009, using 2006 as base year.
   •   The Reserva del Hombre and Biosfera del Río Plátano received a “fair” rating in
       consecutive annual monitoring events conducted from 2010 to 2012. This rating is
       strongly associated to the high weighting assigned by PROARCA to economic
       and financial criteria, as relevant interest groups receive direct benefits under
       Project activities.
   •   The Reserva de Biosfera Tawahka Asangni Tawahka maintained a rating of
       “Regular” throughout annual monitoring events conducted from 2010 to 2012.
   •   The Parque Nacional Patuca maintained its “Fair” rating throughout the period
       of Project implementation. This rating is low relative to the others PAs primarily
       due to low scores under criteria related to administrative capacity, which points to
       the lack of personnel necessary for an adequate management of the protected area
       (a responsibility of ICF), and the lack of maintenance of infrastructure in the area.

Indicator # 4 – Achieved: Technical Proposal for the recognition of the CTBR by
UNESCO prepared, and endorsed by national governments and indigenous peoples
The technical proposal to UNESCO for the nomination of the CTBR was approved and
endorsed through a long process that involved broad participation of local municipalities
and indigenous territories, in both countries. The Project supported a final binational
meeting that was conducted in Nicaragua, in November 2012, with the objective of

                                              33
agreeing on the final name for the Reserve, to be included in the UNESCO proposal. The
name unanimously approved at the meeting was: PATRIMONIO ANCESTRAL
INDÍGENA DE LA RESERVA DE LA BIOSFERA TRANSFRONTERIZA ABYAYALA
(INDIGENOUS ANCESTRAL HERITAGE OF THE TRANSBOUNDARY
BIOSPHERE RESERVE ABYAYALA). The indigenous word Abyayala means Ancestral
Earth, Mother Earth or Life for All, and also stands for American Land. Indigenous
history books use this name for the area when referring to historic indigenous efforts to
defend ancestral natural resources.
The preparation of the technical proposal involved extensive binational work and
coordination between binational teams at all levels (central and municipal governments,
Territories and Indigenous Federations, SERNA and MARENA, as well as technical
teams). The document consolidated information that the Nicaragua and Honduras country
teams worked at compiling (e.g. scientific, social, economic, and environmental)
including data generated by the Project (e.g. administrative and participatory
management data, zoning information). This information was added into a binational
geographic information system unifying the classification categories of information for
both countries, generating maps for the proposed harmonized binational Corazón Reserve.
At the end of the Project, the endorsed technical proposal was delivered to the Ministry of
Environment in Nicaragua, and the Secretary of Environment in Honduras. The final
steps of submitting the proposal to UNESCO will need to be undertaken by Foreign
Affairs ministries in both countries, following the steps and the timeline prepared by the
technical country teams.

1.2. Strengthening mechanisms for sustainability financing

Indicator # 1 – Achieved: Establishment of Fund for Protected Areas and Wildlife of
Honduras.
The Fund for Protected Areas and Wildlife of Honduras (Fondo Ambiental de Areas
Protegidas y Vida Silvestre, FAPVS) was established under the Protected Areas and
Wildlife and Forestry Act (Article 35) in 2006. The Technical Implementation Unit of the
Fund started operations in 2009, with the responsibility for the administration of
resources allocated by the State (60 million Lempiras). In 2012, after Honduras met all of
the conditions established in the Grant Agreement, the Corazón Project contributed
US$500,000 to the capitalization of FAPVS. The endowment fund was established in
BANADESA, and will be administered by the Bank’s endowment fund unit, which will
report directly to the Steering Committee of the FAPVS. In 2013, the Committee of the
SINAP (Comité de Apoyo del SINAP), the technical arm of the Fund’s Steering
Committee has the responsibility of announcing the establishment of the Fund to national
and international agencies currently working on issues related to protected areas in
Honduras, as well as of promoting the use and implementation of available resources,
according to the Operating Manual of the Fund. The annual interests generated from the
principal amount, will finance annual measurement of management effectiveness in
protected areas of the SINAP.

Indicator # 2 – Achieved: Action Plan for the establishment of a Fund for Protected
Areas in Nicaragua developed and endorsed by relevant authorities.

                                            34
In Nicaragua, the Project’s contribution to the strengthening of financial mechanisms for
sustainability of protected areas within the SINAP consisted in developing instruments
aimed at promoting the creation of a Protected Areas Fund (FAP). The proposed FAP is
expected to be administered by MARENA and promoted within state institutions, the
donor community, and international organizations as a financial mechanism of the
SINAP. The Corazón Project developed proposed methodology and procedures that
MARENA could use to establish and manage the Fund. Specifically, the Project
contributed to the preparation of the following documents: (i) concept paper and proposal
for the design of the FAP; (ii) FAP Operating Manual; and (iii) FAP action plan.

conservation measures.

2.1. Sub-projects for Participatory Management and Sustainable Production

GEF Tracking Tool

The management effectiveness rating of the four protective areas, with PROARCA and
GEF tracking tools, show the importance of contributions made to biodiversity
conservation by sub-projects that supported participatory management and community
governance. The rating obtained using the GEF tracking tool methodology is consistent
with the results using the PROARCA methodology.
Using the GEF Tracking Tool methodology, for evaluating the management effectiveness
in the four protected areas of the Corazón Reserve is "Fair". Summary ratings are
presented in the table below. Important factors contributing to this rating are: (i)
participation of indigenous territories and local communities in the decision-making
                                              36
process for the protected areas; (ii) training and research conducted in the areas; (iii)
development of community framework for supporting environmental management within
the protected areas (e.g. guards, fire-fighting brigades); and (iv) number of sub-projects
financing sustainable production, which are contributing to the management and
conservation of biodiversity in protected areas.

Indicator # 2 - Achieved: Deforestation rates in the CTBR estimated annually and
linked to activities included in management plans for the protected areas
The rate of deforestation in both countries is estimated using multitemporal studies of
land use using satellite imagery cross checked with field verification. In Nicaragua, the
deforestation rate evaluated in the Reserva de Biosfera BOSAWAS (RBB) from 1987 to
2012 remained low for nucleus zones and high for buffer zones, with rates of -0.6% and -
3.2%, respectively. Results showed that in areas of the RBB with primary forest cover at
the nucleus zones, coverage rates have remained at 81 to 94% in Nicaragua and Honduras,
respectivily. Most of the preserved primary forest cover is located in indigenous
territories of the Reserve.
In Honduras, the assessed annual deforestation rate is low (0.59%). Forest loss in the
period 2005 to 2010 was estimated at 65,150 hectares. Average primary forest cover in
the three protected areas covered under the Project remained high at 90% of the total,
equivalent to about 1,325,536 hectares (2010).

Indicator # 3 – Achieved: 4,500 families in Nicaragua and 1,500 in Honduras develop
and implement conservation sub-projects

Sub-projects implemented under the Project in Honduras and Nicaragua benefitted
11,629 families (5,416 and 6,213 families in Nicaragua and Honduras, respectively). A
total of 247 sub-projects were completed, of which 131 promoted sustainable production
and 116 focused on participatory management of natural resources. Sub-projects
combined objectives of promoting a more sustainable management of protected areas
within the Reserve, with the need to improve socio-economic conditions of people living
in the area of influence of the Project.
Sub-projects provided positive experiences of financing in local communities, with over
50 good practices implemented in 7,205 hectares (3,090 ha. and 4,115 ha. in Nicaragua
and Honduras, respectively). The methodology developed to implement sub-projects
promoted ownership and strengthened capacity of executing parties, as beneficiaries
received resources, technical assistance, as well as administrative and fiduciary training.
Project funds amounted to a maximum of US$20,000 per sub-project, matched by
beneficiary counterpart financing of at least 20%.
The targets for this indicator were exceeded by 70% and 89% in Nicaragua and Honduras,
respectively. The involvement of communities in the Reserve as executors and
beneficiaries of Project funds represents one of the most dynamic and multi-ethnic
experiences of participatory management of protected areas in Central America.

2.2. Governance of Natural Resources Strengthened

Indicator # 1 – Achieved: Adoption of manuals for participative management of
protected areas of the CTBR (7 in Nicaragua and 6 in Honduras)
In Nicaragua, seven manuals were developed and instruments to promote participatory
management in protected areas were updated/validated by communities in the Reserve.
This strengthened not only both countries’ SINAPs, but also the governance of local
communities and indigenous peoples. Indeed, these instruments were developed while
searching for a balance between new scientific knowledge and local traditions, which will
guarantee ownership by the communities and sustainability of their use. Specifically, the
instruments developed include: i) manual of land use changes in the RBB; ii) illustrated
guide to birds of the RBB; iii) manual for implementation of sub-projects for
participatory management and natural resources; iv) research program for the RBB; v)
technical dossier to be presented at UNESCO in support of the nomination of Corazón as
a Biosphere Reserve; vi) update of the RBB’s technical dossier to be presented to
UNESCO; and vii) manual for scholarship program and for vocational and technical
training in natural resources and environmental issues related to sustainable rural
development in the RBB.
In Honduras, six manuals aimed at promoting participatory management of protected
areas were developed/updated: i) manual for implementation of sub-projects for
participatory management and natural resources; ii) update of manual for monitoring
management effectiveness of SINAP; iii) guidelines for the construction of infrastructure
in protected areas of the SINAP; iv) strategy for the implementation of the National
Environmental Information System of Honduras (SINIA); v) strategy for information
monitoring and management in the protected areas; and vi) scholarship manual.


                                           39
Indicator # 2 – Achieved: 1,600 and 1,000 ha. within the Corazón Reserve under
rehabilitation/protection and sustainable use of local communities, in Nicaragua and
Honduras, respectively.
The target values of this indicator were largely exceeded. Indeed, through the
implementation of sub-projects, 7,205 ha. of land within the Corazón Reserve (in both
countries) were placed under rehabilitation / protection and sustainable use of
communities.
   •   In Nicaragua, a total area of 3,090 ha. was covered by sub-projects focusing on
       associations of cocoa and / or coffee crops with fruit and timber trees, as well as
       on sustainable agroforestry activities, environmental education and others.
   •   In Honduras, the implementation of sub-projects had positive impacts on 4,115 ha.
       within the Reserve. Sub-projects included the promotion of best practices related
       to cocoa crops, associations of coffee with timber trees and fruit trees, agro-
       forestry activities, recuperation of degraded areas and others.

Indicator # 3 – Achieved: At least 20 percent and 30 percent of sub-project beneficiaries
in Nicaragua and Honduras, respectively, are women
The targets for this indicator were largely exceeded in both countries. On average, sub-
projects reached 45 percent of women beneficiaries.
   •   In Nicaragua, 54 percent of sub-project beneficiaries were women
   •   In Honduras, 35 percent of all beneficiaries were women

Indicator # 4 – Achieved: Percentage of indigenous communities living in the Reserve
benefitting from sub-projects in Nicaragua and Honduras reaches 85 percent and 50
percent respectively.
In Nicaragua, implementation of sub-projects benefited 89 percent of indigenous
communities in the RBB (50 percent of the sub-projects were executed by indigenous
beneficiaries), who actively participated in different activities including sustainable
production, conservation and participatory management of protected areas associated
with land development. Roughly half of the sub-projects involved major efforts to set up
adequate administrative frameworks, including formalization of legal status, and to
strengthen the capacity of beneficiaries to develop proposals and monitor their
implementation.
In Honduras, 81 percent of the communities living in the three protected areas benefitted
by sub-projects that were financed under the Corazón Project. In fact, 51 percent of the
sub-projects were executed by indigenous beneficiaries.
In both countries, the Project also contributed to strengthening governance of indigenous
communities through support of activities dealing with conflict resolution with third
parties regarding ancestral land ownership, land regularization and titling, gender issues,
and others.
It is important to note that indigenous leaders participated in training and capacity
building activities related to preparation, implementation and monitoring of sub-projects.
The sub-project and scholarship manuals were disclosed and discussed with indigenous
leaders, as well as beneficiaries, in order to ensure effective participation of the
                                            40
communities/territories. The direct participation of these communities or of their
representative leaders assured incorporation of local socio-political considerations in the
design of sub-projects, ensuring their long-term ownership and sustainability.

Indicator # 5 – Achieved: Promote capacity building through the preparation of
workshops: 60 mestizo communities and 80 indigenous communities in Nicaragua; at
least 70 workshops for ladino communities and 70 for indigenous communities in
Honduras

The Project financed a total of 407 capacity building workshops. Of those, 170 were
aimed at indigenous communities (80 in Nicaragua and 90 in Honduras) and 237 to
mestizo communities (60 in Nicaragua and 177 in Honduras). Workshops covered a
variety of themes including: (i) project preparation, along specific eligibility criteria and
with targeted objectives; (ii) strengthening governance for natural resource management
– e.g. training in good practices, conservation and monitoring of biodiversity and
protected areas; (iii) business administration and management, financial and procurement
management – e.g. obtaining legal status, opening of bank accounts, selecting providers;
(iv) exchanges of good practices to address conditions – e.g. germination problems,
unfavorable climate variability (drought and excessive rain), and lack access road
infrastructure in remote areas; (v) commercialization techniques – e.g. adding blue to
products, pricing, marketing, associating, etc.; and (vi) in indigenous communities, some
workshops also included review of regulatory frameworks and basic administrative
procedures.

Indicator # 6 – Achieved: At least 75 and 60 scholarships on topics related to
conservation, environmental sciences, and protected area management awarded in
Nicaragua and Honduras, respectively.
A total of 233 scholarships were awarded (158 in Honduras and 75 in Nicaragua) through
the Project. Three different types of scholarships were financed: a) scholarships for
university programs, where the main objective was is provide training (at a professional
level, or at a technician level) in areas such as environmental sciences, natural resource
management, and rural development. en universidades o centros de estudios técnicos del
país; b) scholarships for short-term courses and technical training, aimed primarily at
young leaders with interests in environment, who participated in capacity building events
and exchanges to share experiences with other communities; and c) stipend for young
indigenous students enrolled in natural resource management of environmental studies.
These types of scholarships provided a small stipend for indigenous students living far
away from their communities of origin. In many instances, the lack of resources to buy
the most basic daily necessities contributed to these students abandoning their studies and
returning to their communities.



Component 3: Monitoring and Information Management
At the beginning of the Project Honduras and Nicaragua had very different baselines in
terms of the level of development of the National Environmental Information System
(SINIA). Nicaragua had an established, fully operational system managed by MARENA,

                                             41
while in Honduras, SERNA did not have the basic structure for the establishment of the
system. Consequently, the support provided by the Project was different in both countries,
and Honduras greatly benefitted from the experience that Nicaragua was able to provide.
In Nicaragua the Project became a platform to strengthen the monitoring of biodiversity
in the RBB, specifically in relation to indicators for forestry, land use, hot spots, and flora
and fauna. On a more regional context, four of the indicators developed for the RBB meet
the agreed criteria for regional indicators under the Mesoamerican Biodiversity Program
(PROMEBIO). The SINIA Honduras was at a much earlier stage of development than
that in Nicaragua, and therefore objectives were significantly more modest. Through the
Project, the SINIA was strengthened by the development of an overall strategy for the
development of the system, including action plans for institutional coordination,
equipment, and training of SERNA personnel. Support also included exchanges and
internships with SINIA of Nicaragua, which demonstrated in very hands-on manner, the
potential and usefulness of such an information system.
Moreover, this component strengthened the Mesoamerican Environmental Information
System (SIAM), which involves all the SINIAs of Central America.

3.1. Capacity for monitoring and information management in Nicaragua
strengthened and benefitting management needs of the Corazón Project through the
National Environmental Information System (SINIA)

Indicator # 1 – Achieved: 95 percent of field data collected through biological and
socio-economic monitoring program have been integrated into databases in Nicaragua.

The Project supported the generation and compilation of environmental and socio-
economic data that were incorporated in the SINIA-MARENA databases. Roughly 95%
of the data correspond to the following:
    - 1,097 reports of species for each protected area of the SINIA were incorporated
        into SINIA databases that were developed with support from the Project. The
        design of the databases was done in consistency with the Global Biodiversity
        Information Framework (GBIF).
    - 419 control points for land use within the RBB were also developed and
        incorporated into the SINIA-MARENA database developed under the Project.
        These data are effectively being used by MARENA, in conjunction with satellite
        images, to monitor changes in land use (e.g. deforestation) within the Reserve.

Indicator # 2 – Achieved: Web page of the SINIA Honduras established and including
published information on biodiversity indicators

The SINIA Honduras webpage was developed under the Project, with the objective of
compiling and systematizing available environmental and biodiversity information, and
making it available to the general public, through a portal administered by SERNA. The
new portal includes interactive platforms as well as a module containing environmental
geographic information (MIGA). The MIGA displays GIS data environmental available
GIS data available in SERNA, facilitating a rapid assessment of potential environmental
impacts resulting from specific activities.


                                              42
Indicator # 3 – Achieved: Development of protected area indicators in Honduras, to be
monitored in the future.
The monitoring of biodiversity indicators was done through monitoring studies of
ecological integrity and multitemporal analysis of land uses. A set of indicators and
methodologies was derived from this type of evaluation, which can be used in the future
for monitoring protected areas. Multitemporal analysis was used to determine indicators
such as deforestation rate and forest cover within protected areas.

Indicator # 4 – Achieved: At least six research projects related to protected areas
management in the Corazón Reserve carried out by CCAD in partnership with academic
and/or research institutions
CCAD carried out research studies that supported the acquisition of knowledge on
protected area management practices in the Reserve. Research topics ranged from
identifying ancestral medicinal practices to assessing impacts generated by mining both
for residents and for natural resources in the Reserve. Major research contributions
generated by CCAD included the following:
   1. Compilation of the Ditalyang knowledge on the use of medicinal plants - This
      research focused on documenting ancestral knowledge of existing plants in the
      Corazón Reserve and their potential uses for medicinal purposes.
   2. Identification of harmonic coexistence systems in the heart of the Corazón
      Reserve – This study documents social threats to indigenous peoples living in the
      Reserve, derived from structural and historical causes of poverty and social
      exclusion. This study provides guidelines for the establishment of a "green system
      of production" that allows the incorporation of the economic activity of the local
      people in harmony with local natural resources.
   3. Identification of flora and fauna in pasture ecosystems for biodiversity
      conservation in the BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve - This study research aimed at
      identifying species of the BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve ecosystem aimed at
      guiding conservation efforts.
   4. Environmental and socioeconomic diagnosis of the Parque Nacional Cerro
      Saslaya in the BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve – This research study identified
      strategies for sustainable management of resources within this protected area, and
      proposed an action plan to carry out conservation-related activities.
   5. Environmental impacts of industrial mining activities in the buffer zone of the
      BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve - This study evaluates the impacts of mercury, a
      by-product of artisanal mining in the Community Los Cocos, Town of Bonanza,
      RAAN on human health and the environment, with a particular focus on the
      impact in the biodiversity of BOSAWAS.
   6. Monitoring populations of jaguars – CCAD coordinated efforts to update a study
      on jaguar populations in the Corazón Reserve. The study was ultimately not
      published within the timeframe of the Project, but efforts were made to compile
      available information and to network agencies and NGOs working in the area to
      monitor populatios of jaguars within the Corazón Reserve.


                                          43
Indicator # 5 – Achieved: Jaguar populations under monitoring in the Corazon Reserve
in Honduras and Nicaragua and data used as indicators of ecological integrity

In the four protected areas of influence of the project monitoring studies were conducted
with additional support of other specialized research centers. In Honduras, research
studies confirmed the presence of jaguars in the three protected areas of the Project
(estimated density of 4.2 jaguars per 100 km2) reflecting good ecological integrity of the
reserves (WCS / GIBHBALAM, 2008). In Nicaragua, the presence of jaguars was also
confirmed through accounts and monitoring reports, which were uploaded into SINIA
databases.
The presence of jaguars is a good indicator of connectivity, good forest cover and
adequate food sources across the Mesoamerican Corridor. Given the extension of the
Corazón Reserve, and the limited scope (within that overall context) of the activities that
were financed under the Project, no specific intervention supported by the Project can be
linked directly to the presence of jaguars in the area. However, the implementation of
good natural resource management practices, the support to sub-projects that aimed at
recovering impacted/deforested areas, will contribute to maintaining jaguar habitats in the
region. Moreover, the Project did promote a dialogue between MARENA, SERNA,
CCAD and research institutions that have been monitoring jaguar populations in the area,
on the need to continue monitoring this specie and incorporated specific indicators in the
SINIA databases.


Component 4: Project Administered Effectively
4.1. Project administered efficiently

Indicator # 1 – Achieved: Project management system working efficiently, according to
World Bank and CCAD standards
The Project successfully contributed to establishing a capacity within Project
Implementation Units in SERNA, MARENA and CCAD to comply with fiduciary
commitments, as defined in the Grant Agreement. Occasional issues occurred throughout

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
                           (including assumptions in the analysis)

A cost-benefit analysis of the activities to be implemented under the Corazón Project was
not carried out during the formulation and start phase. Activities were executed under the
assumption that they would contribute to the Global Environmental Objective, i.e.
contributing to the conservation of biodiversity within the Corazón Reserve. In that
context, the present analysis is carried out ex post examining the impact of some of the
activities financed by the Project after its implementation. Efficiency is evaluated by
assessing the different use of available resources and their relative contribution to
achieving the Project’s Global Environmental Objective (GEO) objective.

Benefits of sub-projects implemented in protected areas
Sub-project proposals presented by communities typically involved activities previously
executed by the community, or by neighbors, with which beneficiaries had some limited
prior experience. This ex post evaluation focused on the portfolio of the agro-forestry
sub-projects, specifically those in which cocoa crops were grown in association with
timber woods and with other crops such as plantains. Roughly 17 percent of all sub-
projects financed under the Project correspond to this type, with a total investment of 1.2
million dollars, and impacting an area of 1,198 ha. in both countries. Beneficiaries of
these types of subprojects contributed with a counterparts higher that those requested in
the sub-project manual (the median counterpart contributed was 30 percent, higher than
the 20 percent requested).
The present economic analysis estimated the net present value (NPV) of these specific
sub-projects, using as a reference the costs of similar projects implemented in another
Biosphere Reserve in Nicaragua 12. The NPV was estimated considering 20 years of the
cocoa 13 crop, with net investments associated by harvests of cocoa after the fourth year,
and of plantain after the second and third year. Estimates did not include potential
benefits from the sale of wood, given the restrictions that apply to the sale of wood from
protected areas. However, it would be possible to carry out controlled forest thinning
activities as part of sustainable management of the areas. Two scenarios were considered:
    i) Local market scenario: The entire cocoa production is commercialized at local
         markets (price per unit:US$58)
    ii) International market scenario: All production is commercialized at the
         international market (price per unit: US$70). The main factors that would

  It is estimated that yield from a cocoa plantation can be obtained for up to 30 years as long as good
handling of the crop is performed. The maximum yield is typically achieved during the 7th year with
12qq/mz (IICA-ProDeSoc, 2006).

       influence the placement of products in the international market are: a) continuity
       and consistency of sustainable production; b) product certification; c)
       international price stability; and d) limited impacts of external factors (e.g. natural
       disasters, fire, crop disease). Another assumption of the analysis is that the sub-
       projects considered are being implemented following improved techniques
       (compared to a baseline case where traditional methods are used), which will lead
       higher yield per hectare.

NPV estimated in the local market scenario is US$ 1,445.2 and that for the international
market scenario is US$ 1,932.4 per hectare. Therefore, using the assumptions presented,
sub-projects promoting cocoa production contributed to restoring degraded areas of the
Reserve, added to forest cover, contributed to conservation of the Project area, and
contributed to improving the economic situation of beneficiaries.
Beneficiaries of these types of sub-projects face considerable limitations to access
sources of financing, for reasons that vary widely, and include for instance: (i) lack of
financial institutions in remote areas of the Reserve that are available to provide credit;
(ii) difficulties establishing credit histories; (iii) risk profile to access resources because
of the high volatility of the agricultural income and the lack of economic assets that could
serve as collateral. Therefore, in this context, the Corazón Project provided concessional
financing conditions for activities that local communities would not have been able to
carry out in the absence of Project support.

Therefore, in addition to meeting its conservation purposes, the Corazon Project acted as
a complement to the financial markets in these remote, rural zones. Investments in cocoa
sub-projects will catalyze higher incomes for benefited families in the protected areas.
The cost to the Project of each hectare cultivated under this type of subprojects was
US$991. The NPV obtained shows that for each dollar invested from US$0.09 and up to
US$0.22 dollars are returned under the local and international market scenarios,
respectively. Moreover, it was estimated that those crops that are cultivated under the
highest standards (sustainable, organic, certified crops), which may access fine
international cocoa markets crop may reach returns as high as US$3 to US$5 dollars for
each dollar invested, using a price in the international market of US$ 200 per ton 14.

Analysis Monitoring Sub-projects Cost

Monitoring and close follow-up was central to the successful completion of sub-projects
financed under the Project. Given the remoteness of beneficiary communities and the
difficulties in accessing sub-project sites, the Project explicitly accounted for monitoring
costs in order to document the need to adequately plan for this type of support in future
interventions in similar areas.
The aggregated costs of sub-project monitoring was estimated at roughly US$ 1 million
(13 and 16 percent of the total costs of sub-projects 15 in Nicaragua and Honduras,
respectively). These costs covered expenditures that can be sub-divided into the
following six categories: a) technicians honorariums (47%); b) training workshops (25%),
c) stipends (17%); d) transportation costs (9%); e) Fuel (4%) and f) monitoring
equipment (3%). Training workshops at each community were needed during the sub-
projects formulation phase as well as for implementation, to ensure that communities
were able to complete the development of proposals and that implementation proceeded
smoothly. The costs of these workshops amounted (on average) US$556-664 dollars per
sub-project in Honduras and Nicaragua, respectively.
Lowest costs for monitoring relative to total sub-project costs were achieved in Nicaragua,
where the strategy was to use local labor to monitor all 129 subprojects. In Honduras, the
strategy adopted was to hire professionals to monitor 118 sub-projects across the area of
impact, which ultimately resulted in higher overall costs, mainly due to transportation
expenses 16. The lack of road infrastructure and the communities’ establishment in remote
areas (mainly in the protected areas nuclei zones) made the monitoring process an
arduous and risk task for the monitoring teams.
A main conclusion and lesson learned from the Corazón Project is that the successes and
impacts achieved through sub-project implementation would have not occurred in the
absence of close monitoring and support to beneficiary communities, which for the first
time in the history of protected areas management operations in Nicaragua and Honduras,
were given executing responsibilities. The costs of this support were significant in the
overall context of the Project, but justifiable given the capacity needs of beneficiary
communities, the remoteness and logistical difficulties associated with the Project area
without the capacity of local governments to support this decentralized approach.
A number of factors have been identified, which should be taken into consideration in
order to minimize the costs of sub-project monitoring in future interventions of similar
characteristics: i) transportation and fuel expenses are minimized when hiring specialists
from the Project area of influence, and when optimizing the geographical distribution of
sub-projects beneficiaries; (ii) sub-project development and supervision activities can be

   The subproject total cost includes: a) the financing amount given to the subproject (an average of 20 thousand
dollars) b) The subproject monitoring cost (operative costs and trainings)

   The transportation cost includes fuel, airfare and maritime tickets to carry out monitoring

minimized by establishing offices close to the Project’s area of influence; (iii) the social
evaluation conducted during the formulation phase of the Project could identify potential
beneficiaries capacities upfront, in order to optimize capacity building activities that will
need to be conducting.

Summary

A diverse sample of beneficiaries of the Corazon Project in Honduras and Nicaragua
participated in the Survey of Beneficiaries of the Project, with the aim of providing their
opinions on the results and impacts of the Project. A specific questionnaire was
formulated for the Project, which included four sections: a) Data on respondent; b)
Assessment of the overall objectives of the Project; c) Assessment of sub-projects; and d)
General Feedback and Recommendations. This questionnaire was applied to a sample of
6 categories of beneficiaries: a) Beneficiaries from governments/indigenous federations;
b) Beneficiaries from central/regional/territorial governments; c) beneficiaries from
technical - scientific organizations; d) Community-based beneficiaries, e) recipients of

A total of 57 surveys were carried out in both countries (24 in Honduras, 33 in
Nicaragua). Among beneficiaries, 53 % had a high knowledge of the project and was
mainly involved in activities such as: a) initial preparation of the project (23%); b)
participation in project/sub – project committee (18%); c) Participation in workshops
( 37%); d) Participation in activities related to the UNESCO submission (8 %); e)
activities related to the development and /or update of management plans (14%).

The sample included participation of representatives from indigenous groups (42%), from
government and community associations, among which: 89% felt that all actions
executed respected the rights of traditional peoples and 51% of respondents rated as high
participation of indigenous people in sub-projects. Roughly 40% of the sample consisted
of women, and 60% of the questionnaires were applied to beneficiaries of sub - projects
(53 % of production and 43 % sustainable participatory management).

Recipients in Honduras and Nicaragua agreed that the greatest contribution of the
Corazon Project to their communities were: a) strengthening environmental governance


                                            72
with community empowerment: "The Corazon Project was a platform for transforming a
process of community governance"; b) strengthening their capacities through training; c)
the remuneration of communities through sub-projects that focus on preservation of
biodiversity; d) the institutionalization of project actions, which will contribute to the
sustainability of actions: "The Corazon Project was not an island, but part of a public
policy to begin a process of transformation in the area and to build a new approach to
achieve biodiversity conservation, and incorporation of indigenous peoples "; e) Project
results are linked with other national actions: " In Nicaragua results of the Corazon
Project are being strengthened by establishing linkages with other projects such as the
Human Security Program, which will strengthen cocoa production through a marketing
program”; f) Modernization of farms with the aim to implement good environmental
friendly practices; g) Strengthening management of economic resources that contribute to
the future development of communities; h) Financing of infrastructure for improving
revenue collection of communities; i) Supporting initiatives from Associations of
indigenous and mestizo women; j) Development of knowledge tools to improve the
management and administration of protected areas by communities; and k) Monitoring
and technical support to communities in the implementation of their subprojects.

The evaluation of the contribution of the project to the conservation of biodiversity
through improved and more sustainable use of natural resources had a high rating by
70 % of respondents; 28 % rated it as moderate. In Nicaragua this high rating is primarily
awarded for the following assessments: a) new technologies were implemented to
minimize environmental damage in productive activities; b) the Project promoted and
improved the care for water sources in farms; c) reforestation activities were assessed as
positive by respondents; d) the Project initiated the recovery of areas that had been
destroyed by traditional agriculture; e) increased awareness of families in the area of
influence of the importance of efforts for regeneration of degraded areas and conservation.
Those who rated the Project’s impact as moderate noted that Project actions were not
sufficiently financed given the size of the area of influence, and that the country should
regulate livestock and deforestation activities more strongly. In Honduras, the high
impact of the Project was associated with the following activities: a) update/preparation
of management plans that involved the assessment of appropriate use of resources and
best practices in protected area management; b) recovery of degraded areas through the
implementation of organic production methodologies and technologies; c ) training on
management of natural resources; d ) lack of use of chemicals and promotion of organic
products; e) activities aimed at improving the standard of life of beneficiaries and the
conservation of biodiversity in general.

The evaluation of the Corazon Project’s contribution to improving the management of
protected areas was rated as high by 61 % of the beneficiaries. In Nicaragua this
assessment was mainly attributed to the following perceptions : a) Environmental
education actions contributed to the good management of protected areas, and sub-
projects contributed to improving and restoring areas that have been destroyed by
traditionalist farmers; c) the updated management plan for the RBB included local
participation, which will guarantee sustainability of the process and its impacts; d)
activities to support the organization of environmental promoters was positive; e) the
Project contributed to regenerate degraded areas through the establishment of
agroforestry systems that are compatible with the environment; f) Project committees
were community representatives who, for the first time, were in charge of
implementation: "before the community was only perceived as objects and not as subjects
of action".

Moderate ratings were primarily awarded by recipients that considered the need for
further action in the areas of influence, including funding, monitoring and control of
invasions by settlers. In Honduras the highest rating given by the beneficiary 's
evaluations were attributed to: a) sub-projects that aimed at conserving the area's
resources; b) updated management plans that were perceived as critical to continue to
frame policies for the conservation of protected areas; c) provision of tools and
knowledge for conservation; and d) areas degraded by livestock were reforested.

The evaluation of sub-projects by beneficiaries of both countries scored high marks with
respect to the impact these had on conservation of protected areas (68%) and
rehabilitation of degraded areas (54%). However 49% felt that sub-projects had a
moderate impact on improving the income of beneficiary families. In both countries the
assessment of the contribution of sub-projects was positive in the following aspects: a)
recovery of water resources in farms; b) management of wastewater from coffee

                                             74
plantations; c) reforestation of the farms; d) establishment of agroforestry systems; e)
enriching knowledge and awareness of families living in the reserves; g) strengthening
rangers and personnel working in the reserve.

Responses demonstrated the perception that sub-projects reduced the pressure on natural
resources and biodiversity reserves. The impact of sub-projects on income level of
beneficiary families was positive. However, respondents discussed other socioeconomic
factors that are considered necessary to increase and maintain income generation of the
type of beneficiaries in question, such as: a) prices of products in local markets; b)
technologies to improve the quality of production (e.g. chocolate); c) greater automation
to improve yields; and d) increased knowledge on product marketing and market access.

  Proyecto CORAZÓN tales como ejecución de sub-Proyectos, elaboración de los planes de
  manejo de las cuatro áreas protegidas y medición de su efectividad de manejo por las
  comunidades; el intercambio de buenas prácticas entre comunitarios y la vigilancia y
  monitoreo de la biodiversidad combinando el conocimiento ancestral con la tecnología.

-   247 sub-Proyectos comunitarios fueron implementados de los cuales 135 fueron para la
    producción sostenible y 112 sub-Proyectos de manejo participativo de recursos naturales;
    donde se implementaron más de 50 buenas prácticas en 6,341 hectáreas. El mecanismo
    financiero incluyó fondos de aporte del Proyecto CORAZÓN (máximo US$ 20,000 por sub-
    Proyectos).

-   13 categorías de sub-Proyectos fueron implementados: 1) Agroforestería 2)Educación
    Ambiental 3)Ecoturismo 4) Rehabilitación en Áreas degradadas 5) Formación de promotores

-   En Honduras: la medición de la efectividad de manejo en áreas protegidas tiene los
    siguientes resultados: en la Reserva del Hombre y Biosfera del Río Plátano su valoración de
    efectividad pasó de regular en el año 2000 a aceptable en el año 2011 debido al alto puntaje
    del ámbito económico-financiero; el Parque Nacional Patuca pasa de una valoración de poco
    aceptable en el año 2000 a regular en el 2011 y la Reserva de Biosfera Tawahka Asangni
    desde el año 2008 al 2011 se ha mantenido en el nivel efectividad regular con leves
    incrementos en los puntajes.

-   En Nicaragua: la medición de la efectividad de manejo muestra para la Reserva de Biósfera
    de BOSAWAS en 2011 una valoración regular en áreas habitadas por mestizos y aceptable
    en territorios indígenas principalmente por la alta ponderación que se dio a la mejoría en la
    gobernanza territorial y comunal indígena;

-   Se elaboró el documento borrador de la ficha para la propuesta de Reserva de Biósfera
    Transfronteriza ante la UNESCO

-   Con el Proyecto CORAZÓN se establece un espacio de diálogo político que posibilitó que
    autoridades de ambiente y de áreas protegidas de los dos países junto con organismos de la
    integración intercambiaran puntos de vista y emitieran directrices para asegurar la gestión
    del Corazón del CBM, sumado a esto se tienen los intercambios binacionales de líderes
    indígenas a través de los representantes de los Gobiernos Territoriales Indígenas en
    Nicaragua y de las Federaciones Indígenas en Honduras así como las gestiones con la
    cooperación internacional para asegurar recursos para el manejo de estas áreas protegidas y
    con organismos de Naciones Unidas como UNESCO, para obtener la nominación como
    Reserva de Biosfera Transfronteriza (RBT).

                 Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
                                      (if any)

A closure workshop was held in Nicaragua (Managua, November 28, 2012) with the
participation of technical teams from both countries and CCAD. The agenda of the
workshop is included below.

Workshop objectives were to share the main results of Project implementation in both
countries and the contributions of the technical staff in the evaluation. A presentation of
the draft Project Closure Report (Results, Evaluation and Lessons Learned) of each
country and the CCAD were performed. Technical coordinators from both countries
presented the results of the evaluation of Project performance. Results of the Beneficiary
Survey were also presented.

Participants of the workshop were divided into the four following working groups:

   •   Group 1- Sub-project monitoring: The exchange of experiences and lessons
       learned from monitoring and evaluation (M&E) during Project implementation is
       summarized as follows: a) M&E is an enriching process that provides valuable
       information on the actual needs and realities of communities; b) the remote
       location of sub-projects makes monitoring difficult and expensive; c)
       communication with beneficiaries was complex and the use of indigenous native
       languages was critical; d) weather was a factor in the planning of field trips; e)
       operating expenses provided for monitoring were not consistent with the
       geographical conditions of communities; f) lack of access to roads in protected
       areas created greater difficulties with regards to monitoring; g) women
       beneficiaries of sub-projects were more organized and tidy in resource
       management; h) increased investments for community training in administrative
       and project implementation is critical to successful implementation; and i)
       beneficiaries typically have high receptivity for training.

   •   Group 2- Financial Management: Financial management and reporting procedures
       across countries were discussed and compared (FMR, reporting tables,
       disbursements, co-financing). Best practices in financial management identified
       by the group included: a) the existence of a Project Operational Manual; b) a
       Manual of procedures for sub-projects, c) the use of an annual work plan as a
       management tool; d) Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) updated every 6
       months.

   •   Group 3: Evaluation of Project Objectives and implementation: Project technical
       coordinators from the three agencies conducted an exchange of lessons learned
       and shared results of performance evaluations that had been previously carried out
       in the different countries. In Nicaragua, a performance evaluation of the Project
       led to a highly satisfactory rating of the commitment of the Government in
       implementing the Project. Overall World Bank performance was rated as
       moderately satisfactory based on the performance in the initial phase and the

                                            84
    highly satisfactory quality of Project supervision after the restructuring.
    Meanwhile, the Honduras team evaluated the performance of the Central
    Government for Implementation of Project Corazon satisfactory (84.75%)
    assessing the following elements: a) existence of an environment to support
    macro, sectoral and institutional policies suitable for the development of Project
    activities that included visits to beneficiaries and/or actors; b) before restructuring
    a comprehensive plan for implementation, enforcement mechanisms, and the
    appointment of key personnel was lacking. The World Bank assistance is rated as
    Moderately Satisfactory, considering that in the initial phase of the project was
    evaluated “Not satisfactory" and after the restructuring it was assessed as
    “Satisfactory”. During the preparation and implementation of the first phase of the
    Project, deficiencies in supervision and monitoring by the World Bank were
    noted. Performance after the restructuring significantly changed and there was
    close supervision of implementation.

•   Group 4 – Environmental evaluation: The team conducted a review of the main
    results of monitoring tools used to evaluated project impact, namely the
    PROARCA and GEF tracking tools. The group evaluated performance in both
    countries, and the results scored “Regular”. It was noted that although the
    Corazon Project had not been involved in all areas assessed through the
    mentioned methodologies, the best scores were attributed to the following topics:
    a) participation of indigenous territories and local communities in decision
    making; b) focus on research and training; c) improvement in the training of
    community structures, d) increased investment in sustainable production.

MARENA
La evaluación del desempeño del Proyecto se califica como altamente satisfactoria (93),
la Apropiación y compromiso del Gobierno con el logro de los objetivos de desarrollo, el
entorno propicio de apoyo incluyendo macro, sectoriales y políticas institucionales
(legislación ambiental, Plan Nacional de Desarrollo Humano, Estrategia nacional
ambiental) y la adecuación del proyecto con consultas a beneficiarios y actores han sido
condiciones altamente satisfactorias en las circunstancias que de desarrollo el Proyecto, la
apuesta del Gobierno de Reconciliación y Unidad Nacional a través del Ministerio del
Ambiente y los Recursos Naturales (MARENA) de fortalecer la capacidad de las
comunidades en la gestión para la conservación y manejo sostenible de los recursos
naturales de la RBB ha sido una respuesta a los derechos del uso sostenible de las tierras
y los recursos naturales, así como al rescate de las prácticas ambientales ancestrales para
la conservación y mejorar el bienestar de las comunidades asentadas en la RBB, logrando
de esta manera la protección del medio ambiente en una relación armoniosa Naturaleza y
Ser Humano.

La ejecución del proyecto en relación a la preparación para la implementación,
mecanismos de ejecución, el nombramiento del personal clave, así como la solución
oportuna de los problemas de ejecución, por ejemplo, tiempos prolongados para hacer
efectivos las transferencias de los primeros desembolsos, la preparación del manual
operativo para implementar el programa de Sub-proyectos también represento un tiempo
necesario para dimensionarlo con la realidad de las condiciones territoriales para lograr la
preparación y consenso del mismo. La necesidad de desarrollar y poner en marcha un
plan de asistencia técnica en los temas fiduciarios y de adquisiciones dio lugar también a
establecer en la ruta del proceso tiempos para estas tareas.

En cuanto a la adecuación de los mecanismos de seguimiento y evaluación para la toma
de decisiones podemos valorar que institucionalmente la participación directa de las
sedes de la Secretaria Técnica de BOSAWAS, así como el involucramiento directo de los
Gobiernos Territoriales Indígenas provoco una atención efectiva para los avances y
ajustes a las condiciones para una ejecución basada en resultados.

En relación a la calificación del desempeño general del Banco por parte de la Unidad
Ejecutora esta se califica como moderadamente satisfactoria para la dimensión del
desempeño del Banco en la fase inicial y altamente satisfactoria en la calidad de la
supervisión del Proyecto.

El arranque del Proyecto presento una serie de condicionantes desde el tiempo
transcurrido para declararlo efectivo, la transferencia del primer desembolso, la creación
de la unidad ejecutora y los arreglos con los actores involucrados expresados en el
manual operativo y reglamento de becas, siendo limitada la asistencia por parte del Banco
para mejorar estas condicionantes. Desde la evaluación de medio término y las
condiciones creadas para una reestructuración la cual fue efectiva en todos los ámbitos de
atención del Proyecto, se tuvo de parte del Banco un acompañamiento, asistencia técnica,

                                            88
supervisión de calidad y una comunicación efectiva para hacer las mejorar necesarias en
la implementación del Proyecto.


SERNA
La unidad ejecutora ha realizado evaluación del Desempeño del Gobierno Central para la
Ejecución del Proyecto Corazón con una ponderación de 84.75%; valorando los
siguientes elementos: a) existió un entorno propicio de apoyo a nivel macro, sectorial y
de políticas institucionales adecuadas para desarrollar las actividades del proyecto con
consultas a beneficiarios y/o actores, b) Antes de la reestructuración no se hizo un
exhaustivo plan o preparación para la implementación, mecanismos de ejecución, y el
nombramiento del personal clave.
En cuanto a la adecuación de los mecanismos de seguimiento y evaluación para la toma
de decisiones y la asignación de recursos; se considera que tomando como base la
importancia de las áreas protegidas atendidas se debió haber asignado una cantidad de
recursos acorde con la población y el área territorial de las áreas protegidas, y garantizar
la sostenibilidad de los recursos, luego del cierre del Proyecto. Por otro lado se debió
recibir respuesta positiva a la solicitud de nuevos fondos GEF en vista del éxito y de los
logros obtenidos en la ejecución de esta fase del Proyecto.
La asistencia del Banco Mundial se ha evaluado como Moderadamente Satisfactoria,
considerando que en la fase inicial del Proyecto fue evaluada “No satisfactoria” y
posterior a la reestructuración se valora como Satisfactoria. Durante la preparación y
ejecución de la primera fase del Proyecto se encontraron deficiencias en supervisión y
acompañamiento por parte del Banco, que contribuyeron de manera importante a la
situación de desempeño del Proyecto. Los problemas que se fueron identificando durante
misiones de supervisión (de gestión financiera y de adquisiciones) no se resolvieron a su
debido tiempo. Compromisos de todas las partes, enmarcados en planes de acción, no
tuvieron un seguimiento adecuado por ninguna de las partes y por ende no se cumplieron.
Por otra parte, oficiales de las Unidades Ejecutivas recibieron entrenamiento sistemático
de parte del Banco para asegurar su desempeño adecuado. Durante la ejecución posterior
a la Reestructuración esto cambio significativamente; hubo una simplificación en la
ejecución una revisión en el Marco Lógico del Proyecto con la estructuración de un
adecuado plan de Monitoreo y Supervisión. Además se realizaron capacitaciones para el
personal técnico, administrativo y de Adquisiciones y en todo momento se tuvo el
acompañamiento del Banco en la Ejecución del Proyecto.
