growth of industry by: (i) providing technical\n            assistance to help exporters of non-traditional products\n            develop new markets outside the CACM; to strengthen the\n            Government's export promotion policy framework and\n            strategy; and to strengthen the capacity of BG and\n            participating financial intermediaries to prepare, appraise\n            and supervise projects. It also intends to: (ii) provide\n            medium- and long-term credit and foreign exchange for\n            financially and economically sound industrial reconversion\n            or expansion projects. By providing enterprises with\n            technical assistance, credit and foreign exchange, the\n            proposed loan is expected to generate employment, income and\n            a more rapid expansion of non-traditional exports than might\n            otherwise be possible."}, "docdt": "1984-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
