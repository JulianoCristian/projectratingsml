APPRAISAL OF THIRD POWER PROJECT
SUIMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This report covers the appraisal of a project for the expansion
of the electricity system in Taiwan, Republic of China, for which a loan
has been requested by the Taiwan Power Company, the Government-owned
institution responsible for electric power throughout the country. A
loan of US $55 million equivalent to cover the foreign exchange costs
of the project, including interest during construction, is proposed;
it would represent 68% of the estimated cost of the project. This would
be the third loan to Taipower. The first, Loan 574-CHA, was made in
1966 for an amount of US $50 million equivalent to finance the Tachien
hydroelectric station and 345 kV transmission. The second, Loan 671-CHA,
was made in 1970 for an amount of US $44.5 miUlion equivalent to finance
the Talin No. 4 thermal unit, the Lower Tachien hydroelectric station,
and transmission facilities. Experience to date with these loans has
been satisfactory.
ii.       The project would comprise the installation of the 500 MW
Talin No. 5 thermal unit (the major item), substations for the Chinshan
No. 1 nuclear plant transmission, control equipment for system load
dispatch, and the provision of management consulting services. The
project is an essential part of the program to meet the expected load
growth.
iii.      The electric power system in Taiwan has been expanding at a
rapid rate, to keep pace with the growing industrialization of the
country. Continuing strong economic development, and correspondingly
rapid development of the power sector, is foreseen.  More than US $1,200
million equivalent will be spent on the expansion of power facilities
during 1971-1976, which is the period of construction of the project.
The project would represent 7% of the cost of the 1971-1976 program.
iv,       The project is technically sound and the arrangements planned
for engineering and construction are satisfactory.
ve        Taipower is presently well-operated, and its management and
organization is satisfactory. To enable its management and organization
to cope with its rapid increase in size, funds were provided under Loans
574-CHA and 671-CHA for financial and engineering consultants to improve
accounting procedures and assist with system planning. Additional funds
are provided in the proposed loan for this purpose.
vi.       The expansion of Taipower's facilities will require large
borrowings in addition to the funds that it can expect to generate
internally from its presently-adequate tariffs. Taipower will there-
fore depend on large amounts of international-aid financing and suppliers'
credits, This dependence might be reduced if a local capital market



- ii -
could be developed, enabling the floating of independent bond issues
by Taipawer to tap savings in the private sector. The Government and
Taipower have undertaken to study local market conditions for a token
issue as a first step in this direction within the next year.
vii.      The internal financial rate of return of the project is esti-
mated to be about 24%. This is a particularly high figure, principally
because of sunk costs on site infrastructure and high-voltage transmission
facilities; taking into consideration the sunk costs, the return would be
reduced to the still satisfactory level of about 20%.
viii.     The project would form a suitable basis for a loan of US $55
million equivalent for a term of 20 years including 5 years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF THIRD POWER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Taiwan Pover Company (Taipower), a corporation owned princi-
pally by the Government of the Republic of China and responsible for
power supply throughout Taiwan, has asked the Bank for a loan of US $55
million equivalent to cover the foreign exchange needs of a project
estimated to cost US $73.2 million equivalent, and the interest during
construction of US $8 million equivalent on the proposed loan. The
project, comprising the 500 NW Talin No. 5 thermal unit, substations and
system load dispatch equipment, and funds for further management consult-
ing services, would form part of the power development program in
1971-1976, estimated to cost a total of about US $1,233 million equivalent.
102      This would be the third loan to Taipower.  The first, Loan
574-CHA, for US $50 million equivalent for the Tachien hydroelectric
station with 2314 M4 capacity and 345 kV transmission facilities, was
made in December 1968.  The second, Loan 671-CHA, for US $44.5 million
equivalent for the Talin No. 4 thermal unit of 375 IJ, the completion
of the second stage of Lower Tachien hydroelectric station with 180 MW
capacity, and additional transmission facilities, was made in May 1970.
Experience to date with these loans has been satisfactory.
1.03      The very large scale of Taipower's expansion program arises
from the necessity of making an adequate amount of power available for
the country's rapidly-growing industries. The program includes the con-
struction of two 600 141J nuclear units scheduled for operation in 1975
and 1976, reflecting Taipower's strategy of developing large nuclear and
conventional thermal generation facilities for base load together with
pumped-storage facilities for peaking. This strategy is appropriate,
given that most of the Island's hydroelectric resources have now been
developed, there are no longer large resources of indigenous fuel
available, and the system is reaching a size large enough to benefit
from the economies of scale attached to large conventional thermal and
nuclear generating units.
1.04      Although the Talin No. 5 unit would be the largest single
electric generating unit yet financed by the Bank, the elements of the
project are essentially conventional, and problems beyond those normally
encountered are not foreseen in executing the project or in its opera-
tion thereafter.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission composed
of Miessrs. D. King, P. J. Cornford, and B. G. Montfort which visited
Taiwan in October 1970.



II.  T1E BORROI3
Economic Backgrcund
2.01      The island of Taiwan, including a number of small adjacent
islands, has an area of about 36,000 km2. From north to south the island
has a length of about 425 km and from east to west a maximum width of
150 km. It experiences a substantial annual rainfall, about 2500 mm, most
of which falls during the May/October storm season; the October/April
period is comparatively dry.
2.02      The population at the end of 1969 was 14.3 million, and is grow-
ing at an annual rate of about 2.3%O.  With almost 400 people per km2, Tai-
wan has one of the highest population densities in the world.
2.03      Taiwan's economic growth has been very rapid in recent years
and the Gross National Product (GNP) increased at about 10% per annum
during the period 1964-1969.  Per capita income in 1969 was about US$ 257.
During the sam.e period, industrial production increased at an annual rate
of about 18%, and power output by about 14.5%  Power output for the first
ten months of 1970 was almost 205% greater than in the same period of 1969.
2.04      Indications are that the fast pace of economic development will
continue. The target value for GNP average groiwth rate over the 1971-1980
period is set at 8.5% per annum. But this may be a conservative figure
since forecasts of the rate of industrial development have traditionally
been underestimated.
Taiwan Power Company
2.05      Taipower was organized in 1946 by the Chinese Government to
take over and operate the system ccnstructed by the Japanese. It is
responsible for electricity supply throughout the country, with the
exception of some captive generating plants owned by manufacturing
concerns. Taipower is a stock corporation almost wholly owned by the
National Government (62%) and the Provincial Government (33%).
2.o6      Policy is determined by an eleven-man Board of Directors, six
of whom are appointed by the National Government, four by the Provincial
Government and one by the Bank of Taiwan. The appointments are for a two-
year period and members may be reappointed.
2.07      The Company's principal officers are the president, who is also
a voting member of the Board of Directors, and eight vice-presidents who
have functional responsibilities for administration, commercial activities,
engineering, purchasing, personnel, planning, operations and finance, The
president and vice-presidents are appointed by the Minister of Economic
Affairs on recommendation of the Board of Directors and are normally drawn
from within the Company itself.



- 3 -
2.08      Taipower's capital and operating budgets are submitted annually
to the Legislature for approval through the iLInister of Economic Affairs.
The relationship between Government and Taipower is appropriate in that
there is a continuing liaison between Taipower, the Ministry of Economic
Affair6, the Council for International Economic Cooperation and Develop-
ment (CIECD) which coordinates foreign assistance and has itself provided
funds for the development of the country, and other government bodies.
This process serves an important purpose in coordinating the development
of the power sector with the rapid industrialization of the country.
2.09      At present  there are about 11,370 employees on the Company's
payroll; with approximately 2.24 million customers this gives a ratio of
200 customers per employee which compares very favorably with industri-
alized countries (refer to Annex 10).
2.10      During its 25-year history Taipower has developed into a well
organized and efficient utility. However, its rapid expansion in recent
years has imposed heavy burdens on its organizational capacity. Recog-
nition of this was made by providing funds in Loans 574-CHA and 671-CHA
for the retention of financial and engineering consaltants to improve
Taipower's accounting procedures, assist with system planning, and to
train management and supervisory personnel. Gilbert Associates (USA) and
Ebasco (USA) have been retained to provide financial and system-planning
consulting services, respectively. An additional amount of US $400,000
is included in the proposed loan for this purpose.
2.11      Taipower has experienced difficulty in retaining Its technical
staff, due to the higher salary scales existing in private industry.
Consequently a quasi-public engineering firm, Sinotech, owned by Taipower
and other Government companies, and not subject to civil service regula-
tions or salary limitations, was organized in 1970. Design engineers
from Taipower and other Government-owned companies have been transferred
to it - along with the work they have been doing. The arrangement is
proving satisfactory.
2.12      Taipower is capable of carrying out the construction program
with the assistance of suitable consulting firms. It is employing Electro-
consult (Italy) for the Tachien Project (Loan 574-CHA), and Gibbs & Hill
(USA) for Talin No. 3 unit as well as for Talin No. 4 unit (Loan 671-CHA).
The latter will also be retained for No. 5 unit. Ebasco (USA) has been
engaged for the Chinshan nuclear power station, units No. 1 and No. 2.
Lahmeyer (West Germany) is studying a proposed pumped-storage project, and
Commonwealth Ehgineering (USA) is Taipower's transmission consultant.



Facilities of Taipower
2.13      Taipower had an installed generating capacity at the end of 1970
of 2,720 MT in 9 thermal plants and 27 hydroelectric plants, with aggregate
capacities of 1,819 and 901 MWi, 67% and 33% respectively of total capacity.
Thermal capacity is concentrated in the north and south ends of the island.
The hydroelectric installations are located principally in the central and
northern regions where the most important rivers are found. M4ost of the
hydroelectric power sites have now been developed. Annex 1 lists the
major generating stations.
2.14      Generating stations and load centers are connected by an exten-
sive 154 kV transmission network to supply the market which is concentrated
in the northern region, including Taipei and Keelung, and the south, in-
cluding the Kaohsiung area. Sub-transmission is operated at 69 kV, and
34.5 kV which is being converted to 69 kV. Distribution voltages include
3.3 kV, 7.5 kV, and 11.4 kV which is replacing the lower voltages.
2.15      The Taipower system is operated efficiently, one evidence being
that losses on the transmission and distribution system have been reduced
over the course of time to 10%, just about the optimum level at present.
The major problem of Taipower has been the provision of adequate generat-
ing capacity. Load growth has been underestimated in recent years,
reflecting the unexpectedly large economic growth, so that generating
capacity has not quite matched the demand. For this reason it has been
necessary to curtail load from time to time, the extent being related to
hydrological conditions experienced during the dry season and the
requirements of the generator maintenance program. An estimate of the
amount of load curtailed is given in Annex 2. W1hile the magnitude of
load shedding has been of some proportions (even the reduction of 0.5%
in sales in 1968 and 1969 is not insignificant considering that it was
concentrated in the power-intensive industries), it has not been serious
enough to affect the country's industrial development. It has been a
considerable system planning achievement to keep generating capacity
almost abreast of the unexpectedly large demand; indeed Taipowier's
capital expenditures on system expansion have been just about at the
lowest level consistent with not jeopardizing development.
Future Expansion Program
2.16      Given the situation described above, the generation expansion
program must be tailored to provide reserve capacity. Annex 1 includes
a list of the generating stations under construction and in the planning
stage, indicating about a 3,500 MW increase of capacity by the end of
1976, or 130% over the installed capacity of 2,720 MW existing at the
end of 1970.



- 5 -
2.17      As can be seen from the charts in Annex 3, which show the
installed capacity and forecast demand until 1976, conditions are going
to continue difficult through 1975. The system capability would be in-
sufficient to meet the anticipated load requirements in 1971 and 1972
under the most adverse flow conditions, mainly because of a 12 months
manufacturing delay of Linkou No. 2, 350 MW thermal unit. With the
placing in service of the 500 MW Talin No. 5 unit and the 600 mW Chinshan
No. 1 nuclear unit at the end of 1975, a reserve capacity during the dry
season, based on the driest year on record, of about 800 MW, or 20% over
the expected demand of approximately 4 million klW Will be available.
This would be no more than the normal reserve for a system of this size
and containing units of 600 MW capacity. It would provide for the shut-
doun of generators for repairs and the possibility of a larger load
growth than is presently forecast being experienced.
2.18      The nuclear units, which are identical, are scheduled for
service respectively in 1975 and 1976. Contracts for the first unit have
been awarded for the boiling water reactor to General Electric Company
and for the generating equipment to Westinghouse, both of USA, financed
by the Export-Import Bank of the USA, and suppliers' credits. The second
unit is being ordered and financed in a similar manner (para. 5.14). It
is likely that Taipower will expand its system by additional nuclear
power installations for base load together with pumped-storage installa-
tions for peaking. However, the provision of additional conventional
thermal units might be found necessary, given the rapidity of load growth
and the length of time it takes to provide a nuclear power facility.
2.19      Bulk power transmission capability is being substantially re-
inforced by the construction of a double circuit 345 kV transmission line
running the length of the island, part of the project being financed
under Loan 574-CHA and Loan 671-CHA. This will tie together the major
load centers in the north and south with the principal hydro peaking
facilities in the middle of the island. However Taipower-has since
arranged with the Bank to have the line financed from other resources,
in order to use the proceeds of these loans to finance the additional
foreign currency costs of the associated substation equipment. These
additional costs were incurred when the scope of the substation
facilities was substantially increased.
2.20      The expansion of transmission and distribution facilitiGe w11
amount to about US $490 million equivalent in 1971-76 (approximately half
for transmission and half for distribution). Of the total amount of
US $1,233 million equivalent to be expended during this period, respec-
tively 58%, 22% and 20%, will be spent on generation, transmission and
distribution, This is reasonable for a power system on which industrial
load is predominant.



- 6 -
III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The project would consist of:
i) the construction of the Talin No. 5 thermal generating unit
with a capacity of 500 MW, the major item of the project;
ii) the provision of substation facilities to transmit the power
generated by the Chinshan No. 1 nuclear generating unit;
iii) the provision of equipment for system load dispatch; and
iv) funds for further management consulting services.
The project represents about 7% of the cost of Taipower's
expansion program during the 1971-1976 project construction period.
Talin No. 5 Thermal Generating Unit
3.02      The Talin No. 5 unit would be located at the south end of the
i5land in proximity to the concentration of industrial development in the
city of Kaohsiung. At this site, Talin No. 1 and No. 2 units both rated
at 300 NW are in operation, and Talin No. 3 and No. 4 units both rated at
375 NW, are scheduled to begin service in March 1973 and April 1974,
respectively. There will remain no space for installation of additional
units at the site after Talin No. 5.
3.03      Talin No. 5 will have a capacity of 500 M1J.  The turbine-
generator will be tandem compound. The boiler will be designed to operate
at a pressure of 2,400 psi and a temperature of 1,000°F with reheat at
1,000°F. It will be designed to burn oil. Taiwan has limited resources
of low grade coal, some of which is burned in existing thermal plants,
but it would not be economic to start new mines to burn coal in future
generating plant to be constructed.
3.04      The generator will feed into a main step-up transformer, the
output of which will be at 154 kV. Power at this voltage will be trans-
mitted to the substation at Kaohsiung nearby, for local distribution or
for stepping-up to 345 kV for transmission to other parts of the island,
using existing transmission lines which have enough capacity to carry the
power generated by the new unit.
3.05      The characteristics of the Talin No. 5 unit were determined on
the basis of an economic study of steam conditions carried out by Taipower
and Gibbs & Hill, Inc., their consultants, and are satisfactory.



- 7 -
Substation Equipment Related to Chinshan No. 1 Transmission Line
3.06      Chinshan No. 1 nuclear unit (para. 2.18) is scheduled for opera-
tion in December, 1975. It is sited approximately 28 km northeast of
Taipei on the northernmost extremity of the island. The polwer generated
will be transmitted to the Taipower transmission grid by means of 117-
km-long double-circuit 345 kV transmission system extending from the site
to the primary substations of Nankang and Panchiao. The Bank-financed
construction comprises the 345 kV primary substations of Nankang and
Panchiao and the Chinshan switching station, including 500 MVA of
transformer capacity and ten 345 kV line terminals.
Load Dispatch
3.07      Taipower is planning a system control facility which will
provide for:
i) automatic control of frequency (60 cycles);
ii)  automatic distribution of load (economic dispatch) between the
large thermal and hydroelectric units;
iii) transmission system load flow supervision;
iv) system data logging and alarms; and
v) other miscellaneous control functions.
The master control station will be located in the system dispatch
office in Taipei. The provision of this facility will be timely in ensur-
ing the continued efficient operation of the power system, when as the
result of increasing size, it would be difficult to maintain fully effi-
cient operation with manual control.

3.10      The cost estimate for the Talin No. 5 unit was prepared jointly
by Taipower with the advice of Gibbs & Hill, their consultants, and
reflects their experience with the procurement of the previous Talin
units.i/ The cost estimates for the substations and load control were
prepared by Taipower. Taipower has considerable experience in estimating
construction costs and erecting thermal plants, and the site conditions
are fully known. The cost estimate and contingency allowances are con-
sidered appropriate.
3.11      An amount of 9% has been included for price contingencies on
equipment, which is ample to provide for increases in cost of labor and
materials, since the bulk of the awards will be made during 1971 on a
firm price basis. An amount of 7.5% has been included for physical
contingencies on civil works. This should be sufficient as Taipower has
already the experience of constructing the 300 MW Talin Nos. 1 and 2 units
on this site. Separate provision for price contingencies on civil works
is not included as the cost of materials and supplies, representing the
bulk of the cost, has been very stable.
1/ Bids for the supply of the turbo-generator were received early ::n
April, 1971 and are reflected in the cost estimate.



- 9 -
3.12      The estimated unit cost of Talin No. 5 exclusive of custom
duties and interest is US $108 per kVW. This attractive price is due not
only to economies of scale and sunk costs in site infrastructure, but also
to the efficiency of Taipower's construction techniques.
Amount of Proposed Loan
3.13      The proposed loan is US $55 million comprising US $47 million
for the estimated foreign cost of equipment and services (64% of the total
estimated project cost of $73.2 million), and US $8 million for interest
on the proposed loan during construction of the project. A term of 20
years is recommended, including 5½ years of grace; for the purpose of
this report interest of 7-$ per annum and a commitment charge of 3/4%
per annum has been used. Taking into consideration Loans 574-CHA and
671-CHA to Taipower, the Bank would be financing about 11% of Taipowerts
total construction expenditure during the period 1971-76.
Custom Duties
3.14      Custom duties on the equipment to be imported are estimated to
be us $8.8 million equivalent, reflecting an average levy of about 22%.
They are payable by Taipower in local currency and are shown as a local
cost.
Engineering, Construction and Scheduling
3.15      Engineering and design of Talin No. 5 will be carried out by
Gibbs -&. Hill, an experienced firm in this field, which is already under-
taking this responsibility for Talin No. 3 and No. 4 units. Construction
will be undertaken by Taipower which, as noted, has had a large amount of
experience with thermal plant construction. Taipower and Gibbs & Hill
will supervise construction. Talin No. 5 is scheduled for service in
December 1975. These arrangements are satisfactory.
3.16      Taipower plans to design the project substation facilities;
this is satisfactory since it is gaining experience in the design of
similar facilities, with the assistance of its consultants, under Loan
574-CHA.
3.17      Taipower will seek the assistance of consultants for the system
load dispatch facility.

Ecological Aspects
3.18      Talin power station is a part of the Kaohsiung (see map) indus-
trial complex, planned as part of a free-port development. The station
was sited according to the most favorable conditions for its construction -
proximity to a growing load center, availability of fuel and adequate
supply of cooling water. The ecological aspects associated with this
station are as follows:
i) the hazards associated with the existing oil tank farm of the
China Petroleum Corporation, bordering on the station,for which
safe-guards have been provided;
ii) the effect of the stationts sea water cooling system which
discharges directly into the ocean and is not considered
harmful to marine life;
iii) the height of stacks is limited to 145 m because of the
proximity of Kaohsiung International Airport; and
iv) air pollution. The Republic of China has not yet established
standards for permissible concentration of bulphur dioxide and
other contaminants emitted into the atmosphere by industrial
plants. However pollution from the Talin plant at full output
(ultimate capacity 1,850 MI) will not exceed standards found
acceptable in other countries. Furthermore, the prevailing
winds will carry pollution awiay from Kaohsiung city.
A monitoring program will be carried out by Taipower.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.19      Procurement of goods financed by the loan would be on the basis
of international competitive bidding except for components required to be
compatible with existing equipment, and items of minor cost for which
such bidding will be impractical, the total cost of which should not
exceed US $800,000 equivalent. Disbursements would be made for the full
foreign exchange cost of the equipment imported and services provided.
No disbursements would be made for expenditure made prior to signing the
proposed loan. Estimated disbursements, by quarters, are given in Annex
8. It is envisaged that any surplus loan amounts remaining on completion
of the project would be cancelled.

1V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Load Growth
4.01      Sales have increased at an average rate of 14.5% annually during
the period 1964-69. They are forecast to grow at an average annual rate
of about 12.6% until 1976 (11.8% for power, 15,3% for lighting). Actual
and forecast sales for the period 1968-76 are given in Annex 2.
4.02      Taipower reviews the forecast at least once a year for major
categories of customers on the following basis: i) major industrial
customers which account for 57% of total energy sales, are surveyed indi-
vidually; ii) minor industrial customers' past growth trends are analyzed,
and projected in accordance with factors which will affect future growth;
and,  iii) for lighting (residential) customers, past growth trends are
projected, taking into account future demand for electrical appliances.
The various components are then integrated to give the total forecast. In
this process, Government developmental goals and growth in GNP are taken
into consideration. In correlating energy requirements with GNP, a growth
rate for the economy somewhat higher (9.7%) than the target rate (8.%), is
assumed, because the latter has often been underestimated, as mentioned in
paragraph 2.04.
4o.03     Actual sales for the first ten months of 1970 increased by
19.9%, instead of the 16.7% forecast, principally because industrial con-
sumption was higher than had been expected. Over the next several years
such fluctuations in growth are likely to even out, and the forecast is
considered satisfactory for appraising Talin No. 5 unit.   Any increase in
load greater than forecast would result in a reduction in reserve capability.
If the trend continues to suggest a substantially larger annual growth
than the 12.6% forecast, Taipower will have to consider accelerating its
development program.
Economic Alternatives
4.04      The Tali  No. 5 unit represents the most appropriate and economic
means of meeting the increase in load. There is no hydroelectric site
large enough to compete with a large base-load thermal project, and another
nuclear facility would take too long to construct. Gas turbines would be
much too expensive for base load. The only alternative therefore would be
the construction of two smaller conventional units, perhaps siailar to
Talin No. 4, both of which would be needed to cope with the expected
demand. One of them would be installed at Talin and the other at a new
site since there is space for only one more unit at the Talin site. Two
smaller units would probably have a higher overall availability factor,
but this would be more than offset by the lower capital cost per kW in-
stalled of the 500 MMl unit. Furthermore, opening a new site would lead
to additional costs in infrastructure and transmission facilities* Thus
the 500 MI unit at Talin is the least cost iEanB of meeting the load
expected in late 1975. Another factor is the heavy burden that would be
imposed on Taipower's management when opening a new site and constructing
two units instead of one.



- 12 -
Internal Financial Rate of Return
4.05      The internal financial rate of return for Talin No, 5 is the
discount rate at which the present worth of its capital costs (net of
duties) and operating costs (net of depreciation and taxes), is equal to
the present worth of the revenues derived from it, over its expected life.
The capital costs include the cost of Talin No. 5, the estimated cost of
distribution facilities required to distribute the power generated, and
an initial fuel stock. The resulting internal financial rate of return
is 24%. This is a particularly high figure, due principally to the
following sunk costs not having been included in the computation:
i) infrastructure costs on the project site since Talin No. 5 is the
last of five units; ii) EHV transmLission costs since the transmission
facilities of other projects will permit the utilization of power
generated by Talin No. 5 at no additional cost. An estimate of these
costs was made, leading to an internal financial rate of return of 20%
if they are included in the cost of Talin No. 5; this is satisfactory.
fletailed data and assumptions used to compute these rates of return may
be found in Annex 9. The full economic benefits of the project are not
adequately reflected by the revenues alone in that the consumers would
be prepared to pay more for their energy requirements. Thus the internal
economic return (could it be calculated) could be expected to be higher
than the internal financial return.

V.  FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background
5.01      While Taipower's earning capacity is generally satisfactory,
this was not the case prior to 1969 because of restrictive legislation.
At that time its return (income after interest charges and taxes) was
limited to 8% on a rate base comprising net fixed assets plus an allowance
for working capital, less outstanding debt. The Bank considered this
inadequate to produce a level of internal cash generation appropriate to
Taipower's rising investment needs. The Government therefore modified
the tariff law, in conjunction with Loan 574-CHA, to enable Taipower to
achieve a return within the range of 9.5% - 12% from 1969 onwards.
Taipower also agreed to earn a rate of return (income after taxes but
before interest charges) of 9.5% in 1970, and 10% thereafter, on average
net fixed assets in operation and an allowance for working capital.
5.02      Taipower's gross fixed assets, in operation and under construc-
tion, more than doubled between 1963 and 1970 and are now US $893 minlion
equivalent. Over the ensuing six years they are expected to double again,
since the sustained growth of the power market and the capital-intensive
nature of the industry will require investments of about $181 million
equivalent per year through 1976.
5.03      To cope with such an expansion program Taipower has had to
resort to substantial foreign financing in addition to heavy borrowings
from domestic banks and CIECD (para. 2.08) and the Sino-American Fund for
Economic Development (SAFED). However, the Chinese authorities are con-
sidering alternative financing schemes because it is doubtful that suffi-
cient funds on reasonable terms will be available from these traditional
sources beyond 1975/6 (see para. 5.15).
Audit
5.04      Under the provisions of Loans 574-CHA and 671-CHA, Taipower,
subject by law to Government audit, appointed a local firm of independent
professional auditors (T. N. Soong & Co.) to examine its accounts for the
1969 fiscal year. The auditors subsequently confirmed Taipower's
financial performance and position. The covenant is repeated in the
proposed loan agreement.



- 1.4 -
The Current Situation
Recent Performance and Financial Position
5.05      Following the enactment in 1969 of the legislation referred to
in para. 5.01, the Government permitted Taipower to incorporate into its
tariffs the tax on electricity consumption (equivalent to an overall
increase of 10%) which up to that time, had been collected for the
Government. The rate of return for 1969 was 10.4%, a rise of 18% over
that for 1968. The average price per unit sold in 1969 was NT$ 0.54
(=US 1.35 cents/kWh), which is low. This is explained by the very high
proportion (77%) of industrial load (see Annex 2) and by the efficiency
of operations (see also paras. 2.09 and 2.15).
5.06      Taipower's performance in 1969 was satisfactory.  (See Annex 5
for Actual and Forecast Income Statements, 1967-1976.) Sales of energy
rose 15% over 1968 and, aided by the tariff adjustment, operating income
increased 36%. Net internal cash generation represented 39% of the year's
construction expenditure. The proportion of debt to total capitalization
decreased fractionally to 50% and the ratio of current assets to current
l=iabilities improved from 1.3 to 1.5 times. Preliminary results for 1970
indicate a continued improvement in both operating income and financial
position.  Taipower's efficiency in its monthly billing/collection
cycle is demonstrated by the very low level of consumers' accounts
receivable, which is the equivalent of 18 days sales, witlh virtually no
bad debts.
Fixed Assets and Depreciation Policy
5.07      Gross fixed assets in operation as of December 31, 1969 totalled
NT $25.3 billion, about US $631 million equivalent (see Annex 7 for Actual
and Forecast Balance Sheets, 1967-1976). Present book values of assets
are based on a revaluation carried out in 1961 applying a Taipei wholesale
price index. Further adjustments to book values have not been necessary
because prices have been remarkably stable, Should this situation change,
the rate of return covenants of Loans 574-CHA and 671-CHA would require
Taipower to revalue assets. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-
line basis; the composite rate was 3.2% in 1969. In addition, annual
depreciation charges are increased proportionately to the wholesale price
index increase over the year in which assets are acquired. Such
additional charges are credited to a reserve against possible revalua-
tions of assets. Depreciation charges have so far been somewhat on the
low side and a formal understanding between Taipower and the Government
has now been reached on the increase in rates (about 9% overall) recently
recommended by its financial consultants in accordance with the provisions
of Loan 671-CHA (para. 2.10). The new rates, agreed-with the Bank, are
being   applied in its accounts for fiscal 1970; their impact on the fore-
cast rates of return is not expected to affect tariffs in the immediate
future.

total capitalization estimated at December 31, 1970 is summarized in the
following table:

* Including current portion
5.09      All income remaining after appropriations to reserves is made
available for dividends. Mhile private stockholders receive theirs in
cash, Government have long followed a policy of reinvesting in Taipower
the dividends on its shareholdings. A covenant ensuring the continuance
of this policy until 1982 was included in the provisions of the Guarantee
Agreement for Loan 671-CHA and is repeated in the proposed loan.
Taipower's equity capital includes various reserves (see note 6 to
Annex 5) and the provision for additional depreciation described in
para. 5.07, equivalent to 1.3% of estimated gross fixed assets at
December 31, 1970.



- 16 -
5.10      Long term debt, including current maturities, presently repre-
sent about 49% of total capitalization. Of the aggregate amount of
NT $14 binlion (US $349 million) some NT $8.3 billion (US $208 million)
is in foreign exchange and NT $5.7 billion (us $141 million) is in local
currency. Outstanding obligations under various completed U.S. AID pro-
grams, administered and lent by CIECD, which are repayable into SAFED
and have been available for re-lending, total about NT $7.8 billion
(us $196 million) reflecting the high dependency on this source in the
past. Another very important source of local funds is the deferment of
custom duties (para. 3.14), granted interest-free by the Ministry of
Finance for extended periods depending on the amount of the duties.
Further details including the terms of outstanding long term debts are
presented in Annex 7, page 2.
5.11      Although the level of debt at present is not particularly high,
some of the recent and prospective borrowings are on too short terms to
be appropriate for an expanding public utility. Taipower's traditional
local sources for large amounts of longer-term debt financing are no
longer available, U.S. AID (counterpart) programs having terminated in
1966 and CIECD/SAFED being obliged to devote their limited funds to the
investment demands of the social sector. In addition Taipower is having
to resort to an increasingly higher proportion of credits from suppliers
and overseas commercial banks, with 5-10 year repayment terms. The only
foreign currency borrowings, for committed projects, that amortize over
periods of at least 15 years and carry modest interest rates, are from
institutions such as the Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the U.S.
EXINBANK which together account for just 44% of Taipower's total
financing requirements during the project period.
The Financing Plan
5.12      Taipower's construction program through 1976, is described in
paras. 2.16 - 2.20 and summarized in Annex 6, page 3. Its cost including
interest charged to construction would amount to about US $1.2 billion
equivalent, or 1.6 times the gross plant expected in service at the end
of 1970.
5.13      Internal cash generation, net of debt service and cash divi-
dends, would provide about 35% of the inveatment requirements during
1971-76. Government's reinvestment of dividends (para. 5.09) account for
almost two-thirds of this. These resources together with minor cash
inflows from the disposal of salvaged assets, customers' contributions
and sales of stock to private shareholders, less an allowance for an
adequate increase in working capital, will produce some 41% of const-
ruction expenditure. This represents a substantial improvement in
financing since the Bank became involved: in 1968 internal cash
generation provided only 21% of construction expenditure.

5.14      Taipower expects to finance the remaining 59%" of the construction
program through borrowings (detailed on page 2 of Annex 7), three-quarters
of which would be in foreign exchange. Borrowings committed or in prospect
include:
Foreign Exchange
i) the proposed Bank loan of US $55 million equivalent;
ii) continued disbursements under Lcans 574-CHA and 671-CHA;
iii) disbursements under the joint financing arrangements of
U.S. EXIMBANK and other U.S. commercial banks for the
two nuclear projects (5-15 years, 6%-9% interest);
iv) existing supplierst credits, for a total of about US $104
million (5.10 years, 6% interest);
v) a loan of US $13 million' equivalent from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) for transmission and distribution
extensions (15 years, 7.5% interest);
Local Currency
vi)  SAFED loans (25 years, 10% interest), for a total of
about US $20 million equivalent (see para. 5.10);
vii)  drawings from the Bank of Taiwan (BOT) and the Bank of
Communications (BOC) totalling some US $104 million
equivalent (10 years, 10% interest); and
viii) deferment of custom duties, amounting to about US $68
million equivalent (5-20 years, no interest).
5.15      After allowing for the foregoing there is still a short-fall
of NT $4.4 billion (US $111 million) to be met - not an abnormal situa-
tion for a rapidly expanding utility with a heavy capital investment
program. Taipower concedes it ought not to resort to more short-term
debt and has therefore undertaken with the Government to investigate the
development of a local capital market. As a first step they plan to study
conditicns for a private bond issue by Taipower, of a token US $5 million
in the first instance, on terms competitive with Government's own bonds.
A good response from the general public would provide more local partici-
pation in an essential industry and give a degree of confidence to future
investors; it would also augur well for further issues of progressively
larger amounts. The Government has agreed to support Taipower in floating
a bond issue if results from the study prove favorable.

Expected Performance
5.16      Forecast financial performance would be satisfactory and no
change in tariffs is envisaged. The rate of return under the rate
covenants prescribed by both previous loans, which is repeated in the
proposed loan, require the Company to earn a return of at least 10%;
it is expected that this target will be achieved with an average of
11.5% each year during the project period. Annual depreciation charges
are being increased by about 9% (para. 5.07) which would result in the
forecast rates of return being reduced from 1970 onwards by about 0.5%
p.a., without any change in cash generation. Average revenue per kWh
is projected to rise gradua.ly from NT $0.56 in 1970 to NT $o.58 by
1976 because of increases in the proportion of residential sales
carrying higher average rates. Operating expenses are expected to
decrease in relation to sales, reflecting not only more efficient
operations from the use of nuclear power and larger size thermal
generating units, but other economies of scale.
Expected Financial Position
5.17      The expected financial position is satisfactory.  The financing
plan provides for adequate increases in working capital and for the main-
tanance of a satisfactory cash position. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities would fall to fractionally below unity in 1975 and
1976 but would regain that level in later years. The debt/equity ratio,
after reaching a peak 58/42 in 1973 would decrease to 52/48 in 1976,
reflecting the satisfactory level of retained earnings. On an annual
basis debt service coverage would decline from 2.0 in 1970 to 1.6 during
1973-75 but thereafter improve.
Debt Limitation Covenant
5.18      Under the provisions of both previous loans Taipower has agreed
not to incur debt unless it meets a debt service coverage of 1.5 times
as a minimum, measured by comparing current net revenues (before the
charge for depreciation) to maximum future service on all debt drawn
down   The covenant is maintained in the proposed loan agreements.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
6.01      During negotiations Taipower agreed:
i) to employ qualified engineering consultants and contractors
in carrying out the project (paras. 3.08, 3.15 and 3.17);
ii) to continue to retain qualified independent auditors
(para. 5.04);
iii) to continue to maintain tariffs sufficient to produce an
annual rate of return of not less than 10% (para. 5.16); and
iv) not to incur any further long term debt without first obtaining
the Bank's approval, unless it meets a debt service coverage
of 1.5 times as a minimum (para. 5.18).
6.02      During negotiations assurances were received from the
Government:
i) that it undertakes to continue its present policy of re-
investing in Taipower the dividends accruing on its share-
holdings (paras. 5.09 and 5.13); and
ii)  that, depending on the results of a local capital market study,
it would support the issue, by Taipower, of an exploratory
series of bonds (para. 5.15).

0.5%. In 1970, 20 GWh of curtailment has been experienced up to September. In
the period 1963-67, load shedding was estimated to range from 0% (1964) to 3.8%
(1963).
2/ Taipower's 1971 load growth is lower than in previous years because 400 GWh of
the Taiwan Aluminum Co. (TALCO) requirements, previously supplied by Taipower
will, starting that year, be supplied by TALCO itself.

ANNEX 5

Notes to Income Statements
1/ The rate base conprises: (a) average net fixed assets in operation;
plus (b) a working capital allowance equal to 2.5% of (a), plus 11.5%
of cash operating expenses.
/ The increase in average revenue per kWh in 1969 and 1970 is due mostly
to the tariff adjustment described in para. 5.05, effective July 1,
1969. Purther increases result from shifts in the composition of demand
(see also para. 5.16).
3/ The principal taxes paid by Taipower are:
(a)  Sales Tax:  0.875% of revenues from power and other sales,
plus 1.5% of other revenues, plus an additional 30% of the
amount so determined;
(b)  Stamp Tax:  0.4% on all revenues and annual customers
contributions;
(c)  A number of property taxes on land, buildings and net
fixed assets, at rates varying between 2% and 6%;
(d) Taxes and surtaxes at various rates on motor vehicles.
4/  Income tax is paid at an effective rate after adjustments of 16%-17%
of net income.  The proceeds accrue 80% to the National Government
and 20% to the Provincial Government.
5/ The figures shown in the Income Statement for depreciation include
the additional depreciation on unrecorded appreciation of assets
described in para. 5.07. Depreciation allowances for a coal mine
owned by Taipower are treated as part of the coal cost and included
under "Fuel". They are properly taken into account in the funds
statement and in the balance sheet.
6/ Taipower follows rather rigid rules for the disposition of profits.
The legal reserve is credited 10% of net income before income tax.
Until 1968, all income above the 6% return (then required by regula-
tions) had to be allocated to a "Reserve for Rate Equalization" to
compensate for possible future returns lower than 6%. In 1969, the
amount credited to this reserve was transferred to "Reserve for Power
Development", wlere, under the new regulations mentioned in para. 5.01,
all income above the 10% return would so accruee Credits to the

"Reserve for Exchange Adjustment", previously made at the rate of
NT$ 30 million per year, are now subject to new rules. The alloca-
tions should be equal to 2% of outstanding foreign long term debt
minus half the current year's provision for additional depreciation
which is credited to a reserve against possible revaluations of
assets. The balance of net income after allocations to reserves is
available for distribution as dividends to private shareholders
(in cash) and to the National and Provincial Governments (in stock).
Distribution has been between 15% and 20% of par value since 1963.
In 1971 however, it would drop to 13.7% because of the substantial
capital increase which resulted when the "Advances" were converted
into stock.  For the future, distributions of around 15% would be
possible.

Notes to Sources and Applications of Fnds
*/ All new customers are required to pay a connection charge. If sub-
stantial new facilities are required to provide the service, the
customer must contribute in addition 70% of the actual construction
cost, plus a fixed fee based on the Comnpany's overheads.
**/ In calculating net internal cash generation - and the rate of self-
financing, debt service and cash dividends are deducted from internal
cash generation. However, interest charged to construction has been
considered part of the overall construction expenditures, and has not
therefore been included in the debt service.

Internal Financial Rate of Return
The method followed in determining the rate of return consists of
comparing the present worth of the streams of costs and revenues related to
Talin No. 5 unit over the expected life of tlhe project and in seeking the
rate at which the present worths of both streams are equal. Two rates are
computed excluding, and including, the sunk costs, that is, those costs of
transmission and distribution facilities essential to marketing the output
of Talin No. 5, but already available or committed.
1. Excluding Sunk Costs
Costs
i.    The capital cost includes the cost of Talin No. 5 (us$ 53.8
million), the estimated cost of distribution facilities required
to distribute the power generated by this unit (US$ 17 million),
and an initial fuel stock (US$ 1 million). No cost for trans-
mission is included at this stage since the existing or committed
transmission facilities have enough capacity to transmit the
powser generated by Talin No. 5; and
ii.   Operation and maintenance costs amount to .3 US mills/k14h.  Fuel
cost per kih is 3.6 mills/kWh from a heat rate of 8867 Btu/kWh,
a fuel heating value of 18,COO Btu/lb. (Bunker C class) and a
fuel cost of US$ 16.5 per ton, the rate charged since 1969 by
the Chinese Petroleum Company, the Government-owned oil monopoly.
Revenues
Revenues are obtained by using the NT$ .58 per kWh average tariff.
Rate of Return
The internal financial rate of return is 24.1%. This is a par-
ticularly high figure, principally because of sunk costs on project
site infrastructure and high voltage transmission.
2. Including Sunk Costs
Costs
In addition to the above mentioned costs, sunk costs comprise:
i.    Sunk cost on project site estimated at US$ 1.5 million, since
Talin No. 5 unit benefits from already financed site develop-
ment.
ii.   Sunk cost on high voltage transmission facilities, estimated
at US$ 14 million.



ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 2 pages
Revenues
Revenues remain unchanged.
Rate of Return
The internal financial rate of return with sunk costs included
is 20.4%, a still satisfactory one.
