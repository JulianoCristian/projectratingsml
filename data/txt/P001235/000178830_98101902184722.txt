INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR AN AIRPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Kenya for the equivalent of $29 million to help
finance a project for the development of Nairobi Airport. The loan would
have a term of 20 years including 5 years grace, with interest at 74 per
cent per annum.
PART I - THE EONOMY
2.        Since gaining Independence at the end of 1963, Kenya has made
a good start in bringing a better standard of life to its population
and has gone a long way towards establishing the administrative and
infrastructural base for future economic development. This growth
has been made possible by pragmatic economic management, which
successfully built on to the economy inherited from the colonial period,
and by policies and attitudes that have encouraged a high level of private
investment and external assistance. Kenya has continued as a strong
supporter of the East African Community, particularly during its recent
period of stress.
3.        A Bank economic mission visited Kenya in September 1971 to review
progress made under the current development plan which covers the financial
years 1970 through 1974. The report of that mission, entitled "Economic
Progress and Prospects in Kenya" (Report No. AE-22 of March 3, 1972), was
distributed to the Executive Directors on March 17, 1972. Country Data are
given in Annex II.
4.        The economic report was considered by the Consultative Group for
East Africa which met in Paris on April 20 and 21, 1972 to discuss Kenya's
economic prospects. The meeting concluded that the economic performance
and prospects of Kenya justified continued technical assistance and increased
financial aid from the members of the Group and that having regard to the
growing requirements for external assistance a substantial part of financial
aid should be on concessionary terms.
5.        The report concludes that since the Bank's last major economic
report in 1969, the Kenya economy has continued to expand rapidly, very
much in line with the targets set in the 1970-74 Plan.  Since 1964 GDP in



- 2 -
real terms has been increasing at an average rate of 6.7 per cent. Average
per capita income has increased from $107 in 1964 to about $140 in 1970,
which is near the median for Africa as a whole. Thus, real income has prob-
ably grown about twice as fast as population since Independence, even though
the rate of population growth (3.3 per cent) in Kenya is one of the highest
in the world.
6.        There have been no fundamental changes in Kenya's development
philosophy since Independence; in fact the evolution of economic policy since
1964, as set out in the national development plans which have been published,
should rather be seen as a development of the basic philosophies laid down
in the original Government policy statement, "African Socialism and its
Application to Planning in Kenya". The current 1970-74 Plan, which was pub-
lished towards the end of 1969, restates the Government's basic objectives
of maintaining rapid but broadly-based economic growth and providing all
the country's citizens with rising incomes and reasonable facilities.
In addition, the Plan focused particularly on the scope for accelerated
development of the rural areas, on the urgency of providing more
employment, and on the need to achieve a more equal distribution of
income. Since the Plan was published, the Government has started to move
cautiously towards greater direct participation in certain key sectors of
the economy by purchasing a shareholding in several private companies,
notably in power, oil refining and banking.
7.        In terms of overall growth, the target growth rates set by the
Plan have so far largely been realized although a prolonged drought set
back development in 1971. GDP increased by about 62 per cent in real
terms in 1969 and 1970, compared with a target growth rate of 6.8 per cent
in the Plan. Investment, after only a modest increase in 1969, increased
by nearly a quarter in 1970 to a record level of nearly K1100 million.
Development in the first phase of the Plan has so far been fairly
broadly-based, although construction and manufacturing have been particu-
larly important as growth points in the economy.
8.        Government expenditure during the first three years of the Plan
is also growing at a faster rate than planned, especially the development
budget which has been boosted by an average of 30 per cent a year during
the Plan period. Some of this increase has been due to the purchase of
shares in private companies referred to above (paragraph 6). This deci-
sion to take a substantial, though not-necessarily major, shareholding
in a few major undertakings of strategic economic importance was not
provided for in the Plan. Moreover, the decision to acquire these shares
by purchases on the open market or by direct negotiation with the private
companies, while reinforcing investor confidence in Kenya, has had effects
on both the budget and the balance of payments in 1970 and 1971. But even
if these transfer payments are eliminated from public sector expenditure,
it is evident that the Government is pushing ahead with development faster
than expected. This acceleration in expenditure is reflected in a budget



-3-
which has now to rely more heavily on raising loan capital and in the domes-
tic market since neither the recurrent surplus nor external aid has kept up
with the growth in expenditure.
9.        The rapid rate of development of the economy as a whole has also
brought about a much tighter balance of payments in 1971. While
the emergence of a balance of payments constraint by 1974 was foreseen in
the Plan, the very rapid increase in imports needed to sustain the pace of
development - more than 20% per year in 1970 and 1971 - has brought it
on sooner than expected. After a number of years of balance of payments
surpluses and growing reserves, this new and rather sudden development
will require some changes in the orientation of economic management, par-
ticularly in regard to the fostering of export industries and the need to
attract additional amounts of external financial assistance to cover the
deficit on current account. The emergence of the first real constraints
on the balance of paynents, as well as on the Government budget, is a
significant development, but not, as stated earlier, an unexpected one.
In fact these constraints are in large measure the natural consequence of
the country's success in pushing development nearer to the limits of its
resource base than it has in the past. They also indicate very clearly
that Kenya will have to attract a substantially higher level of external
assistance - perhaps as much as $70 million a year more than is now in
prospect - if the present fast pace of development is not to be curtailed.
10.       While the overall rate of growth of the Kenya economy has been
very good, certain aspects of Kenya's economic development in recent years -
especially in regard to the allocation of resources and the distribution of
benefits among its people - have not been entirely satisfactory. The general
allocation of resources in Kenya's development planning is very largely in
conformity with the economic priorities of the country, but, as past Bank
reports have suggested, there is the risk of some imbalances emerging. The
agricultural sector, for example, has tended to receive a diminishing allo-
cation of public expenditure and investment funds since the end of the major
land transfer and settlement programs after Independence, even though the
continued growth of incomes, employment and exports will depend critically
on the pace of agricultural development, as will the success of any program
of rural development. To a large extent this apparent imbalance reflects
the necessary emphasis there has been on providing the infrastructure -
roads, harbors, power and water supplies - which were required
before any development could take place. It also reflects the strongly-felt
social and political need to improve social services, particularly education,
to a people who had few of these services before. However, some re-ordering
of priorities may be called for in subsequent reviews of the Plan, if the
productive sectors are to be given sufficient resources to stimulate a high
rate of future growth.
11.       Perhaps the least satisfactory aspect of Kenya's past economic
growth has been the manner in which the incremental benefits have been



-4 -
distributed amongst the population. Many people in Kenya have gained very
considerably since Independence, particularly those who have been able to
benefit from education and training under the Kenyanization program, the
urban wage earners, and many thousands of African farmers who have had
their way of life transformed through the successful introduction of
profitable cash crops. Many other people, however, particularly in the
lower strata of income, have benefitted much less. The difficulty in
distributing economic gain in some equitable way is seen in its most
serious form in the increasing unemployment. Wage employment has not
increased at all since 1964 in the large-scale private sector, and the
rapidly increasing labor force has had to seek work in the relatively
small public sector or in the increasingly important small-farm and small-
business sector, or find self-employment on the land or in the towns. The
hardcore of the unemployment problem is among the school leavers, particu-
larly the primary school graduates, who are being thrown on the labor
market at the rate of about 100,000 a year and are generally ill-equipped
to secure the few jobs that are available and unsuitable either by age or
orientation to return to work on the land.
12.       The Government is well aware of these problems and is continuing
to seek solutions. The present plan contains an enterprising experiment
in rural development which the Government now hopes to extend gradually
to all rural areas, and there is now a growing concern for accelerating
agricultural development and the first signs that the agricultural sector
is getting an increased allocation of resources. Government's greatest
concern, however, is probably now being centered on the problem of
unemployment.
13.       Kenya's immediate economic dilemma will be to decide how to
allocate more resources to certain key sectors of the economy, while
not disrupting the continuation of existing programs, in the context of
emerging financial and foreign exchange constraints. There is clearly
no easy solution to this problem. There will, however, be a higher
priority for projects in agriculture and other export-oriented industries
in a form that will be suitable for external financing. It is estimated
that if the past rate of development continues, Kenya's resource gap
will continue to grow rather quickly during the remainder of the Plan
period, and that an increased flow of external capital will therefore
be required to cover the balance of payments.
14.       Since Independence in 1963, Kenya's total external debt has
increased from $179 million to $282 million at the end of 1970. In addi-
tion to its own external public debt, Kenya is also jointly responsible,
with the other two Partner States, for the debts incurred by the East Afri-
can Community and its institutions, which amounted to some $171 million at



-5-
the end of 1970. About 25 per cent of Kenya's external debt is held by
the Bank Group (10 per cent IBRD and 15 per cent IDA). Some 44 per cent
of the Community's debt is also held by the Bank. Kenya's external public
debt is not unduly large, and her debt service ratio (7 per cent in 1971,
including her share of EAC debt) does not represent a large burden on her
foreign exchange earnings. Kenya is a low income country, and it is there-
fore desirable for her to incur debt on the most favorable possible terms.
However, the Bank Group's program of lending to Kenya exceeds the amount
of IDA funds which can be made available and, since the economy can absorb
some borrowing on conventional terms, Bank lending to finance high priority
projects continues to be justified.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO KENYA
15.       Kenya has to date received 6 Bank loans and 12 IDA credits amount-
ing to $149.3 million. In addition, Kenya has been one of the beneficiaries
of 6 loans totalling $162.8 million which have been extended for the develop-
ment of common services (railways, ports and telecommunications) operated on
a regional basis for the three Partner States of the East African Community:
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Summary statements of Bank loans/IDA credits
to Kenya and the East African Community common services organizations and
comments on Bank and IDA financed projects in progress are in Annex I.
16.       Most of the Bank Group's direct lending to Kenya in the past has
been for infrastructure, particularly roads and power, although other sectors
such as agriculture and forestry, education and water supply have also re-
ceived support. For some time the Bank has been endeavoring to give greater
emphasis to agriculture and other directly productive sectors and particularly
to projects which will directly benefit large numbers of people and will,
wherever possible, contribute to Kenya's foreign exchange earnings. During
the past year, as a result of an extensive dialogue with the Government, a
broad understanding has been reached on a program for expanding the Bank's
assistance in identification and preparation of agricultural projects and in
charting a longer term strategy for agricultural development. The work now
going on for the preparation of some seven agricultural projects - including
a second phase smallholder agricultural credit project, further projects for
the development of tea and livestock production and two rural development
projects - was reviewed in detail,and it was agreed that Kenya, with assis-
tance from the Bank's Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa,would undertake
preparation of these projects as a matter of priority. To assist in the
longer term effort the Bank agreed to provide a senior adviser to help the
Government in formulating a long-term strategy for agricultural development.
A suitable expert has been selected and is expected to assume his duties
in Fall this year.



- 6 -
17.       The Bank is also making a study of rural development in Kenya
and Tanzania, which will include agricultural sector surveys in the two
countries. I hope that this concerted effort being undertaken by the
Government and the Bank will lead to new approaches to Kenya's rural
development and greater participation by the Bank Group in the most
vital sector of the economy.
18.       Concurrently with the efforts to promote the development of
the rural economy, substantial amounts of investment will continue to
be required to maintain public services abreast of economic growth and
we expect to continue financing key infrastructure projects. The Bank
is also assisting in the preparation of a project for a major new tourist
resort on the Kenya coast and in the establishment of a development finarice
institution for industry.
19.       The Bank is proposing to continue its lending to the institu-
tions of the East African Community. I expect to submit to the Executive
Directors shortly a proposal for a Bank loan of $8 million to the East
African Development Bank, a Community institution serving Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda. Further programs for the development of the facilities of the
Community common services organizations for railways, harbors and tele-
communications are at varying stages of preparation; the program for harbor
development has recently been appraised by the Bank.
20.       IFC has three investments in Kenya: $12.9 million in the Pan-
African Paper Mills, Ltd., $3.2 million in Kenya Hotel Property Co., Ltd.
and $2.4 million in Tourist Promotion Services (Kenya) Ltd. A further
investment of approximately $2 million in Kenya Hotel Property Co., Ltd.
is presently under consideration.
PART III - THE AVIATION AND TOURISM SECTORS
Aviation
21.       Air transport is becoming increasingly important and now accounts
for about 20 per cent of Kenya's revenues from transport services.  It
accounts for the majority of Kenya's international passenger traffic, and
a large proportion of passenger traffic within East Africa. It is becoming
increasingly important as a means of transportation within Kenya.



-7-
22.       Apart from its general role in supporting the growth of the
economy, an efficient system of air transport is particularly important
for the tourist industry which is now a major source of foreign exchange
earnings and represents the most promising single source of expanding
earnings in the future. Since the tourist industry and aviation are so
closely related, and since the priority accorded by the Government to
airport development stems from its desire to ensure an uninterrupted
exp)ansion in tourism, a separate section on tourism is given below. In
addition to tourism, exports of agricultural produce, particularly fresh
horticultural products, place heavy reliance on air transport. While
these exports are still small in absolute terms, they have increased
significantly during recent years and hold promise of further rapid
growth in the future. The Bank is helping the Government to work out
a major horticultural production program which could result in a greatly
expanded export industry, dependent on air freight service.
23.       To serve the needs of passenger and freight traffic, Kenya has
five main commercial airports. Of these, by far the most important is
the Nairobi (Embakasi) International Airport, which is at present the
only point of arrival and departure for scheduled international flights
serving points beyond East Africa and is also the hub of the East
African Airways network. About half of the international and regional
passenger traffic passing through Nairobi is generated by the tourist
industry, with the remainder about evenly distributed between business
travellers and transit passengers. In addition to the East African
Airways Corporation (EAAC), which is a Community corporation operating
scheduled services to all the three Partner States and some overseas
countries, Nairobi is served by some 22 foreign airlines. These
directly link Kenya - and indirectly other East African countries - to
20 foreign countries.
2h..      Apart from Embakasi Airport, three other airports - Mombasa
(Port Reitz), Malindi and Kisumu - operate scheduled domestic services.
In addition, Wilson Airport in Nairobi is an important general aviation
center for charter operations by small aircraft, mainly for tourists.
25.       Over the last ten years, passenger traffic has grown at
an average rate of 13.3 per cent a year and freight traffic at about
13.9 per cent. Projections of future traffic growth through 1982
indicate that passenger traffic will grow at an average rate of
11 per cent a year and freight traffic by 15 per cent a year. To
support this expected increase in traffic, the current 1970-74
Development Plan provides for some $20 million for airport improve-
ments, but it is expected that substantially more than this will be



- 8 -
spent before the end of the Plan period. In addition to the proposed
development of Nairobi Airport, the plan provides for the expansion of
the existing terminal building at Mombasa Airport and lengthening of the
runway to accommodate aircraft of the DC-8 and Boeing 707 type. This
would make it possible for Mombasa to handle direct charter flights from
EXurope to service the coastal tourist circuits. The Government plans to
carry out the developments at Mombasa with bilateral aid. In addition,
improvements have recently been completed at Wilson Airport (aprons,
taxiways and lighting), Kisumu Airport and other airstrips in various
parts of the country.
Tourism
26.       The priority accorded by the Government to the expansion of
Nairobi Airport rests on the expected growth of tourism. In recent years
tourism has been one of the most rapidly expanding sectors in the economy,
and now ranks, alongside coffee as a principal source of foreign exchange.
The current Development Plan projected an average increase of 15 per cent
a year in the number of tourist nights spent in Kenya. In fact, although
the total number of tourists visiting Kenya have increased faster than
expected in the Plan, the total number of tourist nights spent within the
country increased at only about the same rate as projected in the Plan
since the average duration of stay has fallen. The Plan envisaged that
the gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism would grow from $42
million in 1968 to over $100 million in 1974. Actual earnings may fall
somewhat short of this target, since the average daily expenditure of
tourists has shown a decline with the shift towards package tours. The
Government estimates that three quarters of these gross tourism earnings
are retained by Kenya. In addition, tourism generates employment and
incomes, not only for those directly involved but also for those engaged
in agriculture, constructian, commerce and transport, which supply the
industry. There is no doubt that the tourist industry will play an
increasingly important role in Kenya's future development.
27.       Kenya has already taken advantage of its natural attractions
of wild life, unspoiled beaches, beautiful scenery and pleasant climate
to build up a dominant position in the East African tourist industry.
The potential for future growth is still substantial. The tourist industry,
however, has now reached the stage where Government will need to be more
closely involved in its planning on a comprehensive basis. In particular
this calls for investigation, planning and promotion of new tourist
circuits, providing infrastructure, training manpower to obtain
greater local participation in the industry and ensuring that development
by private investors is in consonance with social and environmental
considerations. The Government is now embarking on studies to prepare
new circuits and improve existing facilities. One of these studies, in
which the Bank is assisting, is of a major new tourist resort on the coast,
to the south of Mombasa, which would in the first phase include approxi-
mately 2,000 beds and in addition would generate demand for facilities
in game parks and other inland circuits.



-9-
28.       An extension to the capacity of Nairobi Airport to handle aircraft
andl passengers and their baggage is a prerequisite to the long-term develop-
ment of tourism in Kenya, and will also contribute to the development of tour-
ism in neighboring countries. A survey of tourist passengers leaving Nairobi
tirport in 1968/69 revealed that 43 per cent of all visitors to Kenya (and
59 per cent of holiday visitors) were also visiting either Tanzania or Uganda
(or both) where they spent an average of six days. Thus, while the East
African countries are to some extent competing for the same market, they are
also complementary to one another in attracting, and retaining, overseas
toulrists .
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Nairobi Airport Project, Kenya"
(No. PTR-103., dated May 16, 1972)is being circulated separately. A
Loan and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
30.       Involvement with the formulation of the proposed project dates
back to 1969 when, at the request of the Government, the Bank reviewed a
Master Plan for airport development at Nairobi prepared by consultants.
This early involvement in the formulation of the project enabled the
Bank to render assistance which is perhaps almost as significant as the
financial assistance provided through the proposed loan.
31.       Review of the Master Plan resulted in three substantive
recommendations which were instrumental in shaping the project. The first
recommendation involved a rephasing of the developments proposed in the
Master Plan; in particular, the postponement by three years of a major
investment in a new terminal building. In pursuance of this recommendation,
Kenya carried out certain modifications to the existing terminal building
which will permit it to handle, without sacrificing efficiency, the passen-
ger and freight traffic through 1975. The postponement of major capital
expenditure even after taking account of the likely increase in costs of
the new facilities has undoubtedly been a significant saving for the economy.
The second recommendation called for a substantial revision of the physical
Master Plan to take into account the longer term technical and ecological
implications of the location of a proposed second runway (and consequently
the siting of the terminal complex) which might have necessitated relocation
of the Wilson (general aviation) and Eastleigh (defense) airports, forced



- 10 -
relocation of some 8,000 people residing in the Enbakasi village and
generated additional noise and pollutants over the city of Nairobi and
the Nairobi National Park. The Government accepted this recommendation
and the revision of the Master Plan and subsequent design and engineer-
ing of the proposed project were carried out in close consultation with
the Bank. The third recommendation concerned the institutional aspect
of airport operations in Kenya. Responsibilities for airport operations
were dispersed among various ministries, resulting in inadequate
control, coordination and accounting of airport operations. Such diffusions
of responsibilities not only affected operational efficiency, but also
failed to provide cost data necessary for arriving at a cost related scale
of user charges. The Government saw merit in the Bank's recommendation
for centralizing all functions relating to airports into one operating
unit and has established an Aerodromes Department which would be the
organizational and administrative unit in charge of all Kenya airports.
32.       The project was appraised in the field in August 1971. Negoti-
ations for the proposed Bank loan were held in Washington in February 1972.
The Kenya Government was represented by Mr. S. E. Ogembo, Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Power and Communications; Mr. A. M. Nderi, Nairobi Airport Manager;
Mr. P. Ndibo, Under Secretary, Ministry of Power and Communications; Mr.
Moskalawicz, Adviser, Ministry of Power and Communications; Mr. A. L. arap
Ngeny, Under Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning; Mr. Simon J.
Mbugua, Engineer-in-Chief, Ministry of Works; and Mr. G. P. Manners, Chief
Engineer, Roads (Supernumerary), Ministry of Works.
33.       The proposed project, which forms the first phase of the Master
Plan for the development of Nairobi Airport, comprises:
(a) construction of a new terminal building for international
and domestic traffic, a freight building, taxiways, aprons,
control tower, other ancillary buildings and access roads;
(b) installation of airfield and approach lighting, a fire
hydrant system, water, electrical and sewerage systems; and
(c) provision of technical personnel and training, including
consultants' services.
34.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $h6.3 million equiv-
alent,of which $29 million (63 per cent) is the estimated foreign exchange
component. The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange costs. The
local currency costs amounting to $17.3 million equivalent would be financed
by the Government.



- 11 -
35.       The present airport facilities at Nairobi for passenger traffic
and freight, which are expected to grow at an annual rate of about 11 per
cent and 15 per cent,respectively, (after taking into account possible
loss of traffic to Mombasa and other competing airports) are rapidly
approaching their saturation points.  The proposed project, when completed
in 1975, will meet traffic needs up to 1982 and remove restrictions on the
flow of passengers and freight through Nairobi.
36.       Nairobi is a major international airport, serving not only Kenya
but also to an extent all of East Africa. The scheme adopted for the
development of the necessary facilities is the optimum solution taking
into account long range technical and ecological implications of alternatives.
37.       The projec't is estimated to yield-a return'of about 15.0 per
cent to the economy of Kenya based on:
(i) A third of the aircraft operating cost savings accruing to
'the East African Airways which is jointly owned by Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda.
(ii)  The estimated net contribution to Kenya's GNP by the increased
number of foreign tourists made possible by the project. The
project would generate additional tourist traffic by reducing
passenger time spent on travel to Nairobi and by providing
capacity for accommodating a greater number of flights and
larger size aircraft for handling a greater number of passen-
gers.
(iii)  The incremental revenues generated from additional landing
fees made possible by the airport's capacity to handle
larger aircraft, from rentals for increased terminal space
provided to airlines and the expected increase in the de-
parture tax which would recapture part of the benefits
accruing to the passengers.
This analysis has taken into account only those benefits which accrue directly
to the Kenyan economy. A sensitivity analysis indicates that under varying
assumptions of costs and benefits the rate of return would range between
12 and 17.5 per cent.



- 12 -
38.       Nairobi Airport has been and is expected to continue to be finan-
cially viable. The airport operations have contributed significantly to
the Government revenues in the past and are expected to continue doing so.
The Government has provided assurances that it will introduce a system of
user charges based on costs and take all action necessary to ensure that
the airport will generate revenues sufficient to yield a minimum annual
rate of return on net fixed assets in operation of 5 per cent through FY77,
8 per cent in the years 1978 and 1979 and 10 per cent thereafter. Indeed,
projections indicate that the airport will, in later years, generate
revenues far greater than required to meet the stipulated minimum rate of
return. The earned surpluses generated by Nairobi Airport are expected to
rise from about $3.2 million in 1972 to about $6.4 million in 1984 - a
cumulative contribution to the Government of about $42 million over the
period.
39.       The project will be implemented and operated by the newly estab-
lished Aerodromes Department. The new Department,which will be manned by
a Director, a Chief of Operations, an Airport Engineer, a Financial Manager
and necessary supporting staff,will control all operations relating to all
airports in Kenya and account for all financial transactions in respect of
them. Services of experts to fill the positions of the Airport
Engineer and Financial MIanager as well as consultants to set up a unified
commercial accounting system and train accounting staff will be required
and funds for this purpose have been provided under the loan. The proposed
loan also provides funds for a training program for the staff employed on
airport engineering, maintenance and the whole spectrum of other disciplines
involved in operating a modern airport.
40.       In addition to the overall improvement in airport operations that
this unification of functions in one operating Department is expected to
bring about, the availability of accurate cost accounting information
will provide the basis for arriving at user charges based on costs which
the Government has agreed to introduce at the time the new facilities
are brought in service at Nairobi.
41.       Procurement of equipment and the letting of construction contracts
will be in accordance with the Bank guidelines for international competitive
bidding. Disbursements would be made against the actual foreign exchange
costs or the estimated foreign exchange component of the goods and services
procured.
42.       The Government expects to incur a total expenditure of about $4
million in respect of consultants services for architectural and engineering
design and supervision of project construction. Of this approximately $1.9
million is expected to be paid prior to June 1972. The Government has re-
quested that the Bank finance the eligible portion of such costs retroac-
tively from April 1, 1970, which was roughly the date when the consultants
commenced work on the revision of the Master Plan, recommended by the Bank.
The proposed loan includes $1.3 million for meeting these costs.



PART 1V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Kenya and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors sepa-
rately. The draft Loan Agreement follows the pattern of those for the
Bank's projects in Kenya.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Ar-
ticles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXEC1TION
1.        Performance under ongoing projects is generally satisfactory.
2.        The Smallholder Agricultural Credit Project (Credit No. 105 KE)
which started slowly due to changes in the top management of the project
entity, lack of adequate technical staff and the time required to build
up an adequate extention service io now being satisfactorily implemented
and all funds provided for on-farm development were coumitted in February
this year. The revised Closing Date is March 31, 1973 and the credit is
expected to be disbursed by this date. A follow-up project for further
provision of credit to mnallholders has recently been appraised.
3.        The Livestock Development Project (Credit No. 129 KE), after a
slow start due to the pioneering nature of the project and lack of ade-
quate staff at the start of the project, has picked up considerable mo-
mentum, and the last supervision mission in February reported that the
rate of approval of sub-loans for ranch development had improved markedly,
that 85 percent of the funds had been committed as at the end of January
1972 and that the entire amount would be committed by mid-1972* It is
unlikely that disbursements can be completed by the present Closing Date
of December 31, 1973 and a postponement of this date may be necessary.
A second phase project is currently under preparation with Bank assistance.
