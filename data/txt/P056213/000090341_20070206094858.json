Lessons learned from\n            the project: formal project restructuring through\n            streamlined procedures should be considered for projects\n            that are well performing, but need to accommodate new\n            realities (country or sector-wide). Introduction of trade\n            facilitation measures requires commitment across a wide\n            range of stakeholders in the public and private sector and\n            cooperation to succeed. Better linking and sequencing\n            technical assistance with investments could maximize\n            implementation success and development effectiveness.\n            Independent project management unit arrangements should be\n            considered for projects requiring effective cooperation\n            across related stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2006-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
