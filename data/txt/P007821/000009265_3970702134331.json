"The Second Structural Adjustment Project\n            loan will continue to support the Government's strategy\n            of structural adjustment and economic recovery. The strategy\n            aims at creating a more open, export-oriented economy in\n            which the efficiency of the productive sectors is enhanced\n            through exposure to greater international competition and\n            through refocused public services. To this end, the major\n            components of the program include: (i) improving the\n            efficiency of the public sector; (ii) reorienting the\n            incentive structure in the industrial sector; (iii) removing\n            some rigidities in the labor market; and (iv) reducing\n            distortional interventions in agriculture. The economic\n            program supported by the loan is expected to result in\n            substantially higher levels of economic growth and\n            employment than would otherwise occur. To realize its\n            potential the program requires a favorable international\n            environment: continued growth in the industrialized\n            countries, recovery in Latin America, low interest rates and\n            oil prices, and open international markets."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
