also accomplished additional initiatives\n            agreed at the mid-term review and with various supervision\n            missions. Project sustainability is likely: the\n            institutional transformation within APFD and the willingness\n            and ability to adapt to the participatory approach to forest\n            management and protection, with support from an established\n            training cell, suggests that project gains will be\n            maintained and enhanced. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances were rated satisfactory. Some of the major\n            lessons learned are summed up: Forestry programs contribute\n            significantly to poverty alleviation. People's\n            participation is essential and effective in protecting and\n            developing degraded forests. Building trust between people\n            and the department helps project implementation. Preparation\n            of a good microplan helps to effectuate implementation.\n            Organizations provide better access to delivering benefits.\n            Combined training of organization members and department\n            staff establishes better relationships and trust, which\n            improves project implementation. Integrating village\n            development and forestry development helps effectively\n            protect the latter. More interaction and input among\n            homogenous groups increases success in heterogenous groups.\n            Empowerment of women is crucial for the program's\n            success. Alternative energy sources such as biogas and\n            smokeless chullahas save time and fuel consumption."}, "docdt": "2001-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
