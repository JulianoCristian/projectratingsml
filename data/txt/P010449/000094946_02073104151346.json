Completion Report (ICR) of highly\n            satisfactory outcomes, high institutional development, and\n            likely sustainability. Likewise, the Borrower performance is\n            rated satisfactory; in contrast though, the Bank\n            performance, while generally good, compels an unsatisfactory\n            performance rating, due to a violation of the Involuntary\n            Resettlement safeguard. Lessons convey, first, that it is\n            possible to turn around the strategy of a large public\n            entity from command-and-control, to community participation\n            quite quickly, given commitment at high levels. Therefore,\n            sustained, skills development for government staff, and for\n            stakeholders in participatory processes, over periods longer\n            than a single project is necessary. Second, in any tribal\n            forest situation, there is a high potential for involuntary\n            resettlement. During the project review, Bank management\n            should carefully question claims in natural forest\n            management projects, where involuntary resettlement issues\n            should be anticipated. Third, even where a high percentage\n            of the poor are forest dependent, it is much easier to\n            manage forests for trees, than for the poor; hence,\n            equitable distribution of the benefits, needs early\n            attention through pro-poor policy, government and community\n            processes, and resource management systems. Fourth, economic\n            analysis of community development interventions will usually\n            be incomplete, if it assesses only the net benefits\n            associated with members themselves, or their allocated area.\n            This is because others may have previously utilized\n            resources inside the boundary, and also because members may\n            have previously utilized resources outside the boundary."}, "docdt": "2002-07-08T00:00:00Z"}
