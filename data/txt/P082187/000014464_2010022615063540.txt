the Special Account shall be made as follows:  
 
(a) 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Recipient shall furnish to 
the Association a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account of an amount or 
amounts, which in the aggregate do not exceed the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of

Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount, as the Recipient shall have 
requested.  
 
(b) 
For replenishment of the Special Account, the Recipient shall furnish to the

Association shall specify.  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Recipient shall 
furnish to the Association the documents and other evidence required pursuant to Part B.3 of 
Schedule 1 to this Agreement for the payment or payments in respect of which 
replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, the Association shall, on

Account, once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Grant minus the total amount of all 
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of 
the General Conditions shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized 
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Grant Account of the remaining unwithdrawn 
amount of the Grant shall follow such procedures, as the Association shall specify by notice 
to the Recipient.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Association shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the 
Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for 
Eligible Expenditures.
