                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project will close on 31 May 2011 but the CFD will not be fully operational until the last batch of technical equipment is shipped and installed, which will not happen before the
                         autumn 2011. The execution of the revised disbursement plan prepared by the project will be closely monitored by the task team until the closing date. A 4-month grace period will be
                         granted so that withdrawal applications submitted by the project until 30 September 2011 for services rendered before 31 May 2011 may be processed. The CFD needs to open an
                         escrow account to host the IDA funds that will be used to pay the audit for 2010 and 2011.

                         ICR should be sent to the Bank by 31 August 2011. The last supervision mission (March 28, April 01, 2011) recommended that the project convenes an extraordinary Board meeting
                         and a meeting of its Scientific Committee before 31 May 2011. The mission also recommended that the CFD team starts working on the implementation of a monitoring & evaluation
                         system (Component 3) and seek guidance and advice from the Scientific Committee.
