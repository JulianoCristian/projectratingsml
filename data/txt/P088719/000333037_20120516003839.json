         Facility Project for Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Afghanistan's environment is challenging for Foreign\n            Direct Investment (FDI), in particular the worsening\n            security environment and governance. Availability of\n            political risk guarantee is not enough to mitigate the\n            concerns of foreign investors. Without minimum peace and\n            security, long-term investments are difficult to attract.\n            The Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF)\n            marketing activities will have been further improved by\n            hiring a local marketing representative, familiar with local\n            investment and business environment as well as political\n            risk insurance products. The previous operation of\n            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in Bosnia\n            and Herzegovina highlighted the importance of having a\n            full-time representative working on the ground to increase\n            awareness and liaise with investors on a continuing basis;\n            once a special representative was placed in-country, there\n            was a steady flow of inquiries from foreign investors for\n            guarantees. In addition, local representative can help MIGA\n            staff in headquarters to better understand the risks\n            involved in the country since more detailed information can\n            be provided. This greatly helps in the management of risks\n            in a high-risk environment."}, "docdt": "2012-04-05T00:00:00Z"}
