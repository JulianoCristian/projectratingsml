Under this\n            project, IDA will provide a credit to the Government of\n            Afghanistan for an Investment Guarantee Facility which will\n            be administered and implemented by MIGA. The Facility '\n            s capital base will be made up of cash contributions from\n            IDA and others to be disbursed into an interest bearing\n            Trust Fund. Investors will pay premiums and MIGA, as\n            Administrator, will issue contracts of guarantee on behalf\n            of the Facility. All guarantees supported by the Guarantee\n            Facility will follow MIGA's regular underwriting\n            procedures and methodologies, and will be able to offer\n            coverage against the following risks: transfer restriction\n            and inconvertibility, expropriation, war and civil\n            disturbance and breach of contract. The guarantees will be\n            priced to risk, in accordance with MIGA's pricing\n            methodology and guarantee contracts will have a maximum\n            duration of seven years. In view of the need for flexibility\n            in Afghanistan's conflict-effected environment, it is\n            proposed that the Guarantee Facility be able to support the\n            following transactions generally ineligible under\n            MIGA's regular policies: a) foreign loans without\n            equity, to be used to finance a local equity investment or\n            the importation of critical capital goods for\n            reconstruction; and b) local loans provided in a freely\n            convertible currency by a foreign financial institution in Afghanistan."}, "docdt": "2004-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
