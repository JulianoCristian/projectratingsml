SCHEDULE 4 
Operation of the Facility Account 
1. 
For the purposes of this Schedule: 
 (a) 
the term “eligible Category” means Category (1) set forth in the table in 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; 
 
(b) 
the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures for the Project and 
to be supported out of the proceeds of the Credit allocated from time to time to the 
eligible Category in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 
 
(c) 
the term “Initial Advance” means an amount equivalent to $1,250,000 to 
be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited into the Facility Account pursuant 
to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule. 
2. 
Except as provided in Section 3.03 of this Agreement, payments out of the 
Facility Account shall be made exclusively for a valid Claim under a Guarantee Contract 
issued in accordance with Schedule 3 to this Agreement. 
3. 
After the Association has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Facility 
Account has been duly opened, withdrawals for the Initial Advance and subsequent 
withdrawals for the Facility Account shall be made as follows: 
 
(a) 
For withdrawals of the Initial Advance, MIGA, on behalf of the 
Borrower, shall furnish to the Association a request or requests for deposit into the 
Facility Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate amount of 
the Initial Advance.  On the basis of this request or requests, the Association shall, on 
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into the Facility 
Account such amount or amounts as MIGA shall have requested. 
(b) 
(i) 
The Borrower through MIGA shall not make any requests for 
withdrawals exceeding the Initial Advance unless the Initial Advance has 
been entirely utilized for issuing a Guarantee Contract(s) or is inadequate 
to cover issuing a Guarantee Contract(s). 
(ii) 
Prior to, or at the time of making the first request for 
withdrawals exceeding the Initial Advance, MIGA shall, on the 
Borrower’s behalf, furnish to the Association relevant documents and 
other satisfactory evidence, including Host Country Approvals for 
Guarantee Contracts showing that the Initial Advance has been entirely 
utilized for issuing a Guarantee Contract(s) or is inadequate to cover 
issuing a Guarantee Contract(s) with respect to which the request for 
withdrawal is made.

(iii) 
Prior to, or at the time of making any requests for withdrawals 
subsequent to the request referred to in clause (ii), above, MIGA shall, 
on the Borrower’s behalf, furnish to the Association relevant documents 
and other satisfactory evidence, including Host Country Approvals for 
Guarantee Contracts with respect to which the request is made. 
(iv) 
On the basis of each such request, the Association shall, on 
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit 
into the Facility Account such amount as MIGA shall have requested.  
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Association from the Credit 
Account under the eligible Category, and in the respective equivalent 
amounts, as is justified by the documents and other evidence presented 
by MIGA on the Borrower’s behalf. 
4. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Association 
shall not be required to make further deposits into the Facility Account: 
 
(a) 
if MIGA, on the Borrower’s behalf, shall have failed to furnish to the 
Association, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b)(ii) of this Agreement, 
any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the Association pursuant to said 
Section in respect of the audit of the records and accounts for the Facility Account; or 
 
(b) 
if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the Borrower of its 
intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals 
from the Credit Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General 
Conditions. 
5. 
(a) 
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any withdrawal 
(including the Initial Advance) from the Credit Account to issue Guarantee Contracts or 
any payment from the Facility Account: (i) was made for a Guarantee Contract not issued 
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or for a payment not eligible under 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Association, the Borrower shall, or shall cause MIGA to, promptly upon notice from the 
Association: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Association may request; or 
(B) deposit into the Facility Account (or, if the Association shall so request, refund to the 
Association) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so 
eligible or justified.  Unless the Association shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by 
the Association into the Facility Account shall be made until the Borrower, or MIGA, as 
the case may be, has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case 
may be. 
 
(b) 
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Facility Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall or shall cause MIGA to, promptly upon notice 
from the Association, refund to the Association such outstanding amount.

(c) 
The Borrower or MIGA, as the case may be, may upon notice to the 
Association, refund to the Association all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the 
Facility Account. 
(d) 
Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs 5 (a), (b) and (c) 
of this Schedule shall be credited to the Credit Account for subsequent withdrawal or for 
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the 
General Conditions.
