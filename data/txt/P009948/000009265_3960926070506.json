The project seeks to\n            accomplish this through (a) the addition of 270 MW of hydro\n            capacity on the Kalinadi River; (b) rehabilitation of the\n            Sharavathi Power Station; and (c) reinforcement of the\n            State's transmission system. In addition, the project\n            intends to provide consulting services, computer hardware,\n            software and training.  There are no extraordinary technical\n            risks associated with the project.  Geological\n            investigations have confirmed generally good rock formation\n            in the area of the hydro schemes.  KPC and KEB have staff\n            familiar with works similar to those included in the\n            proposed project and consulting support will be provided in\n            those areas in which the beneficiaries lack experience."}, "docdt": "1987-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
