The\n            principal project objectives were to alleviate power\n            shortage in the state of Karnataka and the southern region\n            by exploiting hydro resources, to provide efficient\n            transmission capacity, and to effect institutional,\n            operational and financial improvements in the two power\n            utilities of the state. The performance of the Bank in\n            respect of project preparation and appraisal cannot be\n            considered satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was not\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned from the project were:\n            (i) many of the project components preparation had not been\n            sufficiently advanced to warrant approval of a loan; (ii)\n            project management capabilities should have been more\n            rigorously assessed and the project management organization\n            designed accordingly; and (iii) measures need to be\n            introduced before loan approval to create an appropriate\n            regulatory environment to ensure the creditworthiness of the\n            power sector entities and which would prevent the government\n            from disallowing tariff increases for political reasons."}, "docdt": "1995-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
