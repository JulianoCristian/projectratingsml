over a two-year period, with the objective of\n            demonstrating and evaluating the relative merits of a number\n            of technical and operational improvements to the design of\n            existing tubewell systems in the State. The twelve districts\n            represent the full range of agro-climatic conditions in the\n            state. A small fund for preparation of a second-stage\n            project to introduce new tubewell designs throughout the\n            state would also be provided under the project. The project\n            would expand the irrigated area in Uttar Pradesh\n            significantly and would result in increased foodgrain,\n            sugarcane, and oilseed production."}, "docdt": "1980-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
