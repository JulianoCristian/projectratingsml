The project was\n            implemented during one of the worst economic crises the\n            country has experienced, with the country's public\n            policy priorities directed toward controlling the fiscal\n            deficit. Government counterpart funding was often not\n            forthcoming due to fiscal difficulties, creating delays in\n            project implementation and threatening disbursements due to\n            ineligibility of expenses on several occasions when loan\n            proceeds were used in lieu of counterpart funding to finance\n            project activities and taxes. The project has also suffered\n            delays resulting from Ecuador's unstable political\n            climate. The lessons learned from this project include:\n            Complexity of the project has to be commensurate with the\n            capacity of the Borrower. Technical assistance projects\n            require adequate close supervision. Project sustainability\n            and institutional strengthening require a close\n            collaboration between the implementing agency and the\n            Project Coordination Unit. Bank extension of closing date\n            proved essential in achievement of project objectives."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
