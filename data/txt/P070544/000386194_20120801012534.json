"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Accountability,\n            Transparency and Integrity Project (ATIP) for Tanzania were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            benefits and potential trade-offs associated with the aid\n            delivery modalities need full consideration at the outset.\n            The Bank's configuration of technical and financial\n            support provided with the ATIP was informed by two major\n            approaches: (i) Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) approach to\n            reforms, and (ii) the pooling of efforts, management,\n            finances and oversight through the mechanism of common\n            basket funds. The combining of sectors in an omnibus\n            'umbrella project' plus the multiplicity of\n            implementation agencies pose additional implementation\n            challenges and increase transaction costs downstream.\n            Available commentaries and lessons learned through previous\n            sectoral works need to be carefully reviewed at design\n            stage, to better understand the feasibility of the\n            interventions and avoid over-ambitious targets. The presence\n            of top-level leadership with executive capacity and\n            strategic focus should be tested rather than too readily\n            assumed, as their absence has detrimental effects at\n            implementation stage. The constructive impulse to mobilize\n            additional financing behind the government reform drive led\n            to assumptions as to how 'ready to run' was the\n            project design. Procedural and budgeting problems should not\n            be underrated. Another particularly troublesome aspect of\n            project management related to work planning in the context\n            of mainstreaming and integration with Medium Term\n            Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The choice to embed the\n            specific conditionality of the Memorandum of Understanding\n            (MoU) in the project design is highly questionable, as its\n            costs far outweigh its potential benefits. The process of\n            restructuring does not need to await the MTR but should be\n            conducted as soon as there are signals that the DO may not\n            be achieved and/or the IP has the prospect of being\n            unsatisfactory. As referred to above, the attenuated\n            consultative process to restructuring may have been\n            inevitable. Defining and managing a robust approach to\n            'change management' is essential when dealing with\n            complex institutional reforms, and can help to maximize\n            returns at implementation stage. Given the complex and\n            difficult nature of cross sectoral public sector reforms,\n            such a diverse and extended sector nationally, a robust\n            'change management approach' was required to\n            galvanize participating actors around the efforts for\n            reform. The nexus of benefits to identified groups from the\n            reforms needs to be established in all cases. Funding of\n            non-state actors can be time-intensive and requires careful\n            planning, with good information, clear criteria to guide the\n            selection process and hands-on monitoring. This is necessary\n            to ensure that activities are well supervised and\n            strategically linked."}, "docdt": "2012-07-26T00:00:00Z"}
