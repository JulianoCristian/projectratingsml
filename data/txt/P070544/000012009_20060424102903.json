resources. This will\n            be achieved by improving the skills and systems to deliver\n            judicial/legal services and public financial management, and\n            strengthening the capacity of oversight and watchdog\n            institutions (OWIs) to perform their role. The program has\n            four components: 1) strengthening the legal and judicial\n            system; 2) enhancing public financial accountability; 3)\n            strengthening oversight and watchdog institutions; and, 4)\n            project coordination. To strengthen the legal and judicial\n            system, this first component consist of six sub-components\n            that will a) establish a harmonized national legal framework\n            by amending key legislation, streamlining processes, and\n            improving capacity for legal research, towards drafting the\n            law reform. Also included are improvements to the legal\n            environment for enhanced social justice, safety, and\n            economic development, focusing on accessible justice by the\n            poor and disadvantaged. Support will be provided to\n            strengthen research capacity, and studies on a national\n            legal framework. Moreover, improved governance and\n            administrative justice will be supported, specifically\n            within legal and judicial institutions, by enhancing\n            transparency in the administration of justice through\n            relevant interventions. To this end, improved skills and\n            knowledge for legal professionals will be fostered through\n            quality legal training, improved practical training skills\n            for law students, and improved capacity on continuing\n            education programs. An improved service delivery capacity in\n            key legal institutions will entail the provision of\n            organizational and support services, enhanced competence and\n            integrity personnel, and an improved working environment\n            (this includes infrastructure and civil works for office\n            facilities). The second component will enhance public\n            financial accountability, through improved capacity at the\n            Ministry of Finance, so as to achieve sound macroeconomic\n            and fiscal management, and, public financial management will\n            be improved at ministries and agencies to improved resources\n            on decision-making and accountability. The third component\n            will strengthen oversight and watchdog institutions,\n            particularly regarding crosscutting reforms, i.e.,\n            generating high quality information on government\n            performance and outcomes, focused on improving the ethical\n            environment. Finally, the fourth component will support\n            project coordination, i.e., monitoring and evaluation\n            activities, support concerning institutional structures, and\n            to information, communication, and education activities."}, "docdt": "2006-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
