                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         ATIP will contribute to improved access to judicial and legal services and in the accountable and transparent use of public financial resources. This will be
                         achieved by improving the skills and systems to deliver judicial/legal services and public financial management, and strengthening the capacity of oversight
                         and watchdog institutions (OWIs) to perform their role.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Two components of this project have been completed, namely component 2 on enhancing public financial accountability and component 3 on strengthening Oversight and Watchdog
                         Institutions (OWI). Implementation of component 1 on strengthening capacity of legal and judicial institutions that supports the government Legal Sector Reform Program (LSRP) is
                         still incomplete. This component was the main focus of the project restructuring that was completed in November 2010. Due to initial delays encountered in this component, it has not

                         been able to fully undertake planned activities. This fiscal year, a study on case flow management has been completed and the Judiciary plans to adopt its recommendations before
                         the end of the year to improve case management in the courts. The construction of the law school is more than 65% complete and is due for completion in February 2012.
                         Construction of 20 primary courts has not started and contracts have not been awarded. Government has committed to construct 10 of the planned primary courts using its own
                         resources. This component will suffer setbacks with the impending closure of the ATIP. The project has fully disbursed funds under component 2 amounting to US$ 10 million in

                         support of the government's Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP). Major components of the PFMRP have been completed, but government has extended the
                         program to close in June 2012, to allow adequate preparation of a successor program. The PFMRP has led to improvements in internal and external audit services, procurement
                         capacity, and in budget preparation and implementation. Measured in terms of the overall indicator for PFM performance, the number of MDAs with clean audit reports presented to
                         Parliament, has registered a decline from 86% in 2009 to 77% in 2010. This reflects some continued weaknesses in the public financial management system that have been
                         captured by strengthened capacity of external audit services. In strengthening the capacity of OWIs under component 3, ATIP has provided four rounds of grants to 39 grantees
                         including Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), three professional associations, and two state watchdog institutions. Progress of this component has been mixed largely due to
                         variable performance of grants to CSOs. The initial two rounds of grantees selection were based on a wider objective of strengthening demand side institutions, but following
                         restructuring of the project in November 2010, the focus has been limited to institutions that are involved in legal and judicial or public financial management reform. In 2011, the
                         component successfully supported the Procurement and Supplies Professionals Board to strengthen ethics compliance of its members. In addition it has supported 12 CSOs to
                         undertake simple Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys in local government authorities, demonstrating the importance of this approach to ensuring accountability of public funds and
                         creating awareness amongst citizens of government expenditures in service delivery.
