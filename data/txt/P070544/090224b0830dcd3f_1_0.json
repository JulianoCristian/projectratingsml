For the\n            last decade, Tanzania has sustained high economic growth\n            driven by structural reforms and improvements in economic\n            performance and service delivery. Growth in Gross Domestic\n            Product (GDP) has averaged between 5 and 7 percent a year\n            since 2000. Access to primary education has increased\n            dramatically, along with solid increases in net enrollment\n            rates. Under-five child mortality has declined by more than\n            a third since 2000. To assist Tanzania in meeting its\n            development goals, International Development Association\n            (IDU) will continue to actively coordinate with partners and\n            participate in the joint development dialogue with the\n            government. Going forward, the lending program will largely\n            focus on the infrastructure and human development sectors."}, "docdt": "2012-09-25T06:20:04Z"}
