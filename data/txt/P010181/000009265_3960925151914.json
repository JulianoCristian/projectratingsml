The project\n            achieved its main objectives, its impact has been\n            substantial, sustainability is likely, and the performance\n            of the Bank and Borrower was very satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, in the\n            future, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) should consider\n            issuing the No Objection Certificates (NOC) on the list of\n            equipment submitted by the project authority after the\n            approval of the project PC-1. Second, for projects involving\n            large procurement activities, the project authorities should\n            be encouraged to appoint a special procurement\n            officer/expediter from the start of project implementation.\n            Third, the GOP should let WAPDA (Water and Power Development\n            Authority) keep a certain percentage of its annual revenue\n            from the sale of electricity generated at the Tarbela and\n            Mangla Dams. Fourth, GOP/WAPDA should continue annual and\n            periodic dam safety inspections. Fifth, WAPDA should place\n            its best qualified and experienced engineers and technicians\n            on the O&M (Operation & Maintenance) and safety\n            monitoring of the three dams. Lastly, the Bank should\n            establish guidelines concerning the exchange of information\n            between parallel co-financiers and the Bank."}, "docdt": "1992-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
