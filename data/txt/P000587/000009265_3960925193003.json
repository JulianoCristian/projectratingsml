Services Project in Comoros. Agriculture dominates\n            the country's economy, providing employment to 80\n            percent of the population; contributing 40 percent to Gross\n            Domestic Product (GDP), as well as virtually all export\n            earnings. Agricultural production is almost entirely\n            concentrated in the smallholder sector. The country is\n            densely populated and, in order to meet basic family food\n            requirements, government's primary objective for the\n            agricultural sector has been to increase food self\n            sufficiency and reduce imports through productivity\n            improvements. The Federal Center for the Support to Rural\n            Development (CEFADER) had been set up as the agency to\n            implement the above objectives, but government envisaged for\n            it a large number of projects and a rapid expansion of\n            staff, thus creating serious complications as to its\n            absorptive capacity and recurrent cost budget. At the time\n            of project preparation, in 1982-83, the major donors who\n            cooperated at field level were well aware, as was CEFADER\n            management, of the need to consolidate activities into a\n            clear program of action and to ensure the government had the\n            budgetary capacity to continue activities once donor\n            financed projects came to an end. The need for\n            reorganization, for effective use, training and supervision\n            of staff, for budgetary management, and for coherent\n            planning within the rural services network, became an\n            important priority."}, "docdt": "1992-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
