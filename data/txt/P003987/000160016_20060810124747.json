Secondary Education Project; and Central Indonesia\n            and Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Projects all had\n            satisfactory outcomes. Their sustainability is likely, and\n            institutional development impact is substantial. Bank and\n            Borrower performances were also satisfactory. This\n            assessment confirms a number of lessons: 1) It is possible\n            to target successfully poor areas for interventions aimed at\n            increasing enrollments, even in times of financial crises.\n            Scholarships administered to the poor and disbursed to them\n            promptly may be effective in sustaining enrollments and\n            preventing dropout. 2) Community involvement may be a\n            cost-effective and reliable means to build and support\n            schools. Nevertheless, school committee members may not be\n            able or willing to keep school expenditures low, may not\n            have much time-to spend on school affairs, and may be unable\n            to advise the principal effectively on educational matters.\n            3) Decentralization promotes effective use of resources.\n            However, a central government may find it necessary to meet\n            the basic educational needs of the poorest communities\n            directly if national goals for basic education are to be\n            achieved. 4) International comparative assessments of\n            student achievement may provide critical feedback to\n            governments interested in increasing the competitiveness of\n            their human capital. They may also provide means to help\n            countries improve their performance."}, "docdt": "2006-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
