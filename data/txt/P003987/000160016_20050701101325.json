Some of the key lessons cited were the\n            following: 1) When school communities manage resources they\n            are likely to be used more efficiently and lead to greater\n            long term participation in school development. 2) Improving\n            learning outcomes is complex and teacher training on its own\n            will not bring it about. 3) Within the framework of\n            decentralization, the Central Government must have a role in\n            targeting strategies to address education needs if national\n            goals for basic education are to be achieved. 4) During\n            times of financial crisis, or political change, projects\n            should be designed with a view toward maximum flexibility,\n            and the potential for rapid restructuring as the need\n            arises. 5) There are advantages in cost effectiveness and\n            efficiency when several similar projects are funded\n            concurrently and managed as a single program rather than as\n            separate Projects. 6) Baseline data should always be\n            collected, documented in the Project Appraisal Document, and\n            agreed upon during project preparation. 7) The use of\n            contract teachers addresses issues of temporary teacher\n            shortage and the need to introduce increased flexibility\n            into the civil service.  8) Establishing a strongly staffed\n            and well managed project implementation unit is a key factor\n            to successful project implementation. 9) It took time for\n            schools to learn how to match the books and equipment they\n            ordered with actual student needs and the teachers'\n            ability to make effective use of them. 10) Systematic\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is critical to the\n            success of a project with widely dispersed project\n            activities and sites. 11) Geographical targeting of services\n            should be done on the basis of poverty. Estimates should be\n            made down to the village level. Also there should be a\n            pre-commitment to update the \"map\" each year -\n            thereby overcoming the static nature of most poverty map schemes."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
