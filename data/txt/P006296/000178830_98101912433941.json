Other objectives of\n            the project include: increasing the project area's\n            contribution to the local and state food supplies and to\n            export earnings, and improving the technical and\n            administrative capacities of agencies involved in\n            agriculture and rural development in Sergipe State. To\n            achieve these ends, the project provides for the\n            strengthening of agricultural and social support services\n            and infrastructure, rural credit, the establishment of\n            agricultural settlements, and the institutional development\n            of the main local executing agencies. The main risk faced by\n            the project is that of not achieving active participation by\n            and adequate coordination among, the various participating\n            agencies. However, a special Project Administration Unit is\n            already established, and arrangements would be made by the\n            State to ensure a more direct involvement of the\n            participating agencies in annual project planning. Potential\n            project management problems would also be reduced by such\n            safeguards as annual reviews of the implementation program\n            of each participating agency."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
