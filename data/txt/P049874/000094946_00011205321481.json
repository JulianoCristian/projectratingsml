The project consists of\n            three components: 1) The technical learning in firms\n            component will focus on building the technical capabilities\n            of majority Mozambican-owned firms in manufacturing and\n            exports. The component will support the establishments of\n            the Firm Competitiveness Office, Training and Advisory\n            Office, and Linkage Program Office. All three foster\n            technical learning through the private marketplace. 2) Under\n            the finance component, two financial products will be\n            available for firms in all sectors -- a special facility\n            designed to provide small, first-time bank borrowers with\n            loans amounting to a maximum of $15,000; and a traditional\n            facility to finance loans up to $300,000 for small and\n            medium-scale borrowers. 3) The institutional capacity\n            building component will enhance the capabilities of private\n            and public institutions to deliver business support\n            services; and support Government agencies in their\n            transformation process from maintaining control functions to\n            providing business facilitation and promotion services,\n            including improving their capability to identify and ease\n            bureaucratic rigidities."}, "docdt": "1999-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
