The Bank's\n            financial supervision of projects can be strengthened by\n            escalating early on accounting or financial errors that\n            appear to be of a systemic nature and ensuring that\n            financial management addresses any identified weaknesses.\n            Transition and post-completion arrangements should be\n            planned well in advance of project closing.
