Based on\n            these impact studies, this environmental assessment has been\n            prepared to comply with project appraisal requirements of\n            the World Bank and is organized into the following seven\n            chapters: 1) project description; 2) environmental and\n            social impact assessment framework; 3) existing\n            environmental and social conditions; 4) significant\n            environmental impacts; 5) analysis of alternatives; 6)\n            environmental impact management and monitoring; and 7)\n            social impact management and monitoring."}, "docdt": "1995-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
