objectives of the Strategic Urban\n            Roads Infrastructure Project are to: 1) reduce traffic\n            bottlenecks on the national roads in selected urban areas in\n            the North Java corridor; 2) address the environmental and\n            social issues associated with the increased usage of the\n            national road network in these urban areas; 3) assist the\n            government of Indonesia (GOI) in the process of\n            decentralizing responsibility for the planning, design,\n            construction, maintenance, management and regulation of\n            urban transport from central to local government as set out\n            in recent government regulations; 4) strengthen technical\n            and institutional capabilities, particularly with respect to\n            dealing with environmental and social issues, of GOI's\n            central and local government agencies involved in urban road\n            development and management; and 5) assist GOI in the\n            formulation, articulation and implementation of urban\n            transport policy. The project comprises the following five\n            components: 1) road construction; 2) urban management and\n            quality of life improvements; 3) institutional and human\n            resource development; 4) GOI urban road program development;\n            and 5) policy articulation and implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
