                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is to enhance the efficiency, transparency and accountability of justice sector institutions. This objective will be achieved
                         by assisting the Government of Mongolia to mainstream and scale-up the results achieved, and lessons learned, through the Mongolia Legal and Judicial
                         Reform Project (LJRP). In order to achieve the goals of transparency and accountability the following areas will be supported under the project: (i) Enhancing
                         public legal education on the justice sector (ii) Increasing transparency through improved access to legal information (iii) Enhancing judicial operations,
                         enforcement and monitoring of court decisions.

                         The key outcome indicators which will be used to measure success are: (i) Information on enforcement of court decisions is available and shared between the
                         Court Enforcement Agency and the General Council of Courts (ii) Discrepancies between statistical information provided by Court Enforcement Agency and
                         General Council of Courts is shared and reduced (iii) Improvement in level of court decisions enforced.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The October 2011 visit by the Bank team recognized significant efforts by the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs in relation to improved project implementation. Bidding processes
                         were completed for construction of new buildings for Court Decision Enforcement Agencies, and General Council of Court buildings, and civil works were undertaken beginning in
                         September 2011. In addition, the subcomponents on access to justice for minorities have had significant impact, either through consultations, written representations or advocacy
                         services before courts. The types of cases dealt with were extremely varied ranging from land and bankruptcy disputes, loan collection, to discrimination in education provision. In
                         2012, work will begin on an assignment for a fiber optic network for the courts, aimed at increasing connectivity and facilitating exchange of key information.
