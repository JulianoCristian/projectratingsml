                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With a new government in place, a new minister has been appointed and all project counterparts at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) which implement this project have changed. Some
                         key counterparts at other beneficiary agencies, i.e., the General Council of Courts (GCC), the administrative courts, the participating law schools and legal aid centers remain
                         unchanged and continue activities as planned, others, such as at the Court Decision Enforcement Agency (CDEA) were changed just recently in October 2012. Overall, the project

                         continues to make good progress. Initial discussions with the newly appointed minister and ministry staff indicate continued support for the ongoing project activities. The MoJ also
                         indicated that some of the new activities planned in support of the President's significant reform plans are building upon prior Bank-supported work. All counterparts were equally
                         open to discussing the few remaining delays in implementation, finding solutions to address these and thinking about implications of legislative and other changes and that may
                         impact project success and sustainability in the near future.

                         Since the last supervision mission, the project has made substantial progress in a number of areas and is beginning to show some positive results. Over the last year, disbursement
                         rates have increased from 6% to 61%. The increase in disbursement is largely due to the start (and finalizing) of construction activities but also a result of most other activities being
                         on target. Good progress is being made in relation to public legal education and legal assistance to the poor in Bayan Ulgii as well as support to legal clinics who provide legal
                         services to the poor in UB. Assistance to enhance law school capacities is also progressing. Construction work on all 4 new court buildings has been completed, the 4th building was
                         reviewed by the State Technical Commission and accepted on October 30, 2012. Only the refurbishment of the court building in the Umnugovi Aimag remains in construction status
                         and has not been finalized as planned since May 2012 since the contractor refuses completing the contract. The Borrower is aware of this issue and is taking several steps to
                         address a problem that is not unique to this project. Since the construction period in Mongolia has ended, the company requested permission to complete the remaining works in
                         spring 2013. The request is currently with the GCC to develop an official response. 2 of the 3 Court Decision Enforcement Agency (CDEA) buildings have been completed. 70% of
                         the construction work of the remaining building (Bulgan Aimag) has been completed. Since the construction period in Mongolia has ended, the outstanding construction work is
                         scheduled to be finished by May 30, 2013.
                         Some progress has been made since the last supervision mission in ensuring that procurement of two important software applications and a fiber optic network can be completed in
                         time after suffering significant delays.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Based on what has been achieved in terms of both substantive outputs and outcomes since the last supervision mission, and despite slow progress in capturing all needed data for
                         the M&E framework and some delays in procurement, the project is still be considered as moderately satisfactory on both "Progress towards achievement of PDO" and "Overall
                         Implementation Progress (IP)". The borrower is taking steps to address the remaining issues. Currently no extension is considered.
