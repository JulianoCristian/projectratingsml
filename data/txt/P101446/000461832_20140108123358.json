Significant lessons learned during the\n            implementation of the project are: 1) a holistic approach is\n            difficult to implement but also more effective in creating\n            sustainable change across the sector; 2) good and broad\n            stakeholder involvement throughout implementation ensures\n            not only that the design is a good fit but develops\n            ownership and capacities beyond the targeted activities; 3)\n            actual change in agency operations and justice outcomes are\n            largely dependent on changes in institutional culture; 4)\n            great care needs to be taken when crafting a results\n            monitoring framework during appraisal; 5) legal covenants\n            are no replacement for project-relevant preparedness; 6)\n            infrastructure components not only require a lot of time for\n            planning, architectural services, site reviews and\n            procurement, they also require both specific expertise for\n            preparation and implementation and a budget to provide this\n            expertise; and 7) adequate staffing needs to be reflected in\n            the design and capacity gaps need to be addressed early on."}, "docdt": "2013-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
