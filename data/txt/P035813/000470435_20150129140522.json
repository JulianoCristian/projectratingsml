Since independence in 1991 however,\n            unemployment has soared in Azerbaijan and today half of the\n            country's population relies on the agricultural sector\n            for their livelihood, including many who are new to farming.\n            In Ganja District, in the west of the country, families with\n            an average of five people depend on two or three hectares of\n            land. Optimal output on these farms is therefore vital for\n            these families to survive; however many are inexperienced\n            farmers. In order to address this problem, the World\n            Bank-funded Agricultural Development and Credit Project (\n            ADCP) has supported, among other components, the\n            establishment of regional advisory services for farmers.\n            Ganja Business Group (GBG) was contracted by the project in\n            2002 to provide farmers in the western provinces of the\n            country with information on everything from seed quality and\n            pest control to cattle breeding and product packaging. A\n            survey of over 2,000 farmers in the region provided the GBG\n            with an understanding of what concerns needed to be addressed."}, "docdt": "2006-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
