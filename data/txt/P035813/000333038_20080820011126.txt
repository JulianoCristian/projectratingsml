 IEGWB Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellenceand independencein evaluation.


About this Report
      The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programsandactivitiesof the World Bankfor two purposes:
first,to ensurethe integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation processand to verify that the Bank's work is producingthe
expected results, and second,to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthroughthe
dissemination of lessons drawnfrom experience. As partof this work, IEGWBannually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lendingoperations through fieldwork. Inselecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; thosethat are relevantto upcomingstudiesor country evaluations; those for
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report(PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents,interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountryto discuss the operationwith the government,
and other in-countrystakeholders,and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquartersand
in localoffices as appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review,and managementapproval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commented on by the responsibleBank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe comments as
relevant.The completedPPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'comments are attachedto
the documentthat is sent to the Bank's Boardof ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has beensent to
the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

About the IEGWB RatingSystem
      IEGWB's useof multipleevaluationmethods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lendinginstrument,projectdesign, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluatorsall apply the same basic methodto
arrive at their projectratings. Followingis the definitionand ratingscale used for each evaluation criterion
(additionalinformationis availableon the IEGWBwebsite: httD:/Avorldbank.ora/ieq).
      Outcome: The extentto which the operation's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto be
achieved,efficiently. The rating has three dimensions:relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevanceincludes
relevanceof objectives and relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectivesare consistentwith the country's current developmentpriorities andwith current Bankcountryand
sectoral assistancestrategiesand corporategoals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies,Sector StrategyPapers, OperationalPolicies). Relevanceof design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistentwith the stated objectives. Efficacyis the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,taking into accounttheir relative importance. Efficiencyis the
extentto which the project achieved,or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the opportunitycost of capital
and benefitsat least cost comparedto alternatives.The efficiencydimensiongenerally is not applied to adjustment
operations.Possibleratingsfor Outcome: HighlySatisfactory,Satisfactory,ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation,that developmentoutcomes(or expected
outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized).Possibleratingsfor Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
      BankPerformance: The extentto which services providedby the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operationand supportedeffective implementationthrough appropriatesupervision (including ensuringadequate
transition arrangementsfor regularoperation of supportedactivities after loanlcreditclosing, toward the
achievementof developmentoutcomes.The rating has two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratingsfor Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance: The extentto which the borrower (includingthe governmentand implementing
agency or agencies)ensuredquality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenantsand
agreements, toward the achievementof developmentoutcomes.The rating has two dimensions:government
performanceand implementingagency(ies) performance.Possibleratingsfor BorrowerPerformance: Highly

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) o ftwo projects inthe Republic
o f Azerbaijan: the FarmPrivatization Project (FPP) andthe Agricultural Development and
Credit Project (ADCP).

The FPPwas approved on January 16,1997 andreceived an IDA Credit (Credit 2933) o f
$14.7 million equivalent. At project closure $13.4 million equivalent or 90 percent of the
original credit hadbeen disbursed, and $0.2 millionwas cancelled. The project was closed in
December 2003, 18 months behind schedule.

The ADCP was approved on June 8, 1999 andreceivedan IDA Credit (Credit 3236) o f $30.0
million. At project closure $31.lmillion hadbeen disbursed and $0.06 million was cancelled.
The project was closed inJune 2006,30 months behind schedule.

The report presents IEGfindings based on review o f the projects' implementation completion
reports, appraisal reports, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant material. An
IEGmissionto Azerbaijan inOctoberhTovember 2007 visited project sites andheld
discussions with government officials and agencies, project directors and staff, beneficiaries,
the private sector, key donors andNGOs. The advice and help received from all persons met
is greatly appreciated.

The projects were chosen for assessment because, betweenthem, they piloted a fundamental
landreformprogramthat equitably distributedthe ex-Soviet system's state andcollective
lands to individual families, and developed private sector agricultural extension and other
rural services. Other ex-Soviet countries also undertook land reforms, but inmost cases the
reforms were partial. Thus, the assessment o f FPP andADCP provides lessons both for
Azerbaijan's future agricultural reformprogram and for the general interest o f other ex-
Soviet countries. This PPAR also provides case-study material for a forthcoming review by
IEGo fthe World Bank's global experience with landreforms. The PPAR adopts a results-
based approach, reviewing the projects ina broader sectoral context.

Comments on the draft from the Bank's Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region have been

Summary

This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews two projects that supported
Azerbaijan's comprehensive land and agricultural reform program. Between them the
projects pioneeredAzerbaijan's reformprogram over its first ten years (1997 - 2006). The
Farm Privatization Project (FPP, 1997-2003) was a pilot operation. Its objective was to
accelerate the Government's program for landprivatization and farm restructuring o f
representative state and collective farms ina systematic manner to provide models which
could serve as a basis for wider geographic replicability and subsequent development o f a
national program. On six ex-Soviet collective farms indifferent regions, the landwas
distributedto individual families, agricultural extension andcredit services were initiated,
.andirrigation was rehabilitated.

The Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCP, 1999-2006) was the first phase o f
a three-phase Adjustable Program Loan. ADCP sought to raise agricultural productivity by
consolidating the landreform, agricultural extension andcredit elements o f FPP, covering a
wider geographic area. Bank support to this program i s continuing under ADCP I1and other
relatedprojects.

The FPP's Outcome was Satisfactory. The project was highlyrelevant because nothing short
o fradical reform made sense. By 1995 agriculturalproductivity had fallen bynearly 50
percent from the already low productivity o f Soviet era farming. Input and output markets
had collapsed, technical expertise had dissipated, credit had evaporated, irrigation was in
disrepair, and farmingwas still collective, with little incentive for improvement. All o f FPP's
main activities achieved their physical targets. The project's greatest contribution was the
establishment o f models to guide the broader reform process. Agricultural extension, credit,
andwater user associations were created for the first time inAzerbaijan. The landreform
achievements were remarkable. In 1997, less than two years into project implementation,
Government decidedto scale up landprivatizationnationwide. By2001,two years before
FPP closed, some 95 percent o fAzerbaijan's agricultural landhadbeendivided upinto
private family farms. Data deficiencies due to inadequate M&E preclude estimation o f an
economic rate o freturn, althoughproxy indicators suggest positive economic impact. Risk to
Development Outcome i s rated Moderate. The reform is unlikely to be reversed and the only
significant risk is the sustainability o firrigation-water user associations need to collect
more funds to finance operation andmaintenance. The Bank'sperformance is rated
Satisfactory. Other than the M&Earrangements, the project was well designed, and, during
preparationand supervision, the Bank provided cutting edge expertise, andmotivation and
advice to guide the reform program. The Borrower's Perjbmance is rated Highly
Satisfactory. Government was fully committed to reform, the nation's most senior political
leaders were effective champions, andthe implementing agencies were largely effective.

The ADCP's Outcome is rated Satisfactory. Its objective o f consolidating the reform
programandenhancing agricultural productivity was highlyrelevant, andthe project's
physical targets were met. As with FPP, incomplete data due to weak M&Epreclude
estimation o f an economic rate o freturn, although alternative indicators suggest positive
economic impact. ADCP's most significant achievements were to develop private

agricultural extension services and to establish field offices for recording land transactions.
The ADCP also pioneeredfarmer credit unions and informal borrower groups. However, the
credit apex agency was ineffective, partlydue to the decision at project design that it should
contribute 20 percent o fits own capital to investments. The agency became risk-averse and
paidlittle attention to developing farmer institutions. Risk to Development Outcome is rated
Significant, mainlybecause a problem-free model for the credit program i s yet to be found.
Bankperformance was Satisfactory.Quality at entry was good.except for the farmer credit
management arrangements and design o fM&E. Duringsupervision, the reformist and
collegiate partnership with Government established under FPP continued. The Borrower's
performance is also rated Satisfactory. Government continued to champion the reform
program, and, except for the credit agency andimplementation o f M&E, the implementing
agencies performed well.

The two projects are significant because-compared to the other 11Commonwealth o f
Independent States countries that emerged from the 1989 break-up o f the Soviet Union-the
landreform that FPP andADCP supported was more sweeping. All 12 CIS countries
declared Independence at the same time (1991), all shared the Soviet heritage o f state-
managed collective farms, and all attempted some degree o f landreform from the early to
mid-1990sonwards. Butthere are differences betweenthe countries inthe reformpaths
chosen and the progress made.

Azerbaijan adopted a broad-based landprivatizationagenda. Landwas transferred from the
collectives to fully autonomous privately ownedholdings-common practices elsewhere
were leasing o f landby the state or imposition o f crop production quotas. Also, landin
Azerbaijan was distributed to individualfamilies rather than to corporate or cooperative
farms-a     commonpractice inother CIS countries. Such multi-family enterprises have tended
to differ little from the collectives they were meant to replace. Additionally, landwas hlly
transferable andcould be sold, rentedor leasedwithout restrictions (not the case insome CIS
countries). Landreform was alsopackagedwith provision o f agricultural extension and
credit. Another feature was that landwas privatizedrapidly-at a single strokerather than
through intermediate steps (which might become permanent rather thantemporary
arrangements). Finally, landwas shared out evenly via transparent lottery, all persons
receiving equal areas.

Azerbaijan's agricultural productivity has increased, although it is impossible to attribute
how much this was driven by the Bank-supportedprojects. Data are weak and inconsistent
between sources. ADCP project farmers increased yields by 30-40 percent infour years
(2002-06) while the yields o fnon-project farmers increased by only 10-15 percent.
Nationwide data from 1994-96 (before landwas privatized) to 2003-05 show a more than 50
percent increase incereal yields, and rapid expansion o fhigh-value horticultural crops. The
productivity o fthe new family farms is twice that of corporate farms. The agricultural
productivity increases inAzerbaijan closely follow the progress o f landprivatization
corroborating the views o f farmers on the benefits from the landreforms.

The assessment o f these projects suggeststhe following lessons o fbroad application:

                                                x i


1.      Azerbaijan's largely successful landreform program has been characterized by full
and individualized (ownership by families) privatizationo f land, a package approach
combining agricultural services with landreform, and a rapid and single-step change rather
thangradual or phasedimplementation.While the great diversity o fexperience across
countries indicates that there is no uniquely right landreform model, Azerbaijan's approach
i s an option for other countries to consider.

2.      Equitable land distribution andaccess to agricultural support services helps to ensure
that vulnerable groups such as women and the poor share inthe benefits from landreform.
Byfar themost important action for social inclusionwas the distributiono fcollective lands
equally and transparently. For support services, Azerbaijan offers equal access to extension,
training andcredit-but    more effort i s neededto encourage women and poor people to take
advantage o f the available services.

3.      The reformprocess i s critical for determiningwhether land reform works. In
Azerbaijan's case, client focus, transparency and stakeholder involvement were central to
reform implementation, and a learning-oriented andinnovative culture was fostered.
Privatizedservice delivery reducedrequirements for extra government staff.

4.      Landreform needspowerful champions to succeed. Exceptionalcommitment by
champions inthe Government and the Bank were critical to the success under the projects
evaluated here.

  1. BackgroundandContext

  Overview

  1.1        This assessmentfocuses on the first two agriculturalprojects that the Bank
  supported inAzerbaijan. The Farm Privatization Project (FPP), and the Agricultural
  Development andCredit Project (ADCP) were the pilot vehicles for launching a land-based
  agricultural reformprogram that has been amongst the most far-reaching o f any o fthe
  countries that were formerly part o fthe Soviet Union. Landprivatizationwas used to create
  individually-owned family farms, with land shared out equally between claimants. This
  reform was carried out swiftly andwas accompanied bymeasures to provide extension and
- credit and to rehabilitate irrigation, where possible usingprivate suppliers. This posed an
  enormous challenge: the number o fproductionunits went from about 2,000 collectives' to
  about one millionprivate family farms2, eachneeding support services.

  DevelopmentContext

  1.2         Azerbaijan i s one o f 12 sovereign nations that, in 1991, declared Independence
  following the break-up o f the Soviet Union in 1989.3Like the other Commonwealth o f
  Independent States (CIS) nations, Azerbaijan experienced an initialperiod o fmajor
  disruptions causedbythe progressive collapse o f the Soviet-inherited command-economy.
  Duringthis periodper capitaGDPdeclinedannually reachingapost-independence low o f
  $470 in 1995, less than 40 percent o fper capita income inthe Soviet period. The economy
  was then transformed, mainly on the back o f oil and gas discoveries. Average per capita
  income more than doubled, reaching $1,240 in2005.

  1.3         The oil-sector has not greatly improved social welfare, partly because it employs
  only 2 percent o fthe labor force. Oilrevenues have fueled inflation, resulting inhigher prices
  for consumers and higherproduction costs, not least for farmers. The oil boom i s expected to
  peak in2010. Thereafter overall growth o f the economy will increasingly depend on the
  performance o f other sectors, not least o f agriculture. The sector currently contributes 10to
  15 percent o f GDP and, particularly significant, employs 45 percent o fthe country's work-
  force.

  1.4         Under the Soviet model agriculture was dominatedby large, state-managed
  collective farms, with prescribed productiontargets, minimal market incentives, government-
  determined and delivered inputs, limitedinnovation inproduction systems, and
  predeterminedoutput markets and prices. Agricultural productivity was low to begin with

  1. There were some "state" managed farms as well as "collectively" managedfarms, which were also
  substantially state-managed. For convenience, state farms will also be referred to as collective farms.
  2. Nearly all o f the privatized landis individually ownedby farmers. About 2 percent o f gross agricultural
  production is from agricultural enterprises rather than family farms (Statistical Committee o fthe CIS, 2003).
  The FPP andADCP and(except where statedotherwise) this report deal only with the individualized farms.
  3. The other Commonwealth o fIndependent States countries are: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
  Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine andUzbekistan.

                                                      2


and deteriorated further after the break-up o f the Soviet Union, falling to less thanhalfpre-
Independence levels. Inputand output markets collapsed; technical assistance and sources o f
finance dried up; and essential rural infrastructure (particularly irrigation works which
support about three-quarters o f agriculturalproduction) were no longer maintainedby the
state and deteriorated.

1.5        By 1995 agricultural value-added had fallento 55 percent o fthe level in 1990 (at
constant prices). But the country was slow to develop a new agricultural strategy. Inthe early
years, policy-making remained inthe socialist mold and, up until 1994, the conflicts with
Armenia were a continuing source o f disruption.

1.6        Despite the formidable institutional obstacles, Azerbaijan has significant
agricultural potential. Soils are generally fertile. The irrigation network (although inneed o f
rehabilitation) i s extensive (69 percent o f cropped land).Agro-climatic zones range from
temperate to Mediterranean, and from humidto semi-arid, enabling production o f a wide
diversity o fvegetables, h i t s , field crops and livestock. Export potential o f fresh produce to
neighboring countries i s considerable once effective marketing chains are established, as i s
the potential for agro-processing. With a highliteracy rate- 97 percent o fthe adult
population andlittle difference betweenmen andwomen -the rural population provides a
solid foundation for agricultural growth.

1.7        The diversity o f Azerbaijan's agricultural sector forms a good base for accelerated
growths4About 57 percent o f the country's land area is cultivated, halfunder crops and the
remainder under pasture. About 42 percent o f cropped landis under cereal^.^ Wheat
dominates followed bybarley andmaize. Major diversification is takingplace, especially to
vegetables andpotatoes for which cropped area has tripled over the period 1992-2005.
Livestock production has increased bymore than 50 percent inthe same period. Fodder crop
areas are also increasing. Limited growth andjob opportunities inthe cities has resulted inan
increasingpercentage o fthe population residing inrural areas- from 46 percent o f the total
population in 1990 to 48 percent in2006. With small farms and relatively abundant family
labor, the farming sector may be able to respondwell to the improved incentives from land
ownership.

LandReforminRegionalPerspective

1.8        All o fthe CIS countries undertook landreforms. Insome casesreforms beganinthe
early 1990s (e.g. Kazakhstan), but for most countries significant actions commencedinthe
mid-1990s. Azerbaijan was typical inthis respect, commencing landdistribution in 1996.
Azerbaijan stands out, however, inthe extent o f its reforms. Although the results o f a land
reformprogram are what ultimately matter (Section 3) the main features o f Azerbaijan's


4. Data from World Development Indicators, 2008, WorldBank andFA0 statistics.
5. Wheat is Azerbaijan's dominant crop with about 600,000 hectares. Other cereals are barley (155,000
hectares) and maize(32,000 hectares). Cotton and fruit trees usedto be major crops assuredbythe Soviet
marketsandproduction instructionsto the collectives, but areas have since plummeted. Cotton area has fallen
from224,000 hectares inthe 1992-94period to 86,000 hectares in2003-05. Fruitcrop areahas fallen from
238,000 hectares (1992-94) to 88,000 hectares in2003-05.

program- full privatization andtransferability o f land-were close to the ideal model for
landreform cited inthe literature.6

1.9        Table 1provides a comparison o fthe extent o freform ineach o f the CIS countries.
Azerbaijan is one o fthe three top-scoring countries. About halfo f CIS countries allocated
"shares" to land, rather than actual land, and only a few countries have transferable land
rights. Also, "privatization" can be more nominal thanreal.7 Collectives mightbecome
"corporations", "cooperatives" or receive other titles, but inpractice remain communally
managed.8

1.10       Incontrast to most CIS countries, Azerbaijan's landreform embraced four catalytic
elements: comprehensive land tenure arrangements; landtenure and agricultural support
services; a big-bang approach; and transparent landallocationprocedures to ensure equity.
Azerbaijan's landreform involved:

         Land to be privately owned.
         Individual rather than collective or corporate farms.
         Transferable ownership.


1.11       A PackageApproach: Another feature o fAzerbaijan's reformprogramwas that it
was seen as an integrated reform program, combining landreform with reform o f agricultural
support services - inparticular, agricultural extension and credit services and rehabilitation
o firrigation. A better term for the reform program inAzerbaijan would be that it was a
"Land-Based Agricultural Reform" program, rather than "Land Reform" by itself. At that
time, literature on agrarian reform inthe CIS countries tended to place lower emphasis on the
non-land aspects o f agricultural reform.'
1.12       A "Leap": not a"Transition": Privatizationwas executed swiftly. In1997, while
privatization was stillbeing completed on the 6 pilot collectives coveredby FPP, the
Government rolled out a nationwide program o f landprivatization. By 2001 some 95 percent

7. e.g. Leaseholds rather than fullownership; retaining staterightsto interfere infarmer decisions such as what
crops to grow; initial issuance o f share certificates specifying a landright without identification o fthe specific
landparcel that is owned - such share "ownership" tends to persist rather than move to a next step.

2004.
9. The complementary links between landreformand agricultural support services, however, are well
recognized inthe designs o f Bank landreformrelatedprojects inthe Europe and Central Asia (ECA) countries
since the mid-1990s. The Russia LandReformImplementation Support Project and its twin, the Agricultural
ReformImplementation Support Project (both FY94); the Tajikistan FarmPrivatization Support Project
(FY99); the KazakhstanReal Estate RegistrationPilot Project andAgricultural Post-Privatization Assistance
Project (both FY98); andthe Armenia Title RegistrationProject (FY99) all followed a package approach (using
one or two projects). IEG's review o f "Agriculture Policy Reforminthe ECA Transition Economies, 1991-
2002" (2003) commented that "Substantial support services are neededto make restructuring work and it is the
relative absenceo fthese inCIS countries which helpsexplain why the sub-region lags behindthe Central and
Eastern Europe countries."

                                                            4


o f the country's agricultural landwas owned byprivate family farmers. Each collective had
beenprivatized inone step - from the commune straight to private family ownership. The
frequently used reference to "transition" o f land reform inthe ex-Soviet countries was, in
Azerbaijan's case, more o f a "leap."

1.13         EquitableLandAllocation:Azerbaijan's landdistribution process was egalitarian.
Land from each collective was allocated to localpeople on the basis o f equal amounts per
person, irrespective o f age, gender, income or social status. For each collective, there were
extensive community discussions leading to a general understanding o f individual rights and
how the allocationprocess would be managed. Allocation o f landparcels was then bypublic
lottery, preempting the possibility o f "rigged" outcomes.

2.        Project Objectives and Design

The FarmPrivatizationProject

2.1          FPP's Overall Development Objective was to accelerate Government's program for
landprivatization and farmrestructuringo frepresentative state andcollective farms ina
systematic manner andto provide models which could serve as a basis for wider geographic
replicability. The underlying intention was that the project would form the basis for
subsequent development o f a nationalprogram. There were six specific objectives:
development o f (i)        land registration; (ii) information and advisory services; and (iii)
                                                      farm

                                                 5


credit services; (iv) rehabilitation o f irrigation and drainage infrastructure; (v) creation o f an
enabling environment to buildlinkages between key institutions; and(vi) development o f
community based services insupport o f landprivatization and farm restructuring. There was
a corresponding project component for each o f these specific objectives, as shown inTable 2,
along with component costs.

2.2        FPPwas apilot project covering one former collective farm ineach o f6 raions
(districts), chosen to providebroad regional coverage. Country coverage was very small
relative to Azerbaijan's total number o f raions (66) and former collectives (about 2000), but
the impact o fthe pilot as an initial testing ground for Azerbaijan's agricultural reforms was
potentially large. Azerbaijan needed to make a radical departure from the failed Soviet
system, anda successful pilot would provide a model for reform, setting the stage for roll-out
nationwide. Inparticular, FPP, joined by ADCP, would pioneer three main agricultural
development thrusts: the landprivatizationprogram itself, and two key agricultural services -
agricultural extension, and credit. Irrigationrehabilitation was also an important component
of FPP.

The AgriculturalDevelopmentand Credit Project

2.3        The ADCP was the first parto f a three-phase Adaptable ProgramLoan (APL).

2.4        The overall development objective o fthe program as a whole was to: return
Azerbaijan 'sfarming areas toformer levels ofproductivity under a new system characterized
byprivatefamily andgroupfarms operating inprivate markets. Theobjective of ADCP was
that: privatefamily andgroupfarms and otherprivate rural entrepreneurs begin to: (i)
register land transactions in large numbers; (ii) use information and advisory services; and
(iii) expand investment in theirfarms and other rural businesses; and (iv) that government
capacity be built toformulate policy to improve the competitivenessof the rural economy.

2.5        ADCP was on a larger scale thanFPP. Five areas for field implementationwere
chosen, with broad geographic coverage andrepresenting different climatic andsocial
conditions. ADCP's landreformprogram was to complete the nationalcoverage for land
titling, andintroduce systemsfor recordinglandtransactions, anecessaryadjunct for aprivate
landmarket. For agricultural extension, the aimwas to strengthen field advisory andtraining
services, promote applied researchthrough a competitive grants scheme, andprovide
agriculturalinformationservices nationally, usingTV and other media. For the thirdmain
activity - rural finance - credit services were to be decentralized through credit unions and
informal borrower groups, andto be supported by a centrally managedline ofcredit. The
private sector would be used extensively for agricultural extension, training andinformation
services, for applied research, and for veterinary services.

InstitutionalArrangements

2.6        The organizational arrangements o f FPP andADCP were substantially similar at
central levels andinthe main line ministries involved. A Project Management Unitunder the
MinistryofAgriculture was established for FPP, andwas chargedwith centralcoordination
of the project, planning andprocurement. Later, this also took on the same function for

                                                 6


ADCP andhas now evolved (under the name "State Agency for Agricultural Credits") to a
general coordination unit for all externally funded agricultural projects, but containing a
specific PIUfor the ADCP program. Fieldimplementation activities for FPP and ADCP
came under the line ministries and agencies concerned. The primary agencies were the
Ministry o f Agriculture, State LandCommittee, Agrarian ReformCommission, the State
Land and Cartography Committee, State Irrigation Committee, Agroprombank (for FPP),
State Veterinary Service (for ADCP), and an "Implementing Agency" for ADCP's credit
program. Ineach district covered by the projects there was also a "Project Implementation
Unit"whichcomprisedamember from eachofthe agencies involvedwiththe project. The
centralPMUand the district PIUs were effective, andthe line agencies also performed well,
after hesitant starts insome cases (e.g. Agroprombank, paragraph 3.19). The only
significantly poor performer was ADCP's credit ImplementingAgency (paragraph 3.2 1).

MonitoringandEvaluation

2.7        Bothprojects were Designedto include surveys to measure project outcomes.
Several surveys, such as the FPP's 2003 Beneficiary Survey and some o f ADCP's impact
assessments, were undoubtedly useful, especially inassessingless quantitative outcomes
such as farmer views on the benefits from different project components. However, systematic
M&Eprograms alignedto measuringthe degree to which the projects' development
objectives were attained were only partially developed. For FPP, the PAD designated the
PMUto beresponsible for M&E, butwithout guidance on how M&E was to be done. There
were monitorable indicators including "input" type data such as number o f landtitles issued,
and"output" indicators such as crop yields. But "outcomes" such as farm incomes were
sparse. The PMUfor ADCP was also to be charged with M&E, but details on M&E
implementation were not provided. The PAD did, however, contain an (overly) detailed
listing o fmonitorable indicators, but, like FPP, mostly on inputs and outputs.

2.8        Implementationo fM&Econtinuedto under-represent outcome indicators. In
particular, data to measure the projects' fundamental outcomes-to     increase agricultural
yields, productivity and incomes-were      patchy, and sources are not adequately cited.
However, each project, especially ADCP, had occasional consultants' surveys, mostly on
social impact andbeneficiary attitudes, providing indirect indications o f outcomes.

2.9        This has limitedthe Utilizationo f M&Edata. For instance, for the purposes o fthis
assessment, the projects' productivity impacts are difficult to assess. Nevertheless,
Management Information System type data was collectedbycomponent and field-based
managements, andwas collated by the PMU. The ADCP project management commented to
the mission that this MIS data, needed to inform project implementationdecisions, was
adequate andtimely. This information, however, falls short o fmeasuringthe broader
outcomes and impacts o fthe projects; which were only partlycaptured bythe consultants'
surveys. The overall quality o fM&Eis rated Negligiblefor bothprojects. Although some o f
the survey information i s useful, M&E data were, overall, inadequate to estimate economic
rates o freturn for the projects (para 4.14). This is a major gap, inparticular for a pilot project
where an understanding o f impacts and outcomes are important for decisions on scaling up

                                                                7


2.10           The startmadeunderADCP 11,with a specific M&Eunit developing amore
systematic approach, appears more promising. Supplementing this, an independentmajor
survey ofthe FPP/ADCP outcometo date could provide a firmer base for movingthe program
forwards. M&Ealso needs to be seen as aninstitutionalized andcontinuouspart ofthe reform
program's management, rather than an activitythat is disbandedat the endo feachproject.

3.      MainProject Results

LandReform

3.1        FPP: The initialproject objective was limitedto land distribution andregistration
for FPP's six pilot collective farms (occupying an area o f4800 ha), small enoughto be
manageablebut allowing for adequate coverage of variations inlanduse and scale. Land
titling at the six pilot sites was completedby mid 1998,just 18months after Board approval.
Some 6645 families were provided with individual landtitles (comparedwith atarget o f
4800 titles).

3.2        Most FPP farmers interviewedby the IEGmission hadapositive view of the land
privatization process." The distribution of equal landareas to all persons, regardlessof age,
social position, gender or other factors, andthe lotteryprocessof allocating land, were
generally consideredccfairy'.This view i s corroborated inthe FPP's Beneficiary Survey
(2003). The survey found that some 95 percent o fFPP farmers consideredthat the land
allocation processhadprovided themwith "a property share o fthe same or better average
value as others."" Positive views (on the national landreformprogram) were also expressed
byADCP farmers, andby farmers outsidethe project areas.

3.3        Basedon the early experience ofthe pilots, government decidedin 1997to launch a
nationwide rollout of the landprivatization program, using the FPPmodel. By2001, two
years before FPP completion, some 1980o fAzerbaijan's 2020 state and collective farms had
beenprivatized. This representedover 95 percent of agricultural land. Government and civil
society representativesinterviewedby IEGstatedthat landreform had largely succeeded.
Also, FPP was widely credited to haveplayed akeypart inthe roll-out. The relationship
between landreform, crop production and GDP i s shown inFigure 1.

3.4        ADCP: The primary landreformobjective ofADCP was to establishan efficient
systemfor recordingrurallandtransactions, consolidating work startedunder FPP.
Experience elsewhere (e.g. Thailand) has demonstratedthe value of a landtransaction
recording system: to ensure ownershiphenant security, to underpinthe use o f landto secure
loans, andto make on-farm investmentsworthwhile.

3.5        All output targetswere met.TenRegional CadastralCenterswere createdas
intended,andregistration ofland ownership andtransactions was decentralized from Bakuto
these centers. By2004 the cumulative total of landtransactions reachedthe appraisaltarget
o f 10,000. With a further 50,000 registrations under the Regional CadastralCenters, titling
was completed on virtually all o fthe nation's arable land. A UnifiedCadastreand
Registration systemwas successfullypiloted andhas provided experience for anation-wide
unifiedregistrationprogramunderthe RealEstateRegistrationProject (FY07).

3.6        An IEGmissionvisit to a Regional Cadastre Center anda Registration office in
Beylagan region confirmed that land services were functioning well. Decentralization has
made the service quicker andmore accessible to farmers. Processing time for registering a
landtransaction i s now 10 to 15 days compared to several weeks before the project. Land
transactions were accounting for over 80 percent o f the work compared with less than20
percent for landregistrations. Business was rapidly expanding-the                               new land registration
office recorded 5,000 transactions inthe first quarter o f 2006, and inthe same quarter o f
2007, transactions were over 32,000. Financially, the field offices were becoming more self-
sustaining: the fees charged for a transaction were about 80 percent o f variable costs. Both
the cadastral and registration offices were introducing computerized services, including
digitization o f landrecords.

Agricultural Services

3.7        Before FPP, agricultural services were inpoor shape. The technical staff o f the
collectiveshad departed but there were now one million new family farms, each requiring at
least a minimumo f technical understanding. Havingpreviously been used to follow orders
from above, farmers were for the first time expected to make their own decisions.

                                                 10


3.8        FPP: A Farm Information andAdvisory Services unitwas set up inthe Ministryo f
Agriculture. This was complementedbyprovision of extension agents ineach of the six pilot
raions, preparationand disseminationo ftechnical booklets, extension field visits, and farmer
training. While the services primarily covered crop and animal husbandry, they also included
how to apply for credit and farm business management.

3.9        Farm survey data andthe IEGmission's .field discussions indicate that the
information and advisory ("agricultural extension") services are highly appreciated. Data
from FPP's end-of-project Beneficiary Survey (Table 3) show that pilot farmers gained
almost universal access to advisory services, and had substantially greater use o f farm inputs,
new croppingpatterns andmarket informationthan non-pilot farmers. Duringa visit to FPP's
Lankaranpilot area, the mission found that the extension agent's training courses were
particularly popular-"we         come because we get value", said one farmer. Increases in
productivity were mainly attributedto the technical advice provided by the agents. At the
end-of-project stakeholder workshop participants cited agricultural extension more often than
any other FPP component as havingbeen the key to their success.

3.10        ADCP: ADCP hadawider range o f extension activities thanFPP. Regional
Advisory Centers (RACs) were established for each o f ADCP's five regions, as field bases to
provide training, demonstrations and a network o f extension agents. Technical pamphlets on
horticulture, diversification crops and farm management were prepared and distributed to
farmers. Mass media information campaigns were conducted, using television and
newspapers. A Competitive Grants Scheme for financing applied research and
demonstrations was established. Veterinary FieldUnitswere piloted. And, to support these
initiatives, the Information and Advisory Center inthe Ministry o f Agriculture was
strengthened.

3.11        ExtensivePrivate Sector Participation: Three o fthe five RACs were contracted
out to non-government agencies. The veterinarians were private, andthe CGS was open to
bothgovernment andnon-government bidders. The non-government sector was also
involved inthe preparationo ftraining andmedia modules. These experiences were generally
positive andprivate sector participation is being expanded under ADCP 11.

3.12        PrivatizingVeterinary Services: The ADCP's 25 private Veterinary FieldUnits
serviced some 48,000 livestock owners compared with an appraisal target o f 20,000. More

                                                      11


important than such physical targets, the FieldUnits successfully pilotedprivate veterinary
services, and Government now intends to scale-up under ADCP 11.The IEGmissionvisited
one Veterinary FieldUnit inBeylagan. Premises were spotless and well-frequented. The
practice was operating independently, able to cover costs through charges on medicines and
services. The veterinarians estimated they spent about two-thirds o f their time inthe field,
and the rest at the clinic. Medicines were significantly more expensive than publicly supplied
drugs, yet demand from farmers was high.Because the private veterinarians hadto provide a
better service inorder to get paid, they had a greater range o fmedicines, and their
professionalknowledge was more up-to-date.

3.13       CompetitiveGrants:A Competitive Grants Scheme (CGS) was usedto sponsor
applied research andnew technologies, and hadbroad geographic and crop coverage. It was
also considered a first step towards rehabilitating and improving the national agricultural
research capacity. Some 52 grants (average cost: $28,000) were awarded under ADCP (from
168 competing submissions) to a mixture o fpublic entities such as research stations (80
percent), andproposals from the NGO andprivate sectors (20 percent).'*

3.14       The competitive grants have helped instill a farmer-oriented andproblem-specific
approach to promoting agricultural technology. Demonstrations andtraining are a major part
o f each funded sub-project. CGS activities are clearly "owned" by the RACs. According to
one R A C Director, their researchwas now more relevant to farmers. CGS survey data
indicates that about 30 percent o f farmers that had visited demonstrations took up the
demonstrated technologies. The yields o f farmers who had attended demonstrations are
typically over 50 percent higher than yields under traditional practices. Given the enthusiasm
that the grants scheme has generated amongst farmers, the extension service and researchers,
it is being continuedunderADCP 11,with strong support from Government.

3.15       AgriculturalExtension,TrainingandDemonstrations: Annual extension
contacts reached 91,000 farmers in2004, well above the appraisal target o f 10,000 to 15,000
farmers per annum. Demonstrations are reported to havebeen visited by about 8,000 farmers
annually, compared with the appraisal target o f 3,000 visits. Most farmers interviewed bythe
mission said that the program was helpful, andthere was a desire inmost cases that the
program shouldbe intensified. Farmers said they were particularly interested inobtaining the
technical knowledge needed to raise productivity, as well as advice on crop diversification
and how to obtain credit.

3.16       The IEGmission was shown over a hundredtechnical brochures offering practical
advice to farmers. The Information Advisory Center's nationalbi-monthly TV programs on
agricultural subjects are aired inprime time andare popular with the general population as
well as farmers.



12. The research or extension activities for competitive submissions are chosenby a committee, which also
evaluates the submissions receivedagainst each pre-identified researcWdemonstration activity. For the future,
the CGS might be further enriched by creating an additional open window option. This would allow proposals
to be submitted by any party for activities that are not pre-identified by the committee, encouraging additional
innovations.

RuralFinance

3.17       The FPP and ADCP rural finance programs made slow starts but ultimately
achieved their main objectives. FPPblazedthe trail and ADCP built on this experience,
pilotinga larger, more sophisticated programbased on farmer-managed field institutions.

3.18       The FPP/ADCP credit program followed a series o fbanking sector crises. The
transformation o fthe socialist banking system hadcausedmajor financial losses and a loss o f
consumer confidence inthe emerging commercial banks. This was matchedby commercial
bank skepticism about the profitability o flendingto the ruralpopulation. Government
attempted to establish credit unions inthe 1990sbut most o fthem failed.

3.19       FPP: The credit pilot was built around the state-owned Agroprombank, which lent
directly to individual farmers. It was chosen as it was the only bank that reached into all
major agricultural regions. It made senseto opt for an existing financing agency, and
Agroprombank would have been a logical choice, given the limitedalternatives when FPP
was beingprepared. However, Agroprombank had little experience with rural finance anddid
not develop as an effective lendinginstitution. Loan application procedures were initially
overly-complicated and farmers distrusted the system. Nevertheless, FPP's output targets
were ultimately achieved. Its credit component was fully disbursed and credit repayment was
over 90 percent.

3.20       Government officials andBank staff frequently told the IEGmission that FPP's
significant rural finance achievement was to "change mind-sets". There was little experience
o f credit prior to FPP, let alone a culture o f repayingloans.

3.21       ADCP: ADCP's rural finance programbuilt on the starting initiatives o fFPP,
taking them much further. ADCP's notable achievement was at field levels - inpiloting
farmer institutions for managing credit, and setting the stage for the nationwide scale-up o f
the credit program under ADCP 11.The ADCP established two types o f local financial
institutions: Credit Unions (CUs) as formal legal entities, and smaller informal Borrower
Groups (BGs). ADCP also attempted to establish an "Implementing Agency" to manage the
credit program. The appraisal concept for the Agency was that this activity would be
managed commercially, andwould be tendered with the requirement that the Agency would
put20 percent o fits ownmoneyinto each loan. Itwas consideredthat this wouldprovide the
incentive for good loan management and cost recovery. However, the arrangement also
introduced incentives to only take easy lending opportunities rather than develop grass-roots
and development oriented farmer institutions. The eventually selected entity was risk-averse,
and showed little inclination to provide training andto promote the CUs. Eschewing
encouragement o f local ownership and self-imposed financial discipline, the Agency favored
a top-down approach with excessive controls. Another problem was the highlicensing fee for
a C U- some $5,600 -which deterred applications. A critical institutional issue was the lack
o f an exit-strategy for the Agency. It was seen as a temporary arrangement, but, especially
given the long-term andnational perspective ofthe ADCP's three stage APL, the need to
think aheadshouldhavebeenevident.

                                                    13


3.22       The program got o f fto a slow start. Disbursements to CUs beganinlate 2002, over
three years into project implementation, and disbursements to BGs didnot begin until2003.
A Mid-TermQuality Enhancement Review introduced anumber o fchanges which improved
project performance. The Agency was replaced by a technical assistance team that performed
well, and C U licensing fees were substantially red~ced.'~

3.23       Rapid implementationinthe second half o f the project enabled most o fADCP's
output targets to be achieved. According to the ICR 30 CUs and 905 BGswere established,
compared with appraisal targets of 80 CUs and 200 BGs.As o f June 30,2006 (the extended
closing date o f ADCP) the number o f BGs had grown to 1,498. The shortfall inthe number
o f CUs was thus counterbalanced by the greater than anticipatednumber o fBGs. About
38,000 farmers received credit (appraisal target 12,000), and lending totaled US$26 million
at closing, compared with a target o f $10 million. Repayment rates were 97 percent for CUs
and 95 percent for BGs, within appraisal expectations. The average loan amounts to farmers
were $1002 for CUs and $373 for BGs, modest enough to suggest that small farmers were
being served. ADCP also fostered the development o f a legislative framework for rural
finance.

3.24       As concerns the impact o f the credit program, survey data is limitedto the BGs.
Nearly all farmers surveyed considered that their BGloan hadhelped them generate profits,
and 92 percent intendedto continue usingcredit. IEGMission field visits to CUs andBGs
also found that farmers hadoverall positive views o f the credit program. But farmers drew
attention to the following drawbacks:

        Periods for seasonal credit are too short
        Seasonal credit often arrives too late for purchasing inputs.
        There is a lack o f medium-term and long-term credit, hampering crop diversification
        andon-farm investment.
        Individual credit limits are too small.
        C UMembers are not able to make deposits.
        The overall credit ceiling for BGs andCUs is too low.

3.25       Prospectsfor CommercialCredit.At present, commercial banks are minimally
involved with rural finance which represents a small part o f their portfolio (estimated by one
banker to be only about one percent on aggregate). Under ADCP-11, a line o f credit to
commercial bankshas been established for mediumand longer-term loans to agribusinesses.
IEGmissioninterviews with several commercialbanks indicatedapotentially largerrole for
private rural finance - the financing not only o f agribusinesses, but also o fBGs and CUs.
Seasonalcredit as well as longer-term lending might also be attractive. Thus, PARABANK
has successhlly provided credit to BGs even to small, geographically dispersed
communities, with virtually 100percent recovery rates, and intends to expand lending to
BGs.l4Also, commercial banks were bringinginmore flexible loan terms than those offered


13. Subsequently, management o fthe line o f credit was transferred to the Azerbaijan Credit UnionAssociation
(ACUA), which is continuing to manage the credit line under ADCP 11.
14. The manager o f a PARABANK branchvisited wanted to increase his BGportfolio because he felt the BGs
were credit-worthy borrowers. A microfinance institution CREDAGRO - had expanded rural lending from
                                                          -

through the Credit Implementin Agency and Azerbaijan Credit UnionAssociation, the
official channel for farm credit. 7 There is, inthe words o f one commercial banker, "room
                                        5

for multiple actors inrural finance".

Irrigation Rehabilitation

3.26         Under FPP, the irrigation and drainage systems o f the six pilot areas were
rehabilitated andwater user associations (WAS)were created as independent entities, with
water charges to recover 100percent o f operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. There was
a two-fold rationale for rehabilitation. First, irrigation and drainage systems hadnot been
maintained since dissolution o fthe collective farms andhad fallen into serious disrepair.
Second, whereas under the collective farms water could be directed to selected parts o f the
farmleaving other areaswithout irrigation, water nowneededto reachall o fthenew farms-
for equity reasons, and to gain community acceptance for landredistribution.

3.27         Allphysicaltargets for the six pilots were met, andfbndingto the programwas
subsequently doubled to provide additional coverage. The program reached 17,100 ha
compared with the appraisal target o f 9,300 ha, 31W A Swere formed compared with a
target o f 19, and over 1,600 kmo f canals were rehabilitated against 900 kmtargeted.
Irrigation conveyance efficiency i s reportedto have increased from 45 to 65 percent, and
field application efficiency from 45 to 80 percent. FPPdata indicates a near-doubling o f
yields for most crops, which is consistent with yield changes reportedby farmers duringthe
mission's field visits.

3.28         FPP established the first W A Sinthe country andhelped instillingovernment the
confidence to scale-up the program. By the end o f the project some 550 W A Shadbeen
established nationwide. The project also provided a forum for national policy discussions on
participatory irrigation management andwas the catalyst for the development o f legislation
for W A S .Finally, FPPis considered to have contributed to a cultural change inthe attitude
to water-from       considering water as a free and government-provided service, farmers began
to consider water management as a community responsibility and started to recognize the
need to pay for irrigation.

3.29         Nevertheless, WUAs are not yet financially self-sustaining. The mission
encountered one WUA (Gilinjli)which was collecting annual water fees o f only 3 manatha
(about $4). This maybe adequate for light maintenance o f a newly rehabilitated scheme, but
the more normal situation o f a system that has had only basic repairs to restore functioning o f
old infrastructure, requires more than this. Adequate O&M i s important to the long-term
success o f Azerbaijan's agricultural reform program, as, with some 70 percent o fthe nation's
cultivated land under irrigation, ruralproductivity depends on the sustainability o f the
irrigation infrastructure. Bank water staff familiar with Azerbaijan's irrigation sector


$3.7 million in2004 to over $23 million(Manat 20 million) in2007, andwas prepared to make small loans to
individual farmers (about $200 to $1200 per loan). AndAGRARCREDIT was planning to expand the number
o f its ruralbranches (from 12 to 25 inthe next three years).
15. e.g. PARABANK and CREDAGRO have seasonalcredit terms o f 12 and 14 months respectively and are
more flexible on loan amounts.

                                                      15


consider that $10/ha or more would be typical annual maintenance costs. Further, most
WUAs employ staffto operate their schemes, whichmaycost some $5-10/ha per annum. The
State Irrigation Agency andnational WUA administration have also expressed concern about
the adequacy o fwater fees and O&M. The O&M financing issue is now being tackled
country-wide under the IrrigationDistribution System andManagement Improvement
Project (FY03), which is establishing a national support network for awareness buildingand
training o f WUAs. For FPP however, the self-sufficiency o f its W A Swas an unfinishedpart
o f its agenda.

AgriculturalProductivity

3.30        Due to data and analytical problems the reform program's impact on agricultural
productivity cannot be stated reliably. Attribution is one problem. It i s not possible to
determine the degree to which changes inyields, crop diversification and agricultural value
were due to the influence o f the projects rather than other factors. Secondly, there are
inconsistencies and gaps inthe data collected under the projects themselves, inlarge part due
to weak M&E(paragraphs 2.6 to 2.9).16National level data also contains inconsistencies.
Hence, the impact below (which cross-check between different information sources including
qualitative information andmission observations), mustbe considered indicative.

ProjectLevelData

3.3 1       FPP.Yield data is particularly sparse for FPP.However, the Beneficiary Survey at
project ~ompletion'~produced findings which indirectly confirm the land reform's potential
for boostingproductivity (Table 4). Missionfield visits to Barda and Lenkaranregions also
found positive farmers' assessments.Most farmers reportedyield increases, andwere
satisfied with the agricultural services provided under the project. Irrigationrehabilitation
was reportedto have doubled yields.

3.32        ADCP. The ADCP-I1Baseline Survey o f2007 measured yields o frepresentative
crops from project and non-project farmers in50 villages across all ADCP regions. Data is
available for the last four years o fthe project. Inthe well-performing Beylagan region,
starting yields were about the same for project andnon-project farmers. But project farmers
increased their yields by 45 percent from 2002 to 2006, while the yields o f non-project
farmers increased by only 10percent (Figure 2).18For all five ADCP regions together,


16. For instance: (i) yield increasesreportedinthe FPP ICR's project Results Framework (data source
                      Crop
uncited) are inconsistent with the increases inpilot farmer incomes reported inthe Beneficiary Survey; (ii)  the
Beneficiary Survey reports a (patently unrealistic) ten-fold increase inincomes; (iii)
                                                                                     the ICR states that pilot
farmers' productivity increased 250 to 300 percent during the project, which is likely inconsistent with the 400
percent increase inpilot farmers' incomes also reported; (iv) data cited inthe ADCP ICR from the State
Statistics Committee indicates yield increases from 2000 to 2005 for ADCP and non-ADCP regions of wheat
113% (for ADCP Regions) and 108% (for non-ADCP Regions); for corn o f 148% and 137% respectively and
for potatoes 175% and 141%, which differ significantly from the FA0 data inTable 6; and (v) data sources and
survey methodologies are not always clear.
17. Elat, 2003.
18. National statistics on wheat yields are reported(FA0 data) to have been2.6 and 2.7 mt per hectare for 2002
and 2006 respectively, higher than the yields o fthe non-project farmers inthe ADCP survey. Relative data

average yield increases for project farmers were 30 percent or more, while typical yield
increases for non-ADCP farmers were 10-15 percent (Annex B, Table 2).

3.33        Most ADCP farmers interviewedby the IEGmissionreported increased crop
yields. Some obtained more than 50 percent increases. Others saw little change, especially
when encountering constraints such as low prices (cotton), difficulties inaccessing credit, or
where farming on rainfed lands with low response to farm inputs. The overall picture was o f
moderate to good yield increases. Qualitative data from the ADCP-I1 Baseline Survey also
suggest positive project impact. Farmers were clearly pleased with the project - for instance,
99 percent o fADCP 1's surveyed farmers were "very satisfied" or "satisfied" with the
project's agricultural extension support.

3.34        NationalLevelData: The nationwide roll out o fthe landreform program may also
be affecting Azerbaijan's overall agricultural productivity. InThailand, for instance, land
titlinginitselfincreasedproductivity." Caveats apply. First, itis not clear to what extent
productivity changes inAzerbaijan canbe attributable to the reforms or to other influences.
Second, ADCP covered less than 5 percent o fthe country's farmers. Nevertheless, from land
privatization alone, there may be some spillover from FPP/ADCP to Azerbaijan's overall




trends over time are, however, consistent. ADCP project farmers are recordedto have increased yields by 33
percent, while both for nation-wide and for non-project ADCP farmers yield changes were modest.
19. Although the "package" o f agricultural services with landreformwill be requiredfor major impact on
agricultural productivity, international experience is that landreformby itself(e.g. Thailand's landregistration
program) can significantly improve agricultural productivity. Influences (beyond the short-term impact o f extra
labor effort applied to the farm) can include (K.Deininger, 2003): intensified labor input, greater investment on
the land, anduse o f land as collateral for credit.

 cereals production from decline to progressive increases corresponded closely with the
 progress inlandprivatization. Yields andoverall productionalso increased for most other
 crops, andthere has been significant diversification into higher-margincrops (Annex By

 affecting every CIS country, more analysis would be needed to reach significant conclusions

 3.35        According to an agriculturalist familiar with Azerbaijan agricu1tu1-e~~~significant
 yield increases following landreform were to be expected.24Intakingover from the
 inefficient collectives, the new farmers were starting from a low base incrop husbandry and
 yields, with ample scope for improvement. The main cause o f yield growth was probably the
 increased time and care devoted to crops. The small size o fAzerbaijan's farms (2 ha on
 average) would have enabled more labor input from underemployedfamily members, and the
 scarcity o fjob opportunities o f fthe farm made this more likely. Better planting, weeding and
 other cultivation practices can make an appreciable difference to yields.                25 26




 20. InThailand, the mediumterm impacts o f landownership titles were to induce higher investments on the
 landand higher farming intensity. Land market values increased, and output was found to be 14 to 25 percent
 higher on titledlandthan on untitled land ("Land Policies and FarmProductivity inThailand", G.Feder, 1988).
 21. Details are at Annex B, Tables 3 and 4. Diversification to horticulture is one trend. The increase in
 agricultural value added hasbeendriven more by changes inyields andthe crop mix than by area expansion-
 land incrops increasedby only 7 percent between 1994 and 2002." The area incotton (the primary cash crop in
 Soviet times) fell by 60 percent, a response to the low purchase price offered by the government monopoly
 buyer. The reduced cotton area provided roomfor further diversification.
 22. Three time periods are illustrated. The 1990 to 1996 periodwas the decline inagriculture inall CIS
 countries. In 1997 to 2000most countries were intransition with their reforms. From2001 to 2006, most reform
 programshad stabilized.

 monopoly purchaser. This decline made room for the diversification into additional wheat, maize and
 horticultural crops.
 25. Likely reasons for several apparently counterintuitive trends (Annex B Table 2) were also provided.
 Vegetable yields didnot change appreciably becausethe farmers were already used to vegetable cultivationon
 their family plots inthe Soviet era, and crop husbandry remains substantially the same. However, there was a

Equity

3.36         LandDistribution:The IEGmission found widespread consensus amongst both
farmers and government officials that Azerbaijan's landdistribution hadbeen equitable. This
is confirmed insurvey data. Table 6 shows a highproportion of farmers (92 percent) who felt
that land distribution hadbeen fair. Azerbaijan also compares well with other countries. The
basis for social equity was the decision to allocate'equal land for all persons, but the process
used inallocating land- full public participationand a transparent lottery system -was also
important. Evenwithin this system, there might have beenways to manipulate land
allocation, or influence subsequent landownership27,but inAzerbaijan's case this appears
not to have been a significant problem.

3.37         AgriculturalSupport Services for Women andthe Poor:Agricultural support
services could, however, be more proactively applied to reach women andthe poor. In
principle, women andpoorer households have the same access rights to land services, credit,
agricultural training andirrigation as wealthier andmale-headed households. But committee
membership inCredit Unions and Water User Associations tends to be dominatedby men.
An agricultural extension worker and a C UPresident told the missionthat special efforts had
to be made to get women to come forward to access training and larger loans.



large responseinproduction after privatization due to increasedcultivated area. Grape area fell dramatically
once the masspurchasing from the Soviet plannedmarket ceased. Apple area declined as large areas hadbeen
plantedon marginal soils under the collectives. Butaverage yields increased as the remaining orchards were on
better soils. The production o f all cereals increased, the very highincrease for maize may have beenbecause o f
better seed.
26. Notwithstanding, FA0data shows a nationwide decline inmean fertilizer applicationper hectare-fiom           43
kghain 1990-92to 6 k g in2003-05. Butneither manure nor crop residues were applied inSoviet times, whereas
they are now. Also, while the collectives typically applied200 kgo finorganic fertilizer per hectare, misapplication
(aggravatedby flood irrigation) could result in80 percent o f fertilizer draining offwithout benefit to the crop. The
new farmers canmake more targeted applicationo f fertilizer, withsmall quantities timed precisely to keyplant
growthstages. This canboost the efficiency o ffertilizer application to 80 percent.
27. Unequal access to knowledge about landrightsand land distribution procedures is one inequity cited inthe
literature; for instance, inTajikistan, women were found to be twice as likely as mennot to have heardo f the
landreformdecrees. Also, inRussia and Kazakhstan, land speculators, including large conglomerates, are cited
as having exploited poor or less educated families, through buying up their landimmediately after land
distribution (Sources: Tajikistan Survey, USAIDiWorldBank/Government o fTajikistan (2008); Lemn, Csaki
and Feder, 2004; and K.Deininger, 2005)

3.38       Findings from two surveys inAzerbaijan are consistent with this observation.
"Focus group discussions.. .found women less likely thanmen to attend public meetings or to
consult with authorities, and they are less knowledgeable about the legal and administrative
aspects o f the reform, as well as its implications for their own households".28 Participants in
the FPP's Beneficiary Survey in2003 considered that vulnerable social groups, including
women, were less likely to benefit from the project than male-headed and younger farmers.29

3.39       The PovertyImpactof BorrowerGroups.The ADCP's programto provide credit
through Borrower Groups achieved highcredit recovery (95 percent ) and is even attracting a
commercial bankbecause BGs are seen as low riskborrowers (paragraphs 3.23 and 3.25).
Yet, under ADCP 11, BGs are to be phased out. Inthe IEGmission's discussions with
farmers, government andthe private sector, a common view was that BGs are better at social
inclusion than CUs. A BG's small size (about 20 members) and informal structure, with
members from the same small community, tends to favor integration o fwomen, sometimes
to a very large extent.31The poor also havebetter chances o f inclusion insuch small groups.
The two Credit Unions met acknowledged the better capacity for BGs to serve women and
the poor. One C U committee member commented that the membership fee for a C Umightbe
unaffordable for a poor farmer. There was also the questiono f whether the poor and women
sufficiently propose themselves for membership o f a CU. Inthe words o f one C U Chairman
"You can invite (the poor and women to be C Umembers) but that doesn't mean they come."

Equityversus Efficiency

3.40       Dissolutiono fthe collectives presented two fundamental allocation choices for
Azerbaijan: some form o fcorporate farming, as typically chosen bythe CIS countries, or
distribution ofthe collective's land equally to all persons.32Azerbaijan's choice o f equal
distribution couldhavereduced efficiency intwo ways. First, the resultant very small farms
(two hectares on average) would not enjoy the economies o fscale that mightbepossible on
larger farms, andsecond, because landwas allocated to everyone, capacity to farmwould have

FarmRestructuring inTransition Countries. The Experience o f Bulgaria, Moldova, Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan." World Bank Working Paper, 2007
29. Survey respondents considered that the following categories o fpeople were "losers" as a result ofland
privatization: pensioners and the old 65%; the disabled 67%; andwomen 39%. Groups considered "winners"
were: "the young and strong" 63%; farmers 61%; men69%; children inthe future 89%; and they (the
respondents) themselves 88%.
30. Such social constraints are not unusual.For instance, ina farm survey inTajikistan it was found that,
compared to women, "Men are 3 times more likely to attend training, and significantly more likely to see
publications, listen to radio, watch TV, readnewspapers and engage ininterpersonal discussions." (USAID,
Government o f Tajikistan and World Bank, 2008)
31. For instance two groups o f BGs knownto have a highproportiono f women members were interviewedby
the mission. Froma group o f 3 BGs, 78 percent o fthe combined members were women, and ina group o f 9
BGs, 35 percent were women.
32. Variations between CEE/CIS countries included, for instance, creation of commercial corporate farms in
Hungary, nominalcorporations inRussia andthe Ukraine, and subdivision o f collectives into smaller
"brigades" (which were later divided into family farms) inTajikistan.

varied~onsiderably.~~Hence, inthe short-term at least, atrade-off between equity and
efficiency couldbe expected. However, efficiency does not appear to have been adversely
affected. The 2003 World Bank Survey inAzerbaijan found that the productivities o f labor,
ando fland, were twice as highon family farms as oncorporate farms.34                   35 A World Bank staff
member familiar with Azerbaijan considered that the possible negative effect from scale dis-
economies andvarying farming capacities would havebeen mitigatedbythe strong incentives
from individualized ownership, further enabledby Azerbaijan's highrural under-employment.

3.41        Developing the Land Market. An important remaining need is to further develop
the landtransaction recording system begun under ADCP so that it becomes a nationwide
network, close to villages and easy to use. Expansiono f the network i s proceeding well
(paragraph 3.6). Success here would facilitate development o f a free market for sale,
purchase and lease o f land. This would provide the basis for a gradual market-based
reallocation o f land to those farmers who are able to use the landmost e f f i ~ i e n t l y . ~ ~

Outcome

4.1         Consideringthe Relevance, Efficacy andEfficiency o f each project, the Outcomes
o fbothFPP and ADCP are rated Satisfactory. The results are summarized inTable 7 and
amplified below.

Relevance

4.2         Relevanceof Objectives: For bothprojects, relevance with respect to Objectives i s
ratedHigh.A radically different approach to agricultural development was needed ifthe
major decline inagricultural productivity following Independence was to be reversed. The
projects fittedwithin the general policy thrusts o f the Bank and Government. The decision
for equitable privatization o f agricultural land, accompanied byprovision o f agricultural
services (agricultural extension, credit and irrigation) agreedwith Government and Bank
policies for the rural sector. The 1996 Country Assistance Strategy, operative when the
FPP/ADCP programbegan, proposedtransition to a market economy, andtransfer o f
ownership o f the collective farms. Project objectives are also broadly inline with the current

33. The younger and more entrepreneurial households would intrinsically make mostproductive use o fthe land.
Butthe elderly, thepoor, andthe less educatedwere also giventhe opportunity to farm.
34. World Bank Survey o fFarms (2003), as reported inN.Dudwick, K.Fock and D. Sedik, "Land Reform and
FarmRestructuringinTransition Countries (2007).
35. Overwhelmingly, farming i s underprivate family farms inAzerbaijan, but 2 percent o f the land i s farmed by
agricultural enterprises.
36. To this end, Azerbaijan may have a comparative advantage over some other countries inits ability to reach
towards optimal landuse efficiency. A land-market operating where landhasbeendistributed equitably is
starting without the distortions introduced ifland or part o fthe landi s under entrenched influence o f local elites.
CIS countries that were less equitable indistributingland or which created corporations that have become
dominatedby a few members may have greater difficulty developing a filly liberalized landmarket.

4.3           The projects' objectives were andremain Highlyrelevant to the agriculture reform
agenda for the CIS countries. A significant "value-added" from FPP and ADCP i s the
experience they provided as the Bank startedto roll out other CIS landreformprojects inthe
late 1990s. Prior to FPP, there had only beenone project -the Russia, Land Reform
Implementation Support Project (FY94) - dedicated to landreform, andthis was limited
primarily to cartography andlandregistration. The FPP, prepared in 1995-96, thus had little


37. Through extensive discussions with stakeholders and amongst policy makers, a de facto strategy was
developed andbrought into the designs ofFPP andADCP. There are potential gaps insuch an approach,
however, as discussedat Annex C.

prior Bank experience from CIS countries to utilize. The first group o f rojects following
FPP - inKazakhstan (FY97), Tajikistan ((FY99) and Armenia (FY99)                     -had FPP's initial
experience to learn from, and interviews with Bank project staff indicate that this was useful.

4.4       Relevance of Design: Relevance o fdesign was Substantial for bothFPP andADCP.
The only significant weakness indesign o fFPP's components was the minor component
promoting community services which lackeda clear purpose andactionprogram. Butwith
respect to landprivatizationandextension, the design o fFPP was sound. ADCP's main design
shortfall concernedmanagement arrangements for the credit program-private                  equity incredit
provision didnot work, andthere was no exit strategy for the implementing agency (paragraph
3.21). The landreform andagriculturalextension programs were, however, well designed. But,
for bothprojects, M&E arrangementswere weak (paragraphs 2.7 to 2.9), moderatingthe highly
relevant designs o fmost aspects o fthe projects.

4.5       Overall, relevance is rated Substantial for FPP and Substantial for ADCP.

Efficacy

4.6       Objective 1 Land Privatization. FPP and ADCP achieved their objectives to
                         -
pilot landreform and facilitated a nationwideprocess o f landprivatization, far exceeding
expectations. Bothprojects are rated High.

4.7       Objective 2 Agricultural Extension Services: These were established,
                         -
strengthened considerably, and expanded. Bothprojects are ratedHigh.

4.8       Objective 3 -Rural Finance: The credit programs o fbothprojects had
problematic anddelayed starts, but credit targets were eventually reached. The FPP's and
ADCP's credit achievements, and corresponding on-farm investments (mainly seasonal
inputs andlivestock), were important because they forged a new culture o frural finance and
repayment (FPP was the initiator o fthis), and developed successful models for farmer-owned
financing organizations (ADCP's CUs andBGs). ADCP's apex organization was
unsuccessful, but the project's field achievements were important. They provided the models
andexperience for the scaling-up o fcredit unions now underwayunderADCP-11. Both
projects are rated Substantial.

4.9       Objective 4 Irrigation Rehabilitation (under FPP). The project achieved its
                         -
physical targets and efficacy i s rated Substantial. However, inadequate O&M raises
sustainability concerns (paragraphs 3.30 and 4.18).

4.10      Objective 5 -Inter-agency Coordination (under FPP) is rated High.It was also
critical to have a management structure and collaborationbetween the many agencies
involved inthe reforms, inshort, as stated inFPP's objectives - "an enabling environment to
buildlinkages betweenkeyinstitutions". The past tendency for institutions to operate in
separate "silos" was effectively tackled through a coordinating unit sponsored primarily

under FPP. Coordinating cells at field level were staffed with individuals from each relevant
agency. Management under this unit (now part o f the State Agency for Agricultural Credits)
i s strong, while the line agencies are mostly effective inimplementing their areas o f
responsibility.

4.1 1      Objective6 CommunityDevelopment(under FPP) is ratedModest. AnNGO
                           -
was hiredto sponsor community construction o f social andproduction-oriented
infrastructure. The underlying rationalewas to protect the welfare o f vulnerable groups such
as the poor, women, the elderly andthe infirm.Itwas considered that such people mightbe
disadvantaged inthe landprivatization process due to limitedcapacity to work the land or to
access other project services. The component was not successful. Pre-independence
community mobilization hadbeen "directive" rather thanbottom-up and voluntary, and
neither the NG,O nor Government was experienced with community-driven development.
Nevertheless, one achievement appreciated bythe villagers was the establishment o fwater
and sanitation facilities ineach o fthe six FPPpilots.

4.12       Objective7-BuildingGovernmentCapacityfor PolicyReform(under ADCP)
i s ratedModest. A Rural Policy Unit was set up by the project, andwas placedunder a
senior-level Government commission. Several usehl strategy documents were produced.                         39
However, at the end o fthe project the Unitwas disbanded. There i s no longer an analytical
capacity and institutional structure to overview and formulate adjustments to policy as events
and understanding evolve, yet the buildingo f such capacity was the development objective.

4.13       Basedon these assessmentso f each development objective, overall, Efficacy is
rated Substantialfor FPP and Substantialfor ADCP.

  Efficiency

4.14       An economic rateo freturnwas not calculatedfor either FPPor ADCP, and
inconsistent project-specific data (paragraph 3.3 1) precludes an ERRestimation at PPAR
stage.

From the perspective o f the national program, however, some insights can be gained from
assessingwhat gains innationalproductivity would be requiredto make the reform program
economically viable. If,for instance, FPP andADCP set the stage for national net
agricultural value added to increase by 0.9 percent per year over 15 years, this would result in
an economic rate o f return above 12percent (Annex B).A 0.9 percent growth rate compares
with the 1990-2005 growth innet value added o f2.8 percent per annum(WDR, 2008).                         40 The
national data on crop-wise productivity presented at paragraphs 3.36 to 3.40 indicate quite
dynamic increases inagricultural yields andproduction. But the share o fAzerbaijan's
agricultural growth that can be attributed to the reform program is undetermined.


39. Three documents were prepared: a Policy Framework in2004, a sector Strategy in2005 (both approvedby
the Commission), andanInvestmentPolicy andFinancing Planpreparedindraft in2006 (discussed with
stakeholders though not yet formally approved).
40. Excluding the first half o f the 199Os, when production declined, agricultural value added would actually
have grown by more than this rate inthe past decade.

                                              25


With such limited analytical material, proxy indicators mayprovide the best assessmento f
the projects' efficiency. The following maybe taken into account:

    The speedwith which the pilots were implemented (paragraph 3.1)
        The swift scaling-up o f the pilots to a nation-wide program (paragraph 3.3)
        Reductioninthe time taken to register landtransactions, andthe rapid increase in
        landtransactions (paragraph 3.6)
        Provision for competitionbetweenprivate and public service providers (paragraph
        3.11)
        Willingness o f farmers to pay for veterinary drugs (paragraph 3.12)
        Highuptake ofcreditbackedbysoundrepayment rates (paragraph 3.23)
        Reports that farmers participating inthe extension program received higher yields and
        incomes than non-participants (paragraph 3.34)
        Evidencethat yields for ADCP farmers rose more than for non-ADCP farmers
        (paragraph 3.33).
        Diversificationinto higher-margin crops (paragraph 3.35)

          Based on these considerations, the Efficiency ofboth FPP andADCP i s rated
Substantial,althoughthis mustbe aqualifiedbest assessment,pendingthe availability
of more complete data on, especially,productivity,andsufficientquantitative
informationon costs andbenefitsto calculatean economic rateof return.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

4.16      The Risks to FFP's outcomes are rated Moderate.FPP's central objective-
private landownership-is     strongly supported by Azerbaijan's farmers, who are a major
political force, and Government continues to be a zealous reform champion. The agricultural
support services that FPP supported have evolvedwell beyond the initial model, andthis core
thrust can also be expected to continue in some form or another. Together, the likely
sustainability and further consolidation o f the land and agricultural services reformsjustifies
the moderate assessment o frisk for the project overall. Nevertheless, this assessment is on
the margin as it does not apply to one component, irrigation. The inadequate revenues being
collected by W A Sfor O&M, poses significant sustainabilityrisks. Prospects for addressing
this riskhavebeenenhanced since FPP, through the ongoing IrrigationDistribution System
andManagement ImprovementProject (FY03). This nation-wideproject has been
specifically devised to tackle the O&M issue.

4.17      The Risks to ADCP's Outcomes are ratedSignificant.ADCP's central
objective-to   increase agriculturalproductivity-set    the barhigherthan FPP. To increase
and sustain productivity the ADCP program (phases I1andI11o f the APL) will face tougher
challenges-provision    o frural finance being perhaps the largest.

BankPerformance

4.18      The Bank's overall performance was Satisfactoryfor bothFPP and ADCP. For
bothprojects, the Bank was a reform champion andmotivator, had a close partnershipwith
Government, and contributed international best practice.

                                              26


4.19      Qualityat Entry.FPP(Satisfactory): Reform championship was outstanding. The
task team leader spent considerable time with Government officials advocating reform and
discussing how to achieve it. The team had significant practical experience inrural
development, andpractical knowledge o freform initiatives inother countries. But there were
shortcomings inM&Eand the design o f the Community Development pilot.

4.20      ADCP (Satisfactory): The task team designed a long-term program, and learned
and built on FPP's experience, adding substantial further innovation. A significant shortfall
was indesigning the management arrangements for the rural finance program. Requiring an
implementing agency to contribute its own equity introducedincentives to be risk averse and
top-down.

4.21      Qualityof Supervision.FPP (Satisfactory): The supervisionteamhad a close and
progressive partnership with Government, and Bank management provided active support,
especially inpolicy dialogue. A contribution going well beyond the bounds o fthe pilot
project was the Bank team's technical support when Government decidedon rapidroll-out o f
the landreforms nationwide. Butweaknesses inthe implementation anduse o f M&E make it
hardto draw definitive conclusions about the success o fthe program.

4.22      ADCP (Satisfactory): The supervisionteam continued the progressive partnership
with Government begununder FPP, strongly supported byBank management. But aplanfor
the continued management o f credit after ADCP's closure was not prepared. Also, issues
such as the overly short seasonal credit periods (paragraph 3.24) could havebeenresolved.

Borrower Performance

4.23      Overall performancewas Highly Satisfactoryfor FPP andSatisfactoryfor ADCP.

4.24      GovernmentPerformance.For bothFPP andADCP, Government Performance
was Highly Satisfactory. The Government successfully combined long-term vision with
practical andinclusive implementation. The reform agenda was bold and clearly articulated.
The reforms were well championedwith unwavering commitment by the nation's most
senior political leaders.

4.25      ImplementingAgency Performance.Performance for FPPwas Highly
Satisfactory. The line agencies successfilly discharged the tasks for which they were
responsible. The Project Management Unithelped to improve inter-agency coordination and
involved stakeholders indecisions and implementation. The one weak performer was
Agroprombank which hadno experience with credit, although, ultimately, targets were
achieved.

4.26      The performance ofADCP's Implementing Agencies was Satisfactory overall.
Relations betweentechnical agencies were good, andthe program was strongly managed by
the Project Management Unit andits successor entities (ASDAP and SAAC). The
agricultural extension programwas energeticallypursued, with strong technical leadership,
and continuous adaptation. Strongmanagement o f the landreform program enabled its
ambitious targets to be met. However, incomparisonwith the highly satisfactory

                                              27


implementationo fthese two programs, the credit program was poorly managed-the
implementing agency was ineffective inmotivating andtraining credit unions, and was
eventually replacedby a technical assistance team.

SafeguardIssues

4.27      The social impact o f the projects has beenpositive, particularly the equitable land
distribution. FPPhada direct positive environmental impact resulting from the
rehabilitation o f irrigation systems - waterloggedsaline areas on the pilot farms fell from 32
percent to 15 percent o f landarea. As the reform program continues, however, increased use
o fpesticide may pose a contamination risk. Also, the growth o f livestock may result in
overgrazing o fcommon lands. These issues go beyond the projects inquestion, though they
are a consequence o fAzerbaijan's broadening ruralreform program. Major reforms, ifthey
are effective, should generate major changes infarm management and landuse. Accordingly,
environmental monitoring andmanagement is a necessary adjunct to a reform program.

5.       Lessons

5.1       Azerbaijan's largely successful landreform program has been characterized by
individualizedprivatization o f land, a package approach combining agricultural services as
well as landreform, and a rapid and single-step change rather than gradual or phased
implementation. While the great diversity o f experience across countries indicates that there
is no uniquely right landreformmodel, Azerbaijan's approach to landand agricultural
reformwould be an option for other countries to consider.

5.2       Equitable landdistribution and access to agricultural support services helps to
ensure that vulnerable groups such as women and the poor share inthe benefits from land
reform. By far the most important influence on social inclusionwas from the initial choice to
distribute collective lands equally. Also, there have beenno restrictions on access to
agricultural extension, training and credit. However, women and the poor are less assertive
than other households inapplying for such services, andproactive steps to encourage
participation are needed.

5.3       The reformprocess i s critical for determiningwhether landreform works. Client
focus, transparency and stakeholder involvement were central to reform implementation, and
a learning-oriented and innovative culture was fostered. Privatized service delivery reduced
requirements for extra government staff. Some aspects o f Azerbaijan's reform process could
havebeen stronger. Bothprojects hadweak monitoring and evaluation, and more
comprehensive sector analysis is called for.

5.4       Landreform needs powerful champions to succeed. Exceptionalcommitment by
champions inthe Government and the Bank is fundamental to success. Bothparties were
effective champions o f Azerbaijan's reform program. For Government, the President himself
was the lead champion.

Annex B. EconomicAnalysis

Inthe absenceofsufficient datato calculate aneconomic rateofreturn, anindicativeanalysis
has been undertaken to ascertain the degree to which national Agricultural Value Added
(AVA) wouldneedto increase inorder for the FPP/ADCPprogramto be economically
viable. The "minimum gain" would be the increase inAVA required to result ina viable
ERR; Le. anERRexceeding the Opportunity Cost o fCapital (assumed at 12%).Alteniative
assumptions canbe made about the impact o f the projects on AVA, and can be compared
with the modelresult. Ifthe model shows that the program only needs to have a small impact
on AVA relative to expectations or emerging data, the reasonable assumption would be that
the program is viable.

One illustrative scenario is provided inthe table. It is assumed that FPP/ADCP pushes
nationalAVA (Gross value o f agricultural output less inputcosts) upby 20% over a 15 year
period (1.2% per annum). The national increase inbenefits (AVA) is accompanied by a
proportionalincrease inthe costs o f agricultural extension and the administrative costs o f
credit and landtransactions. Thus, the full costs o f an expandingnational program are
included inthe model.

The assumption that AVA increases by 1.2%per annum compares to the growth innational
agricultural value added o f 2.8% inthe 1990-2005 period. A 2.8% annual increase would
result ina 50% increase inAVA over 15 years, and an increase o f over 70% in20 years.
While the degree to which agricultural value added is, and will be, affectedby the reform
program is not known, a 70 percent increase is substantially over the 20% assumed inthe
model. (Also, agricultural value added has been growing at over 5 percent per annum since
1997.)

The 20% increase inAVA assumed inthe model's base case (see Table and Table footnotes)
results inan ERR o f 33%. Assuming a lower increase inAVA -o f 15% (0.9%0 per annum) -
butkeepingthe build-upo f support service costs at the same rate as for the 20% increase, an
ERRo f 14% is obtained, just above the opportunity cost o fcapital.

Annex C.ImplementationProcessesThat FacilitateLand
Reforms

Azerbaijan's land-based agricultural reform program was significantly facilitatedbymost o f
the implementationprocessesusedto carry out the reforms. The processes that were most
influential are highlighted inLesson Four (Section 5). These processes are detailed below,
including actions that complicatedrather thanimproved reform implementation:

(i) Stakeholdersplayedamajor role in reformimplementation.Clientorientationand
transparencyfosteredthis: For each collective farm, the allocationo flandwas preceded
byworkshops to discuss the process, farmers were involved indetermining the landparcels
for distribution; and allocation was bypublic lottery. Onthe other hand, some processes,
such as loan applications under FPP, were overcomplicated (FPP's application system was
later simplified), andtraining, demonstrations and media beganprescriptively before
becoming more client- responsive.

(ii)Alearning-oriented,adaptiveandinnovativeculturewasimportanttosuccess:A
"reform culture" was fostered from the beginning, usingstudy tours to a diversity o f
countries, followed by workshops. Legalprovisions on land andW A Swere adjusted as
experience was gained. The RACs were encouraged to welcome the involvement o f
individualNGOs or aid agencies inpiloting new technologies. The Competitive Grants
program became fairly responsive to farmer interests.

(iii)Decentralizationofagriculturalsupportservicesimprovedimplementation:Land
registration andtransaction services became more effective once they were managed from
field offices. The l2ACs were given substantial freedom inimplementing extension and
training, the center providing technical advice and strategic guidance rather thandetailed
management.

(iv) Theprivatesector couldhandlethe major growthof agriculturalsupportservices
neededunderAzerbaijan's packageapproach.Without a major private sector role
Azerbaijan could face burgeoning government staffrequirements as support services
develop. The FPP/ADCP program was largely successful inpilotinguse o f the private sector
for agricultural extension, veterinary services and research. The commercial bankingsector
could become more involved.

(v) Reformactionsneedto be sustained over time, without interruptions:The reform
program could have fared better inthis respect. For instance: (i) ADCP's policy formulation
cell could have been continued; (ii) an institutional planwas needed under ADCP for
managingthe credit program after handover bythe temporary Implementing Agency; and
(iii) creditprogramwouldhavebeenbetterasacontinuousruralfinanceprogramrather
     the
thanstoppingat closure ofeachproject

(vi) StrongandcontinuousM&Eis essential:The FPP/ADCP programhaddisjointed
M&E,with inconsistencies inmethodologies, a lack o ffocus onoutcomes, andno continuity

                                               40                                      Annex C


betweenFPP and ADCP. Resultantly, impacts on agricultural productivity are difficult to
determine, and opportunities to improve the reform program may havebeen foregone.

(vii) Parallelprojectssupportingdifferent activitiesof a land-basedreformprogram
are moremanageablethan a single comprehensiveproject. Eacho fFPP's and ADCP's
three core activities -landprivatization, agricultural extension and credit - are challenging
bythemselves. Ofthe four other CIS countries where Bank projectshave supported land-
basedreforms -Armenia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Tajikistan -only Tajikistan attempted one
multi-component project. Armenia, KazakhstanandRussiahad two parallel projects each;
one project financing landreform, andthe other the agricultural support services. Azerbaijan
is now also following a multi-project approach for supporting land-based reforms. Thus,
complementing the agricultural extension andcredit services promoted under ADCP-11, land
services are now beingtaken forward under the Real Estate Registration Project (FY07).
Also, the Irrigation Distribution and Management Improvement Project (FY03); is fostering
O&M and self-sufficiency for WAS.)This approach is likelyto be more manageable for
Azerbaijan's increasingly larger reform program.

(viii) Reformsshould bebased on comprehensiveandup-to-datesector analysis. During
preparationo fFPP an in-depthunderstanding o f the sector was gained through extensive
discussions with stakeholders. De facto, these discussions amounted to preparationo f a
strategy, which was brought into the designs o f FPP and ADCP. Proceeding without a more
formally articulated strategy (the more classic approach) worked at inception o f the two
projects, but maybe working less well today. There i s still no detailed sector work on
Azerbaijan's land-based agricultural reform program. Longer-term andbroader perspectives
mightbebeingmissed inthe absence o f such analyticalwork. Also, shorter-term andmore
project specific opportunities to improve the program or better address emerging issues might
be identified.

(ix) Reformsneedcomplementingwith improvedenvironmentalmanagement.A
significant reformprogram will generate major changes inproduction, agricultural
technologies, crop diversification and other effects, with bothpositive andnegative impacts
on the environment. Negative impacts may develop fast ifnot monitoredand mitigated. In
Azerbaijan's case, overgrazing from an increasing livestock population (livestock
investments are a common use o f credit) i s already an issue, and, while present usage is
minimal, pollution from pesticides and fertilizer could be problems inthe longer term. These
andother possible environmentalimpactsneedto betaken account of, but environmental
protection is not yet a prominent focus o fthe reform program.
