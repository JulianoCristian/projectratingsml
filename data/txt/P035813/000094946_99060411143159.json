markets. There are four project components. 1) Real\n            estate registration component will support the\n            Government's national program for privatizing and\n            titling state and collective farm land; and develop and\n            implement the organizational and legal framework for a\n            unified real estate cadastre system. 2) Rural finance\n            component will pilot a mechanism to increase the\n            availability in rural areas of market based credit and\n            deposit services for rural households, enterprises, and\n            farms. In particular, the component will establish two types\n            of local financial intermediaries -- credit cooperatives and\n            groups of jointly liable borrowers. 3) Information and\n            advisory services component will increase farmers access to\n            information, advice, and training. It will build capacity\n            for the provision of such services in the private and public\n            sectors, assemble useful technology and advice, and develop\n            suitable delivery mechanisms. 4) Rural policy unit will be\n            set up to assist the Government to develop a strategy to\n            maintain the competitiveness of agriculture in face of the\n            potential impact on the real exchange rate of developments\n            in the oil sector and related issues of agricultural sector management."}, "docdt": "1999-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
