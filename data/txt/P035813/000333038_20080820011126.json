Ratings for the Agricultural\n            Development and Credit Project for Azerbaijan are as\n            follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant; Bank performance was satisfactory;\n            and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the projects included: Azerbaijan's\n            largely successful land reform program has been\n            characterized by full and individualized (ownership by\n            families) privatization of land, a package approach\n            combining agricultural services with land reform, and a\n            rapid and single-step change rather than gradual or phased\n            implementation. While the great diversity of experience\n            across countries indicates that there is no uniquely right\n            land reform model, Azerbaijan's approach is an option\n            for other countries to consider. The reform process is\n            critical for determining whether land reform works. In\n            Azerbaijan's case, client focus, transparency, and\n            stakeholder involvement were central to reform\n            implementation, and a learning oriented and innovative\n            culture was fostered. Privatize service delivery reduce\n            requirements for extra government staff. Land reform needs\n            powerful champions to succeed. Exceptional commitment by\n            champions in the Government and the Bank were critical to\n            the success under the projects evaluated here."}, "docdt": "2008-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
