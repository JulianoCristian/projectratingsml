The performances of the Borrower and the Bank are\n            rated satisfactory. Lessons learned included the following:\n            1) In order to manage complicated technical assistance\n            effectively and efficiently, it is important to first\n            develop a capacity and understanding within the Project\n            Implementation Unit of the main features of technical\n            assistance, and international best practice on the subject\n            matter since the risk of failure due to poor technical\n            assistance is great. 2) The Project needs to be selective in\n            the number of monitoring indicators, progress indicators,\n            Adaptable Program Lending triggers, and targets, etc., as\n            management of the too complex monitoring system becomes a\n            cumbersome and time-consuming project activity in itself. 3)\n            For objectives that involve changing the mentality or\n            attitude of Government agency personnel, projects need to\n            include opportunities for gaining international experiences\n            through study tours or conferences. 4) Advantages of a\n            credit line managed by a third party with risk-sharing and\n            co-financing arrangements include: (1) transparency of\n            implementation; (2) careful screening of potential borrowers\n            and thus high repayment rates; and (3) no Government or\n            political influence. There are also disadvantages: (1) the\n            desire to shift disbursement towards the end of the Project\n            in order to minimize its own risk; (2) some initiatives are\n            legitimate from the point of view of the co-financier as a\n            commercial company, but are not in accord with the\n            Project's philosophy or methodology.    The\n            Project's implementation reconfirmed some of the usual\n            lessons from many other projects, such as (1) a very\n            complicated project design consisting of multiple activities\n            should be avoided as it dilutes the focus on the most\n            essential outcome the project attempts to achieve, and makes\n            supervision and implementation extremely costly and time\n            consuming; (2) preparation of the project design should not\n            be short-cut, as any flows in the design ultimately\n            undermine the quality of project implementation and\n            achievements; and (3) expectations for implementation\n            periods of conceptually innovative activities should be\n            based on more realistic assumptions."}, "docdt": "2005-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
