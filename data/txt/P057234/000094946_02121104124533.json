environmental and\n            social impacts. The project is not expected to result in\n            significant negative environmental or social impacts. The\n            project supports the implementation of a series of\n            participatory forestry management activities. Provisions\n            will be made to bring about sound forest management, and\n            when required, the preservation of critical biodiversity\n            habitats. In particular, areas classified as catchment\n            forest that are important for watershed protection and the\n            Eastern Arc Montane Forest will be targeted for priority\n            protection and conservation. Environmental risks are\n            associated with well-known and documented forest management\n            constraints--encroachment into forest reserves, difficulties\n            in implementing practical sustainable forest management\n            plans and sometimes ineffective traditional government\n            forest management policies and regulatory measures. Social\n            and economic impacts will be assessed for all plantation\n            forests which are expected to be directly affected by the\n            component involving the private sector in managing\n            industrial forest plantations. Consultation will be taken\n            with all stakeholders. Special attention will be directed at\n            small sawmillers to ensure they are adequately protected\n            during project implementation. An added benefit to involving\n            the private sector is that creating expanded business\n            climate could introduce new sawmilling technologies that\n            would use discarded mill waste."}, "docdt": "2002-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
