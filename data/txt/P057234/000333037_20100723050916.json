Conservation and\n            Management Project for Tanzania were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, risk to Global Environmental\n            Objective (GEO) was substantial, the Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: sustainable forest sector reforms require strong\n            political and technical leadership. Reforms also need to be\n            in line with government priorities. Transparency in the\n            consultative process ensures that staff/employees, at all\n            levels, feel ownership and consider change as an opportunity\n            rather than a threat to their livelihood. Projects\n            implemented during times of significant policy change\n            require enhanced, constant engagement and supervision. This\n            includes utilizing outside expertise with strong in-country\n            experience, mobilizing senior Bank management, and ensuring\n            flexibility in the design to respond to changes in\n            priorities while retaining the overall goals. Forest sector\n            projects tend to be overly ambitious, aiming to address\n            multiple challenges (e.g. sector reform, sustainable\n            management, governance, community participation, etc.) in a\n            single operation. Recipient implementation capacity is often\n            insufficient to address existing complexities within the\n            given timeframe and limited resources are spread too thinly.\n            As a consequence, restructuring is often required to adjust\n            ambitious project designs to realities on the ground,\n            helping to achieve a few tangible results. So as to yield\n            sustainable project outcomes, project designs should be more\n            focused, allocating sufficient and targeted financial resources."}, "docdt": "2010-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
