Global Environment Facility (GEF)\n            financed Eastem Arc Forests Conservation and Management\n            Project for Tanzania is the third component of the broader\n            Forest Conservation and Management Project (P058706)(report\n            no. 22743). The Eastern Arc component was appraised\n            separately from the main project due to timing of the GEF\n            approval process, which has necessitated the separate\n            processing of  the grant component. This third component of\n            the program, which is largely to be financed by GEF (and\n            possibly with bilateral  sources) has been jointly developed\n            and implemented by the World Bank and UNDP working with\n            Government and other partners with interests in the forestry\n            sector. This component will support  institutional reform,\n            strategy development, pilot community-based conservation,\n            and the development of   sustainable financing for tropical\n            high forest conservation in Tanzania. The main global\n            environmental objective of  this GEF activity is  to promote\n            the sustainable conservation  and management of  the Eastem\n            Arc forests. The activity has four sub-components:\n            subcomponent (i)  will be implemented by the World Bank with\n            IDA resources; subcomponent (ii) will also be implemented\n            by the World Bank with GEF grant resources; sub-components\n            (iii) and (iv) will be implemented through  UNDP with GEF\n            grant resources. Subcomponent 1 finances institutional\n            reforms for forest biodiversity conservation, in particular\n            of the Eastern Arc  forests at central, district and local\n            partnership levels to incorporate specific responsibilities\n            for  biodiversity conservation, oversight, monitoring and\n            coordination. Such reforms will be linked  with other\n            reforms and institutional restructuring proposed for the\n            forestry sector as a whole,  which are to be financed by\n            IDA. The implementing agency for this sub-component would be\n            the Bank. In subcomponent 2, mechanisms for sustainable\n            financing of biodiversity conservation will be developed\n            including the establishment of  the Eastem Arc Mountains\n            Conservation Endowment Fund  (EAMCEF). It   is  envisaged\n            that a pilot endowment trust fund will be established by the\n            project,  with GEF resources. The EAMCEF's initial\n            operations and programs will be co-financed by  IDA, The GEF\n            implementing agency for this sub-component would be the\n            Bank. Two additional components are to be implemented by the\n            UNDP and are complementary to the  Bank-implemented\n            activities: 3) Development and preparation of an integrated\n            Conservation Strategy for the Eastern Arc  Mountain Forests\n            and 4) A forest conservation intervention through government\n            and community partnership  initiatives which will be\n            undertaken at priority sites in the Uluguru Mountains."}, "docdt": "2003-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
