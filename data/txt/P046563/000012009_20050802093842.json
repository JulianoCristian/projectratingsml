Nevertheless, some lessons\n            of experience address the following. Some technical lessons\n            suggest the use of thick geo membrane under conventional\n            lining materials to ensure seepage control, while the use of\n            evapo-transpiration (ET) management and remote sensing is\n            effective in assessing, and managing water resources. In\n            addition, the community-driven Land and Water Management\n            Plan (LWMP) process provides an excellent framework to\n            address, in both structural and non-structural terms, the\n            complex water supply, drainage, salinity, high groundwater,\n            agricultural and cropping systems, land management and\n            environmental issues facing typical irrigation systems world\n            wide. Lessons regarding the institutional reform indicate\n            that any process will only be delivered with strong\n            political support, and the right enabling policy and legal\n            framework. The change process to bring about inclusive river\n            basin based integrated water resources management (IWRM)\n            must include both integrated \"bottom-up\" and\n            \"top-down\" measures. Other lessons reinforce the\n            importance of developing mechanisms to define the rights to\n            water for an appropriate natural resources and environmental\n            management, compliant to the river basin management\n            arrangements, achieved through a consultative and inclusive\n            stakeholder representation."}, "docdt": "2005-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
