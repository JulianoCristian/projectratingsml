Some of the negative\n            impacts of the project are: 1) salinization of land within\n            irrigation areas and natural areas of the green corridor\n            (GC); 2) declining groundwater levels throughout the GC, but\n            particularly, the lower (LGC) downstream of Daxihaizi; 3)\n            increasing groundwater salinity in all areas and\n            particularly near irrigation areas; 4) lack of knowledge\n            about groundwater recharge rates, lateral flow rates and\n            discharge rates/areas; 5) there is little information on\n            fish and other aquatic biota; and 6) fisheries based on the\n            three endemic species have collapsed and those species are\n            either extinct or nearly so. Mitigation measures include: 1)\n            groundwater monitoring piezometers should be installed\n            within and adjacent to all irrigation areas. Additional\n            piezometers should be installed at representative locations\n            along surveyed cross-sections across the entire floodplain.\n            There should be at least three cross-sections in each reach,\n            i.e. Qiala to Daxihaizi, Daxihaizi to Yinsu, Yinsu to Alegan\n            and Alegan to Taitema Lake preferably coincident in timing\n            and location to sites where surface water is monitored; 2)\n            water levels should be monitored every 3 months for 2 years\n            to determine seasonal variations, then twice a year after\n            that before and after the summer flood. Water quality\n            samples should be taken on one occasion in the first year\n            and analysed for soil salinity levels (TDS), pH, major ions,\n            alkalinity, mineralization; and 3) fish monitoring is\n            required near each of the major hydrologic monitoring\n            stations along the river so that all parameters can be\n            easily analyzed for establishing habitat condition. The\n            locations should include river, wetland and backwater areas.\n            Sampling effort should be quantified so that catch per unit\n            effort can be defined for each species."}, "docdt": "1999-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
