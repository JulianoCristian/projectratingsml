                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
1.      This restructuring paper seeks the approval of the Country Director to introduce
the following changes in the Indonesia Initiatives for Local Governance Reform Project,
Loan/Credit No. 4790-IND/4078-IND and any accompanying amendments to the
Project's legal documents. The proposed changes, as requested by the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) through the Ministry of Finance, are intended to maintain
implementation support for part C of the Project through the end of FY 2011 by allowing
expenditures previously financed by a DFID co-financing grant to also be covered from
loan proceeds after the DFID grant closes on 31 December, 2010. The Borrower's
proposed changes include: (i) adding an expenditure category of "Goods, consultant
services, workshops and training" under Loan/Credit; and (ii) reallocating the
undisbursed "Grants for Sub-projects" to finance "Goods, consultant services, workshops
and training" in the amount of US$ 1,310,000.
2.       The implementation support in FY 2011 will mainly focus on the
institutionalization of the reform agenda in districts participating in ILGRP, particularly
in the best performing districts, supervision of sub-project construction, and final
evaluation of the program. Two objectives of the final evaluation are: (i) to have a
comprehensive evaluation of program implementation and achievements; and (ii) to
provide lessons learned for similar or scale-up projects in the future. Transfer of assets
from the Central Government to Local Governments will also be carried-out in FY 2011
and has to be completed before the Project closes.



PROJECT STATUS
3.      Past Performance and Implementation Issues. Since the Project's restructuring,
which simplified the Local Governance Reform Framework and kept the number of
participants to the existing participating districts, progress towards achieving the Project
Development Objectives is well on track. Reforms in transparency, participation and
accountability have been undertaken extensively, adapting to specific local
circumstances, as have the reforms related to financial management and procurement.
For example, publication of various types of public information now occurs more
regularly in most districts. Some districts have progressively improved their allocation to
their villages. The quality of districts' financial reports, as verified by the State Audit
Agency, has significantly improved, and the Procurement Units that some districts
created have increased efficiency in procurement processing. Moreover, the Provincial
Coordination Teams (PCTs) have been actively promoting the local governance reforms
of the Project to all non-participating districts in their provinces. Some provinces have

                                             4
begun replicating the Project's reform incentives in their districts. Poverty-targeted
investments are also advancing, from 141 sub-projects in January 2009, before the Mid-
Term Review, to 256 sub-projects, with a total contract amount of US$30.5 million,
which are expected to be completed at the end of the project. A recent study of cost
effectiveness shows that ILGRP sub-projects have an economic internal rate of return of
more than 15%. Based on the overall progress described above, and the improvements
that have been made since the Sixth Implementation Support Mission, the Project is
currently rated as Satisfactory.

4.      Disbursement. As of November 24, 2010, disbursement of Loan 4790-
IND/Credit 4078-IND had reached 79%. The completion of on-going sub-project
construction by the end of the project is estimated to increase the disbursement up to 91%
of the total Loan/Credit.

PROPOSED CHANGES
5.       The primary change to the loan/grant agreement proposed would allow
acitivities currently financed by a DFID co-financing grant to also be financed from
loan/grant proceeds after the DFID grant closes on 31 December, 2010. These
activities were always part of the project description and no change to the project per se
is required.
6.       Reallocating the undisbursed parts of the "Grants for Sub-projects" to finance
"Goods, consultant services, workshops and training". Currently, 79% of the "Grants
for Sub-projects" from Loan/Credit have been disbursed and it is estimated that by the
end of the project, the total disbursement for this category will reach US$27 million or
93% of the total Loan/Credit for this category. GOI requests that the undisbursed part of
this category be reallocated to finance "Goods, consultant services, workshops and
training" to enable the Project to continue support to participating districts, particularly to
institutionalize reforms in the best performing districts, and to carry-out a final project
evaluation.
7.      Add an expenditure category of "Goods, consultant services, workshops and
training" under Loan/Credit. Currently, the category of "Goods, consultant services,
workshops and training" is fully financed by a DFID Grant (TF-055913/IND), which will
be closed on December 31, 2010. Therefore, to enable the reallocated funds to be utilized
after the Grant closes, this additional expenditure category has to be created. Table 3
below provides the revised category of expenditure and allocation of the Loan/Credit.
