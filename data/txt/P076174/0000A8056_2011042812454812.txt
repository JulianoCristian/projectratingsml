                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project well on track in achieving it development objective, and has already attained or exceeded most of its targets. Financial management and procurement reforms and
                         capacity building carried out under the project have significantly improved transparency, accountability, public participation, and local government performance in the 14 participating
                         districts. Almost all of the districts now routinely make public the summaries of their annual budgets, accountability reports, and procurement plans, as well as the estimated amounts
                         of public contracts. The project is now focused on implementing and scaling up more advanced governance improvements in some districts. The project has also financed 249
                         poverty-targeted investment sub projects that were identified by local governments with input from stakeholders. These sub projects include investments in water supply,

                         the sub projects is good and the benefits they provide to local communities is significant.
