"4790", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Initiatives for Local\n            Governance Reform Project for Indonesia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. There are two main categories of lessons\n            learned from this project: one category is lessons on\n            supporting governance reforms at the district level, and the\n            other category is on project design and management. These\n            lessons are collectively derived from the project's\n            final evaluation report, Government of Indonesia\n            (GOI's) project completion report, and the Bank's\n            task team. Lessons learned includes: lessons on\n            district-level governance reforms. An enabling external\n            environment is necessary for governance reforms at the\n            district level. A necessary but not sufficient condition for\n            successful governance reforms at the district level is the\n            existence of an enabling external environment within which\n            districts can then undertake their reforms. Several key\n            ingredients have been identified as contributing to such an\n            enabling environment. Successful district-level governance\n            reforms require strong district leadership and dynamic and\n            engaged civil society. Several internal factors at the\n            district level were also identified as being crucial for\n            implementing successful reform. Lessons on project design\n            and management. Realistic project scope and goals increase\n            the likelihood of project success. A major lesson related to\n            project design which has been discussed earlier in this ICR,\n            and which has wide general application, is to be realistic\n            in what a project can reasonably achieve and to avoid being\n            overly ambitious. Reliance on a governmental transfer\n            mechanism that has not yet been operationalized is likely to\n            raise difficulties for project implementation. A second\n            generally applicable lesson for projects working with\n            sub-national governments in Indonesia is not to\n            underestimate the issue of on-granting of funds. Project\n            design is more likely to remain relevant if it adequately\n            anticipates future evolution of the system in which it\n            operates. A final lesson for projects that focus on\n            decentralization is the importance of ensuring broad\n            consistency with the evolving framework for decentralization\n            in Indonesia."}, "docdt": "2012-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
