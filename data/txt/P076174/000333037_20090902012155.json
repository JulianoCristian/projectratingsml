The Borrower's changes include: (i)\n            reducing the planned number of participating districts; (ii)\n            completing the final round of reforms, simplify the\n            reporting of reform requirements, and discontinue reform\n            requirements that will be difficult to achieve within the\n            next two years; (iii) providing additional incentives to\n            performing districts; (iv) improving implementation support;\n            and (v) reallocating the un-disbursed grant amounts to\n            subprojects. This project paper also proposes to extend the\n            closing date of the loan and credit by twenty-four months to\n            September 2011, and the Department for International\n            Development (DFID) grant by fifteen months to December 2010.\n            These changes are expected to enable the project to focus on\n            the existing participating districts and support them in\n            achieving the development objectives in the next two years."}, "docdt": "2009-08-20T00:00:00Z"}
