The loan will\n            focus on the following areas: i) a public expenditure\n            rationalization component which will support private\n            investment by providing the necessary infrastructure,\n            encouraging the private sector to supply some of the\n            services hitherto supplied by the public sector, and\n            promoting a dynamic role for private investment; ii) a\n            poverty alleviation component which will support a shift in\n            budget expenditure priorities toward the social sectors and\n            the implementation of a poverty alleviation strategy for the\n            nineties; and iii) the continuation of the trade reform\n            program and the simplification of foreign trade procedures."}, "docdt": "1992-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
