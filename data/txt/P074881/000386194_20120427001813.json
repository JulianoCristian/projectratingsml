The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from April 30, 2012 until October 30, 2012. The extension is\n            necessary to allow sufficient time to complete the last\n            ongoing project activity - implementing the IT system for\n            the General Ledger of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz\n            Republic (NBKR). The general ledger is technically complex,\n            and its procurement proved difficult.  Three separate bids\n            were tendered between 2008 and 2011.  The third attempt led\n            to the selection of a contractor in August 2011, nine months\n            later than anticipated in the previous extension request.\n            Contract completion was scheduled for August 2012.  The NBKR\n            hoped to accelerate the contract implementation with a view\n            to complete the project-financed portion prior to the\n            project closing date of April 30, 2012, but by November 2011\n            it became clear that the contract implementation timetable\n            could not be compressed. This will be the third extension of\n            the project. The PDOs continue to be achievable with regards\n            to the payment system reform. The performance of the\n            borrower and NBKR has been satisfactory, as explained above,\n            based on the successful upgrade of the other payment system\n            elements and smooth implementation of the general ledger\n            contract once the complex procurement was completed."}, "docdt": "2012-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
