                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The main objective of the project is to develop a modern integrated national payments system that is accepted and used by the commercial banks and their clients. This
                         will provide basic infrastructure that is essential for the development of a modern banking system that will increase the efficiency of payment services and facilitate the
                         growth of financial intermediation.

                         Settlement (RTGS) System introduced in June 2008 to support large value payments already led to a decrease in the operating cost of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic
                         (NBKR) which was passed on to users through a decrease in transaction costs. The adoption of the new RTGS system positively impacted the Kyrgyz economy by stimulating a
                         substantial increase in its payment system turnover. In spite of last year✇ s political disruptions, the total value of individual transactions processed through the RTGS reached about
                         3 times their original target value. The inter-bank Card Processing Center (CPC) has been operational since December 2006 and usage of the national El-Card continues to grow,

                         reaching over 126,000 cards as of end June, 2011. Another important planned application, the Government payroll reform initiative whereby Government employees salaries are paid
                         through bank accounts instead of cash, also continues to grow with approximately 64,000 employees as of end March 2011 receiving direct deposits of their salaries through
                         commercial bank accounts. The tender for the General Ledger of the NBKR has also been completed successfully with contract implementation launched in September 2011. Due to
                         the recent political developments and turmoil in the Kyrgyz Republic, the planned privatization of the Aiylbank was however postponed and - while still planned is likely to be
                         supported under the new Financial Sector Development operation currently under preparation. Finally, given the limited time left under the Project, the large state-owned bank SSC
                         (Settlement and Savings Company) opted to acquire its new core banking system independently so as not to be bound by restrictive time limits while using the detailed specifications
                         and bidding documents developed under PBSM. The Project was also extended until October 31, 2012 and restructured to allow for full completion of the ongoing General Ledger
                         contract as well as to adjust its scope and size to better capture its actual focus and impact.
