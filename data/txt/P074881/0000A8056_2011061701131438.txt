                         The main objective of the project is to develop a modern integrated national payments system that is accepted and used by the commercial banks and their
                         clients. This will provide basic infrastructure that is essential for the development of a modern banking system that will increase the efficiency of payment
                         services and facilitate the growth of financial intermediation.

                         Substantial progress in implementing the project has been achieved in all components related to the modernization of the national Kyrgyz payments system infrastructure. The Bulk
                         Clearing System (BCS) introduced in October 2006 to support small and medium value size payments in the economy continues to operate well. The new Real Time Gross

                         Settlement (RTGS) System introduced in June 2008 to support large value payments already led to a decrease in the operating cost of the National Bank for the Kyrgyz Republic
                         Bank (NBKR) which was passed on to users through a decrease in transaction costs. The adoption of the new RTGS system positively impacted the Kyrgyz economy by stimulating a

                         substantial increase in the payment system turnover. In spite of last year#s political disruptions, the total value of individual transactions processed through the RTGS exceeded its
                         target value by more than three times. The inter-bank Card Processing Center (CPC) has been operational since December 2006 and usage of the national El-Card continues to
                         grow, reaching over 122,000 units as of end April, 2011. Another important planned application, the Government payroll reform initiative whereby Government employees# salaries
                         are paid through bank accounts instead of cash, also continues to grow with approximately 64,000 employees as of end March 2011 receiving direct deposits of their salaries through
                         commercial bank accounts. Both tenders for the procurement of the General Ledger for the NBKR and the new Core Banking System for the Savings and Settlement Corporation
                         (SSC) have been completed with contract signing expected in June. Due to the recent political developments and turmoil in the Kyrgyz Republic, the planned privatization of the
                         Aiylbank was however postponed.
