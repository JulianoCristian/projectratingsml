Re:
Brazil - Loan No. 3043-BR
Sao Paulo Natural Gas Distribution Project
Shareholder Agreement Amendment
Dear Sirs:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement, dated February 16, 1990, entered into 
between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and 
Companhia de Gas de Sao Paulo - COMGAS, as amended (the Loan Agreement), and the 
Shareholder Agreement, also dated February 16, 1990, entered into between the Bank and 
the State of Sao Paulo and CESP - Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo, as amended (the 
Shareholder Agreement).
COMGAS has requested the amendment of the Shareholder Agreement, for the purpose 
of allowing the postponement of the dates set forth in: (a) Section 2.01 (b) (ii), for 
the enactment of financial regulations for the gas sector; and (b) Section 2.04 (v), 
for the completion of the study of natural gas utilization in the State of Sao Paulo.
Based on the reasons explained in COMGAS' letters No. CT-GCB-005/93 and 006/93, 
dated February 16, 1993, the Bank has agreed with their request, and hereby proposes 
to amend the Shareholder Agreement by deleting the dates set forth in Sections 2.01 
(b) (ii) and 2.04 (v) thereof and substituting them by December 31, 1993 and July 31, 
1993, respectively.
If you agree with the foregoing, please sign the form of confirmation on the 
attached copy of this letter and return it to us.
In view of their interest in this matter, copies of this letter are being sent 
to COMGAS, to the representative of the Guarantor and to the Minister of Mines and 
Energy.
Sincerely yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
