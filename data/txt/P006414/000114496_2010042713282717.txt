Re:

Dear Sire:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement, dated February 16, 1990, entered into 
between the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and 
Companhia de Gas de Sao Paulo - COMGAS, the Borrower (the Loan Agreement), and the 
shareholders Agreement also dated February 16, 1990, entered into between the Bank and 
the State of Sao Paulo (the State) and CESP - Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (the 
Shareholders Agreement). 
COMGAS has requested the amendment of the Shareholders Agreement, for the 
purpose of allowing the postponement of the date set forth in Section 2.04 (v) of the 
Shareholders Agreement, for the completion of the study of Natural Gas Utilization in 
the State of Sao Paulo, which was to be completed by a date not later than 18 months

included under Schedule 2, Description of the Project, Part II, paragraph J, section 
(iii) of the Loan Agreement for Loan 3043-BR.
Based on the reasons explained in COMGAS' letter No. GT-FP-110-91, dated 
December 20, 1991, the Bank has agreed with their request, and hereby proposes to 
amend the Shareholders Agreement by deleting the date set forth in Section 2.04 (v) 
and substituting it by October 12, 1992.
If you agree with the foregoing please sign the Form of Confirmation on the 
attached copy of this letter and return it to us.
In view of their interest in this matter, copies of this letter are being sent 
to the Borrower, COMGAS, to the representative of the Guarantor, the Ministry of 
Economy, Finance and Planning, as well as to the Secretary of Energy in the Ministry 
of Infrastructure.
Sincerely yours,
