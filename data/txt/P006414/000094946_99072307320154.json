The project favored the dialogue between\n            the Bank and the Government, directly contributing to the\n            formulation of a new energy sector strategy and legislation,\n            in addition to the establishment of an adequate regulatory\n            framework in the State of Sao Paulo. Furthermore, the\n            State-owned Companhia de Gas de Sao Paulo (COMGAS), was\n            transformed into a private natural gas distribution company,\n            is listed in the local stock market, and its expansion will\n            be partly financed through the issuance of convertible\n            bonds. The key lessons suggest that: 1) having in place an\n            adequate regulatory framework, with a transparent bidding\n            process for the concession of public services, highly\n            contributed to COMGAS' successful privatization\n            process; 2) the environmental advantages of gas with respect\n            to other fuels, should be taken into consideration upon the\n            formulation of national energy strategies; however,\n            differential tax rates application, in accordance with their\n            respective environmental impacts, could be an option; 3)\n            institutional/legislative changes better succeed when\n            introduced gradually; and, 4) project design should consider\n            accountability, in reference to potential institutional\n            management risks, in addition to management capacity constraints."}, "docdt": "1999-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
