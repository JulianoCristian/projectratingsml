Reallocation of Proceeds

1. Proceeds for the Tanzania, Second Social Action Fund (TASAF II), Credit 4002TA,
   Credit 4636TA and Credit 4741TA, (P085786) will be reallocated as follows:

   a. Credit 4002TA

   The proposed reallocation includes reallocating resources from the Unallocated
   Category under the original Credit No. 4002TA in the amount of SDR 1,000,000.
   SDR 452,000 being 45% of the Unallocated Category is being reallocated to
   Category 1(c) Service Poor Communities to complete 140 subprojects and make them
   functional. The remaining amount of SDR 548,000 which is 55% of the Unallocated
   Category is being reallocated to Category 5 to offset the excess demands placed on
   the operating costs following the continued backstopping by the TASAF Management
   Unit.

Allocation to categories 1(b), 3 and 5 will increase while categories 1(d) and 4 will
decrease at the increased amount as indicated on the revised schedule 1 below. The
increase in Category 1(b), 3 and 5 will be used to i) fund pending 70 VG subprojects
which have already been endorsed by TASAF National steering committee; ii)
facilitate improved delivery of cash transfers to enrolled beneficiaries as well as
studies that will inform the implementation completion report for this project; and iii)
fund operating costs of TASAF management unit following the need by the TMU to
provide support at LGA level respectively. On the other hand the decrease in
Categories 1(d) and 4 is due to savings following completion of capacity building for
community management committees, beneficiaries and other stakeholders.

As the project approaches closure additional funds are required for rigorous follow up
of justification reports, completion and certification of subprojects. Thus reallocation
will increase categories 3 and 5 and reduction in category 4. The reallocated resources
are intended to meet consultancy costs for completion of studies, preparation of ICR
and operating costs. The revised Schedule 1 is as below:

2.      Summary of Project Implementation Progress

     1. The Tanzania Second Social Action Fund Project has been under implementation
        since 2005 and overall the implementation of the project has recorded satisfactory
        progress towards achievement of the development objective. The project has
        recorded the following results: reduced student classroom ratios from 70:1 to 45:1
        in targeted areas, increased the number of people accessing basic services as
        follows: (i) in health to 12,422,046 against a target of 10,449,859; (ii) increased
        the number of people with access to improved water sources to 1,310,256 against
        a target of 1,769,750; (iii) 879,583 people have improved sanitation against a set
        target of 889,250; (iv) 3,321,000 people with access to roads against a target of
        2,823,263; (v) 21,885,445 person days of employment through public works
        created against 16.8 million target; (vi) 1,065,000 people have access to irrigation
        facilities against a target of 248,291; (vii) 325,500 people have access to markets
        against a set target of 348,115. These results have led to citizen satisfaction at the
        rate of 85% (which is the target) in delivery of basic social services in subproject
        targeted areas. In all the interventions, the total number of direct beneficiaries is
        over 20,261,322 against a target of 16 million with the number of female
        beneficiaries at fifty percent. Currently, the disbursement rate for all three credits
        is 99%.


                                                   6
     2. The rapid assessments carried out by independent consultants indicate that the
        project has demonstrated high impact on beneficiary households through the
        savings and investment promotion, which has enabled the savers to increase their
        household assets, to access farm inputs from own resources and increase farm
        acreage under cultivation. The Project has also undertaken social accountability
        interventions through the use of community score cards and citizen report cards,
        including deposition of information in the public domain as a way of exacting
        accountability from implementers at all levels.

     3. Following the successful implementation of the Community-Based Conditional
        Cash Transfer Pilot Project under TASAF II, the experience has in part informed
        the preparation of the Tanzania Productive Social Safety Net Project approved by
        the Board on March 29, 2012.

     4. The Closing Date of the Project is June 30, 2013, which is three years after the
        initial closing date. The Project’s closing date was extended for three years
        following the additional financing credit in 2009. The second additional financing
        in 2010 did not affect the closing date.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to fulfill the following requirements:

     5. As TASAF II nears completion, it has become important that all subprojects
        supported under all the beneficiary categories - the Food Insecure, the Vulnerable
        Groups and the Service Poor communities’ - are completed and functional. In
        addition, the final assessments and studies need to be completed to inform the
        preparation of the Implementation Completion Report.

     6. During the preparation of the Project, one of the design assumptions was that
        there would be existing capacity at the Local Government Authority (LGA) level
        to effectively support the communities as they implement their subprojects. The
        reality on the ground has been that the LGAs needed additional technical support
        and financial management support as TASAF II was scaling up. The scaling up
        was a response to the financial, fuel, and food crisis from 2009 and 2010, which is
        when the project received the additional financing. In order to ensure meeting the
        Development Objectives under the expanded scope, the project was adjusted to
        allow for more handholding of the many LGAs with weaker capacity by the
        TASAF Management Unit. While this approach has stabilized implementation, it
        resulted in the need for more resources for the Operating Cost Category.
