as well. Of eleven project development\n            objective indicators, ten were fully achieved, while one was\n            partially achieved. Of twenty-two intermediate outcome\n            indicators, four were partially achieved, one achieved to a\n            lesser extent, while the remaining were achieved fully and\n            surpassed the target by a significant margin. Crucial\n            lessons learned during the implementation of the project\n            include: 1) the Community Driven Development (CDD) approach\n            is effective in bringing communities deeper into the\n            development process; 2) capacity building, through training,\n            information campaigns and learning-by doing, is essential in\n            supporting the ability of poor communities to directly\n            engage in their own development; 3) the integration with\n            local governments and the national decentralization process\n            should take a longer-term view; 4) integration with sector\n            agencies is important; 5) programs need to be flexible in\n            responding to new circumstances resulting from crises; 6)\n            promoting savings and investment among vulnerable groups can\n            be an important complement to safety net income transfer\n            programs; and 7) building an integrated national safety net\n            system requires integration of its essential components,\n            creating coordination and synergies."}, "docdt": "2013-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
