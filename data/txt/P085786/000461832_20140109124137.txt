opportunities so that they can request, implement and monitor sub-projects that contribute
to improved livelihoods linked to the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicator
targets in the Tanzania Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1. At the time of the approval of the Second Tanzania Social Action Fund Project
(Credit 4002-TA and Grant H134-TA) in October 2004, Tanzania had a population of
35 million with widespread poverty and vulnerability, particularly concentrated in
rural areas, exacerbated by a lack of access to basic services. At a national level, 36
percent of the population was living on less than US$ 1 per day and 19 percent were
below the basic food poverty line. Twenty-nine percent of children suffered from
malnutrition based on weight for age. Life expectancy was estimated at 45 years
while maternal; child and infant mortality rates had continued to deteriorate,
exacerbated by the prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Eighty-seven percent of Tanzanians
lived in the rural areas and only half of these had access to safe water. Only 43
percent of births were attended by a skilled worker, revealing the limited access to
health services and driving the country’s high maternal mortality rate of 860 per
100,000 live births. The Government’s elimination of school fees and adoption of
compulsory enrollment boosted primary enrollment but exacerbated overcrowding
and there was a continued demand for more classrooms. Although gross primary
school enrollment in the country had reached 100 percent, there were challenges of
increasing secondary school enrollment from 11 percent at appraisal.
2. The Government of Tanzania’s poverty reduction strategies were set forth in the
National Poverty Eradication Strategy (NPES, 1997)and Vision 2025 (1998) and
focused on three dimensions: reducing income poverty; improving human
capabilities, survival and social well-being, and addressing extreme vulnerability
among the poor. The Government adopted the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) as the basic minimum achievement for its citizens. Through the NPES
participatory process, priority sectors were identified that would have maximum
impact encompassing education, health, water, agriculture, rural roads and justice,
with the cross-cutting areas of gender, environment, HIV/AIDS, employment and
good governance.

3. The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy, approved on May 22, 2000, and was
aligned with the Government’s poverty reduction strategies. Areas of strategic
importance furthered by TASAF II were: (i) sustainable rural development to improve the
livelihoods of the rural poor, and (ii) improved social infrastructure to improve social
indicators and enhance access to public services for communities with special
emphasis on the poor. The rationale for Bank assistance was based on the Bank’s
previous support through TASAF 1 and its recognized international role in safety nets
and community-driven development (CDD).
4. The Government had significant experience in promoting a CDD approach as a
way of reaching the local level and improving services, especially in primary
education, agriculture, and social protection. Investments using a CDD approach,
including the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF), Participatory Agricultural
Development and Empowerment Project (PADEP), and Primary Education


                                         1
Development Program, were complemented by programs aimed at strengthening the
decentralization process, such as the Local Government Support Program (LGSP), so
that control over resources and decision-making could be better vested with local
government authorities and village councils. The CDD approach was seen as a critical
implementation strategy for effective poverty reduction and part of the country’s
decentralization efforts.

5. The overall decentralization agenda in Tanzania at that time sought to vest greater
levels of responsibilities in the country’s 169 districts. The Government’s
decentralization process aimed to improve intergovernmental fiscal transfers, strengthen
revenue generation for Local Government Authorities (LGAs), and make service delivery
more efficient and equitable through its overarching policy, Decentralization by
Devolution, enacted in 1998. This shifted greater political, administrative, and financial
powers to LGAs. Accordingly, their responsibilities for service delivery in education,
health, agriculture, and infrastructure also increased. However, fiscal decentralization
lagged, to be buttressed in 2004-2005 with the implementation of a formula-based
General Purposeblock grant including funding for local administration expenses and
design of a Local Government Capital Development Grant (LGCDG) system to be
used for funding development expenditures.The challenge to CDD efforts within this
context was to align their operations with the evolving decentralization process as LGAs
increased their role, while continuing to support the village and community levels.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6. The initial project development objective of TASAF II was “to empower
communities to access opportunities so that they can request, implement, and monitor
the delivery of services through subprojects that contribute to improved livelihoods
and are linked to the attainment of the associated Millennium Development Goals
indicators specified in the Tanzania National Strategy for Growth and Poverty
Reduction.”
7. A set of key performance indicators were listed in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) related to increased availability and use of basic and market
services. The PAD further clarified that there were no targets set for these indicators
as the project is demand-driven and the number of sub-projects in each specific sector
could not be determined apriori.

      i.    Increase in citizen satisfaction with delivery of basic social services

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

8. During the mid-term review, the Bank and the Government jointly decided to
rephrase the PDO. The original wording of the PDO was too high level, unclear and it
included processes rather than the project outcomes. It was agreed to restate the PDO
to align it with the specific outcomes of the project components. The reworded was:
“to improve access of beneficiary households to enhanced socioeconomic services
and income-generating opportunities”. The modification did not change the purpose
of the project, it was intended to improve the project's results framework, thereby
making the PDO more realistic and measurable. The reworded PDO was retained as
the formally revised PDO in both of the additional financing projects, as approved by
the Board in June 9, 2009 and June 4, 2010.

9. The key performance indicators were brought into alignment with the rephrased
PDO and refined to a set of outcomes for which the Project could be held directly
accountable of the 12 initial performance indicators 6 high-level outcome indicators
were dropped, 2 modified, 4 retained; and additional indicators for the safety nets
results chain included. The indicators were also aligned with the IDA 15 indicators:

      i.   Number of people with access to improved socio-economic services in
           health facilities, safe drinking water, sanitation, roads, irrigation, and
           markets.
     ii.   Education: student /classroom ratio.
    iii.   Percentage increase in income of targeted vulnerable beneficiary.
    iv.    Number of person-days provided in labor intensive public works program.
     v.    Percentage of citizens satisfied with the delivery of basic social services.

10. Targets were set, though when they reflected sectoral choice by communities they
were to be taken as indicative.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11. TASAF II sub-projects targeted: (i) service-poor communities that lack health,
education, and other socio-economic infrastructure; (ii) able-bodied but food-insecure




                                         3
individuals; and (iii) vulnerable groups which include orphans, widows and
widowers, people affected by HIV/AIDS, unemployed youth and the elderly.
12. Capacity enhancement activities targeted implementing agencies at the national,
regional, local and community levels to effectively support implementation of community
investments. Vulnerable households were also targeted for promotion of savings and
investment groups.

1.5 Original Components as approved

13. The Project had two components:

      i.   The National Village Fund (NVF) financed sub-projects for communities
           to improve their access to basic services, to enable poor households to
           increase their incomes, and to reduce their vulnerability. The NVF was
           and is divided into three types of beneficiary categories:
           a) The Service Poor (SP) -targeted communities lack access to basic
              services and infrastructure, in particular health, education, roads,
              markets and water and sanitation, funding small-scale infrastructure
              investments to help communities attain the MDGs.
           b) The Food Insecure (FI) – targeted households with an effective safety
              net through labor-intensive public works (PW) to increase cash
              incomes; ease acute shortages of food in some seasons and prevent
              these households falling even deeper into poverty.
           c) The Vulnerable Groups (VGs) –targeted households with vulnerable
              individuals including orphans, widows and widowers, people affected
              and infected by HIV/AIDS, unemployed youths and the elderly
              working through community-based groups to implement income-
              generating activities (IGAs). This subcomponent also supported a
              moderate scaling-up of a conditional cash transfer pilot.
           The NVF covered all 121 Local Government Authorities (LGAs) on the
           mainland and in Zanzibar - the two Islands of Unguja and Pemba.
           Resources were allocated to LGAs based on a formula (population,
           poverty level, and geography).Implementation responsibility is through
           local governments, with elected Community Management Committees
           (CMC) procuring materials and managing funds at the village level.

     ii.   The Capacity Enhancement (CE) component supported information
           education and communication campaigns, technical assistance, capacity
           building of LGAs and communities, participatory monitoring and
           evaluation, transparency and social accountability efforts, as well as
           general TASAF project management costs. Through the Community
           Savings Investment Program (COMSIP) it supports training to vulnerable
           individuals to help them develop group savings schemes.



                                        4
1.6 Revised Components
14.     The components were not revised. All additional financing was channeled
through the original components although the intended beneficiary groups and coverage
varied. The first additional financing project narrowed its focus to the Food Insecure
(public works) and Vulnerable Groups (including CB-CCT beneficiaries), and funding
only districts targeted as food insecure, in keeping with the nature of the emergency
response. The second additional financing project expanded the scope to include Service
Poor community projects due to the effects of inflation on completion of many sub-
projects, in priority districts with food insecurity, having experienced natural disasters.


1.7 Other significant changes
15.    The initial scope of the project was expanded in 2006 to include a pilot
community-based conditional cash transfer (CB-CCT) program financed through a US$
1,972,915 Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant as a potential component of a
national safety net, testing how the CDD approach could deliver these services.

16.     One of the most significant changes in the project occurred in response to
international economic shocks and local weather shocks. In 2008, the international food,
fuel and finance crisis caused rising domestic prices for food and farm inputs. At the
same time, the failure of the short rain season increased food insecurity and caused an
expansion in the number of vulnerable households. Due to increased cost of transport and
price of almost all kinds of construction materials there was substantial need for
additional funds to enable communities complete on-going sub-projects as well as an
expansion in the number of households in need. In response to these issues there were
two additional financing credits. The first Additional Financing Project of US$30 million
was part of the Tanzania Accelerated Food Security Program approved by the Board of
Directors on June 9, 2009 under the Global Food Crisis Response Program The
Additional Financing was directed only to food-insecure districts and included Food-
Insecure and Vulnerable Groups sub-projects only. The Second Additional Financing
Project of US$35 million under the Pilot Crisis Response Window (CRW) was approved
by the Board of Directors on June 4, 2010 in response to the impacts of the global
financial and food crisis, natural calamities as well as sustained inflationary pressures
providing financing to meet the needs of increased sub-project costs.

17.      The project had two Level-1 restructurings. The first one was approved on June 9,
2009 when the PDO was reworded; the key performance indicators were revised and the
Closing Date was extended to June 30, 2012 during preparation of the first additional
financing. The second one was approved on June 4, 2010 during the second Additional
Financing whereupon the closing date was extended to June 30, 2013, and the IDA
indicator on Direct Beneficiaries was added at PDO level. A Level-2 restructuring was
also approved by the Country Director on May 29, 2013, where resources were
reallocated across categories to allow for finalization of the agreed project completion
activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.     The design of TASAF II built on the accomplishments of TASAF I. TASAF I was
one of the first and most widely recognized CDD efforts in Tanzania, channeling sub-
project financial assistance directly to the community level for priorities identified locally
and managed through local project management committees. TASAF I financed sub-
projects which led to (a) improved socioeconomic infrastructure and basic services; (b)
increased capacity and skills among rural and peri-urban communities; and (c)
employment opportunities in a safety-nets program for poor households in selected
regions in the country. TASAF I proved the CDD approach could work, with important
benefits for local transparency and empowerment, reduced unit cost and increased
relevance of local investments. .
19.     TASAF II had nationwide coverage, and it aimed at scaling up community service
provision and capacity building from 40 districts and in Zanzibar in the two Islands under
TASAF I. Under TASAF I, CDD intervention modalities were well-tested and lessons
integrated in the design of TASAF II.TASAF I also served as the basis to pilot activities
that would be scaled up in TASAF II. For example a pilot of community-managed public
works created a basis for TASAF II’s labor intensive public works program. Support to
vulnerable groups was also piloted in TASAF I that became one of the beneficiary
categories in TASAF II. The World Bank’s global and regional expertise on CDD and
safety nets and community savings and investment promotion also helped inform project
design.

Key lessons learned that were reflected in the design of TASAF II include:
20.     Better integration with sectoral norms. Experience in the implementation of
TASAF I identified the problem of sector norms and standards that exist, but are poorly
enforced at the Village Council (VC) and LGA levels for a variety of reasons. To address
this issue, TASAF II adopted sectoral standards for facility design, for example schools
and health posts, developed by the sectoral ministries. To address the lax enforcement of
sectoral norms and standards at the local level, TASAF II established a Sectoral Expert
Team, chaired by the Prime Minister’s Office -Regional Administration and Local
Government and comprised of higher level representatives from sectoral ministries to
review and authorize all subprojects for conformity with sector norms and standards and
ensure any necessary staffing positions or additional equipment were integrated into
sector planning. TASAF was now seen as helping sectors enforce their norms and deliver
on their mandates.

21.     Further integration with the on-going decentralization process. TASAF I as a
pure CDD approach introduced the concept of direct funding of community-managed
sub-projects. TASAF II marked the shift to greater LGA involvement to support the
nation’s decentralization process. As the country moved to transferring greater
responsibility to local governments, TASAF’s operating procedures were adjusted to
integrate LGAs into the sub-project cycle. Specifically, rather than direct from TASAF


                                              6
accounts to community accounts, sub-project funds would be transferred through the
LGAs development accounts to the communities, consistent with the evolving Local
Government Capital Development Grant (LGCDG) fiscal transfer system.

22.    Greater support to local governments and communities. In addition to training
and equipment, the design of TASAF II provided LGAs with 2.5 percent of a subproject
budget to facilitate the community planning process, 5 percent to supervise
implementation, with 2.5 percent provided to village councils to facilitate community
mobilization and monitor implementation.

23.    Shift to a greater safety net focus. TASAF II design sought to scale up TASAF’s
role in the nascent national safety net in Tanzania as a way of reaching vulnerable
communities and households. For example, public works implementation using the CDD
approach was piloted under TASAF I and found to be more reliable for timely payments
and vested with increased social accountability at the local level than when public works
were managed by district governments. Similarly the piloting of a community based
conditional cash transfer demonstrated a monitoring role of the community and the timely
payment of transfers by the community management committees.

24.     Piloting ways to help vulnerable groups create savings mechanisms. Under the
Capacity Enhancement component, support would be given to individuals interested in
the formation of voluntary savings groups of at least 10 members. The objective was to
have income support via public works contribute to household risk management by
creating opportunities for increased savings and investment. There were some minor
shortcomings in preparation. The PDO was process-oriented and not sufficiently linked to
outcomes for which the project could be held accountable. While it attempted to link the
project with broader national goals like attainment of the MDGs, most key performance
indicators focused on higher level sector objectives. This was an effort at improving over
the output-oriented indicators used in TASAF I. It also reflected the evolution of Bank
thinking on design of key performance indicators at the time. During the preparation of
TASAF II in 2004, most PRSPs were strongly linked to the achievement of the MDGs. In
that regard, TASAF indicators were also related to sectors’ contributions to that process.
In attempting to move from output to outcome indicators, TASAF II overshot,
incorporating higher level sectoral objectives where direct attribution of the project was
less clear. This was very consistent with other project cohorts at the time. In addition, the
monitoring and evaluation system was ambitious, calling for multiple levels of audits,
evaluations and participatory monitoring tools to be carried out frequently. These minor
shortcomings had no direct effect on the achievement of project development objectives
and so are considered minor and reflective of the state of the art at the time rather than
any real task team shortcomings.
25.     Overall, risks were deemed modest. The risk of low capacity in LGAs was
appropriately rated as high and addressed by simplifying processes in the Operational
Manual and by designing a capacity enhancement program tailored to supporting the
ability of LGAs to undertake the expanded sub-project cycle responsibilities. In addition,
each LGA was required to assign a coordinator and accountant with direct responsibility
for TASAF II activities. Memoranda of understanding were signed between the TASAF


                                             7
Management Unit (TMU) and each LGA. And greater reliance on local governments also
exposed the project to a risk, rated as substantial that the national decentralization process
might stall. This risk was controlled at the national level through commitments to the
process of decentralization agreed upon under the Local Government Support Project
approved concomitantly with TASAF II. In addition, TASAF specified clear divisions of
responsibilities between LGAs (supported under the LGSP) and village councils that had
more direct implementation responsibilities using TASAF’s CDD approach.
2.2 Implementation
26.     Implementation timeframe. The project was approved by the Bank’s Board of
Directors on November 30, 2004 and effectiveness declared on May 11, 2005. The first
Additional Financing (AF-I) was approved on June 9, 2009 and the second additional
financing on June 4, 2010. The original closing date was December 31, 2009 which was
extended to June 30, 2012, with the first additional financing. The closing date was
extended again to June 30, 2013 following approval of the second additional financing
project.
27.    Implementation issues and corrective measures. At the end of the first year,
implementation progress rating was downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory due to
delays in filling director-level key positions in the TASAF management unit (TMU).
Subsequently, a Results Based Action Plan was agreed upon to facilitate smoother and
more efficient implementation and staff recruitment completed.
28.    A mid-term review was carried out in two phases (Phase I in November 2007 and
Phase II in March 2008).An institutional assessment of TASAF, a beneficiary assessment
and a technical audit were conducted to inform the review. Satisfactory implementation
progress was noted. Findings of the technical audit and beneficiary assessments pointed
to good technical quality and high levels of beneficiary satisfaction.
29.     Several issues were raised during the Mid-Term Review. The Bank team and
Government agreed on the need to clarify the wording of the Project Development
Objective and amend key performance indicators to better specify the project’s results
framework TASAF’s organizational structure was adjusted to better address bottlenecks
and work overloads between departments within TASAF II implementing structures.
And, to address theeconomic price shocks facing communities and LGAs, the community
contribution rate was reduced from 20 to 15 percent. The project had two resource
reallocations responding to the need for the TMU to support the LGAs as they have
insufficient capacity.
30.     During the final year of project implementation, the government issued a circular in
June 2012 freezing all LGA bank accounts, including TASAF accounts, in order to
operationalize the new system limiting LGAs to six bank accounts as the basic structure of
the fiscal transfer system. This had the unintended effect of causing delays in sub-project
completion and delayed transfers to the CB-CCT beneficiary households, although this
had no adverse impact on achieving project objectives.




                                              8
31.     Responding to Crises. The project was scaled up in 2009 to respond to the demand
to support to the food insecure households through PWP in selected districts during the
global financial, fuel, and food crisis.
32.    Innovative initiatives taken during implementation. During implementation, there
were several innovative initiatives not planned during project design:
      i.   Conditional cash transfers. A pilot community-based conditional cash transfer
           (CB-CCT) was initiated in 2008 in three district councils covering 80 villages
           (40 for treatment and 40 for control, according to the experimental evaluation
           model). The program started by providing transfers to about 2,500 households
           increased to 11,576 (28,480 beneficiaries) by project closing.
     ii.   Community foundations working in collaboration with the SDN, TASAF
           introduced the concept of community foundations to Tanzania. CF’s are non-
           profit organizations who seek philanthropic contributions primarily from
           inside the community and provide grants to a variety of local needs. TASAF
           supported the formation of CFs in Arusha, Kinondoni, Morogoro and Mwanza
           as a way of promoting local sustainability of efforts toward vulnerable groups.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
33.    Design of project monitoring and evaluation was based on a participatory
monitoring and evaluation framework. The management information system (MIS) was
based on the experience and systems used in TASAF I, but it was altered to reinforce the
more prominent role of LGAs. Responsibility for the decentralized computerized MIS
was transferred from TASAF to the LGAs. Participatory monitoring and evaluation tools
were planned, consistent with the project’s CDD methodology included beneficiary
assessments, Community Score Cards, and Citizens Report Cards, to capture the
perspectives of beneficiaries and the wider public on the project. Technical audits,
baseline studies, ex-post evaluations and randomized impact evaluations were designed
to ensure robust measurement of project achievements.
34.     The project was able to adequately track and report on progress as well as create a
sufficient evaluative basis to draw conclusions about project performance. Measurements
on achievement of several of the initial project key performance indicators were not
being done by the project but the ministries through Household Budget Surveys or sector
specific surveys and administrative data. These data were not available by 2007/8 during
the project MTR, but as the country was reporting on the MDG indicator targets, the
information is now available and has been used in the assessment of the PDO before the
restructuring. At MTR there was agreement to change the KPIs to make them more
focused and related to outcomes for which the project could be held accountable.

35.    At an operational level, the integration and decentralization of the computerized
MIS was not fully achieved because the EPICOR system at the district level did not take
into consideration the needs of the project even though there had been agreements. This
notwithstanding, the TASAF MIS system was able to sufficiently track inputs and
outputs. The evaluations varied in breadth and rigor, though most provided significant
evidence on outcomes as well as qualitative findings that drove program improvements.


                                            9
For example, the process evaluation of the CB-CCT pilot was instrumental in designing
an effective scale-up of the program. Some of the innovative participatory M & E tools,
like the Community Score Cares and Citizens Report Cards piloted during
implementation, proved to be difficult and costly to repeat with the required frequency.
Randomized impact evaluations were carried out for both the Vulnerable Groups
component and the CB-CCT program. The VGs evaluation measured consumption and
assets but not income, which is more difficult to accurately assess but was the selected
key performance indicator.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.     Safeguards. The Project triggered safeguard policies OP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement due to the eligible types of sub-
projects, with an environmental screening category of B. Environmental and social
safeguard aspects were outlined in the Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) and incorporated into the Operational Manual, the Service
Guidelines for Community Participation and the Community Project Management
handbook, Environmental screening was done by the district staff.Training was provided
to all LGAs’ designated Environmental Management Officers to carry out this function.
37.     Technical audits reviewed the ESMF and found it to be comprehensive and
adequate to ensure the proper mainstreaming of environmental and social concerns into
TASAF-II funded subprojects. Some shortcomings were observed in implementation due
to inadequate knowledge in some LGAs and at community levels. However, field visits
found, on the whole, no significant negative environmental and social impacts.
Subprojects were undertaken in an environmentally sound manner due to being small in
nature and focused on rehabilitation or improvements or existing infrastructure.Analysis
of findings in various studies revealed that subprojects such as tree planting nurseries,
village forests conservation, storm water drainage systems rehabilitation and livestock
keeping that emphasized zero grazing have considerably contributed to environmental
protection. The technical audit found still inadequate capacity in most of the LGAs as
officials designated as Environmental Management Officers (EMOs) were not well
trained to handle environmental and social issues comprehensively.
38.    Fiduciary compliance. TASAF II’s fiduciary systems were based on the
community management of sub-project procurement and financial management, an
approach used successfully in TASAF I. The funds for sub-projects were transferred
through LGA accounts to support the supervisory role they played, and then deposited
into CMC accounts. Payments were made directly by the community management
committees. Simplified financial management tools and training were provided to CMCs.
39.     Financial management was downgraded to unsatisfactory during the initial year of
implementation due to prolonged vacancies of the Director of Finance and Director of
Internal Audit positions. It was upgraded to satisfactory by 2007 as the issue was
addressed, with no negative lasting effects on the project. Community management of
funds was found to be satisfactory throughout project implementation. Audits were
submitted in a timely fashion and were unqualified.


                                           10
40.     In terms of procurement, under TASAF supported sub-projects, all procurement
activities were undertaken by the CMCs. The activities included selection of contractors
and/or purchase of inputs and payment of wages and transfers in the case of the cash
transfer pilot. TASAF and LGAs provided training and support to communities in this
process. Procurement under the Capacity Enhancement componentwas under the
responsibility of TMU. Due to perceived weakness and lack of experience at the district
and village council levels, procurement risks were rated as high. TASAF undertook
training for LGAs and LGAs in turn trained communities.
41.    In general, procurement performance was good throughout implementation.
TASAF was one of the three projects in the Tanzania portfolio rated as doing well
according to a 2009 CPPR survey. The Public Procurement Authority commended
TASAF for its good performance. Community contracting of sub-projects was a
successful learning by doing experience that not only created local capacity but also
increased transparency in contracting. The Technical Audit found that community-
management of procurement was “a transparent and economical procurement method at
the grassroots community level”. This notwithstanding, procurement was temporarily
downgraded to moderately satisfactory when the TASAF Procurement Manager
remained vacant for eighteen months.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
42.     Sub-project operation and maintenance (O&M) arrangements. TASAF is not
directly responsible for operations and maintenance, but performance in O&M affects the
sustainability of the investments funded by TASAF. O & M arrangements vary by sub-
project type:

      i.   Investments in classrooms and educational facilities have a strong likelihood
           of being sustained. The Government has prioritized the provision of teachers
           to reach its goal of full enrollment in basic education. School committees
           received training on routine maintenance, however funding is limited
           especially when major repairs are needed.
     ii.   In the health sector, sustainability of the services depends on provision of
           staffing and other essential inputs. Making health centers functional after
           completion was an issue in TASAF I, in the sector in Tanzania and most
           countries in the region. In TASAF II, the issue was raised to the highest levels
           of Government, detailing overdue health staffing needs. Performance
           improved and the impact assessment (July 2013) found that 98 percent of
           health centers were functioning. Only 10 percent of health center users felt
           staffing and/or medical supplies were insufficient.
    iii.   In the road sector, all major roads supported under TASAF II are included in
           the official national road network and these come under the responsibility of
           district councils to maintain. TASAF focused on road rehabilitation, avoiding
           opening new roads that would have created incremental costs of maintenance.
           Supported few new road constructions as can be witnessed to by the indicator
           on roads constructed vis-a-vis rehabilitations. Most of the improvements, like


                                            11
           installing culverts, may have increased sustainability of the roads. Labor-
           intensive road works were done to support food insecure households helped in
           keeping roads in better shape. Roads account for about one-tenth of TASAF
           sub-projects.
    iv.    Sustainability is a sector wide challenge in the water sector in Tanzania.
           Water systems are to be operated and maintained by water users associations
           with technical support from LGAs, which often lack sufficient technical or
           financial resources. A field review of TASAF subprojects found limitations
           reflective of these broader sectoral issues. While indicative, firm conclusions
           cannot be drawn due to the small sample size of projects visited (ten villages)
           in the ex-post field review. In half of the villages visited, water systems
           installed by TASAF support were either not functioning or only partially
           functioning. This was due to a variety of factors, including seasonal water
           shortages due to insufficient rains, technical problems, or irregular water
           supply from the water utility company, or failure of communities to pay for
           the water bills. For dams and shallow wells, seasonal drought during the
           moment visited explained the limited functionality finding. Overall, water
           sub-projects represent only about 5 percent of the overall TASAF portfolio.
     v.    Markets have a high likelihood of being operated and maintained as they
           generate revenue directly through stall fees.


43.    Based on a sector breakdown of 63 percent of sub-projects in education, 14
percent in health, 10 percent in water and 13 percent other sectors, the majority of
TASAF II infrastructure investments have reasonable expectations of sustainability.
TASAF II paid greater attention to operations and maintenance plans (though ex-post
assessments often found these insufficient) by involving LGA/Islands, sectors and
communities in O & M expectations. System-wide sustainability challenges remain
which must be addressed at the sectoral level, particularly in water and roads.
44.     For Vulnerable Groups, members have been able to accumulate assets,
particularly livestock assets, pointing to longer-term sustainability of these investments.
The technical audit found that the businesses surveyed seem to be profitable but faced
risks of liquidity also affected by inflation, not able to grow into bigger concerns due
limited markets especially in remote districts. The cash transfer benefits from the safety
net activities were intended to address immediate consumption needs. Sustainability of
the CB-CCT operations is insured through the scale-up in the next phase of the program
where beneficiaries will be reached with financial management information so they start
to save both in cash and in-kind.
45.      Sustaining institutional capacity. The likelihood of sustaining the institutional
capacity created during TASAF II is high. TASAF continues to be a priority program of
the Government and has been slated for a primary role in developing the nation’s safety
net system. At the level of LGAs and communities, sustainability of the general skills and
technical abilities is likely as they continue to be engaged not only in follow-on TASAF
activities but in the broader range of development activities at the local level. The

capacity enhancement component also sought to promote savings and investment at the
household level through the COMSIP program. Relatively high repayment rates reported
on ex-post evaluations enables members to continuously access loans from own and
group savings; and at the same time helps build sustainability of the groups.
46.     Next phase/follow-on operations. The success of TASAF II helped consolidate a
longer-term commitment of the Government of Tanzania and donors to scaling up a
safety net system for the country. On March 29, 2012, the World Bank approved the first
phase of the Tanzania Productive Safety Net (PSSN) Adjustable Program Loan (APL-1)
of $220 million to create a comprehensive productive social safety net system for the
poor and vulnerable. The first phase of PSSN (FY2013-FY2018) will support labor
intensive public works and a cash transfer intervention using the institutional structure
and capacity developed in TASAF II. APL II (FY2018-FY2022) second phase, would
build on these foundations to consolidate the safety net, deepen technical improvements
and further scale-up safety net activities. These efforts are being hastened now as the
Government of Tanzania is in the process of scaling up the PSSN to reach 1.2 million
households by 2015 in order to reduce extreme poverty.



3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial
47.     Relevance of objectives. TASAF II and the subsequent additional financing
projects were well-aligned with national goals and strategies aimed to improve service
delivery to the poor and to increase income opportunities.TASAF II remained a core
component of IDA strategies as well. The CAS (Report No. 38625), approved in March
2007, aimed to develop social safety nets to assist the rural poor and vulnerable, with
IDA support through TASAF taking the lead in increasing capacities of communities to
prioritize, implement, and manage sustainable development initiatives to improve
socioeconomic services and opportunities.
48.     Relevance of design. The project design built on the successful TASAF I
experience but paid close attention to integrating lessons learned. In particular, the better
integration with the on-going decentralization process and the sector programs in health,
education, roads and water increased the project’s relevance.
49.     Relevance of implementation. The project remained relevant throughout
implementation, displaying flexibility to responding to evolving country needs (such as
safety nets) as they emerged. The additional financing approved during implementation
allowed for a rapid scale-up response to international economic and weather shocks. And,
the piloting of the community-based CCT program under TASAF II created the
foundation for a scaling up under the follow-on nationwide operation the Productive
Social Safety Net Project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial
50.     The project’s development objective was re-worded and outcome indicators were
re-focused in the first Additional Financing package. According to the August 2006 ICR
Guidelines (revised Oct 5, 2011), the project outcome should be assessed against both the
original 1 and revised 2 PDO. In both, the project sought to enhance access to income and
services. There was no substantive change in the PDO, just a clearer specification of the
objective and revised indicators to better measure project outcomes. This section first
discusses project outcomes prior to restructuring then goes into greater depth on the
cumulative end of project outcomes.

Assessing achievement of project development objectives prior to restructuring
51.     The project’s development objective and outcome indicators were formally
restructured in the Additional Financing package approved by the Board on June 9, 2009.
According to the August 2006 ICR Guidelines (revised Oct 5, 2011), the final rating for
project outcome should be assessed against both the original and revised project
objectives.

52.     Prior to restructuring, the project had been consistently rated as satisfactory in
meeting development objectives. There were 12 key performance indicators prior to
restructuring. Many of these original key performance indicators were higher-level
sectoral objectives only collected through periodic national surveys or the final project
impact evaluation, and therefore were not reported on at restructuring but can be reported
for the ICR. KPI outcomes at the time of restructuring are presented in the table below.
Six of the twelve had project-level data that confirmed satisfactory progress toward
meeting the PDO. Several were sector wide measures with national data that showed
progress toward meeting national sectoral objectives and/or MDGs, three of which had
direct attribution linkages to TASAF II activities. Only one indicator out of the 12 was
not met at either the project or sectoral level – the number of operational drug revolving
funds – and this because sectoral reporting on the indicator was not available.




1
 Original PDO: “to empower communities to access opportunities so that they can request, implement, and
monitor the delivery of services through subprojects that contribute to improved livelihoods and are linked
to the attainment of the associated Millennium Development Goals indicators specified in the Tanzania
National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction”.”
2
 Revised PDO: “to improve access of beneficiary households to enhanced socioeconomic services and
income-generating opportunities.”

53.      There is sufficient information on expanded access to services which contributed
directly and indirectly to attainment of the MDGS as per the original PDO (before
restructuring) to indicate satisfactory progress towards the project development objective
at the time of restructuring. These outcomes were achieved based on TASAF II outputs,
including seventy-seven health centers constructed, increasing access for 395,000
beneficiaries and 1,515 classrooms built, helping address overcrowding. The beneficiary
assessment found that these completed schools and other facilities were enabling
communities to access the services within shorter walking distance. Four million person
days of temporary employment was generated (even though income could not be
measured), benefitting 248,000 people, with women representing 51 percent of
beneficiaries who were able to smooth consumption and buy some assets.

Assessing achievement of project development objectives at project closing

54.     In terms of final project outputs (Annex 2 has the details), TASAF II financed
8,480 sub-projects benefitting an estimated 18.7 million people, including 3,764 Service
Poor sub-projects, 1,683Food Insecure sub-projects and 3,033Vulnerable Group sub-
projects. The achievements in terms of numbers of subprojects surpassed the original
target by 14 percent. Technical audits confirmed the overall quality of the sub-projects
and eighty-seven percent of citizens surveyed were satisfied with the delivery of these
basic services. The beneficiary assessment found that sub-projects were perceived as
having a significant contribution to social and economic improvements.

55.      The final project outcomes are assessed against the revised PDO and key
performance indicators. These were realigned to better reflect intended objectives and to
better identify indicators against which TASAF II could reasonably be held accountable,
as opposed to tracking sector-wide outcomes. There were 6 revised KPIs with a clearer
specification of the results chain linking TASAF II outputs with these outcomes. The
overall results are provided in the table below and discussed in detail in this section
looking at the overall goals of increased access to basic services and income generating
activities:

indicators. (iii) The project has six indicators as in the table above. It is important to note that the first
indicator has six sub-indicators (i) - (vi); in the ICR Data Sheet these appear as indicators 1 - 6 because the
format is different.


Enhanced access to basic socio-economic services
56.   TASAF II significantly expanded access to basic services. Specific outputs (see
Annex 2) and outcomes by sector include:
  i.     In the education sector, TASAF II financed 7,779 classrooms as well as
         complementary educational facilities (1,250 teacher houses, 179 student
         dormitories, 626 staff offices, 222 administrative blocks, 166 laboratories, and 12
         school libraries). Over 90 percent of these sub-projects were functioning at the
         time of the final project evaluation. These investments made a substantial
         contribution to achieving full enrollment, reducing congestion and increasing
         school quality. The provision of teacher housing with solar power facilities or
         connection to the national grid was important for keeping teachers in the poorer
         rural areas. Classroom construction supported the national drive to expand
         coverage of lower secondary school. TASAF II eased overcrowding in classrooms
         in project areas. The project targeted 45:1 student/classroom ratio, which was
         used as a sub-project design parameter following sectoral norms. Indicative
         findings from the final impact assessment report of a small sample of classrooms
         visited up to eight years later found 63:1 median at primary level and 47:1 at


                                                     17
       secondary level, a significant reduction from the 70:1 as of 2004. Although robust
       conclusions cannot be drawn given the small sample size, indications point to
       TASAF’s longer-term contribution to reducing overcrowding at both the primary
       and secondary levels versus the situation at Project appraisal. The increase over
       time at the primary level reflects continued population pressure as well as
       adoption of Government policy of mandatory primary schooling which caused the
       Government to not enforce the sectoral student/classroom norms, In addition, in
       part the student demand at TASAF-supported schools was influenced by the more
       attractive learning environment created, including water supply and sanitation,
       availability of desks and greater security with fencing. Qualitative assessments of
       education beneficiaries reported increased teacher morale and lower teacher and
       student absenteeism, among other benefits.

ii.    In the health sector, TASAF II supported 1,777 health centers or dispensaries
       which improved access to health services, 96 percent of which were operational at
       the time of final impact evaluation (2013). Health centers improved accessibility
       to basic health services compared to the situation before TASAF II interventions.
       The impact assessment found that TASAF II made a significant contribution in
       basic health services in nearly all studied communities. First, the geographical
       coverage of households within a short distance to improved health facilities has
       significantly improved the accessibility to basic health services for many people
       compared to the situation before TASAF interventions. Secondly, the construction
       of medical staff houses made the provision of emergency services to community
       members possible as the medical personnel were readily available at the health
       facilities Qualitative assessments of health beneficiaries reported reduce time and
       cost of accessing facilities, increased use of child and pre-natal health services,
       and reported decreases in morbidity and mortality.
iii.   In roads, 7,382 kilometers of feeder roads were improved under TASAF II,
       directly benefitting 3.6 million rural and peri-urban dwellers. The final impact
       assessment found that benefits from these road projects included better access to
       social services, like health facilities, schools; increased access to
       commercialization of farm products, decreased transport charges, and increased
       overall mobility.
iv.    In the water and sanitation sector, 1.7 million Tanzanians had increased access to
       improved water sources and 0.9 million to improved sanitation under TASAF II.
       Qualitative assessments of beneficiary perception of impacts found that water
       accessibility improved in terms of shorter distances to fetch water as well as
       reduced household expenditures on purchases from more expensive water vendors
       in urban and peri-urban areas. These positive impacts were tempered with in cases
       where systems faced temporary water shortages or mechanical problems.
 v.    Economic infrastructure was built and/or rehabilitated, including 90 markets, 248
       irrigation systems and 5,289 hectares of land conserved. Over one million people
       benefitted from the irrigation and market sub-projects.




                                           18
Increased access to income-generating opportunities
57.    TASAF II sought to have a direct economic effect on vulnerable households
through wages paid in labor-intensive public works to the able-bodied Food Insecure
households, investments in income-generating activities for Vulnerable Groups and
through the conditional cash transfer program.
  i.   PWP for the Food Insecure Households.1,577 public works sub-projects were
       implemented under TASAF II, reaching 265,872 beneficiaries, 47 percent of
       whom were women. A total of 15,952,320 person-days of temporary work were
       generated. On average each beneficiary earned about $110 for 65 days of work.
       Eighty-five percent of beneficiaries surveyed in the final impact assessment stated
       that the wages paid increased their household food security. Household
       expenditure analysis found that 91 percent spent PWP income on purchasing food.
       Other major expenditures included scholastic materials (45 percent), clothes
       (44percent), medical care (19 percent) and investment in income generating
       activities (18 percent). In addition, household surveys found a significant
       improvement in the frequency of meals eaten per day. In terms of longer-term
       impacts, 85 percent of the beneficiaries stated that they had acquired some work
       skills through their engagement in PWP.
 ii.   Vulnerable Groups sub-projects supported income-generating investments.
       Reflecting the rural setting of the majority of the target vulnerable, about half of
       the IGA groups invested in poultry farming, 28 percent in dairy cattle (mainly for
       milk to sale and to improve nutrition), 11 percent for goat-keeping and the
       remaining 11 percent on agricultural processing/milling and tree husbandry. A
       rapid assessment (2013) found that nearly all respondents were earning income
       from the IGAs they had established. Over 50 percent of the respondents used their
       incomes on purchasing food for their families (80 percent), clothing (60 percent),
       paying scholastic requirements for their children (50 percent), or for health
       purposes (30 percent). Over 50 percent of the respondents were practicing
       banking even though the amounts banked were not large. A randomized impact
       evaluation found for the initial year of operation, there was a large and significant
       effect on asset accumulation by VG members, about eight-fold in value calculated
       among all subprojects. There was no change in consumption levels as this was the
       initial year when groups concentrated on building their enterprises with the
       exception of those keeping dairy cattle as they used some of the milk for
       improving the nutrition of those with HIV/AIDS and orphans. This accumulation
       of assets can lead to future increased consumption as well as provide households
       asset buffers in times of future shocks.
iii.   Conditional cash transfers reached 28,480 beneficiaries providing eligible
       households with direct income transfers to promote human capital development
       since conditionalities required that primary school aged children be enrolled and
       attend school, that children 0-2 be fully vaccinated and participate in regular
       growth monitoring, and that the elderly (60+)family members visit a health
       facility for a basic health check-up. A randomized impact evaluation found that:



                                            19
      a) Transfers were associated with significantly more visits to health clinics,
         especially in the first year. This is true overall and for the program’s target
         sub-populations: children and the elderly. Participating households were 5
         percent less likely to be sick and children age 0-4 were 11 percent less likely
         to be sick. Health improvements due to the CB-CCT program are even more
         marked for the poorest households. In addition, participating households were
         much more likely to purchase health insurance by subscribing to the Tanzania
         Community Health Insurance Fund.
      b) In education, the program showed clear positive impacts on whether children
         had ever attended school or if they completed Standard 7. The primary school
         completion effect is particularly striking for girls, who were 23 percentage
         points more likely to complete Standard 7 than comparison groups. In addition,
         literacy rates increased significantly for children who were out of school at
         baseline.
      c) Other signs of improved well-being among beneficiary households include: a
         large impact on whether children own shoes (significant for health and school
         attendance), CB-CCT beneficiary households tend to purchase additional
         goats and chickens and had twice the likelihood of having non-bank savings
         versus control groups. CB-CCT households invested in more livestock assets.
         Focus groups revealed that households purchased chickens and other animals
         and used them to create businesses (e.g., selling eggs or chicks) or in order to
         have easily sellable, productive savings. The program did not significantly
         affect savings or spending on average, although the poorest half of households
         saw a five-fold, highly significant increase in non-bank savings.
iv.   Community Savings and Investment Program (COMSIP) Training. In addition to
      these direct measures to improve the economic base of vulnerable households, the
      Capacity Enhancement component sought to promote savings and investment
      practices through training in formation of local savings and investment groups.
      TASAF only financed the training (in group formation, basic financial management,
      etc.). At end of the project, COMSIP facilitated formation of 1,778 savings groups
      with 22,712 individual savers. An earlier review had found an average
      mobilization of about $700 per group, with relending of about 79 percent of the
      saved amount to their members. An ex-post evaluation of COMSIP found that
      group members were gradually developing a culture of borrowing from own and
      group savings and repayment rate was high. Moreover, the practice of repaying
      promptly enabled other members to access loans and helped the sustainability of
      the groups.

3.3 Efficiency

58.   Economic analysis of TASAF II investments is reviewed in Annex 3. Overall,
economic efficiency was substantial as evidenced by:
a) For Service-Poor communities, sub-projects’ unit cost savings of between 19 and 153
   percent were realized when compared to sectoral ministries and the National
   Construction Council’s standard costs for construction nationwide. The CDD
   approach was credited with these savings through community involvement in
   procurement and supervision and the avoidance of contractor overheads and profits.
b) For the safety net public works program, labor intensity requirements began with 40
   percent and were subsequently raised to 50 percent, within international best practice
   for labor intensive public works programs. The daily wage rate also followed
   international best practice guidelines by being set at 10 percent below the prevailing
   labor market wages in the project area.
c) For the income-generating activities, measurement at 12 months found positive profits
   on average and large and significant increases in household assets, mainly increases in
   livestock (cows and pigs) as a result of animal husbandry IGAs.



3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
59.    On the rating axes of relevance, achievement of PDOs and efficiency, the overall
performance of TASAF II is satisfactory. The relevance of TASAF II remained
substantial throughout, as reflected in both the Government and the Bank’s core policy
and country strategy documents. TASAF II, via its public works program and conditional
cash transfer pilot, has become the main vehicle for the national safety net system in
Tanzania, to be scaled up through the follow-on Productive Social Safety Net Program.

60.     TASAF II achieved its core Project Development Objectives (both original and
revised) by increasing access to basic socio-economic services and income opportunities.
The vast majority of the sub-project portfolio is operational and delivering benefits to the
population. These outputs have led to improved household outcomes in many key areas,
including increased food security as evidenced by greater food purchases and
consumption, and improved health and education outcomes, among other impacts. In
terms of key performance indicators, prior to project restructuring, of the 12 indicators,
one could not be reported and for one other a proxy was used. All indicators reported
showed substantial progress towards meeting project development objectives, although
several of these were national sectoral and MDG targets (and thus one of the reasons for
the restructuring of the KPIs). Following restructuring, eight of its 10revised project
development outcome indicators were met or surpassed. Community demand for markets
was 78 percent of the target. However, since these sub-project portfolio distribution
targets are based on community demand that cannot be known ex-ante, they are
indicative and not a reflection on project performance. In the remaining indicator, income
was not measured for impact on vulnerable groups, however there was a substantial


                                              21
increase in household asset accumulation, improving households’ economic standing
which is the intent of the intervention.
61.     Economic efficiency was substantial, as TASAF’s CDD approach delivered basic
infrastructure at a lower cost than comparators, safety net parameters follow international
guidelines for cost-efficiency, and initial assessments of IGAs found profits and asset
accumulation.

62.     It is worth emphasizing that several of the implementation challenges stemmed
from the shocks experienced in Tanzania during project implementation, including the
food, fuel and financial crisis that led to significant inflationary pressures on sub-project
costs, as well as drought which raised vulnerability and affected communities
economically and in water availability. The communities were affected to the extent that
they were more concerned with survival that and were unable to meet the community
contribution in most districts, hence the contribution rate was reduced. The two additional
financing credits were an appropriate response to this situation and important in ensuring
that project development objectives could be met.
63.     Regarding the split evaluation rating, efficacy in meeting development objectives
was substantial both prior to and following restructuring. Relevance and economic
efficiency were substantial and consistent throughout the full implementation period.
Therefore, the overall outcome rating for both the pre- and post-restructuring portions of
TASAF II is rated as satisfactory. Using the split evaluation rating formula leads to an
overall satisfactory rating, as per the following table:

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


64.      Poverty impacts. TASAF used a combination of geographical targeting,
community-based targeting and self-targeting (through public works wage levels) to
ensure that benefits reached poor households and communities. Geographical allocations
were based on a funding formula comprised of a weighted score calculated from three
criteria: population (40%), geographical size (20%), and poverty headcounts (40%). Since
using these criteria alone could cause vast differences between district allocations, 25 percent
of NVF was first deducted and distributed equally to all councils. The remaining amount was


                                                 22
then distributed using the composite index. Community-based targeting was used to identify
local vulnerable households through the participatory planning and sub-project identification
process.

65.      Ex-post analysis confirmed that TASAF expenditures were concentrated among
poorer districts, wards and communities. The poverty headcount index at the ward level
has a statistically significant effect on the per capita funding received from TASAF.
Although better-off areas were much more likely to produce sub-project applications, this
was effectively neutralized by the pro-poor funding formula. For sub-projects that
targeted households, such as the vulnerable group sub-projects, , the impact evaluation
found that TASAF VG sub-projects were well-targeted to vulnerable populations with
villages doing a good job of forming TASAF VG groups that are poorer than the eligible
population in general. The CCT program targeted poor elderly and vulnerable children, with
only 29 percent of the children residing in households with both parents. CCT households
were very poor, with 94 percent having a mud floor and only 1 percent with access to
electricity.
66.     Gender impacts. Women were engaged in TASAF II both at the community level
and in terms of their status as beneficiaries. For example, per program guidelines, women
represented at least 50 percent of CMC membership.In Pemba it was declared all CMC
treasurers should be women. The beneficiary assessment found that other communities
often preferred women to hold the position of a treasurer claiming that they were
‘generally honest and not as daring as men to use community property without approval’.
Most of the women focus groups in the beneficiary assessment revealed that TASAF’s
approach was instrumental in ensuring their active participation in community affairs.

67.    Women were also well-represented among TASAF II beneficiaries. Women
represented 40 percent of safety net public works beneficiaries. The labor intensive
techniques and below market wages helped promote women’s participation. For
vulnerable group sub-projects, a rapid assessment found that 82 percent of beneficiaries
were women, of which 44 percent were widows. In the CB-CCT pilot, the cash transfers
were given to women. The qualitative assessment noted changes in household decision
making processes due to the CB-CCT program, with greater mutual decision regarding
the use of the money for the benefit of the household. For COMSIP for example that
most of the saving groups were made up of women and there were increases in savings.
68.     Social development. The project promoted inclusiveness. TASAF II targeted
certain specific vulnerable groups through the income-generating activities, includingthe
elderly, people with disabilities, widows, orphans, and those affected by HIV/AIDS. This
inclusiveness, along with greater control over decisions and resources at the LGA and
village council level through the CDD approach, helped promote local empowerment.
The beneficiary assessment found that TASAF II interventions involved heterogeneous
sections of the community in terms of cultural, political, social and economic aspects.
People perceived that this unity for a common goal transcended other community
differences.




                                             23
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

69.     Capacity enhancement activities were a key factor in achieving the desired project
outcomes. Capacity enhancement activities targeted implementing agencies at the
national, regional, local and community levels to increase their ability to effectively
identify and implement community investments. During TASAF II, 244,715 people went
through various training sessions, including 238,495 community members, 5,891 local
government officials, and 329 national level officials of TASAF and other central
agencies (Annex 2).
70.     At the national level, TASAF is viewed as one of the more effective Government
agencies and the lead agency in terms of national programs that work directly at the
village and community level. The role of the central government was strengthened
through the participation of the technical expert’s team in ensuring that sector norms and
standards were adhered to. There was also strong and active engagement of the National
Steering Committee and active engagement of the Ministry of Finance and in particular
the Permanent Secretary /Secretary to the Treasury and his team. This kept the national
level oversight strong.
71.     TASAF’s CDD capacities resulted in TASAF attracting an additional US$33.6
million, allowing the financing of an additional 6,037 subprojects in
1,400communities.This‘ring-fenced’ funding was provided by the Marine and Coastal
Environment Management Project (MACEMP), Participatory Forest Management (PFM)
a sub-component under Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management Project
(TFCMP), Community AIDS Response Fund (CARF) sub-component of the Tanzania
Commission For Aids (TACAIDS), Community AIDS Response Fund (CARF), sub-
component of Zanzibar AIDS Commission (ZAC), and Tanzania Poverty Reduction
Project (TPRP) under the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
72.     The capacity built at the central level also allowed TASAF to pilot different
approaches to social protection, including the first conditional cash transfer program in
the country which led to the preparation of the PSSN in TASAF III. The experience with
labor intensive public works, cash transfers and support to vulnerable groups helped
establish in TASAF an institutional platform for the scaling up of a national safety net
system, to be carried out in the follow-on operation.
73.     TASAF II sought to support LGAs, including wards and villages. TASAF
provided training, equipment and hands-on experience with implementation of a CDD
program and, for many LGAs, an initial experience with safety net programs. In addition,
they were exposed to procurement, facilitation, monitoring and supervision skills,
applicable to a broad range of their development responsibilities. TASAF I worked
directly with the communities by-passing the district and the village councils. The high
degree of staff turnover and limited resources at the LGA level was a continuing
challenge.TASAF II further reinforced local government by channeling resources through
the nascent LGA fiscal decentralization systems as they became available.




                                           24
74.     At the community level, the CDD approach builds capacity through learning-by-
doing, with direct responsibility for sub-project implementation vested in the CMCs. The
project’s final impact assessment found that 59 percent of households respondents
surveyed had been involved at different stages in subproject activities, for example
participation in targeting process and prioritization sessions, provision of subproject
implementation oversight, employed in public works and subproject management.The
beneficiary assessment found that 83 percent of citizens were satisfied with the
performance of the CMCs, with only 1 percent rating performance as poor. Training of
CMCs in financial management and procurement procedures have enhanced financial
transparency and accountability at the community level.
75.      Addition capacity was built through the formation of four community foundations
(Arusha, Kinondoni, Morogoro, and Mwanza City) which fund-raised over $250,000
from private sources for local needs. Local grants were given to support disables children,
recycling efforts, health interventions (for example fistula operations), educational
activities, and other local priorities. The CF was an intervention which TASAF II worked
in close collaboration with the Social Development network.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There were no significant unintended impacts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes) N/A


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
76.     At the highest levels, the risks to development outcomes are minimal. The
Government remains committed to the mission and operations of TASAF as a core part
of its national poverty reduction strategy and the centerpiece of its evolving national
safety net system. Many of the main elements implemented under TASAF II, in
particular the safety net elements of labor intensive public works, cash transfers, and
community savings and investments promotion will be scaled up through the Productive
Social Safety Net Program. At the community level, the assessment of sustainability of
the infrastructure investments is largely positive, with some drawbacks in operations and
maintenance in water and roads, though these account for a relatively small share of the
overall portfolio. Because of these risks at the local level, the overall rating is moderate.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory


                                             25
77.     From the outset, the Bank had a close working relationship with TASAF due to
the experience of financing TASAF I. Design of the second phase was able to draw
lessons from the experience phase I. In addition, the Bank played a key role in ensuring
that international best practice on CDD and social funds was incorporated into the design
of TASAF II.
78.     The Bank ensured quality at entry through satisfactory technical, financial, social
and economic appraisal. Risks were adequately assessed and mitigation measures
identified. The monitoring and evaluation system as designed was satisfactory, albeit
ambitious in terms of the intensity of participatory M & E mechanisms foreseen. The
PDO could have been better worded to reflect the poverty reduction focus of the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
79.     Implementation support missions, including ex-post financial and procurement
reviews were regularly held. With the Task Team Leader and fiduciary functions
decentralized to the Country Office, the dialogue was continuous, rather than limited to
discreet missions. A review of Aide Memoires and ISRs found that risks were
appropriately identified and ratings were adjusted to reflect implementation challenges as
they arose.
80.     There were several particularly strong aspects to the Bank’s supervision efforts.
The Bank was highly responsive to the needs of the country for emergency response to
economic and natural shocks by processing two additional financing credits delivered in
the same year in FY09/10. In addition, the Bank promoted innovation during
implementation, including securing grant funding for the CB-CCT pilot and its impact
evaluation as well as introducing expertise on community foundations. The Bank team
was diligent in promoting TASAF’s participation in regional social protection training
and experience-sharing events, including organizing south-south exchanges for the
TASAF team twice to South Asia, and exposing them to similar social action fund
programs in Malawi and Uganda; and through the community of Practice on CCT/UCT,
TASAF has been one of the founding organizations in the Africa Region. The Bank team
coordinated with other TTLs to channel resources through TASAF for ring-fenced
activities.

81.     Supervision had minor shortcomings. There were some delay in the start-up of the
project due to delays in finalization of agreement on the Operational Manual, as well as
occasional delays in no objections and difficulties in approving contracting of the
national statistics agency for an impact evaluation, but overall these did not have a
material effect on project outcomes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank’s role in ensuring both quality at entry and quality of supervision are both
satisfactory, leading to an overall rating of satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance


(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory


82.     The project always received the highest level of support from the Government,
from its launch by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, the H.E Benjamin
Mkapa, on May 23, 2005 to the designation of the follow-on operation, the Productive
Social Safety Net as the cornerstone of the national safety net system. TASAF remained a
key part of the Governments evolving national poverty reduction strategies throughout
implementation of TASAF II. Counterpart funds were delivered in a timely fashion, with
the actual amount expected reduced due to the fiscal constraints during the economic
crisis. The Government decision to consolidate all development operations of local
government agencies into only 6 accounts caused delays in execution during the final
year of the project, but these delays did not affect final outcomes and were justified in the
enhancement of the country’s fiscal decentralization framework.

(b) Implementing Agency’s or Agencies’ Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
83.     TASAF, as the management unit for the project, is acknowledged as one of the
stronger implementing agencies in Tanzania. Because of this, TASAF attracted additional
ring-fenced financing from other sources to implement its CDD approach in a variety of
sectors. Implementation performance was rated satisfactory throughout TASAF II with
the exception of two issues. In 2006, there were several key staff vacancies, like the
Director of Finance, which took a relatively long time to recruit. However, recruitment
was also dependent on World Bank no objection and formal approval through the
Government personnel system, so timeframes were not fully within TASAF control.
Towards the end of the project, implementation progress was again downgraded to
moderately satisfactory facing the delays in disbursement brought about by the
consolidation of local government accounts under the new fiscal system, also outside of
the direct control of TASAF management. However, TMU were not aware that the LGAs
were not sending funds to the communities until 6 months later. Ex-post procurement
review and financial audits found few problems at LGA level, and those issues identified
usually were addressed in a timely fashion.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
84.    Despite minor shortcomings, the project was well-managed and achieved its
development objectives. The project was considered one of the stronger performers in the
Tanzania portfolio and had high levels of Government commitment throughout.

6. Lessons Learned

On the CDD approach:
85.     The CDD approach was effective in bringing communities deeper into the
development process, becoming agents for the changes they seek rather than passive
recipients of aid. This increased satisfaction and transparency, helped forge community
leadership, ownership and built capacities beyond the specific intervention.
86.     Capacity building, through training, information campaigns and learning-by-
doing, is essential in supporting the ability of poor communities to directly engage in
their own development. Communities need simplified procedures, clear guidelines and
effective technical support particularly from the local government level.
87.    Demand-driven programs like TASAF need guidelines to correct against the
inherent risk that better-off communities will be better at submitting proposals. This has
been a common finding since the inception of such demand-driven programs and TASAF
II implemented best practice by using a geographical resource allocation formula to
ensure equity. This ensured that poorer districts and wards got more resources.
88.    The integration with local governments and the national decentralization process
should take a longer-term view given the timeframe needed to build capacity of local
governments in weaker institutional environments and in the absence of sufficient fiscal
decentralization to adequately fund local governments.
89.     Integration with sector agencies is important. During TASAF I sector norms were
not always followed and design of TASAF II included a sector experts’ team at the
national level to ensure that the subprojects being funded were meeting sector norms and
standards. The national Steering Committee approved funding only after receiving the
sector experts recommendation. During implementation, the national level sector experts
carried out monitoring to ensure that the district level sector experts were enforcing
adherence to the sector norms. TASAF II funded interventions were seen as
complementing the sectors to deliver on their mandates. This integration with sectors
minimized any competition that would have been there had TASAF II implemented the
project as a parallel entity direct with the communities. TASAF has been seen as
complementing the sectors to deliver on their mandates.

In responding to shocks and building a national safety net:
90.     The institutional and implementation arrangements for TASAF II were distinct at
three levels: the national, district and community level. These arrangements have clearly
informed the design of the country’s productive social safety net. The Government has
indicated that TASAF is the entity chosen to champion CDD approach and
implementation of safety nets in Tanzania. At national level and as a multi-sectoral
intervention, TASAF is housed in the Office of the President, with technical oversight
from the Ministry of Finance which coordinates Social Protection under its Poverty
Eradication Division. TASAF II implementation has been through the decentralized
Government structure from the National Steering Committee chaired by PMO, with
representation from Regional Commissioners’ offices, and direct management by the


                                           28
Local Government Authorities having technical oversight over the Village Councils. This
arrangement has engendered more ownership which led to successful implementation of
TASAF II. These same arrangements are in place for the productive social safety net as a
government program.

91.    TASAF II design was flexible and had developed robust systems that handled the
scale-up response to the crises through the additional financings) and to opportunities
through the ring-fenced arrangements). The TASAF II experience showed the importance
of having safety net programs already in place that can be scaled up in response to shocks.
TASAF’s ability to quickly put in place additional financing in the face of economic
shocks and natural disasters was an important part of the national response.
92.      Programs need to be flexible in responding to new circumstances resulting from
such shocks For example, in the face of the food, fuel and financial crisis in 2009,
communities found it difficult to come up with the required cash contribution, which
became a drag on implementation. Reducing or waiving such requirements during times
of crisis can improve response time during shocks.
93.     TASAF II was one of the few community based conditional cash transfer
programs in the world. This experience with grafting a CCT program onto the existing
structures and operating procedures of a CDD program was successful in meeting
program objectives while demonstrating that community management committees were
capable of acting as effective safety net implementation agencies in poor communities.
CMCs were able to provide greater transparency and more timely payments, both critical
in a safety net program, than when public works were managed directly by LGAs in
TASAF I. Under the follow-on PSSN, CMCs will continue to play this role in more
remote localities, with a scale up of electronic cash transfers for areas where mobile
phone networks are available.
94.    Promoting savings and investment among vulnerable groups can be an important
complement to safety net income transfer programs. The TASAF II experience with
community savings and investment promotion showed that the poor were interested in
and able to form savings groups and extend investment resources to their members, while
developing basic financial literacy and basic skills.

95.     Building an integrated national safety net system requires integration of its
essential components, creating coordination and synergies. TASAF II established the
basic effectiveness of cash-for work through labor intensive public works, conditional
cash transfers and promotion of local savings groups. There were some linkages, for
example through the unified local participatory planning and CMC/LGA structures and
processes used, the synergies between income generation via public works and vulnerable
groups and the establishment of community savings and investment groups. On the
supply side the CCT programs require availability of schools and health services,
strengthened through the community infrastructure sub-projects. The follow-on operation
will take this integration to the next level, with other interventions including the Most
Vulnerable Children program under the Department of Social Welfare in creating a
unified registry of safety net beneficiaries for the country; developing case management



                                           29
of households to ensure coverage in other programs; and establishing a common targeting
mechanism among safety net interventions. The experience of TASAF II has created the
basic institutional conditions and program experience to take this next step.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

(Including assumptions in the analysis)
96.    Economic analysis of the service-poor community sub-projects and safety net
public works program centers on cost efficiency, as a full cost-benefit analysis for these
types of basic social services not appropriate.

97.     Service-poor community sub-projects. To assess cost efficiency, TASAF’s unit
costs of investment were compared with other basic social infrastructure programs
operating in the country. This analysis helps to assess the relative efficiency of small-
scale community infrastructure investments carried out by the communities using a CDD
approach under TASAF versus more centralized implementation methods through, for
example, the sectoral ministries.

98.     The 2007 Technical Audit compared unit costs in the education and health sectors,
the most prominent part of the TASAF portfolio. A sample of TASAF and non-TASAF
projects were compared based on unit costs (cost per square meter), with measurements
taken during site visits and scrutiny of the subproject financial records using costs post-
completion. In addition, comparison was made with classrooms constructed under the
Ministry of Education against the National Construction Council’s standards.
Comparison was made with standard costs used by National Construction Council (NCC)
of Tanzania. National Construction Council rates are based on the average construction
cost for the projects all over the country. All educational and health facilities, even if
executed by different institutions, are constructed based on standard designs of the
respective ministries that guide the projects. The technical audit found:

             TASAF cost per Min. Education NCC                    standard TASAF
Sector       square meter   cost per square costs                          cost
                            meter                                          savings

Education       122,000 Tsh       145,000 Tsh          380,000 – 420,000    19%        -
                                                                            244%
                                                       430,000 – 450,000
Health          178,000 Tsh       N/A                                       141%       -
                                                                            153%

99.     The TASAF construction costs were lower than comparators. The technical audit
posits that one of the major reasons for this was community involvement in supervision
and procurement procedures. The 2013 technical audit confirmed continued unit cost
efficiency, again citing the role of avoiding contractor overhead and profits via the CDD
implementation method.

100. Safety net public works projects. The cost efficiency of safety net public works
programs typically depends on the level of labor intensity and the level of the wages paid.

                                            42
At the outset, the minimum requirement was 40 percent. This was subsequently raised to
50 percent after the mid-term review. At the end of the project, the PWP operation was
delivered at 47% of the total subproject budget accounting for the unskilled wages. In
addition, the daily wage rate follows international best practice guidelines by being set
below prevailing market rates. This increases the program efficiency and promotes self-
targeting. The TASAF II wage rate was set at 10 percent below the prevailing labor
market wages in the project area.

101. Income-generating activities for vulnerable groups. Several assessments were
carried out on the Vulnerable Groups income-generating activities. All provided insights
into the economic viability and impacts, though formal cost-benefit analysis was not
carried out. The 2007 technical audit found that it was difficult to extract meaningful
financial information for business performance assessment. From discussions held with
CMCs the businesses seem to be profitable but faced risks of liquidity and loss problems
due to lack of financial management skills. The more robust randomized impact
evaluation was carried out on short-term effects, but still too short of a period to
effectively assess business viability. Measurement at 6 months showed negative profits,
indicating that the groups were still investing more resources to get their IGA going.
Measurement at 12 months found positive profits on average and large and significant
increase in household assets, mainly increases in cows and pigs as a result of animal
husbandry IGAs.

              IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)

1.0    Background
102. Tanzania had instituted a number of policies and strategies aimed at reducing
poverty in the country. Despite the efforts, poverty remained rampant, particularly in
rural and peri-urban areas. Poverty in Tanzania is characterized by low income, falling
life expectancy, poor social and economic infrastructure and food insecurity. Accordingly,
the main development challenge for the government is widespread poverty which as per
2000/01 Household Budget survey, indicated 19% of the population living below the
food poverty line while 36% living below the basic needs poverty line.


103. Enrollment in primary school stands at an average of 100% but secondary school
enrollment is still low due to inadequate infrastructure that support a relatively small
number of entrants compared to those who finalize primary education. Further, on the
health indicators, (maternal and infant mortality, malaria-related morbidity, and Human
Immunodeficiency Virus Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) -related
illness), rates remain high in spite of the efforts that have so far been exerted by the
government, Development Partners and NGOs. As such, achieving the MDGs indicators
remained a challenge to the government that needed additional resources and efforts to
reach them.


104. It is against this background that the Government sought to implement the Second
Phase of Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF II) to all Local Government Authorities
to strengthen the gains that had been established under TASAF I, which was
implemented in selected 40 districts in Tanzania Mainland and in Unguja and Pemba in
Zanzibar and to achieve MDGs indicators as elaborated in the National Strategy for
Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP) popularly known as MKUKUTA and
Zanzibar Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (ZSGRP) popularly known as
MKUZA from its Kiswahili acronym

1.1    TASAF II Development Objective
105. The Project Development Objective (PDO) of TASAF II was to empower
communities to access opportunities so that they could request, implement, and monitor
sub projects that contribute to improve livelihoods linked to MDG indicator targets in the
Tanzania Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The target groups to benefit from the
designed Project were i) households with limited access to and use of specified service
packages; ii) vulnerable individuals that needed assistance; and iii) food insecure
households with limited employment opportunities. TASAF II was to be implemented for
the period of five years from May, 2005 to June 2010.

in March 2008 the Government of Tanzania (GOT) and World Bank (WB) agreed to
rephrase the PDO in order to align it with the Project focus rather than the Government
level without changing its meaning. The Government level objective is broad; the project
level objective ought to be at lower level and more focused reflecting project contribution
to the Government level objective. Therefore the PDO was rephrased to read, “To
improve access of beneficiary households to enhance socioeconomic services and
income-generating opportunities”. Even the Additional Financing I and II which came
after MTR did not change the PDO since they were implemented within the same
framework and hence TASAF II implementation period was extended to June 2013.


107. Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of 27th October 2004 and Project Operational
Manual of 5th October 2005 which was revised in March 2008, and Financing Agreement
dated 19th January, 2005 states the PDO of the project. However, Program Paper of 27th
May 2009 and Project Paper of 13th May 2010 have a slightly different PDO reflecting
the change.
2.0    Institutional Set Up and Project Components
2.1    Institutional Set Up
108. TASAF II was located in the President’s Office-State House as it was in the First
Phase, The President appointed the TASAF Executive Director who was in charge of
day-to-day management of TASAF implementation. As well, he appointed the National
Steering Committee (NSC), which was responsible for policy guidance and overall
implementation oversight. The NSC had 12 members drawn from Permanent Secretary,
Vice President’s Office; and representatives from the: Vice President’s Office; Ministry
of Finance; Ministry of Community Development, Gender and Children; President’s
Office Regional Administration and Local Government; Ministry of Labour, Youth
Development and Sports; Chief Minister’s Office from Unguja and Pemba;; Presidential
Trust Fund for Self Reliance; Research on Poverty Alleviation; President Office – State
House.

109.    In the course of implementation, the project secured Additional financing I &II,
as a result two more NSC members were added; representative of financial institutions
and representative of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperatives.

110. TASAF Management Unit was established led by the Executive Director. At the
National level, consultants were engaged to strengthen financial management,
procurement, internal audit, monitoring and evaluation, management information system,
research, training, and development communication. This team formed the core of a
Management Unit (MU), whose primary function was to disburse funds to the CMC
directly, or via the “Mfuko Wa Kijiji” (MWK), or to the MWK via the LGA, once the
requests had been reviewed by the SET and endorsed for funding by NSC. The MU also
coordinated the provision of capacity enhancement interventions in response to demands
from LGAs and communities.


                                            50
111. All LGAs were strengthened to address issues of participatory planning,
subproject appraisals, approvals, monitoring, and evaluation using 2.5% of NVF sub-
project contributions, which was increased to 3.5% after MTR on the ground that the
initial allocation was inadequate to address aforementioned issues. Upon meeting access
criteria, the LGAs received a further 5% of NVF contribution to finance supervision
during implementation, and the funds were also used to hire Local Service Providers
(LSP) to assist with technical supervision of subprojects where there was a shortage of
skills within the LGA. Vehicles, computers, and other supplies were provided to the
LGAs from the CE component for the oversight function and there were provisions for
the LGAs to demand capacity strengthening funds from NVF for the successful
facilitation of the Community Subproject Cycle (CSPC). The 42 TASAF Accounts
Officers were re-assigned with the responsibility of providing support on fiduciary as
well as implementation issues to the Cluster of LGAs as Village Funds Systems Auditors
(VFSAs) who were later re-categorized as Finance and Operation Officers (FOOs).

112. Within the LGAs, Ward-level extension staffs were also capacitated from the
LGAs so that they could respond to the technical needs of Village Governments and
communities in the implementation of subprojects as an extension of the LGA.

113. TASAF resources at Village Government were made available to strengthen the
implementation of accountability measures at that level over the use of resources. All
subprojects approved for NVF funding, 2.5% of the NVF contributions were provided for
use by Village Council (VC) to facilitate, monitor and report on adherence to CSPC
which was later decreased to 1.5%. For LGAs that were not LGCDG compliant, a further
5% of NVF total contribution was made available to the VC.

114. At the Community level, each Community Management Committee (CMC) was
given training and other support needed in the implementation of subprojects. The CMCs
were better equipped to ensure that they play their roles in assisting poor communities,
the vulnerable, poor households, and potential savers to access NVF resources.


2.2     Project Components
2.2.1   National Village Fund (NVF) Component (Total US$144 million, IDA
        US$120million, Government US$12 million, Communities US$12 Million)
115. The NVF Component provided money to a Village level fund, Mfuko wa
Kijiji/Shehia/Mtaa (MWK), as the principal input for households to produce outputs that
would improve service availability and use, in health, roads, education, water and
sanitation, markets etc. as well as incomes for the able-bodied individuals in poor
households by working in NVF-financed public works programs, and assistance to
households, with vulnerable individuals which included but not limited to, orphans,
disabled, elderly, affected/ infected by HIV/AIDS. Beneficiaries were facilitated to
identify priority needs, design interventions, and prepare proposals that NVF financed in
the form of subproject grants given to MWK. TASAF II resources for NVF were
allocated globally to the LGAs/Unguja and Pemba on the basis of a formula that included


                                           51
population (40%), poverty (40%), and geographical area (20%) for funding subprojects.
An element of equity, 25%, was applied prior to utilizing the allocation formula. Local
Government Authorities (LGAs) approved subprojects for funding from the NVF
meeting the following conditions: (a) have been generated from communities through an
E-PRA process, (b) meet the stipulated minimum community contributions, and (c) are in
line with sector norms and standards. Any subprojects outside these criteria were
ineligible to receive financing from the NVF.
2.2.2   Capacity Enhancement (CE) Component (Total US$34.5, IDA US$30
        Million, GOT US$3.0 million, Communities US$l.5 million)
116. The CE component provided resources for community mobilization as well as the
monitoring and evaluation of activities financed from the NVF component; the main
outputs being the number of subprojects completed in a satisfactory manner. Support was
also given to individuals interested in the formation of voluntary savings groups of at
least 10 members.

117. Under the CE component, beneficiaries were agencies (public and private) that
supported communities to make the best use of resources made available under the NVF,
as well as poor individuals participating in group savings and taking advantage of
investment opportunities created by various private-public partnerships. The CE
component responded also to LGAs where various agencies needed capacity to support
Village Governments implement subprojects using the CSPC. This component
complemented activities funded by the Local Government Support Program (LGSP) at
the LGA levels.

118. The CE activities supported the NVF by (a) facilitation of the processes of the
NVF; (b) capacity enhancement to LGAs; (c) the promotion of savings by the poor as a
way of equipping them with tools to better manage social risks and respond to shocks;
and (d) demand driven capacity enhancement to NVF stakeholders.

119. To facilitate the stakeholders in making contributions to the implementation of
interventions through the CSPC, a key aspect of the CE regarding transparency and
accountability was implemented. This included raising awareness concerning the rules of
access to the NVF, as well as the systems necessary to monitor and evaluate the NVF,
and the publication of these findings.
3.0     Assessment of the Project
120. This section assesses the PDO and design principles in the context of the
Government of Tanzania (GOT) development priorities and prevailing conditions at the
design stage. The assessment of the implementation is done in light of the overall Project
performance and the achievement of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which were
agreed upon.
3.1     Project components
121. The National Village Fund (NVF) was implemented pursuant to local government
act of 1982 whereby decision making was vested upon the local governments at lower


                                           52
and district level (District Councils, Village/Mtaa/Shehia Assemblies). Apart from
identification of subprojects which was done by beneficiary communities, the approval of
the same was done by the village councils and/or Planning and Finance Committee at
district level depending on the threshold of specific subprojects. NVF was in compliance
with the government policy on decentralization whereby decision making was vested to
local level authorities. Likewise NVF decentralized fiduciary responsibilities to local
level authorities by disbursing directly to the lower level of government authorities. This
is in line with the government policy of decentralization by devolution. TASAF II locus
was the Village, the Shehia and Mtaa aimed at giving the poor the voice and access to
resources held in NVF. The resources were availed to the communities to finance their
priorities in sub project managed by Community Management Committee (CMC) of their
choice on the one hand, and empowering them to demand technical support from Village
Councils/Shehia Advisory Councils as well as LGA/Island Management Team on the
other hand.

122. TASAF spearheaded the CDD approach through the implementation of the ring-
fenced funds in the amount of US$ 47 million from Tanzania Multi sectoral AIDS
Program (TMAP) (Zanzibar AIDS Commission (ZAC) and Tanzania Commission for
AIDS (TACAIDS), Marine and Coastal Environmental Management Project (MACEMP),
OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) (Lindi and Mtwara regions),
Participatory Forest Management (PFM) and the Community Based – Conditional Cash
Transfer (CB- CCT) Pilot Project. The ring fenced funds arrangement enabled TASAF II
to reach more vulnerable individuals and communities and increase opportunities for
meeting the PDO.

123. Capacity Enhancement component provided awareness sessions at all levels
which enabled the public to know what the project was all about, target beneficiaries,
principles, procedures, access rules, and governance and accountability aspects. It trigged
various communities to express their interest based on their felt development needs which
were expressed through Subproject Interest Form (SPIF).

124. The component also provided technical skills to key LGA and Ward level staff
and Community Management Committees in order to provide required technical
assistance to communities implementing subprojects, COMSIP where establishment of
savings groups was enhanced. The component facilitated improved participation in
decision making, improved governance and accountability aspects.
3.2    Project Design
125. The Project design did not change the CDD approach throughout the project life.
The implementation followed key principles, namely: autonomous but operating in
harmony with other on-going initiatives within the Local Government Reform Program,
in order to ensure sustainability of the Fund’s achievements; demand-driven and follows
a bottom up planning and decision-making approach; finances community-initiated
projects directly; acts as a safety net by targeting vulnerable households and poor
communities; conform to sectoral norms and standards; non-partisan and apolitical; clear
modalities to access the fund; delivery structure ensures speedy operations; adequate and


                                            53
timely technical support; transparent and demonstrate full public accountability;
processing and management are cost-effective; and strengthen community empowerment.

126.     These principles were instrumental in bringing a sense of ownership,
transparency and      accountability across the TASAF stakeholders. IEC intensive
campaigns and other capacity enhancement initiatives were used as instruments to
disseminate these principles. The Beneficiary Assessment Study carried out in December,
2007 confirmed that the CDD approach was core in reaching the poor communities. The
process has changed the community mind set from traditional top down to bottom up
approach towards owning the process to identify, prioritize, design, implement and
operate and maintain the subprojects and other development initiatives.
4.0    Project achievements
127. This section assesses the achievements that have been attained through
implementation of activities for each component. The outputs from these components
played a great role to the poor communities to access quality services that resulted in
improving their well-being, which emanated from usage of social services and
engagement in economic activities that they could not do before. In general the benefits
acquired from the created assets and various trainings are immense. These included the
improved livelihood through mobilized informal and formal mechanisms for responding
to shocks, access to socio-economic services, improved learning and health environment
and reduced distance to water, health, education and market facilities.
4.1    National Village Fund (NVF)
128. The target beneficiary groups that were supported under NVF component
included: communities that lack access to basic social and market services; have able-
bodied but food insecure households; and have vulnerable individuals (i.e. orphans,
people with disability, elderly, affected/infected by HIV/AIDS, widows/widowers,
Unemployed youths etc).

129. A total of 14,356 community subprojects applications were received from
LGAs/Unguja and Pemba. However, only 8,480 (baseline 1,483) subprojects were
processed and endorsed by NSC for funding, its distribution across beneficiary groups
was: 3,764 service poor, 1,683 food insecure and 3,033 vulnerable groups. The
achievement in terms of number of subprojects has surpassed the projected target of
7,400 sub-projects by 15 percent.

130. CB-CCT achievement was realized whereby a total of 11,576 households with
28,480 individual beneficiaries were supported. The plan was to reach 22,582 individual
beneficiaries, by the end of the pilot programme. Therefore, the target has been surpassed
by 26 percent. In sum, TZS 4.0 Billion cash benefits were transferred to beneficiaries in
three pilot LGAs. Initially the CB-CCT was piloted as a standalone under the CE
Component, while, its moderate expansion during preparation of AF I was placed under
NVF Component.




                                           54
131. The over achievement of NVF Component was attributable to (i) more resources
being available through Additional financing (AF I and AF II) and (ii) currency exchange
gains between the Special Drawing Rights and US Dollar. AF I and AF II funded 2,305
subprojects and under ring fenced arrangement 3,867 subprojects were supported
representing 19 percent and 31 percent of all funded subprojects, respectively.

132. Under education sector, facilities and assets created and the baseline were as

tanks, 96 water pumps and 31 main irrigation schemes.




                                            55
139. Under mining sector, facilities and assets created were as follows: 60 sets of
mining equipment, 5 hectares of mining plots, 6 sets of mining sorting tools and 20
protective gears.

140. Under marine and fisheries sector, facilities and assets created were as follows:
201 fishing boats, 31 cold rooms/cool boxes, 88 fish collection sheds and 34 fish ponds.
Under forest management sector, facilities and assets created were as follows: 44,470
beehives, 5,289 hectares of forest conserved and 3,887,353 planted trees.
4.2    Capacity Enhancement (CE) Component
141. The objectives of CE component were to promote transparency and accountability
in the management of TASAF funded activities at all levels; promote formation of
voluntary savings groups; and enhance capacities of communities and other stakeholders.
Communities, sectors and other recognized stakeholders were capacitated to access and
make the best use of resources made available under NVF component, to implement
activities that contributed towards achievement of NSGRP’s targets.

142. Staff of TASAF Management Unit and LGAs’s technical staff involved in the
management of TASAF supported activities benefited from project financed trainings to
improve their capacities. LGAs’ technical staffs, community management committees,
village council’s members, beneficiaries and other stakeholders were provided with
various types of trainings, such as subproject management, simple book-keeping/business
plans, procurement and store keeping. Other trainings were; subproject write ups,
community score cards, citizen report card, auditing, financial management, monitoring
and evaluation, among others.

143. The project procured Motor vehicles, ICT equipment, generators, IEC equipment,
Air Conditioners, furniture etc and distributed them to facilitate implementation.

144. A total of 218,576, individuals have been reached with training and support at
national, LGA and community levels as follows; 30 SET members, 113 TMU staff,
124,575 (22,687 Baseline) CMC Members, 88,380 Village Council Members, 5,478
LGAs’ technical and Ward level extension staff.

145. According to internal monitoring reports, CE component facilitated formation of
1,778 Voluntary savings groups under Community Savings and Investment Promotion
(COMSIP), with 22,712 individual savers, from 44 LGAs and Zanzibar (Unguja and
Pemba)., Groups’ savings accumulated to TZS 711 Million, of which TZS 499 Million
were given out as loans and its repayment rate stood at 78 percent. Groups were provided
with cash boxes, ledgers, cash books, register books, individual passbooks etc. Types of
trainings provided included; group formation and management, basic financial
management and book keeping and record keeping, business plans and entrepreneurship
skills, borrowing and loan management, and other specialized trainings. Beneficiaries of
COMSIP benefited from loans given out; consequently, they were able to establish small
individual income generating activities, such as petty businesses, rice production,
Vegetable growing, cassava growing, poultry keeping and the like.


                                          56
146. Under CE Component there was a research window whereby new initiatives were
piloted and tested in order to inform future interventions design. Three initiatives were
piloted, namely; CB-CCT (piloted in three LGAs of Kibaha, Bagamoyo and Chamwino),
CFs (piloted in Arusha and Mwanza City Councils, Morogoro and Kinondoni municipal
councils) and Carbon financing.

147. Community Foundations (CFs) concept was introduced by TASAF to four urban
communities of Arusha, Kinondoni, Morogoro and Mwanza in 2006 and 2007. These are
independent organizations governed by local boards with members drawn from local
Government, business community and civil society. They seek philanthropic
contributions primarily from inside the community, build capital endowment and provide
grants to support a variety of projects identified and implemented by local citizens.
Reasons for establishment of CFs included: tapping extra resources for the development
of poor communities and empowering them; Capacity utilization and enhancement; and
improving governance.

148. The CFs raised funds accumulated to equivalent of US$ 125,582, (Kinondoni CF
(KMCF) US$ 33,000; Morogoro Municipal CF (MMCF) US$ 45,660; Arusha City CF
(ACCF) US$25, 740 and Mwanza City CF (MCCF) US$21,182). The CFs provided grants
amounting to US$47,460, of which Kinondoni CF provided grant of US$ 7,692 for
surgeries of 25 fistula patients at CCBRT Disability Hospital in Dar es Salaam;
Morogoro CF US$ 3,273 to seven needy groups for initiated projects: Environment
cleanliness, Elderly services, centralized environmental conservation through primary
school pupils, Environmental cleanliness coupled with waste recycling to organic manure,
Empty cans recycling and Support to disabled children; Arusha CF US$ 7,030 to 168
orphaned and vulnerable children in secondary schools and Mwanza CF US$ 6,925 to
support training of six students in South Korea and treatment of the sick. CFs provided
support to flood victims.
5.0    Assessment of outcomes
5.1    Relevance of the Project
149. The project was highly relevant to Tanzania’s National Strategy for Growth and
Reduction of poverty (NSGRP) popularly known by its Kiswahili acronym as
MKUKUTA. Also the project design took into consideration the country’s local context
and in line with existing Government’s policies and strategies. The project provided
benefits to the poor households that under the macro-economic reforms could not get the
impact of the economic recovery.


5.2    Achievement of PDO
150. The project has achieved its development objective and the outcome is rated
satisfactory. The project managed to put in place mechanism of identifying beneficiaries
and hence was able to allocate resources to the most poor communities and to the most
poor areas as evidenced by Impact assessment of SP, PWP intervention and Capacity
Enhancement (Training and COMSIP) Report (June, 2013). According to the report on


                                           57
Short-term Impacts of TASAF II VG component (2011); procedures for selection of the
poor communities, households and individuals as direct beneficiaries were put in place
which, as such, provided bases for targeting recourses to the poorest areas in the country
as well as identifying poor households as beneficiaries of the `project.


151. The project contributed to improved availability, use, and access to basic social
services by beneficiaries. With regard to contributing to capacity building it provided
resources to facilitate training that led to development of capacities at community, LGA
and national levels. TASAF II beneficiaries have substantially benefited from
interventions by improving their livelihood and the benefits are as elaborated below:

152. Education sector: There has been a noticeable impact, such as improved learning
environment through the provision of permanent classroom blocks and furniture, which
led to improvement of student classroom ratio from 1:70 to 1:45; increased teacher
motivation as a result of improved housing conditions; and reduced distances to schools.
It also increased enrolment especially in secondary schools since it coincided with the
national drive to build more ward secondary schools in order to absorb more primary
schools leavers. Pupils’ attendance increased due to fencing of school buildings which
minimised truancy and absenteeism. Construction of classrooms and dormitories has
increased more number of students especially girls to join ward secondary schools .As
unintended impact some community members around schools have established Income
Generating Activities (IGA) for examples; shops, food vending, recharging mobile
phones etc.

153. However, the quality of education is a combination of various factors such as
availability of teachers for all subjects, books etc. As a nation, it has not reached a point
of having all these requirements to a satisfactory level due to shortage of resources; as
well TASAF could not support all communities due to the same reason. The government
has instituted some measures to address these challenges. For instance to increase the
number of teachers for primary and secondary schools, enrollment of teacher trainees in
colleges has been increased for the coming five years. The Government has allocated
more funds for purchase of text and reference books. Through annual budget allocation,
the Government will continue gradually avail necessary conditions to ensure that services
are availed to its optimal level as per sector standards and norms.

154. Health sector: Key health impacts as a result of the interventions include: easy
access of health services including, emergency cases within a short distance and
throughout the day and night time, specifically where staff houses are available, reduced
use of traditional birth attendants, decreased referral cases for pregnant mothers due to
availability of delivery services, deaths of mothers and babies has been reduced due to
improved delivery services at an appropriate time, improved mother and child health as a
result of readily available immunization, nutrition education and child general care as
well as family planning provided at health facilities, reduced distances for outreach health
programs as beneficiaries especially pregnant mothers and children can access the
services at health facilities within short distances.


                                             58
155. The target was to increase access to health services to a total of about 10.5 million
people. The current status shows that a total of 12.0 million people have access to
improved health facilities supported by the Project. The target has been surpassed by
15%.
156. Road sector: The impacts as a result of the interventions, as confirmed by Impact
assessment of SP, PWP intervention and Capacity Enhancement (Training and COMSIP)
Report (June,2013) include: Sick people and pregnant mothers can now easily access
services to health facilities in case of emergencies due to existence of passable feeder
roads, economic activities have been stimulated due to accessible roads; examples:
traders from outside beneficiary areas are coming to buy crops in areas which were
formerly inaccessible due to lack of roads, transportation has become much easier
because vehicles e.g. pick-ups, motor cycles (popularly known as ‘Boda boda’) can use
the roads even during rainy seasons; improved housing due to easy transportation of
building materials and land value has become relatively high in project areas since they
are now accessible.

157. The number of people with access to all weather roads has significantly increased
from baseline. As well, the end-of-project target has been surpassed by 26 percent from
2.8 million to 3.5 million people. Improvement of roads enables communities to get
access to other services that are found away from their own localities such as hospitals,
schools, markets, trade between villagers and people outside the villages.

158. Market sector: The services from markets enable communities to sell their
produce from time to time, as well as buy items from other places brought by other
people who are interested in doing business with respective community members. In
addition, the markets are good sources of revenue through taxes for the local
governments, leading to further improvement of other services

159. People with access to market services have gradually increased to 270,000 this
period from 48,000 in 2005, an increase of over 500 percent. Though, the end of the
project target of 348,182 people is yet to be reached because many communities did not
consider markets as their pressing needs. However the target was over achieved by 29
percent in the indicator by number of markets constructed/renovated.

160. Water sector: The creation of water facilities close to beneficiaries’ dwellings
means less time spent for fetching water and hence more time have been available for
other socio economic activities. Some community members have been contracted to
collect water user fees, improved gender relations at households’ level and source of
income for O&M management. Part of user fees from water used to support MVCs e.g.
scholastic materials and the like.

161. The target was to increase access to improved water sources to 1.3 million people
by end of the Project. The current status shows the achievement towards this target has
been surpassed by 27% by reaching about 1.7 million people. By mid-term, people with
access to improved water sources had reached more than half of people at the baseline
year.

                                           59
162. Irrigation sector: Irrigation schemes provided beneficiaries employment in
agricultural activities throughout the year. Increased food productivity since they
provided reliable sources of water throughout the year.
163.     The population with access to irrigation facilities has shown a very big increase
from only 33,000 people in 2005 to 744,000 people in 2013. The target has been
surpassed by 200 percent. Between the project effectiveness and mid-term, the increase
was moderate (about 340 percent) but the increase from mid-term to date has been
significantly on the higher side. The access is important in addressing the challenges on
food security. In many areas, the beneficiaries are engaged in agricultural activities for
more than one season and the productivity per acre has increased.

164. Sanitation: There has been (i) reduced incidence of water borne diseases (ii) good
sanitation facilities created in health and education sector and (iii) hygiene education.

165. In this aspect 907,224 people have access to improved sanitation through
constructed drainage systems and toilet facilities in education sector. The implementation
has surpassed the set target of 889,250 by 2 percent.


Efficiency
166. During implementation cost effectiveness was ensured by provision to
communities of standard design and specifications drawings, subject menu, standard
Operational Bill of Quantities (OBoQs). The Technical Audit Report, (October, 2007),
confirmed that the project has created assets of good quality that meets required standards
in a cost effective manner.

167. Unit cost of construction of TASAF supported subprojects was compared with
that of similar projects implemented with similar approach. The unit cost of constructing
classrooms supported by TASAF is Tshs 125,000 per square meter as compared to Tshs
158,000 per square meter by MMES or Tshs 380,000 – Tshs 420,000 per square meter by
National Construction Council (NCC) standards. Also the unit cost of constructing
dispensaries supported by TASAF is Tshs 160,000 per square meter as compared to Tshs
430,000 – Tshs 450,000 by NCC standards. TASAF construction costs are lower when
compared to other similar projects. There are several reasons for this trend but
community involvement in supervision and procurement procedures have influenced
lowering the costs.

168. In addition, the delivery cost of TASAF II original Project was only 11% of the
overall cost of the Project which is 14 % less than the threshold (25%). That indicates the
extent to which TASAF implementation has been very efficient in resources utilization
by lowering the administrative costs. The able below shows the breakdown:

5.3    PWP and VG outcomes
169. Through Public Works Program, a total of 265,872 (baseline 113,414)
beneficiaries (males 141,656 and females 124,216) were provided with temporary
employment. These beneficiaries provided a total 15,952,320 (baseline 5,431,992)
people’s days of labour. On average each beneficiary earned Tshs 178,750 based on 65
days worked. The PWP operation was delivered at 47% of the total subproject budget
accounting for the unskilled wages against a revised target of 50%, this achievement is
less by 3 percent from the target established under AF I and II. Yet, compared to the
initial target of 40%, the achievement is 7% point above. The overall 47 percent is as a
result of averaging the sub projects initially implemented when the wages for unskilled
labour was 40% and those implemented when the wage was increased to 50% after MTR.

170. The Income Generating Activities (IGAs) carried out enabled vulnerable
individuals to improve their income level, build their entrepreneurship capacity, enhance
their social status, strengthened social ties among group members, consolidated their
confidence and commitment, improved their standard of living compared to pre-project
period and enhanced their purchasing power.

171. The study conducted in 2010 on rapid assessment on implementation of Public
Works and Vulnerable groups subprojects indicated that beneficiaries were able to meet
their family needs. Nearly all respondents had earned income from temporary
employment from PWP or in some ways earned income from the IGAs they had
established, as they had indicated to have used the earnings for different purposes. Over
50 percent of the respondents used their incomes on purchasing food for their families
(80 percent), clothing (60 percent) and paying scholastic requirements for their children
(50 percent). Others used part of their earnings for health purposes (30 percent), and a
few of them spent their incomes on other small but important needs either for re-investing
in the IGAs, paying rent, transport or drugs for their livestock.

172. There has been an increase in accumulation of assets, largely livestock assets such
as chickens, ducks, cows, goats and pigs, linked with project support and increase in
incomes as revealed by Short-term Impacts of TASAF II VG component report (2011).


                                                63
173. The Baseline and Midline study report for CB-CCT (2012), reveals impacts on
conditioning, such as an increase in school enrolment of school aged children from
beneficiary house households; more health-seeking behaviour was occurring among 0-5
year’s children and the elderly. There has been about 31percent increase in the likelihood
of visiting a dispensary or hospital for health problem leading to reduction in the burden
of disease. Also it was observed that parents can afford three meals as a result of the
programme. There has been a notable increase in the non-bank savings among
beneficiaries and higher expenditures on children’s clothing and footwear. The findings
suggest that the CB- CCT has increased people’s trust on their community leaders. There
is a higher expenditure on community health insurance among beneficiaries. Also there is
an increase in accumulation of assets among beneficiaries, such as, chicken, goats,
bicycles etc. CB-CCT has enabled pupils, especially girls to remain in school until
completion.

174. The environmental and social audit and review report (2011) indicated an
increased group income from livestock keeping between Tsh.2 million and 4 million per
month. Improvements at subproject level have been on group productivity which is
considered profitable as it is contributing positively to poverty alleviation. The
beneficiaries in this category are able to meet daily requirements such as having 3 meals
per day, paying children’s school fees and buying new clothes for the entire family
during festivals. It is indeed a remarkable success of the subprojects which have
improved the quality of life of the beneficiaries.

175. In addition, the enterprises established as a result of VG and FI subprojects
created self-employment for those who were directly working on the day to day basis.
5.4    Capacity Enhancement outcome
176. The Technical Audit Report (2007) observed that effectiveness of supervision by
the communities was generally satisfactorily. The CMCs had demonstrated supervisory
strength in cooperation with village leadership (ability to inspire and motivate others,
foster trust, establish a non-threatening environment, and promote team work), increased
confidence among community members to manage their own projects. Some CMC
members were elected in the leadership positions such as Village chairpersons,
Councillors simply because they had demonstrated good performance when they were
working in the positions of CMCs .Supervision of Service Poor and Public Works
Program/Food Insecure subprojects created public assets for improved community access
to basic services. Transparency in handling financial matters and procurement of
materials and services was enhanced at LGA and community level.

177. The grants provided through Community Foundations had an effect on most
vulnerable school children’s performance in terms of school attendance and interest in
learning had substantially improved. Women with fistula regained their social status in
the community. CFs provided support to people hit by natural calamities such as floods.
In a long run the capacity built of CFs will be important by providing timely assistance to
the needy people during natural calamities events. This is because the CFs is very close to

                                            64
the people and therefore can deal with emergencies as they occur. Hence the need for
strengthening CFs and build awareness so that new institutions in other places can be
established

178. According to Impact assessment of SP, PWP intervention and Capacity
Enhancement (Training and COMSIP) Report (June,2013); COMSIP impacts have been;
increased income levels of some group members through small scale
businesses/investments, savings and loan repayment culture gradually being created
among members, proper record keeping, groups have helped to build solidarity bonds and
networks i.e. social cohesion, economic empowerment especially women group members,
increased school attendance as group members can afford paying scholastic requirements
for their children, Group members have reliable sources for credit facilities as groups are
used as collateral to access loans from financial agencies such as the Foundation for
International Community Assistance (FINCA), Promotion of Rural Initiative and
Development Enterprises (PRIDE), Village Community Banks (VICOBA), Savings and
Credits Cooperative Societies (SACCOS) and ability of group members to manage own
incomes through acquired knowledge. The study also revealed that the level of
beneficiary satisfaction with COMSIP is 95%. Therefore, if COMSIP is scaled up it can
work as an instrument of poverty reduction and sustainability for the poorest individuals
in rural and urban areas.
6.0    Monitoring and Evaluation System
179. The M&E facilitated data collection for utilisation in the management of the
project. The computerized MIS data base was maintained at TMU. The tracking of
output, outcome and impact indicators was adequately done. Monitoring the progress
towards achievement of the PDO was done through: (i) Project Tracking System (PTS);
(ii) preparing project progress reports and (iii) undertaking surveys and studies.

180. The M&E contributed to timely improvement in project Management. During
implementation, SPIFs were used to express demand from communities. The numbers of
SPIFs received were balanced for all NVF beneficiary categories (SP, PWP &VG) but
LGAs favoured SP subprojects categories where at the beginning most of applications
received from LGAs were of SP subprojects. Through monitoring reports on the situation
based on the data collected and evidence from the field, the Management issued
directives to LGAs to set aside 20 percent of their allocated funds for PWP and VG
beneficiary categories which formally were not prioritized for approval by the Village
Government and LGAs. Thereafter subprojects from these categories started coming out.

181. The process evaluation conducted for C-CCT Pilot Program provided
recommendations for improvement in the targeting method to minimise inclusion and
exclusion rate. This has improved household targeting. As well, the assessment on the
community targeting did indicate that there were inclusion and exclusion errors to some
extent. The project management implemented the recommendations by revising and
strengthening the targeting method to minimise inclusion and exclusion errors initially
experienced, by ensuring that data are collected and used for targeting poor communities



                                           65
instead of giving prerogatives to the District Councils to decide. This has improved the
way geographical targeting is done

182. During implementation tools used to collect subproject data from LGAs were
improved and automated. Result framework was modified during MTR, AF I and AF II
to accommodate revised and new added indicators. Also, Financial Monitoring Report
(FMR) was improved that facilitated tracking of expenditure and timely decision to
address any deviations revealed.

183. The introduction and use of Accountability tools in the project, such as
Community Score Cards and Citizen Report Card empowered beneficiaries to know their
entitlements, as well as, demand more accountability from services providers in the
intervention areas where these tools were used. The approach to implement Citizen
Report Card along with advocacy for reforms has been accepted by the Government as an
appropriate approach to achieve value for money in service delivery. Further, the service
providers have come to an understanding that accountability tools play an important role
in strengthening participation of the poor people and improve service delivery through
forging a common planning for redress of identified gaps in service delivery.
7.0      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and outcomes
184. In the course of project implementation a number of challenges were encountered
and they have been grouped as follows:
7.1      Implementation Challenges
        i.   There was a tendency during TASAF II implementation to favour service poor
             sub projects and thus ignoring other beneficiary groups. This was a result of a
             service gap which was established during TASAF I districts and later adopted
             by new TASAF II LGAs who wanted to have the same. On the other hand
             District officials preferred appraising SPIFs for service poor rather than VGs
             and FIs. To address the issue, TMU issued directives to all LGAs reminding
             them on the threshold for each LGA regarding grant and credit categories.

      ii.     Frequent change of LGA staff allocated to coordinate TASAF supported
             activities, namely VFCs and VFJAs, and others not undertaking TASAF
             activities on full time basis. This delayed delivery of required technical
             support to need communities due to time lag in familiarizing with CDD
             principles and procedures for new appointees.

      iii.   Low Community contribution. Besides communities’ purchasing power being
             affected by the food crisis, they were also required to contribute to other
             development activities. During MTR the community contribution was lowered
             from 20 percent to 15 percent that was believed community could contribute.
             The situation was addressed by LGA contributions and AF I&II were
             addressing areas for Food insecurity and completion of subprojects.
                       a) Political interferences
                       b) Inadequate sensitization by LGA as it was left to LGA staffs to


                                             66
                              sensitize the whole district; the sensitization message was
                              incorrectly delivered.

      iv.        Rising prices of construction materials due to increase in fuel prices and
                depreciation of currencies had drastically affected the budgets of sub projects
                which threatened to leave sub projects incomplete and non-functional.

       v.       Operationalisation of new system with six (6) Bank accounts at LGAs in year
                2012 caused delays in transfer of funds from the LGAs to Subprojects Bank
                Accounts and supervision of TASAF supported activities. All funds were
                frozen to Development Account managed. The learning curve took long and
                connectivity was a challenge in some LGAs. TMU consulted all stakeholders
                who were involved but it could not been resolved by TASAF II closure.

      vi.        Due to limited capacity in some LGA’s subprojects especially in remote areas,
                there were marketing problem.

      vii.      Sustainability: Unmet community demand for support as expressed by SPIFs.
                A total of 102,309 SPIFs has been received from communities in all
                LGAs/Islands. Out of those only 12,347 applications were approved and
                supported. This indicates that communities are in dire need for development
                support in order to get out of poverty but resources are not adequate to meet
                their requirements. For some reasons, some of the expressed interests were
                not reflecting the genuine sectors for which the Project could support but
                majority of them were worth supporting. The resources were not adequate to
                support all of them. However, not all SPIFs could be turn into fundable sub
                projects.

7.2          Design Challenges
        i.      The design assumption that all LGAs had capacity and did not require TMU
                staff to provide support to effective delivery of TASAF II. This resulted into
                less technical support to communities. However TMU decided to hand hold
                the LGAs to ensure that communities are fully supported. Only 1% of funded
                subprojects were uncompleted at closure waiting for LGA contribution.

       ii.      Lack of funds to buy new vehicles for TASAF II at TMU caused the TMU to
                use TASAF I inherited vehicles which led to rising of operating and
                maintenance costs due to aged project vehicles at TMU. Frequent breakdowns
                also affected provision of technical backstopping services to LGAs. The
                project was rolled over to all LGAs in the country but resources under CE
                component were inadequate, hence TASAF II inherited aged vehicles that
                were used in TASAF I. The TMU decided to dispose the aged vehicles and
                use funds collected to buy few new ones to manage the operations.




                                                67
       iii.     The subproject ceiling of US$ 30,000 resulted into incomplete and non-
                functional subprojects. During the Mid-Term Review (MTR) the ceiling was
                increased to US$ 45,000 for SP and FI subprojects still could not address the
                challenges of completion and functionality. This led to additional Financing II
                in 2010 to address completion and functionality of subprojects.

       iv.      There were no proper computerized systems at LGAs for the project to be
                interfaced as agreed during the design stage that would facilitate capturing of
                information and reporting. Tracking of the sub-project physical and financial
                progress was difficult because the computerized systems which were
                developed at a later stage couldn’t accommodate Project data requirements
                hence it was manually collected. TMU designed a Subproject Data Sheet
                (SPDS) that assisted LGAs to collect required information.

        v.      Due to resource constraint un-allocation of funds specifically for
                implementation of COMSIP affected smooth implementation of the same.
                Whereas initially COMSIP was initiated in 44 LGAs and Unguja and Pemba it
                was later scaled down leaving many beneficiaries unsupported.

       vi.      The VG subprojects ceiling were set too low such that it could not leave
                enough working capital, but during MTR were increased from USD 10,000 to
                USD 15, 000.

      vii.      The use of SPIFs in some cases resulted into non-adherence to CDD
                principles, since some did not express the genuine need of the communities
                but expressed individual aspirations.

      viii. (Viii) Effects due to seasonality factors and Labour analysis. The
              implementation of some of PWP subprojects coincided with agricultural
              activities and hence it was difficult to get adequate number of beneficiaries to
              engage in planned activities. Analysis on seasonal and labour factors was not
              properly done during TASAF II.


8.0          Financial Management issues
185. The TASAF II total project cost was estimated (as per Project Appraisal
Document - PAD) at US $178.50 million. Contributions were US $ 150 million, US
$ 15.0 million and US$ 13.5 million, IDA, Government and Communities respectively.
In the course of implementation there were two Additional Financing (AF I & AF II).
Additional Financing I was US$ 30.0 million and Additional Financing II US$ 35.0
million. Therefore the total IDA contribution was US$ 215.0 million.

186. The actual disbursements show that IDA funding was US $ 220 million, the
Government of Tanzania availed a total of US$ 11.2 million and community contributed
US$ 29.8 million. This represents 85 percent, 4 percent and 11 percent contributions


                                                68
respectively. Since the Government was not supposed to provide counterpart funds to
match with the additional financing credits, both the Government and community seem to
be low. But when computed on actual disbursement before the additional financing
credits, as shown in Table 4, the share of contribution become; 78%, 6% and 16%
respectively.

187. Ring-fenced window attracted US$ 46.6 million from other co-financiers as
follows:
        i.        OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) channeled US$ 22.0
                  million
      ii.          Marine and Coastal Environmental Programme (MACEMP) channeled
                  US$ 8.2 million
      iii.         Tanzania Forest Conservation and Management Project (TFCMP) channeled
                  US$ 4.0 million.
      iv.         Community AIDS Response Fund (CARF), a sub-component under Tanzania
                  Commission for Aids (TACAIDS) US$ 10.0 million
       v.         Community AIDS Response Fund (CARF) a sub-component under Zanzibar
                  AIDS Commission (ZAC) US$ 1.0 million.
      vi.         Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) contributed US$ 1.8 million.

188. The total project cost, including Ring fenced funds has amounted to
US$ 201Million and overall community contribution was US$ 29.8 Million that
represents 15 percent of the project cost.

189. Designated Accounts for TASAF II main credit had thresholds of US$ 10.0
million for the Credit and Grant US$ 2.0 million whereas AF I and AF II had a threshold
of U$ 6.0 million and US$ 7.0 million, respectively. There were no changes in the
Designated Accounts throughout the Implementation Period.

190. There were three changes in the financing schedule of the Development Financing
Agreement (DFA) as a result of approved Additional Financing I and II and after the final
reallocation of the unallocated amount in the order of the approved funds and related
categories.

9.0    Procurement Issues
191. Procurement at TASAF Management Unit, Local Government Authorities
(LGAs) and community levels was undertaken in accordance with laid down
procurement procedures. The procurement processes and contracts administration were of
generally good quality, reliable, timely and transparency. TMU conducted capacity
building in procurement to LGAs’s technical staff, which in turn provided training to
implementers at community level. This enabled Community Management Committees
(CMCs) to procure construction materials, transport services, Local Service Providers
(LSPs) and other services and proper keeping of procurement records.
192. In the course of implementing of the project, procurement audits were conducted
aimed at enhancing adherence to procurement procedures and good record keeping at all
levels. Procurement reviews conducted by the Bank has rated the project satisfactory, as
an overall rating. Also, the Procurement audits conducted by Public Procurement
Regularity Authority (PPRA) assessed the project to have good performance with
compliance levels of 89 percent , 91 percent and 89.29 percent for the financial years
2008/2009 and 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, respectively.
10.0   Sustainability
193. The sustainability of created assets is rated satisfactory. Communities have
developed strategies to make sure that the created assets are functioning. Communities
have formed various community groups depending on the type of created asset. For
example, there are water user committees, school committees/boards and health boards.
The government also allocates funds to cater for repair of assets and they are channeled
through the local government authorities. The local government authorities also provide
expertise to communities. Adoption of project cycle management by the LGAs in
managing their development projects perpetuates the CDD approach in empowering
communities to manage their own development process. According to Impact assessment
of SP, PWP intervention and Capacity Enhancement (Training and COMSIP) Report
(June, 2013); this approach has created a sense of ownership and commitment on the part
of the communities which are the strong pillars for sustainability of completed
subprojects. Income generating groups have developed group constitutions which
assures the group cohesion. With respect to other assets like roads in regard to Operation
and Maintenance (O&M) arrangement, the LGAs have included the O&M component in
the Annual Plan. However in Water sector, poor technical support drought stricken,
vandalism natural spring boxes cease to yield water due to reduced rain. For roads many
roads have been upgraded into district roads, O&M starts after handing over of
subprojects, timing of planning cycle at LGA to incorporate completed subprojects into
district plans. Some roads are washed away after a short period of time due to rain and
floods and there is low capacity at community to repair.
11.0   Environmental and social safeguards
194. The project was classified under environmental category B, which encompassed
sub-projects whose potential negative environmental impacts were less adverse and few
and site specific which in most cases had mitigation measures which could readily be
designed and implemented. Two safeguard tools were in place; namely, the
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy

                                           71
Framework (RPF) to ensure the proper mainstreaming of environmental and social
concerns into TASAF supported subprojects. These tools were prepared in line with the
World Bank safeguard policies OP/BP/GP 4.01(on environmental assessment) and
OP/BP 4.12 (on involuntary resettlement) as well as Tanzania’s environmental policies,
legal and regulatory framework. As the types and specific geographical locations of the
subprojects were not known, the ESMF was an appropriate safeguard instrument at the
appraisal stage that established a unified process for addressing all environmental and
social safeguard issues throughout the implementation of the project.

195. In the course of project implementation, sub-projects were subjected to an
environmental and social screening process conducted at the community, LGAs/Unguja
and Pemba and national levels. The aim was to avoid any adverse and undesirable
environmental and social consequences of the interventions.

196. Communities were facilitated to implement sub projects that were small in size at
particular sites chosen by them by taking into account environmental and social
considerations. LGAs’ staff facilitated undertaking an environmental and social screening
process through Environmental and Social Screening Forms (ESSFs) as part of
preparation of any sub-project proposal. If potential negative impacts were identified, an
Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) was prepared and became part and
parcel of the subproject activities that were implemented. Also Environmental
Monitoring Plan (EMP) was prepared for monitoring and supervision of implementation
of proposed mitigation measures at communities by LGAs’ technical staff at agreed time
frame.

197. The implementation of subprojects did not trigger major resettlement issues, as
there were no subprojects involved the resettlement of affected persons that necessitated
preparation of Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) as per RPF requirements. Most of the
subprojects acquired land from the Village Government and minor resettlement were
handled through mutual agreement between affected households and the respective
Village Governments. Other subprojects were offered land by members of beneficiary
groups through a signed form of commitment.

198. Environmental and Social audit conducted in March 2011, established that
beneficiary communities seemed to have reasonable knowledge on environment and
social issues that might affect the implementation of their sub-projects. Subprojects such
as tree planting, Village forests conservation, establishment of nurseries, rehabilitation of
storm water drainage systems and livestock’s subprojects such as dairy cattle, pig
production, goat keeping that emphasized on zero grazing, considerably contributed to
environmental protection. Most of subprojects related to construction works, such as
construction of classrooms, dispensaries, Maternal blocks and health centres, teachers’
houses, administration blocks, toilets, godowns and market structures was done as an
extension to existing premises or built on village land with no disputes.

199. In order to enhance capacity of LGAs’ staffs in response to the recommendation
of the Environmental and Social Audit conducted in March, 2011, re-orientation sessions

                                             72
for 399staff of LGAs, Unguja and Pemba were conducted to facilitate adequate
subproject screening and completion of ESSFs.
12.0   Bank and Borrower performance
   (i) Bank Performance
200. The Bank‘s performance is rated satisfactory. At the design stage the Bank
provided adequate technical support by availing relevant subject matter specialist to
interact with Government officials and technocrats. Similarly Implementation Support
Missions (ISM) were conducted after every six months. The joint decisions were well
documented in Aide Memoirs that were prepared at the end of each mission.
Accordingly, the Bank addressed issues pertaining to rephrasing of the PDO and related
indicators, revising the percentage of community contribution that led to the amendment
of the DFA to reflect the changes. In addition, the Bank made reallocation of funds
between categories in order to address challenges in implementation as agreed upon
between the Government and the Bank.

201. However, the Bank needs to address the issue of delay in clearing the requests
sent to it with respect to procurement. There had been delays in getting feedback on prior
reviews and No Objections. It is recommended that the Bank should expedite reviews and
issuance of No Objections.

202. The start of implementation for TASAF II experienced a delay for a year that
could have been used for creating awareness raising. Basically, the Project effectiveness
is attained after accomplishment of all obligations that are required to be met by the
government as a precondition for the same. Despite the project being effective, the
Operational Manual was not approved for five months from the date of effectiveness. The
implementation could not start, which created misunderstandings between the
Government and the World Bank’s TASAF II, Task Team Leader at that time. The
matter was resolved and the Project continued with implementation
   (ii) Borrower’s Performance
203. The Borrower’s performance is rated satisfactory. The government met all its
obligations during preparation and implementation that enabled the Project to meet its
Development Objective. As per requirements, the Government formed Project
Preparation Team (PPT) for the design of the project, as well as provision of office
premises for TASAF Management Unit. All LGAs and the Chief Minister’s office in
Zanzibar provided office premises and appointed respective Village Fund Coordinators
(VFCs) and Village Fund Justification Assistants (VFJAs) in their respective areas of
jurisdiction. In addition, secretaries, drivers, office attendants were as well appointed..
The National Audit Office (NAO) provided the audit services as per requirement spelt
out in the DFA which was of high quality and professional conduct.

204. The Government also appointed the members who formed the NSC on a three
years term serving a maximum of two terms. The NSC provided policy guidance and
overall project implementation oversight. In support for the NSC, was the Sector Expert
Team whose members were drawn from all sectors that TASAF was supporting

                                            73
community interventions. This team, maintained sector norms and standards in assessing
all applications from communities and provided guidance on implementation by

205. Implementation of TASAF II has led to a number of lessons and experiences that
need to be considered in designing future CDD operations. These lessons have been
crystallized from TASAF’s own reporting experiences, studies, direct feedback from
communities and other stakeholders. The lessons learnt include:


         i.   The project was highly relevant, as one of the instruments used by
              Government in implementing its National Strategy for Growth and Reduction
              of poverty strategy (NSGRP) since it is in harmony with the poverty strategy
              adopted by the Government. It was learnt that project design should take into
              consideration the country’s local context and be in line with existing
              Government’s policies and strategies.
       ii.    The Project Operations Manual (POM) should be in place prior to project
              effectiveness for smooth implementation because it details project
              implementation procedures and principles. The creation of a ring fenced
              funds’ window provides opportunities for other co-financiers to channel
              resources to finance community sub-projects in the targeted intervention
              areas. The existence of this facility eliminates procedures, time and formalities
              involved in designing and formulating new projects before resources reach
              targeted beneficiaries.
       iii.   The existence of Sector Experts Team (SET) at the national level, which was
              responsible for review of community subprojects proposals, provided
              assurances to TMU on compliance to sector norms and standards before funds
              were disbursed for implementation. Technical Audit conducted in November,
              2012 confirmed that 86 percent of the sampled subprojects complied with
              sector norms and standards.
       iv.    Technical support from TMU was instrumental to LGAs due to inadequate
              capacities at that level. This has been demonstrated by the fact that, where
              inadequate performance was revealed, TMU intervention was necessary that
              brought about significant change.
        v.    Through the CDD approach community attitudes and mind-set was gradually
              changed from the traditional thinking that outsiders can solve their problems.
              The approach enhanced the self-reliance spirit among the communities thus
              enabled them to decide on their own development destiny with or without
              external support.
       vi.    Good cooperation between the World Bank and the Government (Borrower)
              leads to smooth project implementation. This was highly practiced during
              implementation support missions where joint missions were planned,
              organized and conducted.
    vii.      Distribution of resources to LGA using a formula based on poverty,
              population and geographical area was very effective, in directing resources to

                                               74
        the poorest and most needy LGAs.
viii.   Simultaneous piloting of new initiatives provided an opportunity for learning
        and gathering lessons for future scale up and improvement of implementation
        for on-going projects
 ix.    Extensive IEC campaigns about the project have significant impact on
        creating awareness to beneficiaries and the general public. As part of the roll
        out activities oversight of TASAF management Unit is critical in order to
        ensure timely delivery of correct message at all levels.
