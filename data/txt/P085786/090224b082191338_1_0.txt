                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Tanzania Second Social Action Fund (MASAF II) Project had a grant, an initial credit and two additional financing credits, all totaling $215 million. The original Grant IDA-H1340
                         of USD21 million supported Food Insecure (FI)Households and Vulnerable Groups (VGs); the Original Credit IDA- 40020 of USD129 million supported Service Poor Communities
                         mostly and to a lesser extent the Food Insecure Households and the VGs. The first additional funding (AF I) Credit IDA-46360 was for USD30 million which supported the FIs and the
                         VGs including the Community Based Conditional Cash Transfer Pilot. The second additional financing (AF II) Credit IDA- IDA-47410 was for USD35 million which supported the FIs
                         and Service Poor Communities. The two additional financing credits were responding to the global financial, fuel and food crises in 2009 and 2010. AF I was funded from from the
                         Global Food Crisis Response Program, while the AF II was funded from the Crises Response Window.

                         The project had two components: the National Village Fund and the Capacity Enhancement Fund. The National Village Fund (NVF) component (accounting for US$120 million)
                         enabled communities to: (a) access the resources that can stimulate economic activities and allow poor households to increase their incomes; (b) reduce vulnerability by empowering
                         them with more instruments for insuring against the risks they face; and (c) improve access and use of social services. Thus, the project under the NVF component provided a multi-
                         sectoral response to the needs of the communities. The Capacity Enhancement Fund (CEF) component (accounting for US$30 million) supported the capacity building for sector staff

                         represented at the ward and district levels and the communities so that they could undertake activities that assist in the realization of the development objective.

                         This is the last ISR and the project closed on June 2013. The project performance on reaching the development objective and the implementation progress were rated satisfactory. In
                         relation to the relevance, achievement of the development objective and efficiency, the three criteria by which the project will be assessed in the Implementation Completion Report,
                         the current assessment is as follows:

                         1. Relevance
                         The relevance of the project is rated Substantial
                         (i) Relevance of objectives: The PDO, both in the original and reworded versions were relevant to Tanzania's development priorities as espoused in both the first and the second
                         National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty, to build human capabilities through reducing vulnerability and managing livelihood risks faced by poor household.
                         (ii) Relevance of the design: The design of the project was was relevant as it built on the first TASAF - an earlier CDD project which was implemented in forty district, building the
                         necessary experience which was necessary for TASAF II as it was nationwide. The design of TASAF II had inherent aspects that allowed the rapid scale up to respond to the
                         2008-2010 financial fuel, and food crises to reach the vulnerable poor with safety nets under the labor intensive public works intervention. The design also allowed the project to
                         implement ring-fenced funds from other funding agents and other Bank projects that had CDD aspects.
                         iii) Relevance of Implementation. The project reimplementation remained relevant as it was through the decentralized government structure and assisted in capacity building. It was
                         also flexible to accommodate the joint work with the SDN on community foundations and the implementation of the Community-Based Conditional Cash Transfer Pilot Project which
                         has made it possible to build experience and safety net systems for the implementation of th follow on Productive Social Safety Net Project. The ring-fenced funds which the project
                         implemented also led to the wider reach of the beneficiaries.

                         2, Achievement of the Project Development Objective
                         The Achievement of the PDO is rated Substantial having attained the following against the set targets:
                         (i) 20,271,739 direct beneficiaries reached by the project against the end of project target of 16,069,101; with 54% being women.
                         (ii) 22,850,497 person-days of temporary employment provided in labor intensive public works against end of project target of 16,813,797. The beneficiaries have reported increased
                         meals per day and increase in household assets such as poultry, goats and pigs. Beneficiary households have also been able to buy scholastic materials for children and medicines
                         for family members when sick.
                         (iii) improvement in project areas of the student classroom ratio from 70:1 to 45:1. Provision of classrooms and teachers' houses and provision of electricity from the national grid/or
                         provision of solar systems under the project has increased teachers' motivation, and reduced overcrowding in classes.
                         (iv) 87% of the citizens in project areas indicated that they were satisfied with the delivery of basic social services following the support from the project for health or education
                         infrastructure.
                         (v) over 18 million people against the set target of 14 million have access to social infrastructure in roads, irrigation, health, water, education infrastructure following the completion of
                         their subproject.

                         (vi) the final Impact Evaluation results and other assessment studies are not yet available to inform of the income percentage increase for the beneficiaries. However there has
                         been documented in the interim reports that at household level, the beneficiaries have had high increase in asset accumulation, increase in meals consumed per day from one to
                         three (Impact Assessment Study 2010), and having increased expenditures on key social services such as education and health.

                         3. Efficiency
                         (i) The Technical Audit (2009) indicated that the infrastructure built by communities with support from TASAF was by far much cheaper than those under other Government projects
                         including those funded by the Bank.
                         (ii) The Technical Audit indicated that the quality of the infrastructure supported by TASAF was good.
                         (iii) The Project design assumption that the Local Government Authorities will provide timely technical and financial support to implementation at the grassroots level has not
                         materialized. There has been continued inadequate capacity at the district level to the effect that the TASAF Management Unit has had to provided intensive back-stopping from the
                         center which has resulted in the increased expenditure under the operating costs.

                         (iv) Under the PWP, the ratio of the total wage bill to the total for subproject costs is at 47% against the set target 50%. The failure to meet the target has come about due to the
                         increasing cost of construction materials whilst the wage rate remained constant.
