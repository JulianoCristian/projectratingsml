(TASAF)\n            Project. The Second Additional Financing (AF-II) will scale\n            up TASAF-II activities in vulnerable districts in the\n            Mainland and in Zanzibar as determined by the Rapid\n            Vulnerability Assessment Report of October 2009. The AF-II\n            will also fund the cost overruns that have arisen because\n            beneficiary communities have not been able to make available\n            the expected contribution for the subprojects due to the\n            negative impacts of the financial and food crisis, as well\n            as natural calamities such as drought and floods on their\n            livelihoods. There have also been price increases for\n            materials and transportation which have contributed to the\n            subproject cost overruns. Completion of the subprojects is\n            required in order to achieve the intended outcomes in the\n            targeted communities. The AF-II will support all three\n            beneficiary groups that are supported under TASAF-II; namely\n            the food-insecure (FI), vulnerable groups (VGs) and\n            service-poor communities (SP). It will finance social\n            protection initiatives such as public works, and support\n            interventions aimed at reaching these three groups to\n            minimize the negative effects of the global financial and\n            food crisis, drought, and flash floods."}, "docdt": "2010-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
