3.  The Central African' Republie. (CAR) is a landocked, country, the sie
of France, in tho heart of the continnt with a estimated populatLon of
som  2.7 million in 1987. With a per-capita GNP of only US$380 in 1988, It
belongs to tbo group of least developed countries. Th primay sector,
includLng agriculture, forety, and fslherLes is the mainstay of the
economy. Xt accounted for 42 percet of GDP and 49 percent of commodity
exports in 1989 and s estimated t occupy four-flfths of the population.
Nlinln, manUfacturiLn  and utilitLie  (14 percent), construction (2 percnt),
an" services (42 percent) acot for the' ile of GDP.
4.  CAR's rem6tenes   fom the sea, large area and low pcpulation denslty
(4 per km2) make transpoLtation dLffLcult and costly. The transport system
is base oan a network of about 9,300 kin of classLfied national and regLonal
roads and about 14,400 km of unclassifLed rural roads and tracks. T5e
major external links from Bangui to coastal ports are the read link ibrough
;Camroon to Douala (1,650 -Im) fod the river/rail route through Congo to
Points Nolre (1,9 km).  sach routte uffer from major seasonal
-:onstraiftsp the roa4 routes are often impassable Ln\Xthe rainy season,
*hLie river traffic is not possLble ln the dry season because of low water

5.  The economic                of the lat. 1970., which ba causd
considerable social and econo  dislocation and internatioaa isolation,
was followed in the early 1980. by efforts at restoraig interna and
external equilibria. Sin.. 1982, the Goverment has pursued sustaLd
efforts to proote ecrnmic recovey.  Betw_e  1982 and 1985 the IM
supported a stabilLsatlon progrm wLth thae  stea-by       kg Iantet. Since
1986 a sustalned effort at liftLig the structural      at to growth was
initiated, and has bn suppoted by two structural adjustment credits (IDa
26.3 mllion SAL I in 1986, and S= 28.9 millon SAL 11, in 1986), a  8S$10
mllion TechniLal Adssitace  tr sredt (1985, restructured to support Wa  I
ln 1986), and a US$13.2 million Econmic Menagamunt Project (1P), approved
ln FY89.  The AfMcan D     elm-t Bank, the nC, an tance, along with
other bilateral donors, have also provided substantial financLal _upport to
the CAR's adjustment effort.  in 1987 the IP prowlied a 12-month stand-by
arrangement and a first tranh. of a three-year rr        t under the
Structural Adjustment Facility (SAP)  the second trench. was rleased in
December 1988. A Policy Pramerwrk Paper (P1P) was preented to the
Emecutive Bo&rds of the Yund and the Dank in May 1969, at the sams tlm  as
a third-year SAP program was presentd to the Executive Board of the lund.
6. Because financial lmbalances wero substantial, efforts focussed on
reducoing the budget and current account deficits. Results wer mlixds
modest overall real growth ws reported during the 1986-89 perLod wLth
sLgnificant growth only in 19691 the budget defLeLt and the current account
of the balance of payments narrowed, but lses then originally forecastu
overall prLce stabLlity, however, wa  achieved.  Table 1 provide basic
economic data for the 1986-89 perLod.
7.  Growth             was particularly disappointin.  S&LI and 1
projected an annu   avwage growth of 3 percent# with poWlation growing at
2.5 percent a year# this would hav permitted a salght impowment in pe-
capita lncome.  ln reality, growth averaged a meager 1.5 percat per anum
in 1986-88, rLsing to 3.7 percent only in 1989.  Strict control of the
civil service wage bil cotained total consumption ependitur, while
public investment as a share of WDV fell to 7 percet in 1989 frou 10
percent in 1986. Also, the sharp fall In export prices of coffee (1989
CnA? prLes were 54 pe cont lower than in 1985) and cotton (1989 prices had'
recovered somewhat over their depresse levels of 1986-1987, but were still
18 percent lower than in 1985) during the p*iLod, combined with the
diffLculti"e  enounterd in paying agred support price  for these
Conmodities, depreswd agricultural demand, wblch in tur depressd dimnaan
in the industrial and srvlce sectors. Restructuring of the public
enterprise sector led to the closure of thre banks and seven public
enterprises, while some foreign ntrprise either left the country or
reduced their operatLons. As a reult, opportunities for the absorption of
new entrants to the labor market wer  reduced, deepening the atmospher of
crLsis.

to 12 percent of GOP in 1989 fro 14 percent in 1986, in lin  with poliy
objectives. This              wa  largely du* to the reduction ln the
investment budget frqlm 1 percat of GOP in 1966 to 9 percent of GDP in
1989 (Table 6; Annex w, Table 2). The taxlratio to GDO fell by 1

to the informal etor and slow IMpumstatian of fiscal reform. Recurrent
expenditure, which was at the very low level of 12 percent of GOP in 1966,
rose to 13 percent of GDP in 1989. The wag bill fell slightly as * share
of GDP betwen 1986 and 1989, but sb 7 percent compared favorably with the
9.5 percent of GDP in 1982-84 and with other countries in the region.
However, severance' pay for departing civil servants reqired tranfer
payments equivalent to 0.7 percent of GD? in 1989. Also, payments of the
pric, support for the c6ifee and cotton sewtore amounted to 1.2 percent of
GDP in 1989. Liquidity problem led to the accumulation of internal
arrears, especially f~r the coffee and cotton price support programs; pt
th  end of 1989 these  arrears amouated to CIAS 1.9 billion for coffee and
CPAM  600 mllion for cotton, eual to 5.3 percent of budgetary revenue.
Scheduled debt service paymaents (including IN repurhases), at 37 percent
of bu dgetary revenue and 23 percent of exports of goo9ls and services,
remain heavy (V.nftz II* Table 3).
9.  The current account deficit of the balance of payments fell frm 16.5
percent of GDP ln 1986 to 14.4 percent in 1989, more or less as proramed.
A lowr levl of investmnts led to a fall in imports to 30 percent of GDP
in 1989 from 33 percent in 19861 exports remained at about 19 percent of
GOP. The sharp d    in coffee and cotton exports was, however, more than
offset by an inrease 4indiamond exports. Fiscal revenue for the second
year SW  program fellS1 prcent short of the target (but only 4.S percent
below their 19881level), while USSS million of foreign arrears acqumulated;
this delayed negotLation of a third-year SAW until March 1990, pre*entin
the 1989 Paris Club rescheduling, which led to the accuiMalation of  axternal
arrears.
10. CAR is a m*emer of the Central African Monetary Zone, whose cwrrenvy,
the CPA;franc (CIA?), has maintained, since 1949, a fixed parity with the
French franc. This has prevailed despites (i) differnces Ln inflation
rates among countries in the zone, and between Frane and the oember
countrios; (Li) fluctuations in the terms of tradet and (iii) parity
changes between the Wrench franc and the currencies of the tradLag paxtners
of Zone members. The appreciation of the Wrench franc vis-a-vis the U8
dollar since 1985, together with the deterioration of the terms of trade
and nominal devaluations in Nigeria and Zaire, have undermined the
interuatioual competitiveness of the CAR economy. AsL  a parSiama-   for
thts situation, the Government has subsidised traditional exports, and
maintained high import prices by imposing steep duties (nominal tariffs
average 58 percent). lecause of weak adminimtrqtive capacity, this led,

15. Taking into account the        d     tructural constraints, the weak
adminLitration, the ambLtios stratey adopted, and the difflcult external
env-ironmnt, Amplamentation of the adjustment measures has bee broadly
satisfactory. Progress in eD h of the key SAL areas is summarLie  ia Part
IXI below.
16. Deapite the Government's strong gamitment to the overall adjustment
process, several   aha  affected program implementation. Some
measures, such as the welcome dcLsion to split CU:AR Lato seprate
commercial and supervisory agecies, and the agreement on restructuring
plan  for the major pubLic utlilties, required moe time than anticipated.
Othe measures were delayed because of te heavy load whlch program
mplementatLon placed on a relatively weak administration. Thi al led to
a nine-mth  tpo       t  of d_sbursmmnt of the SaL U seond tranbe.
The Government's preoccupation with short-term crLss managemet in the
face of unforeseen adverse exogenous factors further slowed implamentatLon.
Delays in putting in place the civll sevice staffin  plans wer partly
attrLbutable to tho fact that LitiUlly no siagl. vernment organ was
given clear responsibility for them. Also, a lLqudlty crisis slowed both
implemntation of the civil soeice voluntary departur  program (PDVM),
which attrated more application  than expected, and the prot payment of
crop support, whLh in turn jeopardixed smooth i, _entat4on of crop
prchases and threateaed bank liqldity. Parliamaitary elections and the
establishment of a National Assembly ln 1988 represent a positlve s
toward political liberaliation and facliltate LiternallatLon of the
structural adjustment program. However, the fact that many government-
actLons now need to be ratified by the National Assembly requires a longr
tim  frame than orlginally anticlpated for impleetatiLon of some program
1?. Another          n  of the  AL preoc   so far has bee the failure to
make clear progress in overcoming the weak          tion capacity of the
goverrment. The key problm ha been the           to visualLs clearly the

of t  civl servLce, over and above near-term actios to contain the wage

bill, reduce excessive stf, and eliminte CobVous anomalls. while the
weaknesses diminish the eff atenoy of the administration as a whole, they
have particularly hampered efforts to strengthen the peformance of cor
governmest services: treasury operations, customs and tax adminlstration,
macroeconomlc planning, investment programing, and project evaluation and
monitoring.
18. Conscious of these institutional weaknesses, however, the overnment
has initiated a number of important seasues to address them. In 1988, it
rearried out, with IDA financing, a diagnostic analysis of the institutional
mandates, capacity constraints, and requirements of the Ministry of 1ihance
(MRFPCI) and the Plannlng Secretariat (83P), which led to development both
of a reorganization and stafflng plan for thoe ministries, and of a throe-
year program of priority capacity-bullding measures. DA, France, and UNDP
are supporting implementation of thes  measore through an Bconomic
Management Project (MP), launched in 1989, whLch alms to create
sustainable capacity for e.6nomic policy formulation and management in the
core ministries, whlie faclittat             atLon of the adjustment
program. The IMP concentrates on improving technical system and
procedures, buildlng management and information systems, and strengthening
administrative structures. However, delay in starting the DMP, which only
became effective in October 1989, contributed to the lack of progress in
institution-building under the 8AL II program.
19. Management of the adjustment process also fell short of expectations.
Although an Interministerial committee, with a "Comit6 de Suivl- as its
secretariat, had been created to monitor implementation of major SAL
measures, it met irregularly and follow-up by the lower-level working group
was lacking. Measures to address these shortcomings in the SAL III program
are outlined in para. 87 below.
PART III - THE SAL PROGRAM 1990-1992
20. The main objective of SAL III is to support the Government in its
efforts to realixe sustained real per-capita lnsbm growth while enhancing
the participation of all segments of the population in the development
process. The 8AL IUI program will carry forward the reform meabures
initiated slnce 1986 and support a deepening of the adjustment effort ln
macroeconomic management, civil service efficiency improvement, public
enterprise reform, policy reforms in the key agricultural and transport
sectors, and measures to promote expanded private sector activity. sased
on the experience gained under the earlier SALs, SAL III will pay special
attention to strengthening institutional capacity to implsment necessary
reform measures, to building up the Government's human resource base, and
to alleviating the social cost of adjustment. Management and coordination
of the program will also be strengthened. The program is deocribed in
detail in the Government's Statement of Development Policy (Annex V) and
the action program is detailed in the Policy Matrix (Annex VI).

21. The key  areas of the SL III program are*is follows
(a)  Nacroeconomic mnaat, wLth partlular attention glven to
maintain a prudent monetary policy, to reduce the structural
fLscal deficit, both through enhanaqd resource mobiliLatLon and
careful     nditure     g t, and to strengthen further
inveastmnt plannig and puograing whlle lncreasing the level of
investment
(b) Civll servLce refotm, with the objetive of improvlng longer term
effLciency, strengthening personnel and career management, and
improving pay and incentIves policLes, leadLng to reform of the
civil bervice statutes arM rationalization of the regulatory
frameworks
(C) Enterprlse and financial sector reform, aimed at making further
progress ln parastatal sector reform, identlfylng and rectLfying
the factors that hamper fina nLi intermediatlon, and promoting
an lncentlve environment propltious to expansion of private
enterprlse;
(d) Policies in the key sectors of agiulu e.tansuot  dcto

(e) The social dimensions of adiustment wiL be addressed in various
elements of the programl,an SDAD operation will be implLnted in

address poverty issues directly through a joriorlty action
program.

22.  Background. Desplte a structural defiLcit (averaging 13.7 percent of
GDP in '196-89), recurrent expenditure ln t*  CAR averaged only 13 percent
of GDP in 1986-89 (Anzmex U, Table 6;and 7)* Ths is considerably lower
than rost countrles Ln the **glon, and definitely too low to fenanc,e
adequAtely the expenditures required to provlde mlnimal social services to
the population, tO maintain the capital stock and to cover recurrent
expenditures iznclIding those necessary for efflcLent operation of new
Lavestments. Whlle the share of wages in total recurrent expelditure fell
from 62 percent ln 1986 to 55 prcan  in 1989, wages continue to weigh
heavily on total e*pendLtures. At the root of thli sltuatlon Is weak

23.  In the \framswork of SA I and US, the govosrut addressed thes
problems Ln a variety of ways, expected to re1liss budgetary savings of
about 1 percent of CDP by 1989 (against no sut* savings Ln 1966),  nd
reduce the overall budget defiLct (on a commitment 'baLs and beforo grant*)
fro 13.6 percent in 1986 to 12.2 percent In 1989. This policy would have
permitted the Goveromnt to begin finci  part of the investments with
lts own resourcs, thereby gradually reducin  budgetary dependene on
foreign fLnancing. To that end several policy measures were xelied upon.
Flrst, the Government cplted the  orga ation of the core services of
macroeconomic management and  mplntd staffing plans for N?X and SUP,
wlth no support. Second, it has moved to Improve reoukce mobilisatioa,
taking a numbe of masures to strengthen tax assesement and collectios,
and to redue outstanding arrears. ThLrd, a major progras was Introduced
to reduce the clvll servLce wage bLil, basod on strict recruitment
procedures, cleaning up of the civil service fles, and a systematic reiew
of the functions of varaous MinstriLe  and their staffing neds combined
with    lmeLntation of porresponding staffing plan. Uourth, to reduce the
overall budget defLcit pd ease the burden of enuing we s'rrent
expenditure, the investment program was reduced frm 13 percent of CDP in
1986 to 9.7 percent of GDP ln 1989, mainly by eliminatLng a unmber of le
productive projects.
24. Judged against the SAL It targets, the abseoce of budgetary savings in
1989 was disappointLng.. The reduction in the overall budgetary deficit,
however, was greater than targeted under SaL S (11.8 percent of CDP
gaalnst a target of 12.2 percent of GDP), as investments were lower thn
targeted (9 percent of GDP against 11.5 percent of GDO). The latter
achLevement is the more remarkable in that in 1989 crop support payments
amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP, whi  payments tfor the PDA (the Civil
Service Departure Program) amounted to 0.7 percent of GD?.
25. The reasons for not achieving budgetary saving  in 1989 were  (i)
expenditure exceedd the  AL ZI target by 10 percet because of slowe than
anticipated imple menation of the olvil ervice reform and revision of
family allowances, whLch were to have reduced the salary bill by
approximately CPAF 2.6 billion on dn annual basisb thes measures are now
expected to be in place by mid-1990 and the salary bill for 1990 will
amount to 6.1 percent of GDP agai#st 7.3 percent of GDP ln 1986g (ll)
strengthenLag of the flscal administratlon was lower than  pe d
although lts revenue-enhancLng effect was, in any event, to be realised
only in the medLum-trms and (LLL) the formal sector, whLch li the more
productive tax base, went into a retrnchment for most of the period due to
the departure of a number of foreign firms, the gradual shft of economic
actlvities to the Laforal sector, and wek demand from the rural sector.
26. SAL III measures. The SAL III target is to ralse bwdgetary savings to
about 3 percent ofGOP b  1994. Achieving thLi objctlve will, over time,
reduce the dependence of CAR's budget on foreign financing, from 11.8
percent of GOP ln 1989 to 9 percent of GDP in 199.  Noever, settling

ln the trainLng of customs offLiLalst offers from several suh
organLzations have already been requested, and lt is expected that such an
organization will be operational before the nd of 1190.
28. Wlth rea rd to esxendlture, under SAL US, the Government expects to
contaln the growth ln the wage bill, following full implementatlon of the
staffing plans, through maintenance of a freze at the levels defined in
the staffing plans of the number of budgetary poitLoans for at least three
years, and a freeze on the cLvil serviLc compenation package untll a
revised.compensation polLcy is adopted (to be undertaken in the context of
the continuLng cLvll servlco reform program). As a result the wage bill
for 1990 has been set at CY"1 23 billion (S percent lower than in 1989),
and CFAP 22 billion in 1991.  Public consumption of water, electriclty and
telephone servLces is beLng cutaaled (4990 Finance Law) and budgetary
allocations for these servlcoe will be incr easd so as to cover fully

identified needs in health and wd tlon        icrea   by an annual rate of
about 10 percent, which should benfet  anly the poorer se_nt* of
society. the criteria use for the allocation of study grants will be
tlghtened to ensure that the number of grants extended corresponds to the
budgetary allocations, as set out in the context of the Education III
troject (September 1990). Prtherore, wlth the gradual developust of a
core sociLoeconomic public expendltur program under the BDA Project,
priority services will be ldentLfied, minmum levels of expenditures
established, and transparent and monitorab)l budget system will be
developed to ensure that actual expendltures on theo key services
correspond to the amounts budgeted.
29. axpenditures dlrectly related to the structural adjustment reform
concern the severance pay for clvil servants, coffee and cotton sector
price support, and public enterprie and bankLng sector reform. The
flnanclng needs of the latter two sectors are still beLng calculated (see
para. 26). severance pay for 1990 will amount to nearly CPAe 6 billion,
which ls ClPA  1.5 billion more than initially foreseen for lmplementation
of the stafflng plans, as lt was decided to compensate those civll *ervants
whose qualificatlons dld not warrant theLr conttnued employment ln the
civil service. On present prlce forecasts, price support for cotton (CPa?
800 mlllion in 1990) is expected to disappear in 1991, as a result of the
cost reduction efforts underway. Price support for the coffee sector may
amount to CPAF 2.5 - 3.S billion in 1990, dependLng on world market prices.
The reduction of guaranteed producer prices by 40.percent and of
intermediatlon margins by 16 percent for the 1989-90 season reduced the
coffee support borne by the budget by CFAF 2.S bllion.  Beginning wlth the
1990/91 crop season, the Government lnten4u to limit its price support and
in a flexLble manner set producer prlces and intermedlition margins at
levels that correspond better to world market prices. Data are not yet
available to assess the supply response, whlch should be lses strong than
would be suggested by the apparent drop in guaranteed prices, as many
farmers did not receive the guaranteed price for lack of prLce suppott paid
to traders. The speeLfLes of thli new flexible pricing system arestilll
being worked out but will reduce the burden on the budget in case export
prioes remain weak.
(ii) Investment PlannLng and PrograuMiN
30. Background. Under previous structural adjustment programs,.substantial
progress has been achleved ln the area of public lavestment plannLng. The
practlce of preparing three-year rolling public lnvestment plans (PIP) is
entrenched siace the publication of the 1989-1991 PIP, which was the flrst
such exercise in CAR. The formulatLon of the PIP and She investment budget
is the responsiblilty of the State Secretariat for Planin   (mSP) wlthin
NEUPCI. Both SEP and NIFPCI were reorganLzed in 1989 and thelr staffing
plane implemented wlth the help of technical assistance provLded by IDA and
other donors. The reorganization of SEP lncludeds (i) the c!ation of a
new PlannLng and XStrategLes Department, with macroeconomic and soclal
development divisions, to integrate the PIP ln a macro conomc fram ,

and reinforce the analytical basis for addressing the social dimensions of
adjustmnti (LL) the re-establLsbment of the statistical officeo and
(1ii) the expanLon of a Projects and Progrm  DepartuOnto ihich will take
the lead ln investment prograimiLng, project evaluatLon and monitoring.
31. The 1990-92 PIP, which has just ben finalLsed, show that Lnvestment
PrC"    ig procedure  are being lnstitutionalli-d and a process begun to
improve project selectlon and follow more closely the recurrent expendLture
implicatLons of various projects.  IDA staff rviewed the major components
of the PIP and were in general agreement wlth lts overall size and soctoral
priorlties. Ewever,' the ratio of budgetary investment to GDP ln 1989 is
only 8.7 percent (against,an average of 12 jorcent in 1986-88), which is
clearly too low to provide for sustained economic growth.
32. SAL III Measures. The Government will prepare a document spelling out
the medium- to long-term strategy that should underpin CARRs development,
and strengthen the three-year rollni  lnvestment programming process.
Background studies to understand better the historical ad sociological
conte*t of development in CAR have already been commLssioned. It is
envisaged that there wlll be broad-based particLpation in the process,
involving clvll servants, academics and the bsLiness community. The
decision to swLtch to a three-year rolling public investment plan within
the context of the longer torm strategic framework, represents a clear
break wlth the past practice of preparing FIve-Year Plans that tended to
absorb much energy, whlle provlding little or no operational guidance.
33. The proceis of preparing a three-year rol'lLng investment program will
be reinforced as follow:s (L) lt will contain a full dlscusslon of
implementation of the previLus year's capital budget, as well as a section
on the macro-economLc frameworkg (LL) investments of the publc enterprise
sector wlll be presented alongslde those retained ln the lavestment budget
of the statet (k14) a systematic review of Lavestment-related technlcal
assistanca wll be presentedi and (Lv)-semi-annual revlws of the physical
and financial implementation of the PIP will be prepared. Agreement en a
satisfactory PIP for 1991-1993 is a second tranche dLbwrsment condltlon.
34. ;Investment plans for the coming yeare will emphasi ze rehabllitation
and maintenance of exLsting capital stock so as to foster lts most
effic$ent utilization. The recently approved Transport Sector Projctt
clearly reflects this approach. The Government intends to increase the
level of lnvestment so as to establish the basls for sustained long-term
growth; a level of 10 percent of GDP has tentatively been retained for
1992. If additional prlorLty projects for which concesslonal financing is
available can be identifled, thi level could be increased. Project
select.on will be improved. To that end,'the Government is preparing a
manual spelling out the technical, financial, economlc, and management
crLterLa that will be \used in determining project prioritLes and the'
responsibilities of various public instLtutions in performing project
analysLsi this document will be finalized by March 1991. Also, for the
next three-ypar PIP, the Inter-MinLaterLal Comittee, tho arblter of

1minal wage freese (since 1982) and hlring restrictions ("one frac of new
wage expedilture againlt three franc of wage savLngs).
36. Rsults have bee rmarkmble, especally conLderwing the political
sensitivty of the retform effort. The nb  of budgeted posLtions ha
been reduced by about 8 percent or 2,000, which should lead to stimated
annual wag saving of Cia 2.1 billon. Moro tha  700 cLvil servants left

43. Backround. Onder Sn I_ALd 11, major efforts have bion made in
streamlining the public enterprse seqto. Tbrogh a process of
liquidation and privati,ation, the n_be of public enterprises Ma bee
redtuced from 52 in 1986 to 35 at the end of 1989 (sax entrprie  were
alrpady closed in 1985. the yar before GM. ), ten enterprises of which
provide a publi sevie rather than engaging in eo_nrlial or industrial
activity. During this period, the number of employees Of those enterprtses
that continued to operate fell by about oe quarterrt -mpuoyment at the
sugar- factory, however, incroased substantally as plane to brlng the
factory on stream had been prepared several years before AL S. Since
1986,. several public enterprlse were rehabilitated, while prlvate sector
management contracts are being negotiated for the water and
telecmmmunication enterpr1see. The Governmret substantially improved lts
monltoring papaclty, and publishes annually finbaclal data on the
enterprises\ remaining in,its portfolio, based on accounts that in, most
cases are audited on a timely basis; no such audlts were performed up to
1986. The Government has also begun to rationallse the relatlonship
betien public enterprises and the state, through implinentation of- a
series of performance contracts, the first Qf which was 4gned in December
1989 wlth the electricity company (RUMR=A).
44. SUL II Measures. To consolidate proress achieved and to rationalize
further the public       risector, the Government intends under SAL UI!

will be sougt so as to flnallsw thli phase of the PR reform  . In

on marketin  of local produce. An investment Code, wLth  "ai1  provldic-A
to foster growth of smll and medium enterprise  wa prmu gated. Most
trade restritLons have been rmovd. A docision was made to have the
Chamber of Commerce run by the prlvate sector rather than as a srvice of
the Commerce Ministry and to create a One-Stop Investment Center. The
reform of the public entorprise sector not only reflected Government's
confidence in icreasing private sector activity, but was intended to
improve the supply of necessary inputs to the private sector (electricity,
water, telecommunications).
S1. Prlvate sector activity has pLcked up somswhat in 1989, though mOr" in
the informal than ln the formal sector. The Government needs to reinforce
thls trend both by removing the remaainig growth constralnts to private
sector development and by taking positive steps to foster an enablLng
environment. As employment creation in the public sector is liomted,
growth ln the private sector is to assume greater importance ln provlding
jobs to the increasing numbers of shool Ilavers.
52. 8AL III Measures. Pending implementation of the action plan to
strengthen fin&ncial LitermediatLon (pare. 49), the Government hae launched
a pllot program, managed by an M00, which is to provide access to credit
nd management support to micro-enterprises. In additlon, the Government
has undertaken to:
(i) liberalize progressLvely exlstLng price controls with a view to
-achieving full liberalizatLon by the end of 1990,especlfically, the
Government will 1lft the prlce controls on four comodities (canned
foods, irons, machetes and lanterns) by mid-1990, while the prLces for
the remaining products (except sugar) will be lifted before December
31, 1990 (second tranche disbursement condition); the twinning system
applied to sugar imports will be reviewed to make protection of
domantLc sugar productlon more transparent.

53. Petroleum prlce ln CR wre very high compared wlth those prevailing
in naLghborLng countrles, both because of high consumption taxes, and hlgh
intermediation costs This situation contrlbutes to hlgh transport and
production costs and stimulates smuggling (smuggling La estimated to amount
to 20 percent of total fuel conumption). The petroleum dlstribution firm
(PETROCA), whlch haM a monopoly over the market has already taken som
measures to Improve the situation. The Oovernu*nt is now comitted to
analyze systematically the distribution and pricing system of petroleum
producto and to tak the necessary measures to reduce the cost of petroleum
products to the economy. Recruitment of cnsultants to carry out this
study is a condition of Credlt effectiveness while implementation of the
action plan based on the conclusions of this study is a conditlon of second
tranche release.
D. Sector Policy Reforms
(L) Agriculture
54. kackqround. Under SAL U1, a program of actions was initiated to
strengthen the institutional framework for planning and implementing
sector development, including restructurlng the Rural Development Xinistry
(MDR), and to formulate a national rural development strategy. Incentlves
were increased in the coffee sector by instituting quality premia and
blgher producer price., strengthening the price support mechanism, and by
setting in motion the fundamental reform of the coffee stabilization fund
(CAISTAR), through an agreement to separate its commercial and supervisory
rules and to introduce a flexible producer price. However, following the
sharp fall ln export prices, producer prices had to be reduced by 40
percent for the 1989-90 campaign, to permit pricB support to remain wLthin
sustaliable limlts. In the medimm-term, this will depress output somewhat
if sustained. Yet, the supply respon  will be mitigated as many farmers
failed to recoive the guaranteed price in previous years, and output is
largely determined by existing coffee plantations. PrevLous adjustment
progra_ attempted to improve the competitiveness of the country's two main
agricultural exports (cotton and coffee) in the face of declLniag world
market prlces. Measures were taken to reduce interme4iate marketing costs
whle creatLng prioe  upport funds to prevent the colltpse of producer
prlces and wlth it a return to subsietence faraLng in rural areas. The
food-crop sector beneflted from a more liberal trade and ni ce sytem to
whlch lt reacted very posltively. The cotton sector improved lts financLal
performance by reduiLng intermediation costs, and enhancing productLvlty,
as a result of which productlon costs fell by about one-thlrd, and by
lntroducing a flexible producer prLce.
55. SAL  !r Measures.  Under SAL  !, a plannLag and monLtoring system for
public expenditures in the agricultursl sector will be lntroduced. The new



- 22 -
rural developmvet strategy ywrovides for a shift from the La9gle-crp
approach to extesion anL remrah to a          -       approach that takes
better account of farmers' actual production system  an need. It will
be introduced first ia the cotton sone wher S6CADA, the cotton area
devlopmnt agency, will be splt into - autonomous Industrial enterprLse
which will market and process cotton, and en extension serLic agency
coverLng the entire range of faming actLvities.  The balk up cf SOCaDA ia
expected to take jlace before end-July 1991. The new extension methodology
wvll first be tested in a pllot area starting with the 1990/91 agricultural
cWmpalgn. in parallel, a plan of action will be formulated to restructure
the coffee area development agency (ADIAP), to introduc  the natLonal
rural development strategy in the country 5 second major agricultural son*.
The split of CaISTAB will take place ccording to an already agreed
schedule. Recrultment of consultants to lmprove the accounting systems and
to help wlth the .reorganization of CAIBTA is a condltlon of Credlt
effectlveness whlle adoptlon of the statutes of the two entltles that are
to replace cQZSTAD is a second trancho release condltlon. The agricultural
development agencies lntend to stimulate formation of local farur groups
and to concentrate their extension work on thes groups rather than on
indlvidual farmers. These groups should become LncreasLngly reosle
for provLsLon of nputs and sale of thelr products. over tim  this sbould
permit the agrLcultural agencLes to reduce the scope of their extension
operation.
56. The adjustment program for the cotton and coffee sub-sectors will
further compress intermediate marketing and processing costs, and reduce
production costs. The framework for pricing reform agreed under SAL II
for the coffee sub-sector will be strictly applied. It includes
maintaining the offLeLal guarantoed producer prLce at a floor level,
currently set at CIAF 110/kg and supported by the Coffee lund, and, fro
the next campaign, applyLng a flexLble prlcing system to ensure that
producer prlces better reflect world market prices, permittLag these prices
to rise above as well as drop below the presently guaranteed produoer
price. A major productlvity im     provement program will be Initiated
includLng a coffee replanting program, and segtheW" ning appropriate
research to improve the quality of new platingst this will be financed
under a forthcomlng Bxport Crop Rebabilltation and DLversifLcatLon Project.
The pricing framework agreed under the 1987 Cotton Sector Adjustment
Program (Credlt 2836-CA) wlll be strLitly executed, including the flexLble
producer prLce system.
57. In order to LdentLfy aroP dlverelflcatlon posesbliLties, foreign
markets for crope ecologlcally suLted to CAR will be investlgated. The
objectlve will be to enter lnto contractual arrngements with forelgn flim
that can supply technlcal assistanc and commerclal outlets for selected
products. with the fLnancial support of IDA, the Government will hire by
mld-1990, a qualLfied conoultant to carry out the marketLng survey.
S8. Production performance of the food crop and livestock sub-sectors is
very good and no additional actlon are envisaged at the production level
other than those already programmed or on-going under the IDA supported

course of prepng for            Da oprations n the sector. MM will
analyse the findings of an on-going U8 tD-9,nded food crop marketing study
ln order to identLfy marketing bottlenecks and prepare a plan of actlon to
rove them (by March 30, 1991).
59. To strengthen environmental protection, the Goverment will lntiate
by September 1, 1990 the IDA-financed Natural Roaurce Mana¶ismst Projeat.
whlch lncludes a program of policy and institutlonal xeform in the
forfstry and wildlife setor, cupled wlth listitutional strengthening of
the Forestry Linistry, a forest inventory, an agro-forestry pUiot sub-
project, and a dense forest integrated management sub-project that focusses
on wildlife conservation. In parallel, the overnment has requested
external assiLtance for prearation of a Tropical Forest ActLon Plan that
alms at formulating a national develoymet strategy for the forestry and
wildlife sector. It is expected that preparation of the Tropical Forest
Actlon Plan will start by January 1, 1991.
(ii) Transport
80. Baetwround. In support of ongoing efforts under the structural
adjustment programs to improve agricultural production and exports, and to
reduce the cost of dometic and lnternatLonal trade, the Government, ln the
context of the recently approved Transport Sector Project (TSP), ha
committed ltself to implement a broad array of sector polLcy measures that
would strengthen CAR's transport system and rationalLse the sector's policy
framework. The TSP will specifically strengthen CAR's road maintenance
capacity, improve the rural road network, and buLld a durable and strong
institutional capability to plan, finance, execute and manage transport
sector lavestment and expenditure.
61. Under the TSP, the natlonal freLght bureau (BARC), whose monopoly has
already ben abolLiOsd and rate structure lLberalized, will become a
service organization with a reduced staff  the merits of contLnuing MMRC as
a separate inetitution wll be revLewed by the end of 1991. Similarly, the
CAR Shipping Council (OCAC) will be reshaped into a servlce organization to
ensure maritime transport at most favorable rates for CAR merchandLest a
liberal tarlff pollcy, agreed ln 1989, will be maintained and reviewed in a
tLmely manner to reflect more clearly the cost of transport. Investment
planning will be carried out in conjunction wlth CAR's macroeconomic
parameters, focusesing on priorLty projects with the highest economie
return, and linaked to CAR's capability to fLnance resulting recurrent
costs. To preserve lts lnvested capltal ln the road sector, the Government
w$il reorLent lts road maLitenance strategy through ub-contracting of work
to private interests, and initiating an innovatlve mechanim of preventlve
maintenance.  In addition, rural roads rehabLlitation.and maintenance, .
which hbs been carrled out irregularly and ln an uncoordinated fashion, to
the detriment of the agrlcultural sector, by the MDR and asocLated
agrLcultural development agencies, would be carried out through combined
efforts of MDR, the agrlcultural development agencles and the Ministry of



- 24 -
Publlc Works. This should allow adequate rehabiltation and maintenance
work and a more rational use of funds.              more approprlate cost
recovery ch     are being introduced to pmote moore  fficient road use
and enhance resource mobilLizatioLn. Fally, sveral actions will be tken
to preserve CARas environment in lmprovig road and river transportation.
The above measures, whlch were fully endorse by a recent Round Tablo
sector meeting sponsored by UNDP, are expected to enhance conslderably the
performance of CAR's transport sector, which is crucial to its landlocked
economy
62. In addltion, the oovernment baa declared its intention to partLcipate
actively in Lacrteasd UDBAC-wlde integration, in particular with respect to
ratlonalizatlon and harmonlzatlon of customs regulatLon, taxes (see para.
12), trnslt and transport regulations (vehicle regulatlons, transit
agreements). It lntends to cooperate fully in lmplementation of reglonal
and natLonal measures that may be identLfied in future studies to be
carried out ln preparation of this regLonal operatLon.
(lll) Human Resources Sectors
63. Human resource developmet (HDU) is a critical element for achieving
the Government's overall objective of growth with equity. In the context
of SAL III, the Gove.rnent is commltted to putting appropriate sector
strategLes in place and providing adequate resources to ensure supply of
servioes essential to promoting growth, through improv emnts in human
capLtal, and equity, through enhncement of productivity and employment
opportunLties.
64. To this end, the Government will ensure that over the 1990-92 period
increased budgetary resources are allocated to the educatlon and health
sectors, and that these expenditures are dlitributed within the sectors ln
ways consistent with the overall growth-wLth-equity strategy. This implies
that expendltures will be orlented to a large extent toward primary
education and baslc health care, and toward hltherto dliadvantaged groups
(women and chlldren, especially in rural areas), and that budgeted
expenditures for esentLal operatlng inputs are protected (textbooks,
pedagogical and medical materials, essential drugs, etc.). The Government
is currently revLewing with Ira on a regular basip provlsions for both
investment and recurrent expendltures in the educition sector as part of
the Action Plan of the ongoing UducatLon RehabLlitatLon and Development
Project. A simLlar monltorlng mechani  will be deslgned and established
as part of the Health Sector and 8Da projects currently under preparation.
65. Wlth support from the Education Rehabilitation and Development
Project, the Government has already ensured adequate funding for the
education sector and coamitted itself to address issue of resource
allocation between levels of education and between different types of
expenditure in the sector, with priority bei" given to basic skills
(reading, writing and calculation) in primary education. Tho Government is
oommitted to tedouble its efforts to contain expenditures on scholarships
by tightening eligibilLty requirements. In addition, the distribution of



-25-
scholarships will favor math and cience teacher. tor which there is at
presnt an acute shortage. To that effect, the Strategy ad procedur to
Lmplament these measure will be agree  with IDA, so as to be ln plac  in
time for allocation of study grants for the coming academic yer.
66. The health delivery stem in CAQR bh  suffered yers of neglect, as
reflected by its weak instLtutional capaclty to deliver services And the
inadequat budgetary allocations that are heavily skewed in favor of
tertiary and curative care; only 19 percent of the health budget la
allocated to non-wage operating costs and only 10 percent of the MiniLtry's
recurrent budget goes to regional health services. Lack of proper donor
coordnatiLon has resulted in a further dlitortLon ln resource allocation,
leaving essential services in rural areas in a state of disrepaLr and
without supplies.
67. The Goverrnent will prepare a detailed health sector policy and
operational strategy which will define key pollcy and program measures and
for which XDA financLng will be provided. Taking account of the
epidemiologLcal sLtuation, as well as structural, institutional and
financial constraints, the Qovernment's program aim to strengthen and
expand primary health care delivery, and thus respond to the real needs of
communities. The strategy should reflect overall resource avaLlabilLty and
will be based on an analydsi of needs defined by reglonal and prefectoral
primary health care commlttees and national level authorlties.  The key
elements of the strategy are expected to includes (i) reallocation of
health budgets and redeployment of health care personnel ln favor of rural
areas and preventive health care; (ii) development of a cost recovery
system; (iLL) lntroductLon of an essential drugs program and the
rationalization of the drug supply systems (v) reorganLzatlon and
decentralization of the Mlinstry of Health, through implementation of the
staffing plan, strengthening of-managmntj, and a clearer definltion of
roles and responsibilitLes of different health services; and (v)
rehabliLtatLon of exLsting health lnfrastructure. Xn orderlto assess the
functioning level of the health system, a national inventory li to start in
June 1990, to be financed under a PKW of the proposed health sector
project.
B.  8ocial Dimensions of Adiustment
68. CAR lacks fully worked out social sector strategies, and, as a result,
coordinatlon and synthesis of socLal pollcy are extremely weak. The data
necessary to fonmulate policLes are inadequate, and the human capaclty and
procedures to integrate social consideratlons lnto adjustment and
development pollcles are as yet absent. In addLtion, the dellvery systems
through whbch vulnerable and poor groups could be reached, once they are
ldentifled, do not exlit. The government li firmly comiltted, however, to
Lncorporating the soclial dimensions Lato Its adjustment and development
polLeLes and is currently ln the process of developing the necessary social
sector strategLes. To support this, a Social Dimensions of Adjustment and
Development (8=) Prtject is being developed and will be implmnt nd in
conjunction wLth the SAL XXX program.



69. The SD   Poject, unde preParation, is epected to initaia  the first
phase of a process of strnge        Governat capacity to  ncorporate
socLal dimensions into its  djustm   and dvlopmnt policies. It will do
so through listltutloal develop,nt polily formulation,  ad throuh
action  to mitigat the negativo effects of the economc criLsi  nd
adjustmnt. It will also aim to support actions whlch help the country
achiee a more euitable Pattern of growth that    orall segent
of the population, especially the poor ad vulnrable grouPS. Institutlonal
and policy measures of th  s8DA operation would lcludes (L) establishmnt
of a national information systam. comprLiLng creatlon of reional
statistlcal offlces, policy-orlented social Lndicators, and a user s group
ln key line minLstrLeos  (i) contributLng to the gradual development of a
core socio-economic expendlture program, concentrating on vltal sevices
for the poor, and leading to impo_ment of budgeting procedures and (iLL)
a natlonal traLning program to deelop human resource capacity for design
and implementatLon of SM polLcies and pogram. The 8A project li also
expected to include a priority actLon program of meaues to offset the
negative effects of the adjustmet process and to m_et critical needs of
clearly ldentifLed poor and vulnrable  groups. Thls would involve support
to women. n development (119) initiatLves, skill d lopment programs for
rural and urban youth, strengthening and expansio of Noos and communlty
development programs, and an emergency teacher training schme to replace
teachers lost through the cLvll servlie voluntary departure prornam.
PA  IV - ECOMOC, F*NCIAL AND SOCIM. IMPACT
A.  Economic and Finanoial Impact
70. Economic growth iA 1989 was consLderably'better than in the two
previous years, even permLtting a bme percent growth ln real per-caplta
income. after several years of weak perormance and austerity-based
adjustment polciLes, this was a welcom  outcome, and  se ngthen the
positLon of those polLcy makers who have backed structural adjustment since
1986. This revival in growth was not solely the result of external factors
although exports ros by 1S percent. On the contrary, despite
deteriorating coffee export prLces, stable public sector investmants and
continued retrecmhment ln the clvil servlce, the prlvat sector reacted
favor4bly to the mprov4  business environment resulting  -rom adjustment
measures put in place sance 1986. It is likely that the growth performance
experiqnced during 1989 will be maintained durLag the SAL III perlod, or
even 84rpassed (Jnnex 11, Table 3). ThLi would bermit a modest increase in
prlvate per-capita consuption, while savings, which wr negative a" late
as 1988, would become signifLiantly positive.
71. The food sector (13 percent of oDP) whleh beneflted greatly from the
liberalization of prlces and trade, is expected to grow at an average rate
of 3.5 percent, the result of populatitn growth and increased trade with
urban *rea"; thli sector should be the prlm  b efLiLary of the
introductlon of multi-crop extenslo  services and the new amphasLs glven to

maitenance of rural roads. mh livestock anor 114 percet of GDP),
which has gron in rel term  St anual rates in excess of 4 percent in
1986-8t LO expected to contiue on thls treed, albeit at a soehat reducd
rate; veterinary srvices for cattle are nm baically in place and should
facilitate building up the herds. US coffee and cotton sectors (together
2.4 Prcent of GDP) will continu  to benefit frm th ongolig
rehabilitation of extensio services, and establishment of an adaptive
resarch projet.   owe+e,  if oorld market pries ruaLn depressd
(current price foreasts se a gradual but slow recovery from 1990 l1ve),
producer price will remain at their curret low levels, which could  n the
medum-tem depress the sector. to llght of the previling low yield
levls in coffee  nd cotton production, furthr efforts to raise
productivity are envisaged. The ongoLng efforts to diversify exports (e.g.
medicinal and aruuatic plants, pepper and spices, frults and vegetables)
should also sustain growth in this sector by the end of the period und
consideratLon. A four to five percent growth is expected for the secondary
sector (15 percent of GDP)s the ongolng reform  of public enterprise  will
strengthen its performane while the positive response of the private
sectore r           in 1989, is expected to continue; the  informl sector
is oxpectd to be a major source of growth. The gradual retoxation of a
better pfrfoming financial sector should also underpin the growth of the
private sector. The low inflatLon rate expected for the CAR ecnomy should
also help the overall competitlvenoe of the economy. Private  ervice  are
expected to grow more or less in line wLth the rest of the economy, but
govern mnt services will stagnte for most of the period, as a rXsult of
the policy to reduce the fiscal deficit. gross lnvestment is expected to
increase from 9.3 percent of GoP in 1989 to 14 percent of GDP in 1995j both
private and public sector investments are expected to rise.
72* The fiscal deficLt (on a commitment basis) is projected to fall from
11.8 percent of GODP in 1989 to 7.5 percent ln 1995 and budgetary saLngs
are expected to increase from negat4ve two percent in 1989 to 3.2 percent
of GDP in 1995 revenue Ls to increase by two percentage points of GDP
(from 11.1 percent inJ1989 to 13.1 percent in 1995) as a result' of Improved
resource mobillsation, while growth in recurrent expenditure is to be
rentrained, largely because of slow growth in the nominal wage bill and
termlnation of the severance paym^nts related to the vi luntary departure
scheme. A more rapid growth ln budgetary revenue is likely, given ongoing
efforts, and   uld permt a somewhat higher level of recUSrat expenditure i
without jeopardizing the budgetary savings targt. Public investment
expenditure $is onservatively projected to grow more or lese in line with
oP growth, but should grow faster to the extent that the recently
strengtebned Planning Secretarlat can identify core good projects and find
con¢esioal financing.
8.   Social Impact
73. Deficiencies ln economlc management, a fragle fi sal situation and a
structural adjustment progroh that was initiated to eliamnate major growth
constraint have reulted in serou  ¢social problem. -A key isue Ls the
ln_4quate delivery of health and educational sevLes, a result of
-l A



-28-
distorted and misdirected budgetary policles. The previous structural
adjustment proBras have bgwun to correct this situation, In part by
reducing the sham of wags in total budgetary expenditures.  While reform
in the education sector are under way,  the stratgy for the heath sector
is still under preparation. Employment in the civil srvice and public
nmterprises has fallen and wUl resin stagnant. While a program of
severance pay has ben instituted for deprting civil servants to ease the
transition of redundant workers, the reduction in civil service wspilmt,
coupled with narrow absorptive, capacity outside the public sector and low
growth, reduced substantially the absorption of school leavers lnto the
formal sector. The population of the rual sector ha benfited fom the
removal of trade and price controls, and until recently from the incras
in coffee prices. However, coffee produer prices had to be .reduced by 40
percent this year so as to bring the required support within the means of
the Government. As most coffee production-li done in conjunction with
subsistence farming, and as the guaranteed producer prices of earlier years
were not always paid, the impact of this price reduction is probably not as
great as would initially appear.
74. 6AL III will address these issues in various ways. First, to improve
the deliver_ of ocial services, a core public ependiture program will be
developed to protect essential social services.  The govetrment has
committed itself to increase non-wage recurrent expenditure for priority
programs in the education and health sectors\by an annual 10 percent. An
education sector refora program is being implemented and a health sector
strategy is also being prepared. 8eon, the introduction of a flexible
pricing system for c6ffee will guarantee that when world market prlces
.ncrease the farmer will be the major beneficiary. Third, the
implementation of a multi-crop extension service should mainly benefit the
less privileged segments of the population in rural areas, which tend to
grow other than cash crops. Fourth, an IDA project to enhance the *nablin
environment for the private sector is under preparation; together wlth the
reform of the banking sector, this should contribute to the absorption into
the labor market of young school leavers. Pifth. the Government has glven
its full endorsement to an SDA project which will be launched in parallel
with SAL III.
C. External Financing Requirements
75. The improvement in the current account of the balaunce of payments
already experienced during the early phases of the structural adjustment
program is expected to be paintalned, and by 1995 the current account
deficit (before transfers)' is expected to amount to about 14 percent of
GDPg in 1990-93 the defielt wlll be slightly higher because of the
temporary costs associated with the reform of public enterprlse and the
compensation being paid to departing civil servants, some of which i,e
expected to spill over in higher imports (Table.3). Imports are expected
to grow;ln line wlth nni Gal ODP, but somewhat lese in real term as
domestic prices are expected to grow at a slower pace than import prices
real exports are expected to grow at about the same rate as GDP. However,
the financLng needs, estimated at about US$250 mllion a year for the next N



29-
five yers will remai large. Base on preset trends, somewhat more ta
half of the     ing  eeds are expected to be coverd by grants, while
borrowing on concessional terms for investment purposes may cover about
one-fifth.  Quick-disbursing loans adq debt rescheduliog should finaec  the
balance. The proWosd US$45 milllon SaL UII will finance 9 percent of the
total 1990-91 fLnancing needs, about 50 percent of fast-diabursing
assLstance and 8.5 percent of imports. lrance La expected to finance about
one-third of th6 quick-dLbureLng ausi.tancep the AfDB and EE, significant
sources of qulck-disbursing loan in previous years, wlll be unable to
cofinance the SAL operatlon in 1990 for lack of resources. It ie expected
that they will again provlde quLc-iubur*Lng assistance from 1991 onwards.
Debt rescheduling on sta)dard Paris Club term shculd provide about US$1O
mIllion a year this is ln addltlon to the U8$140 million debt forgiveness
granted in 1989 by the French government. The Bank will assist the
Government in mobilizing these addltLonal resources ln partlcular through
the Special Program for Afrlca. The willingness of donors toa,finance the
needs of the adjustment program will depend critically on the ability of
the Government to adhere to its stated reforms. Based on the progress made
wlth structural adjustment thus far, it le likely that the requLred support -
will be forthcoming.
D.  Downside -Lsks
76. The base case growth scenarlo for the medlum term assume rlgorous and
sustained implementation of the adjustment program. Although the
Government is presently commltted to the reform procss, thls commdtment
may falter or lts abillty to implmnt the program may not be as strong as
assumed in the base case  cenarLo. In addltion, the external envlroment
may be more unfavorable than asumed here. The prlnclpal r9sks are
dLscussed below.
77. InternatLonal Prlces of Key Exvorts. Prlces for the major exports
used in the base case scenario could turn out to be lower and prompt a
negative supply response. Exchange rate fluctuations and the economic
condLtionsiLn industrlalLzed countries may add further to the
uncertaLntLes.  Lower-than-projected prlces would raLse CJRls external
financLng requlr_ments and reduce budgetary revenues. They may also
requLre additional support to producer prlies.
78. Slow Prlvate Sector Develomnt. The SAL III program will create a
more favorable environment for the prlvate sector, and prlvate sector
investment is expected to react favorably. However, the supply response,
mLght be slower than in the base case scenario. In addltlon, the lnternal
adjustment polLcLes underlylng the base case scenario may not improve
LnternatLonal, compettiveness as much and as fast as assumed.
79. Government Commitment to the structural adjustmsnt may weaken. Thli
would lead to slower than expected progress ln the reform of the public
enterprlse, laxer flocal dlsclpline, and slow improvement ln the
performance of the fLnancLal sector. All ln all, thls would reduce the
projected GDP growth and infrease-the budget deficLt.  In turn, this could



-30                             a
tgom  an       t      La the reel effectivel exchan. rate, which was
needed to        the lncentlve  n the sectoW of tradgable. It the
implementatiow capacities of thoeI fl st  of wat  1
in the base case, GOP growth will be loeer
favorable.
80. The Downside Risk Case (Table 4) llustrate  the  abined effect of
such program slipage ad adverse externl factors. The salient feature
of thls scenario aces
(a) lnternational price. realized for key export commoditLes are
gradually fallng to a leel 10 percent lower than tho  of the bas
¢as scenario by 1995g
(b) GOP growth slows dams suply response  in agriculture, industry,
and the tertLary sector are weaker than expected as a result of slow
improvmats  in the incentive env      t
(a) the lvel of private ianetmt rmins constant as the private
sector is reluctant to cot additiona resourcet$
(d) delays ia resource mobiLsation and restturng of  unt
public expenditures budgetary revenue stagnate due to la_e resourc
Mobilisation efforts, and to slower econamic expansioll budgetary
mqpeditures increase as wage bill control weakes in part reflecting
- delays i iwplementing the civil service reform.
81. The outcom of the downside risk scenario would be lower export and
GDP growth, and a deterioration in the iLternal and external balances. The
current account deficlt by 1995 would lncreae to 15 percent of GDP, while
the iovenet of the budget defLeLt would be limited. in 1995, scheduled
4sbt servLie wlth respect to exports of goods and factor services would
aa~mt to 17 percents with respect to budget revenue, cheduled debt
service would amount to 24 percent agalnst 15 and 21 percent respectively
in the bae case. Savings and investment as a percent of GOP would be
substantially loer than in the bas case scenario, weakening the basis for
satisfactory growth ln the second half of the decade. The managmemnt and
coorditation arrangements (descrLbod ln pera. 87) are designed to ensure
program flexibillty and responsiveness to changng carcustanoes. Uxternal
flnancing requirements would increase under th! downside risk ce ariog to
the extent that this is due to a more unfaworable external enviroAment, the
Bank would support the Governmont in lts effort to ralse further
conssiona'te l financlng.

82. It is p_bpesd that the Govorr-mmt  Adjustment program be supported
by an DA credit of SDR 34.5 mllion (US$45.O million equivalent), to be
disbursd in two eqal tranches. te second trench. would be releasd only
after the Government has maft satisfactory peogress in implapentirng the
program and, speifically, ln meeting the condtions Ilite  in para. 86
beow. The proposd'credit i expected t         s                18-mnt
period. It would finAic  about 8.5 percent of projected imports of goods
and services and meet 9 pwrcent of Cm's extera1 fI inning requireuents
over the 1990-91 period.
Frane has already cmitted US$13 mlllion equivalent to the program
in 1990, disbursement of about half of which is conditioned by detailed
fiscal performance criteria. The IM  is expected to continue to support
the program through the third-yeaw  SF. Wherea at thie tLme no firm
cofinancing commitments for the adjustmet operation have been identified,
a special effort will be made to identify such financing in the context of
the sPA.

eligible imports (xcludLng luMy consOmr goods, defense items, an goods
intended for military use). Di*4et imports by the Governmn  and public
and pritvte entities will be proc4rod according to simplified lnteratial

The Government will entrust CAADB with the responsibility for preparation
of withdrawal applications under the Credit and for collection of documents
to be furnished to the Association in support of much applications. These
records and accounts, including those for Sons, will be maintained and
audited each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to IDAg the
audit report will be provided to the Asociation not later than four months
after the end of each fiscal year.  All documents supporting expenses
incurred by using S8OE will be kept and made available to IDA supervision
missions for revew.
PART VI - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS AND STRATEoY
91. As of March 31, 1990, 20 IDA Credits had been made to CAR, totalling
US$234 million equivalent. of this, about US$124 million equivalent was
lent for investment in, and rehabilitation of, the transport, education,
energy, and agricultural sectors, and US$110 million for structural
adjustment, adjustment of the cotton sector, and for technical ssistance
in support of economic management. Total disbursements to date are around
US$194 million equivalent. Total comitments during FY90-92 are expected
to be in the order of US$216 million, as comparqd to US$134 milion in
JY87-89. A US$62.0 million Transport sector Project was approved on Aprll
24, 1990, and a US$19.0 million Natural Resource Management Project was
approved on May 22, 1990u these operations are not yet effective.
92. Since 1986, the Bank's assistance strategy has emphasie,d policy-
based lending. Its main thrust is to support the Government's adjustment
efforts through lending operations and focused economLc and sector work.
The long-term goal is to assist CAR to re-establish sustained per-capita  i
income growth. Three fast-disbursing loans havy ben approved MAL S in
September 1986, a Cotton Sector Adjustment Operation in July 1987, and SAL
SI in June 1988. A Social Dimensions of Adjustment and Development Project
(SDAD) is scheduled for FY91.  For the Government to maintain momentum in
the adjustment process, financial support through a series of fast-
di#bursing loans is crucial ln the face of the serLous difficulties caused
by the drop ln world prices for CAR's principal exports and the conseqent
very tight public finance situation.
93. Given CAR's relatively weak administrative capacity and its lack ot
trained mapower, technical assistance (TA) w$U continue to be needed for
the foreseale future, though increasing emphasis needs to be given to
building ldcal Institutional capacities. TA projrots aWproved in 1982 and
1985 began'to build up project evaluation and planning uhits, and helped to
define policy reforms in the parastatal sector and ln the civil service,,
which were subsquently integrated into the adjustment programs. However,
management and administrative problems limited the development impact of
these projects. Under the Economic Management Project, approved in
~~~~~~~.1,



-37-
December 1988, the Government         a stratey for deployment of TA an
strengthened oordination among Lts  inanoLal partners. The MP aims to
faclILtate Liplementation of the overall adjustment program through
appropriate  ssistanceand training, tihile buLldLag local capaclty ln the
key econoamL management minlstrlie.  Tho Bank has also seconded an expert
to the NnI ry of Transort to asisLt ln transport plannlng and rural
road  expa       n the framework of the IDA-only TA progra.
94. To    l t the omaoecomic and seatoral polLcy measures, adopted
ln the context of the SALs, the Bank group strategy includes operations at,
the sector/project levels institutional develooment oroiecte to buLld up
agrlcultural services and improe the management of forestry resources
through defLiLtion and implementation of a forest management plan based on
sound conservatlon principles; sector roErams focusing on overall sector
lnvestment, LnstLtutional strength  ng, and prlorlty recurrent
expendltures (e.g., natural resource management, transport, energy, water
supply)l and social sector programs to develop basie social servLces,
lmprove lnvestment and expendlture patterns ln health and education,
strengthen statistical capacLty for social data collection and analysis,
and priority actions for vulperable groups, aimed at addresilng the social
costs of adjustment. The possibliLty of further adjustment support will be
examined in light of CAR' s performance and tuture fLaancLal needs.
9S. Agriculture, LacludLng forestry, remains the highest,prLority. in
additio3i to the recently approved Natural Resource Nanags.ent Project, two
further operations are planned ln FY90-92s an agrlcultural tistLtutions
operation, aimed at strengthening extensLon and research servlces, and a
rural enterprLse operation to facilitate divereLfLcatLon and expansLon of
CAR's agrcultural export sector. An'UnterprLse RehabLlitation and
Development Project is undr preparatlon, wLth a pllot mLiro-enterprise
credLt scheme already underway whlch wlll complement adjustment efforts to
prom3te an t abllng environment qonduclve to expansion of prlvate sector
actlvity in both the formal and lnformal sectors.
96. raced teith hlgh transport-costs, and CAR's landlocked position,
infra"tructure lnvestment continues to recelve high prlority in the lendlng
strategy. The recently appzoved TSP integrates all sector investment and
maintenance actLvity lnto a coherent framework, ln close collaboration wlth
other donors, and aims to strengthen sectoral Lnstitutlone, the road
maintenance program (lncludlng rural ro4ds), as well as to address
management Lssues of the international routes to the sea. An Unergy
project, whlch aias to rehabliltate and improve the anagement of the
parastata. provldLng thli key service and make necessty infrastructural
investments, was approved ln January 1989  Lt will also address "smue
rolated to petroleum exploration, prLcing and Procurement. Projects in the
telecommunications sector and in munLclpal development are planned for
Fr94.
97. In the socLal sectors, an Iducation Rehablitatlon and Development
project (approved in December 1987) supports the Government'*s efforts to
reorient lts educatlon strategy toward a more effectlve response to the

CENTRAL AflICAN REUBI~C
STATDEZNT OF, DEVLOPNNT POLICY
FOR A THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSSIENT P
i '                .~~~~NTODUIO3l
1.       Since September 1981, the Central African Republic hbs again enjoyed
a climate of social peace and political stability following a decade of
mismanagement during the 1970s when the country was plunged into political,
social, economic, and fimancial chaos.  On the iuitiative of President
Kolingba, recovery efforts began in September 1981 and by the end of 1986 a
constitution guaranteeing basic liberties and establishing legislative and
judicial powers alongside the sescutive aao adopted. Democratic institutions
election of the President of the Republic by universal suffrage, a
national assembly, and an economic and regional council -- were set in place.
-1th democracy thus restored, a climato of freedom and security was created
which, has al.owed the country first to carry out rehabilitation of its basic
infrastructures and then proceed to reform of its economic system.
2.       Assessent of Previous Adiustment Programs.  Since 1986, the CAR
Government has undertaken structural reform programs with backing from IDA,
the DMP, AfDB, and other bilaterat and multilateral donors. The programs
supported a strategy based on developing agricultural exports and redressing
internal and external financial disequilibria. The goal was to restore the
foundations of the economy and enable sustainable long term growth to occur
through the creatioti of incentives for private initiative, retrenchment of
the public sector from productive activities, trade liberalization,
deregulation of prices and transport And strengthening of public Investment
planning capacity. These key objectives were to be achieved through coherent
policies in macro-economic management, agriculture, small and iiedium scale
enterprises (SMEs), mining, and thrQugh reform of the civil service and of
tle parapublic enterprise sector.
3.       Today, most of these measures have been implemented. Following the
development of staffing plans for each  uinistry and the creation of an
"Assisted Voluntary Departure Program,' (PDVA) the number of civil servants
and public sector employees has been significantly reduced.   Policies
liberalizing transport fnd doestic and foreign trade bave been vigorously
applied.  Special steps have been taken to support agriculture and rural
development.   Ten "public enterprises have been  liquidated and  seven
privatized. Detailed reorganization program have been or are about to be
drawn up for 'strategic' enterprises -- those over which the Government
wishes to retain control -- and some have already been put Into effect
(SOCADA, ENERCA. CAISTAB, Telecoumunications).   They will be  closely
monitored. Efforts to improve resource mobilization have already led to an
imnrovement in the 1989 budget situation.
4.       However, despite implementation of these numerous ueasures, CAR has
made only partial progress toward its goals of financial recovery and
econmlic and social development.
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1



-54-                               AMNE= V
-  The Budget.   Reductions In the budget deficit have fallen short of
expectations due to a fall In receipts which i. attributable both to weak
performance of the key reveue services and to a decline In modern
industrial and commercial' sector activity.    Furthermore, the drop in
vorld prices of the nation's main agricultural exports not only deprived
the government of substantial revenue from export taxes but necessitated
significant subsidies to the cotton and coffee sub-sectors.
- Macroeconomic situation. After a decline in activity in 1987, a slight
recovery was recorded in 1988 and 1989.
- The Social Situation. Signs of tension are appearing. The public service
salary freeze is eroding purchbsing power at the same time as young
graduates are hard hit by the hiring freeze. Rapid population growth,
budgetary austerity, and the still excessive share of the wage bill In
overall recurrent expenditures coupled with institutional deficiencies
have resulted in heaZth and education services which are clearly
inadequate to meet the country'*s needs or to ensure the human resources
development on which its future development depends.
5*       To Intensify and deepen the structural adjustment effort, the CAR
Government intends to pursue Its policy of macro-economic and financlal
reform while strengthening its institutional capabilities.   Hlowever, it
intends to ensure that in future these efforts are more resolutely oriented
toward growth and accompanied by vigorous measures to alleviate the adverse
social effects of adjustment, while promoting the participation of
disadvantaged groups in the development process.
6.       Overall Objectives Rf SAL III.  The economic development of the CAR
is inhibitTd by numerous comlex factors. These include the country's land.
locked position which hampers the export trade, a li$ted domestic market
which penalizes Import-substitution industries, a low level of human resource
development,  and admiaistrative weakness.   On the positive  side, the
country's mineral resources are extensivp and under-exploited while the
ecology of th# CAR is very favorable to the emergence of a' dynamic
agricultural sector.
7.       Nevertheless, It is the agricultural sector which appears to be the
main factor in the country's economlc stagnation. Yields per hectare are
among the lowest in Africa, and the average daily wage for agricultural labor
is negligible. The lack of reliable statistics preve4ts adequate analysis
of this phenomenon but a particular effort will be Wade to remedy this
situation. This effort will not entail carrylng out new studies but will,
on the contrary, utilize the findings of the mny studies that have been done
to date and emphasize the practical application of lessons drawn from field
experience, and, where needed, be pursued through pilot projects.
8.       Despite these areas 'of uncertainty, three main factors -- other than
the pre-1981 political situation -- appear to explain the lack of dynamism
in CAR' s agriculture and general economy. These ares
- inadequate agricultural productivity;



-5ss-                              hU nEXv
- low efficiency in the admilnistration, exacerbated In the provinces by low
population denasity and lack of operating budgets. Furthermore, the 1970
'agrarian reform' did sarious ham to the agricultural sectors exiating
research and extension system were dlsmantled and this lost capacity has
yet to be restoredt
- the overvaluation of the exchange rate, compouaded by the recent
depreciation of the real effective excange rates in neighboring countries
which bave non-convertible currencies.
9.       As a member of a customs and menetary unLon, CAR Is not in a
position to adjust its exchauge rate. Aare of this problem, the Government
nevertheless plans to carry out a'study of the comparative advantages of the
CAR economy and, the domestic and external factors which Inhibit the
development of its potential.  In particular, the study will spell out
practical means for developing this potential to its fullest.
10.      The Government believes that it will be possible to eliminate the
effects of these distortions gradually through an 'internal' endogenous
adjustment policy focussing on:
- rehabilitation of the public and parapublic sectors as part of strict
monetary and fiscal policies almed at m      mintaining CAR's inflation rate
below that in competing countries (results obtained in the past two years
seem promising);
- reduction in production costs;
- revitalixation of the rural sector by reviving agronomic research,
introducing new products and new agricultural methods through agricultural
extension, and opening up the rural sector by Improving the roads network;
_ the  possibility  of  introducing  export  bonuses  to  encourage  new
agricultural exports.
11.      Based on the experience of the first two adjustment programs, and
considering the socio-economic, institutional and exchange rate constraints
which control the development of agriculture and other sectors of the CAR
economy, the Government has opted for a diversified adjustment *nd
development strategy fo0using on the following 116jor themes:
- continuation of efforts already made to r,edress the situation of public
finances and gradually move toward positive budget savings;
- a growth policy based on a gradual increase of public Investment and a
flexible price support system;
-  completing reform of the civil service and improving its efficiencys
- acceleration of the reform progrwm for the parapublic sector -- financial
rehabilitation, restructuring, and privatizatoni
- new efforts to diversify the primary sector (agriculture, livestock,
forestry) through a series of institutional reforms, coherent program of

12.         c        Over the period 1986-1989. during which SAL I and II
were implemnted, the  fiscal Imbalance did not show  any   daal
iprovi.t.          I
13.     Three factors caused the deficit bto re       at a high leel
receipts fr  exports of coffee, cotton a#4 wood which fell by 51S, 35S
nd 302 respectively from 1985 to 1989.  In contrast, receipts tfram
diamond exports ncreased by 52? over the sm period. Thus in 1988, the
drop in cotton and coffee pricey cost the Central African budget CYAF 6
billion (CFAF 2 billion' lost 16 mexport duties and 4 billion in price
mubsidies). -itbout this twofold loss, the deflicit wold have been
'reduced from 142 of GD1 in 1986 to 10t of 9Dt i 1989 instead of being at
its actual level of 122. Ireased receipts nroe  diamond exports were not
sufficient to compensate for thisloss;
- the deveopuet of the finforal sector operating to the detriment of the
so-called modern sector also led to a reduction in revenue since it is
difficult to assess taxable items  in this  sector and evasion is
widespread; and
- poor tax administron.
14.     Despite these dlfficulties, a major effort by the Government allowed
the revenue downswing to be contained at 3? of GDP, the 1989 elimination of
Central Bank profits and payment,s under the exchange rate guarantee
notwithstand ?ng   This was the result of several initiatives of which the
most significant were$
- increasing the supplementary tax on imports (escept on hydrocarbons) by

17.      Ad1ustmert of the Structure of TM Receipts. The authorities expect
annual tax roceipts on average to grow at a higher rate than the naoinal
increase In GDP for the period 1989-1992.  This would derive primsaily from
the expected recovery of the economy and continued progress in improving
financial management.
18.      The experience of the past four years has shown that It is difficult
to improve the level of domestic revenue principally because of widespread
tax evasion and smuggling which are due in part to high tariffs and tax
rates. Consequently, despite the ultimato need to increase the tax burden
appreciably in order to speed the growth of budget savings, the tlm does not
seem right for introducing additional toxes and duties or significantly
increasing current rates. For this reason, the proposed revenue strategy
consists first of broadening the tax base with a concomitant though prudent
lowering of high tax rates, and significant improving tax cervices.
19.      Within this context, stricter tax assessment and a broadening of the
tax base could be improved through the following actiones
(a) Customs Duties. The Government has drawn up a plan of action based
on the results of a diagnostic study of the customs services. The maJn
elements of the plan ares
-  effective start up of the SYDONI system (third quarter of 1990) will
allow the compilation, In real time, of customs settlements and foreign
trade statistics which are not adequately understood at present. It is
expected that computerization will make it possible to monitor the value
of each product more systematically, reconcile trade with  import-export
figures and monitor the application of the exemption systems:
- application of exemptions and diplomatic privileges will be examined in
order to determine their cost and limLt their scope (first quarter 1991).
- creation of a pre-shipment agency in parallel with the operational start-
up of the valuation division in cutams In order to maximize its impact;
-  implementation of Law 88.011, which introduces the principle of taxing
externally financed projects, and of new provisions of the 1990 Finance
Law will be detailed in a directive (first quarter 1990), donors will be
made sware of them (second quarter 1990) and the agencies which oversee
the presentation of new project proposals will ask for qualitative and
quantitative technical informat ion on which to assess the duties and taxes
involved;
- establishment of an effective system to manage the transit of goode from
Douala;
-  finally, the reform of customs tariffs to be included in the overall
reform of UDEAC which the Government is supporting. Reforms will includes
I) revision and simplification of the common external tariff; 11)
replacing the single t*x system with an intra-UDEAC tariff; and IIi)
standardization of the consumer tax for imported and domestically produced
goods.

the     nditure structure.  Nevertheless, the budget devlopmt process
should be improved to allow true policy choices, the deffintion of tb major
groups of xpendtures. ad Upetsh ft better to match resourves with
priorities (July 1990).
21.      She growth of current ex   ditues  in nmln al teras, Is expected
to be roughly equal to that of OP in 199041992 before stabilizing at 102 of
GDP In 1992. This will be achieved as described below.
a.   The wage bill is expected tok total CIAF 22 billion in 1991 as the
full effect of the PWA end rigorous application of the staffing
plans are felt. Thereafter, it is expected to show an aAual growth
of 52 beginning in 1992. Compaterization of the payroll and of
management of the civil eevice (iuly 1991) is expected to Improve
the quality of bhima  resource mnagement significantly.
b.   Nominal annual increases of 102 in recurrent expenses vill be made
for priority actions In Health. Bducation. Rural Development and
infrastructure maintenance. Current expendiurew will be a*nlyzed
by social group to take account of th  social dimensions of
adjustment.  A priority soclal expendituzs program will also be
established to benefit the most disadvataged population groups.
Implementation procedures and progress reporting for this program
will be supported by the Sodlal Dimensisons of Adjustment (SDA)
Project.
c.   Transfers for grants and scholarships will be more or less
stabilized at levels consistent with the national education sector
program. Norms for the allocation of grants and scholarshLps ill
be in place by July 1990. The Caisse Nationale des Pension  viX1
be audited, and reorganized with a view to improving its managemet
(3rd quarter 1990);
d.   All diplomatic and contractual avenues for the forgiveness of
bilateral debt will be explored to reduce the debt service burden
which would remain high if there were only a imple debt
consolidation after agreement with the DK  (June 1990);
e.   The level of subsidies for exports and the costs of adjustment will
remain high as long as wotld prices remain weak. In the event that
world market prices registered a signficant change, the Government
wou1d consult with major donors to seek a solution on the
understanding that for 1989 end 1990. price support vlUl be provided
only up to a ceiling of 16,000 tons on exports of coffee.
PART II. A GROMWE STRATEGY
22.      The elimination of the current budget deficlt and the realization
of budget savings make it absolutely necessary to adhere to very strict
financial policies. In contrast, renewed growth calls for a reversal of the
tendency continualy\to reduce public inveatmnt expenditure which, between
1986 and 1989, declined from CIA? 46 billibn to CIA? 30 billion, or, In GOP

terms for the too period, frm 14.61 to 6.71. lhe goal for -ON couinmg years
ts to incre  thu  ratio to samnuhere between 111 and 142.  In order to
improve the reli4ahlity of Its annual planning, the Governmsnt mill continue
to consult on a regular basis  uith Its =jor dvnelopmet partners on the
composition ad ftnancing of the lnvestmt budget.
23 .     The refom of the sectariat of state for Planning  as mplememted
at the end of 1989 and the staffing planwas  1pls mented In accordance with
the decree. At the saw time, annual woid plans (1989) were developed for
each unit and division. HEwevr, Substantive improvemt in the overall
qualLty and perforxmace of the planning ystem requires efflcient functioning
of the line mainitry planning unlts. Yet at present these units, which are
responsible for coordinatlng the development and follow-up of strategies,
programs, projects, and work plans proposed by the Secretariat of State for
Plannintg, are either wak or nom-existent. To offset this deficiency, the
Governeant will, In 1990, either establish mne  research and planning units
In the line ministries or strengthen those which already exist.   The
Ministties of bducation, Health, transport, and Public Works will be dealt
with In priority.
24.      The plannsing,  -rogrn5 g and monitoring of the lnvestment program
is currently organised around three Instrumentst
-     an Economic and Social Develoysint Plan,
-     the three-year rolling Investment Program and the annual Budget, and
-    Ralf Yearly Reviews of the financial and physical results of the
inrestma_t sudget.
25.      Preparation of the nw economLc and Social Development Plan will be
based on a study of mcroeconomic developments which have taken place in CAR
over the last 30 years and of a Sociological study aled at improving
understanding of nomneconcmic obstacles to C#R's social and ecopomic
development. Given the scope of this inunoative undertaking, it it expected
that preparation of the now Plan will take until the end of 1991. Instead
cof being simply a catalogue of projects, the new Plan will present a
comprehensive overview of andium-term global and sectoral strategies and
resulting policies. It is expected to play a major role in rallying public
opinion around economic and social prioritles and In harmwnising publip
sector objectives with those of other economic actors. A National Steering
Committee for preparation of the Plan will be put In place by the end of
1990. The major themse of the Pla will be.prisented to leading donors In
the fratmwork of appropriate Conultation  In the flrst balf of 1991.
26.      The three-year rolling lnvestment program  (PIP) Is an ossential
lnstrinet for implsmenting and updating the strategic options available
under the Plane. The Plan will be prepared in accordace with the methodology
and procedures established during implIeation of SAL II (project briefs
-- 'ficbes de projet", work plans and program of the various actors.
Interministerial Arbitration Canissions etc.) and efforts will concentrate
on bringing bmut the followlig iJprovementst
- establishment of t.he requirements that a feasibility studyl,be carried out
and found positive, a comprehensive, accurate project brief be established
and flancing be swcured, before ny project is included in the investment

program (October 1990). These require_nta will be set out In a circular
to all ministries  (July 1990) so as to be  in force for the next
Arbitration Commipsion'\sessions;
the formalization and distribution to all departments of the project
selection criteria to be used In selecting all publicinvestments (March
1991);
the requirement that all feasibility studies can only be presented for
approval of the Secretariat of State if accompanied by a correctly filled
out project brief, which would be attached from the outset to the study
tem8 of reference. This directive will be set out In a circular to a11
ministries before,July 1990;
- enhancement of the current content of the PIP Presentation Report by
includingt
-     a macroeconomic section with a brief analysis of recent oconomic
developments and projections of the economic environment in which
the PIP will be implemente4 (December 1991);
x -' a new section in the form of an annotated matrix showing expected
trends in expenditure for free-standing technical assistance over
the three years to come (December 1990);
-     a new section in the form of an annotated matrix shoving expected
trends in public investment expenditure over the three years to come
(December 1991); and
-  adherence to schedules and due dates for completing the PIP Presentation
Report by mid-February (June 1991).
277.     Over the coming years, the Government's investment expenditures will
emphasize the rehabilitation and regular malatenance of the country's
administrative, economic and social infrastructure.
28.      Despite  the  development  of  a  suitable  methodology 'and  its
disemination to ministries, the quality and quantity of the lnformation
gathered was insufficient to provide a section on the physical implementation
of the first year tranchl, of the PIP in the perl"K just completed. In order
to remedy this deficiency, project managers will in future be required to
prepare a project financial and physical progress report to be sumitted
every six months to the appropriate office of the supervising Ministry and
to complete in full the physical and financial monitoring forms which they
receive from Plan.   Initial efforts will concetrate on the following
departments: Education, Public Works, Transportation^ Agriculture, Livestock,
Forestry, and Health (September 1990).
29.      The Government is comitted to further consolidating the very
encouraging results of. the recent recovery and reorganizatio4 of the
Statistics Service of Plan. One of these results has been the resumption of
regular statistical public tions. In practicali terms, this effort will be
pursued through:



-63                                A ANNEX V
- establisbment of a new data base and an mproved methodology In the area
of national accoUts (end 1990);
-  development of an Input/output table (mid 1990);
-  systematic monitoring of Indicators of short-toem economic trends (end
1990)1
syst_matic monitoring of social, \dsmgraphic and regional indicators (end
1990);
- lainching of SDA surveys (end 1990); and
- launching of a consumption budget survey (1991).
^ In addition to publication of specific survey results such- as the 'Census of
economic units in Bsangui (early 1990), the reform the Statistics Service
aind start-up of activities enumerated above is expected to allow the regular
publication in future. of the Statistical Yearbook, Quarterly Statistical
Bulletin, Monthly State of the Economy Letter (mid 1990) and the Regional
Yearbook (end 1990).
PAeT III. CONSOLIDATINGC4 SEVCE REFR  AND IHROVING EFFICIUECt
S0.      Reform  of  the  civil  service. Involved  four  distinct, stagest
diagnosing the situation, sigpificantly reducing the most flagrant anomalies
(cleaning up the payroll,, reconstituting Individual files, etc.), developIng
staffing plans (these s\re now being implemented and should be completed by
May 15, 1940), and cartying out the PWVA.  For the future, efforts should
concentrate oan completing this refonm, consolidating its results and
achieving a better organized, better trained and more efficient public
administration, since this is the Indispensable key, to a policy of real
d"velopment. The Government considers this au absolute priority.
31.      Background.  Sigpificant results obtained under the two previous
SALs included:
-  reduction of 1,750 In the total number of civil servants, from 21,379 in
December 1986 to,l9,629 In January 19903
- a reduction of 1,277 in the totai number of budgeted posts on February 28,
1990 as a result of staffing plan Implementation. iIheX the staffing plans
have been Implemented 14 all ministries, some 2,000 budgeted posts will
have been abolished for i total savings of CFAP 2.1 billion annually.
- some 725 staff quit government service under the PDVA; 919 further cases
were set aside due to a lack of funding.

competitive  em1nstioas  and  two-year  probationary  periods  anm  a
contractual basis for new recrults, taking account of the wage bill
ceilings (June 1990). A new racrultment policy will be defined in t4e
framework of the rationalization of personnel policies. a
GA1osur of CAPP and appropripte  tre gthening of the humian and flnancial
resotrdes of CAPK& by December 1990.
34.      Streamlilnn  Personnel Policies and Procedures.  The objective of
the streamlining is to make bptter use of the sector's human resources and
bring about a significant improvemant In Its performance. New policies will
lead tot (i) higher perfomace  and greater efficiency of gover nmt
services;  (I$) greater accont bility and Aotivation of Staff;  (iii)
strengthening of performmace evaluation and career developmentt ad (iv)
revitalization of staff In-service tra ifsi.
35.      To pursue these objectives, the Government will define and adopt a
set of Integrated, coherent policies In the following areas
-  recruitment and tenure (September 1990)\
- career,management including promotinm, posting and retirement, in tande_
with compesation and tralning policies O(Mrch 1991);
-  staff compensation, incuding a simplifled system of allowances and a
p4lcy linking career edvancemstt to performance criteria (June 1991); bad

36.      In an effort to Internalise the reform process, a vori1shop for high-
level policy makers will be organised In angul in July 1990. It will be
supported by -ta World Bank and vill deal with the problem of civil service
reform. The Government will follow this up with seminars on the role of
managers in the civil service and on the,esiablishment of tools for reform.
The timing of these semLtars will be fialized in cooperation wlth the Vorld
Bank before September 1990.             -
37.      Strengthening  Financial  and  Administralive  NAnatement.    A
prerequisite to strengthenng administrative and fin4ncial management of the
civil service it-to centralie not only all files, records and other
documentation but also the concerned t!cbical services in one appropriate
location so as to facilitate computeriztion under favorable conditiois.
Personnel management capacity will be strengthened in the following ways:
- operational start-up of the computerided payroll and wage bill monitoring
systemis. specifically the master staffSng tables (September 1990) and the
quarterly monitoring of the staffing tables (December 1990, March, June,
September and December 1991);
anaudit of Civil Service files (October 1990);
- completion of the computerization of the Ministry of Civil Service
archives (May 1991);

various ministriess system desigp and preparations December 1990;
Implementation of the system: June 1991;
- complete the computerization of the payroll in tandem with start-up of the
integrated system (June 1991);
- updating of the *master key" for persomnel maagement (October 1990);
- preparation of a methodological guide for career aana8gemnt which reflectu
the policies adapted so as to facilitate consistent application of those
policies and rules (June 1991).
38.      The Legal Framework. The Government will:
- update Civil Service legislation with a view to simplifilation,
consistency with adopted policy, the puwsuit of efficiency, promotion of
a  spirit  of  initiative  and  establishing  incentives 'tied  to  jo
performance. To this end, the Governme*t will undertakes i) a review of
the legal and regulatory framework of the civil service (delive,ry of the
studyt December 1990); iI) the adoption by the National Admlilstratlvea-
Reform Committee (CN3h) of a paper (document de r6flezion) o   personnel
pol$cy; iII) the preparation of an initial draft of a law revising the
civil service general statutes and related legislation, if it Is concluded
'I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



-66-                               ANNEX V
that such revision is, in fact, necessary, or the preparation of fuitial
drafts for modification of the provisions of the general statutes and
enabling texts not in conformity with the new policy on public
administration (June 1991). and iv) the adoption of new statutes or
modifications (May 1992);
-  review specific statutes to bring them Into line with the general statutes
of the Civil Service and with the policies adopted.
39.      Direction. Monitoring and Implementation of the Reforms. Monitoring
and control of the imnplementation of the reforms will be the responsibility
of a National Administrative Reform Committee (CNRA) which was created by
Decree in April 1990 and is composed of representatives of:

-  the Auditor General's Office (Inspection d'Etat);
- the Ministry of the Economy, Finance, Plan and International Cooperation;
- the Ministry of Defense;
- the Ministry of the Civil Service;
- the Ministry of the Interior;
-  the Ministry of the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers;
- the Secretariat of State for Plan;
- other departments and agencies as necessary;
t the General Inspectorate of Finance;
t the Permanent Secretary of the SAL Monitoring Comittee.
40.      The CNRA will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Office of
the President. It will meet at least once a month to propose measures,
examine the progress of those already undertaken and propose corrective
action or new orientations where necessary.  The proposals and observations
of the CNRA will be communicated to the Head of State for consideration and
decision. The existing CPRAC, which is under the authority of the Secretary
General of the Office of the President, will become the technical arm of the
CNRA. Its tasks will be tos
- prepare CMIA meetings;
- monitor implementation of actions decided upon;
- evaluate progress of measures under way; and
- evaluate the efficiency with which government services are provided.
PART IV. PARAPUBLIC SECTOR REFORM AND RESTRUCTURING
41.      Background.  Under the first two structural adjustment programs,
major steps were taken to rehabilitate CAR'i parapublic sector. The first
focused on streamlining the sector so that efforts coul4 concentrate on a
smaller and ;;;re productive portfolio. Three banks (BCI, BND and BNCD) and
seven companies: CCNR (road transportation), SNH (housing),- SbCEFI
(forestry), Inter-lCA (airline), LCA (bo,kstore). CentraHydro (hydrocarbons),
LONACA (lottery) were liquidated. Seven companies were fully privatized:



-67-                               ANNEX V
SIWPAD (agro-industry), LCA (shippLng), NWCA (freight service), SVCT (public
works), CIC; (mechanical engineering), Centracuirs (leather and skins), and
UERIR  (insiarance)   Finally, telecommAnications were opened to a private
partner and the operations of the Societ6 Ratiaonle des Eaus (SNE, the water
utility company) were also taken over by a private partnership. Thus, the
Government's portfolio was reduced from 52 companies in 1986 to 35 at the
present time, of which seven are state-owned, 18 are mixed economy companies
and ten are Public Offices. The number of employees totals 7,451. down from
10,096 in December 1985.
42.      At the same time, the Governmeft launched an extensive program of
rebabilitation measures for the enterprises it retained.  These measures
focused on monitoring the sector and tbh Institutional, economic and fiscal
environment as well as on rehabilitation of major enterprises.
- the rols of the High Commission for State Enterprises in monitoring and
coordination of the overall reform was  significant.   Economic and
financial analyses of the sector are now published each year and much
prqgress has been made over the past three years in the publication of
certified and audited accounts. Only a few companies do not yet adhere
to these requirements.
- at the institutional level, a study of the legal framework of the sector
was carried out, a plan of action was defined for ENERCA, and an initial
performance contract signed with the Government;
- at the economic level, some sectors and sub-sectors were radically
reformed  (cotton,  coffee,  transportation,  energy)  leading  to  the
rehabilitation of companies involved (SOCADA, CAISTAB, BARC, ENMCA);
- at the financial level, numerous measures were implementeds they covered
financial restructuring (a CPAF 1.5 billion settlement between ENERCA and
the Government); fiscal dis4ipline (a decrease in government subsidies to
public enterprises from ClAP 7.8 billion in 1986 to CPAF 5.8 billion in
1987 and CIAF 3 billion in 1988; a rise in budgetary allocations for
Governcent consumption from CFAP 500 million in 1988 to CPAP 722 million
in 1989 And CIAF 1.187 billion in 1990; and wage bill reduction.
43.      The rehabilitation of large, public utility companies began with
ENRCA. A plan of action was established and a performance contract signed
with the Government which gives ENERCA more autonomy to achieve specific
performance goals. Following a study, the Government decided to create a
holding company and a mixed economy company to operate the SNX network.
Finally, after various studies, the Government decided to merge OCPT-
Telecarmunications and SOCATI, and to create a new company SOCATEL with
private sector participation.  The restructuring, investment and finacial
plans are all completed. Other companies have also undergone financial and
technical restructuring: (SCATs Tobacco) or have continued to develop
(SOGESCAs Sugar Company; and Centrapalmt Palm oil company).
44.      Thus, the sector-has gradually improved and this is reflected in its
financial performances after a loss of CPAP 9,773 million in 1987, 1988 ended
with a loss of CFAF 5,656 million and there is hope for further Improvement
in 1989.



45.      SAL III Measures.  Under S  ISS, the Goverment and th  public
eintorprlses will contiue their joint efforts to balaee the consolidated
accounts by 1990 end to create a surplus In 991. To this end, the following
mieasures will be takens
46.      Monltorina. The Nigh Comission will pursue lts mandate to monitor
the sector. It will ensure timely preparation of State Enterprise accounts
and balance sheets and will publish consolidated accounts for the entire
sector annually with annexes for each entepriso.
-  the State Secretariat for Plan, iL  conjunction with the  upervising
ministries and the High Commission, will assist the enterprises to prepare
their 1991 investment programs_
-  the CAnDE will continue to monitor the status of guaranteed loans and on-
lending to the sector. The enabling decree of Law 88.002 regarding the
terms of award and the management procedures for Gov,rnment guarantees
will be published.
47.      Liouidation. In accordance with the undertakings made in connection
with release of the second tranche of SAL It, the Government will make the
necessary legislative and regulatory arrangements to transfer the debts of
the liquldated companLes to CADE and the claims of these same companies to
the Treasury before June 30, 1990, The net status of debts and claims must
be esetablished at the same time as a settlement plan, before the end of Narch
1991.
48.      Privatization.    The  Government will continue  its  policy  of
prlvatization by bringing the sale of ZBlCA to closure and by offering the
State Pharmcy, ICA (the printing company) and SAPUCA for sale.  The future
of SDGA will be decided after the diagnostic study now under way and a
financial audit are c4ncluded. The optioa of liquidating SBG and selling
its assets to potential private buyers, rather than creating a new state-
owned abattoir, will be explored.
.49.      Sector Restructuring.  The following meAsures will be undertaken:
- IMENECG The Government will ensure that NENRCA carries out lts
rehabilitation according to the plan developed I November l189 and the
performance contract signed iL December 1989.
- SOCATEL. This company va8 created in December 1989. Its effective start-
up is expected to occur when certain operations now underway are completed
in June 1990. A performance contract wdl 1be signed not later than
December 31, 1990.
I SNE. Following the Government's decLsion to transform SUN into a holding
company and to create a mixd ownershlp company to carry out lts
operations, various evaluations are in progress. The launching of the new
company is projected for October 1990 and a performance contract will be
8sgned before the end of December 1990. The dovernmet will ceiumicate
to IDA for comment drafts of the documents creating the holding company
and the mixed ownership company and their projected financial statements

as vell as the draft agreement definiag the arr ngements for operation of
the vater collection and supply syste_ by the mixd ownership cmpany.
-  The Ppstal Service.   the Governmnt is committed to *aking urgent
decisions concerning the postal service.   Measures rolatfing to lts
financial services will be taken In the framework of the reform of the
financial sector.
- OCSS and ONI. The Government vill carry out a diagnostic *udit of these
two offices as soon as possible In order to prepare rehabilitation plans
before the end of 1990. Terms of reference fQr these studies have been
prepared.
- CND. Given the weak financial results obtained by the Cmuptoir National
du Diamait (CND) the Government will prepate with the CND a recovery plan
to be submitted to IDA for approval by June 30, 1990.
- MOURA.  The outstanding stock of debt of this company on local banks
constitutes a burden on the financial performance of the entire banklng
system in CAR. The Government will adopt an action pla on the basis of
a diagnostic study to settle its liabilities and dispose of it assets.
50.      Sector Financial Restructuring. Following completion of studies now
under way to determine the sector's financing needs (arrears, cross-debts -
- Juiy l9iO --diverse restructuring needs, liquidations -- March 1991)  the
Government will determine what financial resources to make available to the
parapublic sector no later than end June 1991 *nd, in any event, will include
all or part of these in the next Finance Law. In the evevt the Governoent
decides it is necessary, a special externally-financed operation could be
considereds
- within the framework of the bilateral debt forgiveness arrangemnet with
France certain CAR public enterprises are expected to benefit with regard
to guaranteed or on-lent debt incurred in the past few years;
-  the Government will therefore study the financial situation of these
public enterprises on a case-by-case basis with France.  Only those
companies which present a pressing financial situation and have an
approved performance contract with the Goverment, would be considered for
relief under a debt cancellation or suopension arrangement;
- banking sector restructuring will be initiat d as soon as the
recommendations of the study now under way are =noin.
51..     Financial DiscicRlne.  The Government is co.uLtted to maintaluing
subsidies to public enterprises at the lowest possible level and then oaly
in the framework of a well-defined policy (for instance. cotton or coffee
support) or In the case of compensation for public services. The Government
is also committed to reducing its consumption of water, electricity and
telephone services and to ensurlng accurate budgeting and regular payment for
consumption by ministries, public services, and duly designated high
officials up to a predetermined ceiling in 1991. Regarding this last point,
the Government will publish the list of those entitled to free services and,
the ceilings to be fixed on them before June 10, 199*.

52.      The Legal and Institutional Lramework. The Govprnment vill prepare
draft legislation reforming the legal and institutional framework within
which the sector operates. The following basic principles will be reflected
in the new frameworks
-  greater. accountability of public enterprise maagement, particularly
through strengthe      the jurisdiction and quality of the Boards of
Directors and the Directorates 0marals
-  increased autonomy for public enterprise management to be balanced by
greater accountability;
-  streamlining of supervisory relationships between the Government and
public enterprises.
53.      Performance Plans. 'After signature of the ENERC performance plan,
which will be closely monitored, the Government intends to continue the
policy of establishing performance plans which set specific goals for both
the Government and the enterprise in a given period. Performance plans will
be signed with SOCATEL (December 31, 1990) and with the future water utility
management company (December 1990).
PART V. PRIMARY SECTOR RECOVERY AID DIVERSIFICATION
54.      The recent history of the primary sector has been characterized by
vigorous growth in foodcrop production, fluctuating cash crop response to
prlce incentives, continuing growth in livestock and the beginning of
recovery in the forestry sector following a long period of stagnation and
decline. Under these conditions the Government's strategy under SAL III will
be aimed along these four primary liness
-   ; ^Consolidation of self-sufficienty in food productiont
-     Recovery and diversification of export crops;
-     Strengthening of public and private institutions in support of
livestock developmentt
-     Expansion of the forestry sector within the limits of a policy
designed to1 protect the nation's existing natural resources and
ecological eonditions.
55.      Sector-Wide Measures.  Now that the Ministry of Rural Development
(MDR) has been restructured, the time is appropriate to increase its capacity
to plan and monitor rural development projects. To accomplish this, MDR has
carried out a study on the allocation and monitoring of public expenditures
for agriculture. Donor financial. mateFial and technical support will be
sought within the framework of the Agricultural Inssitutions Project to
assist in lmplementing the recoumendations of this study.

56.      The Government Intends to proceed with implementation of the sector-
wide integrated rural development strategy presented at the Round Table
meeting on Agriculture In June 1989. This will involve the establishment of
a national research, extension and training system encompassing the various
agricultural components of each of the atlonJ's ecological zones and the
orpanization of regional agricultural -ervces whose principal mission will
be to reach producer groups. Initially, the strategy will be implemented in
the cotton-growing savannah region. To convert from a subsector approach to
a global one, SOCADA will, by July 1, 1991, be replaced by two newly created
bodies: an agency for the integrated development of the cotton-growing
savannah zones and a cotton ginning and marketing enterprise.  Preparatory
work on establishing a program of support for the future Integrated
development agency will start around May 1, 1990.  At the same time, the
industrial and camercial structure of the future g8ining and marketing
agency will be examined with a view to completing the devolution of power to
the regions and to lowering costs at all levels. This reduction will be
reflected in the cotton sector tariffs which will be revised downwards.  At
a later stage, the overall strategy will be applied In coffee-producing
zones. To achieve this, a plan of actlon will be prepared for restructuring
ADECAP as an integrated rural development agency for forests and peripheral
forest zones. This plan will serve as the framework for a larger program of
crop diversification, rehabilitation of coffee plantations, and the promotion
of agroforestry.
57.      A National Institute for Agronomic Research will be created with the
goals of improving CAR's agricultural productivity and facilitating the
promotion of new crops.  Its main features will be: a lean central structure,
a  regional  orientation,  applled  research,  permamnet  liaison  with
International agencies, and strong links to extension work. A PAO study on
this subject is near completion and IDA financing is being considered. The
first concrete steps should follow quickly on the establishment of the rural
development agency.
58.      A plan for restructuring agricultural tra.ning is urgently needed
in the areas of higher education as well as In the training of managers,
technicians and farmers. Using the framework laid out in a recent ?AOJUNDP
study, MDR, in collaboration with the various financiers involved, will
quickly develop and Implement a policy in this area.
59.      Structuring of the rural sector will be one of the priority tasks
of the development agencies. A plan of action will be drawn up to permit
rapid establishment and operation of rural associations. These associations
shbuld ultimately take over management of input supply and produce marketing
and act as facilitators in ensuring access to credit and to extension
sprvices. In this way, it should be possible for the development agencies
to disengage progressively from such activities. Over the medium term, these
associations would combine into regional and, later, a national organization.
60.      Quality control, price regulation and agricultural product marketing
will be reinforced.   These are major objective* of the restructuring of
CAISTAB in accordance with an agreeoent reached with IDA under SAL IS.
Internal restructuring of CAISTAB has already been carried out and has led
to its effective separation Into two distinct departments, the comercial
department and the regulatory departmnt.  At the sam  time, staffing has



-72-                               ANNEX V
been ieduced and operational savifgs have bsen reflected in a reduction of
the fixed levy from C141 44/kg to CFAP 22/kg. The 1990-91 tariffs will take
account of the total of CAISTAVU fized levy. to be determined as a function
of CAISTAN's operating budget.  The accounting systems in both departments
wiii be strengthened through provision of specialist assistance.   The
market*n8 function will be split off from CAISTA  and will compete on equal
terms with other coffee exporters. in thls wvy, a coffee marketing company
will be established.  what is now CAISTASB  ill become the Agricultural
Produce Control and Regulation Office. Legal Instruments establishing these
two entities will be published before the end of May 1991 to allow start-up
on October 1, 1991.
61.      The operations of the future Office will cover not only coffee but
cotton and possibly other crops, in particular, diversification crops.  Uhe
Office will be rexpoasible for revising the coffee and cotton price schedules
annually, and for checking that these schedules, and the mechanisms for
establishiAg cotton and coffee producer prices and determining the amount of
the state subsidies for the coffee and cotton seasons, are properly applied.
The services of a management auditor independent of the administration shall
be engaged with external financing for a period of 24 montbe to verify proper
application of the price regulations and subsidies to the coffee and cotton
subsectors, to monitor implementation of the CAISTAB restructuriAg plan, and
to provide the technical support needed for proper understanding of current
regulations on the part of all parties involved (MDR, Ministry of Commerce,
CAISTAB, Muinstry of Finance, coffee and cotton operators, and commercial
banks).
62.      Food Crops. CAR is one of the few countries in central and western
Africa whose internal market has not been invaded by imported grain.
Rehabilitation of the road network, liberalization of trade and internal
transport and the return of social order have allowed the country
progressively to become self-sufficient In food production again. Increased
food crop production (up more than 6S per year between 1984 and 1988) is a
recent development, and one of the most encouraging in the recent history of
the CAR economy. In itself, the food crop sector represents 15Z of CDP and
412 of primary sector production.
63.      while the food crop situation is good, a number of steps can be
taken to consolidate the results obtained and to promote an energetic policy
in this field.
64.      To accomplish this, important efforts will be devoted to improving
the productivity of agricultural labor in production of food crops,
particularly manioc, the main staple. The tools to put in place include
research and extension services, combination crop cultivation and the
introduction of animal traction,
65.      The intensification and diversification of food crop production
cannot be achieped unless the value of these crops is lncr4ased by action to
promote processing and marketing activities. In the course of sector project
preparation (support to agricultural institutions and rehabilitation of rural
enterprises), MDR will analyze thi results of surveys financed by USAID on
the domestic food crop marketing network to Identify the constraints. A plan



, ~ ~   ~   ~    5  ____=
of action aimd at rmdyin  such  omstraitts Inthe ezistin  network will
be prpared before 31 Dec,&er 1990.
66.     Livestock. Of all the sectors of       CAR ocony, livestock has
--probably had the met stable growth rate ss its introductim about 60
years go9  ,Itprovides tbh  urba  and rral populations with. a rich source
of protein at a very favorable price ad purchases by livestock fata rs frm
crop farmers have a positive effect an food crop devlopmt In the livestock
areas. The livestock sector Is performing well, the main effort nedeld is
to consolidate gains. ARM mad PM  provide. solid institutioal base for
efforts to   prove animal bealth, foster the  fomation of livestock
associations and. to a lesser extent, streamline the markting system.  A
special effort will be made to put livestock by-products to greater use.
Nanagem.nt of tbe livestock fund will be stregthened to tighten collection
and iVprow; use of the fund. _
6t.    Beyond the action outlined above, the key to sustained fbreher
development,of the livestock subsector Is strentheni    of ch nnel for mast
marketing ald distribution. An operationl and finacial audit of SEGA, the
state-owned abattoir, will be conducted prior to July 30, 1990. At the *s_
time. using an analysis of the current situation as a basis, a 'white paper-
with a maeter plan for the short- and long-tern development of CARk'!
livestock subsector will be prepared and made availailo by early iumt.
Based on the conclusions' of the various  nitiatives, tbe Gvernment will
sefine its position on the future of SGA and the mast subsector priori to the
end of 1990. The option qf sellfing SG's assets to private purchases will
be studied 1a prefereC*e 1o establishment of a new abattoir.
68.     Cash Crne_. Although cash crops represent only 21 of GDP and 5.51
of the primary sector's output. they could   ke a significant future
contribution to development of CAR's agriculture and to productive managemnt
of the country's remarkable ecological potential. The challenge of constant
fluctuations in export mat*ets and the sharp fall In world coffee prices
calls for urgent action to Identify new crops asd new  markets.  Howeve
diversification represets a leap into the unkapbn.  Prudence dictates a
balance between promoting the recovery of traditional crops and new. crop
Initiatives.
69.      The Coffe  Subsector. The precipitous fall In the world price of
co*fee has led the Government to adopt a number of urgeat masures to reduce
costs at all levels of the bsectok. The guaateed producer floor price
has been osarpli reduced.  he -coffe  berry producr price hs been reduced
from CFAF 190/kg to OPAl 110/kg and-the schedule of intemedoate costs bha
been narrowed. k Simltaneously, a flexible systems for estailishing cffee
produce; prices has been set up to allow autmtatc adjustnt of prices above
current levels .(the floor price) hen world prices again allow for ^ surplus.
This inew flexible mchanim for setting coffee producer prices will be the
subject of appropriate legislation during 1990.  A draft text wll be
submitted to IDA f6r coent before September 30, 1990.
70.     A coffee producer price sq port fod *as set up uoder SAL II to
guarantee the minimum prices it Is eubsidised from the -ational budget and
may, in future, also receive external funding. The Government'e financial
difficulties have caused disbursement of budgetary appropriations to be



-74                               AM=ZXV
significantly delayed. Back payments due for the 1988-89 groalng season Vill
be made up; re-exports of coffee from neighboring countries are not covered
by the subsidies.  The necessary allocations to cover the settlement of
arrears were included In the 1990 Table of FInanc*al Operations and ill be
disbursed as the availability of fu4ds *11ows. the Govennmeut will take
rigorous measures to control the flow of coffee originating from neighboring
countries; specifically, a ceiling of 16.000 tons equivalent will be placed
on the crop for which the subsidy will be paid. For the 1990-9i! season, the
system of flexible prices to -be published before December 31. 1990 will
intrqcIuce a minium guaranteed price wbich will vary as a function of world
prices and of the projected availability of government funds.
71.      A program will be drawn up for rebabilitation of the nation's coffee
plantations. It will include the provision of needed tecbnical assistance -
_ for the introduction of more efficient clones, extension of growing
techniques and appropriate post-harvest measures -- and finenclal support in
a form to be defined, but which could Include bonuses for replanting. This
program will form part of the overall approach that has been planned by the
agricultural'support services; its technological and fInancial resources will
be  available 'for crops other than  coffee lin  the coffee  zones  (cf.
diverelfication policy).
72.      The Cotton Subsector.  The recent increase in the cotton ezport
price and SOCADA adjustment measures give reason to hope that the subsector's
financial balance can be progressively reestablished.  Measures have been
taken recently to reda4ce marketing'costs (15? reduction in bonuses, insurance
and transport savings) over and above the very satisfactory deficit reduction
achieved under the cotton sector adjustment program.  Over the next two
years, efforts to adjust the subsector will proceed mainly along two tracks.
73.      First will be investigation of the possibility'of further savings
from reduction of intermediate costs Included in the price schedule,
adjustment of the producer pricing mechanism, and application of cotton
subsidy funds in accordance with the recommendations of the March 1988
financial mission.  No modifications adopted will be allowed to bring the
fimdamental principle of producer price reform into question, but they will
delay price increases until such time as the entire subsector deficit (for
lboth fixed and variable costs) has been covered.   Modifications to the
statutes of the cotton support fund will respect the principle of support
through State subsidies (or- donor financing) and will iot call for the
reestab ishment of stabilization funds. Second will be implementation of the
integr-ted rural development program for savannah' cotton zones which will
include promotion of animal traction methods. The program will be in lint
with the approach, which calls 'for productivity increases not only in cotton,
but in other crops in the zone as well, including the introduction and
improvement of diversified cash crops.
74.      Diversification Crops. The promotion of diversification.,crops will
be an important focus of agricultural policy. It will be pursued through
setting up agiicultural support services which, as already stated, will not
be limited to one crop but will be available for a range of possible crops
in the particular ecological zones involved. A careful analysis of market
outlets, both domestic and foreign, will be carried out. For the domestii
market a special unlt will be set up under the rural enterprise recovety and

crop divereLfication program for which fin ncing, primarily from IIDA, Is
currently being sought, In order to orient potential  investors toward
promising opportuAities. With regard to foreign markets, *in preparation for
the  new  program,  iotentia   overseas  partners  for  marketing  such
diversification crops as vegetables, ;fruit, flowers, tonics., spices,
medicinal plants and those used in the manufacture of perfurms will be
identified.  Cowerial anA technical ties will be established with such
partners in tandem with Investment by nationals.
75.      Sector Financing Policy.  Foreign exchange rate distortions and
world price fluctuations seem to call for the continuation of subsidies to
sectors In which CAR has a comparative advantage. However, the question of
bonuses should be carefully examined. First, because it is important to
guard against a subsidized operation unduly displacing a non-subsidized one
whose comparative edvantage is equal, or superior, to that o. the subsidized
operation.   The problem ti  not significant, since the range of CARhs
agriculturai exports is fairly limited. However it could becomd a major
problem when this range increases as a result of the diversification program.
Second, and more importantly, the focus sbould be on the gradual replacement
of price support by a system of investment-oriented bonuses to be financed
from external funds within the framework of the projects already discussed.
Investment bonuses for crop diversification is the most striking instance.
monuses oriented to increased productivity of traditional crops -- for
instance destumping or equipment acquisition bonuses to promote mechanization
iu cotton zones, or replanting bonuses in coffee zones -- could allow rural
incomes to vemain at present ievels over the long term with significantly
lower produc)r floor prices.   Moreover, although difficult to administer,
specific bonuses of this kind would result in a reduction in illegal *mports
motivated by the price support system. The possibility of establishing an
agricultural investment promotion fund to help increase productivity in the
cotton and coffee regions will therefore be explored.
76.      An agricultural credit policy will be defined in conjunction with
the issue of bonuses.   An initial draft of such a policy based on the
recommendations of the banki#g system study currently underway will be drawn
up as part of preparation of the agricultural enterprises recovery program.
77.      Development and Promotion of Forestry and other Natural Resources.
CAR's forests -are among the richest in Africa. Productive managemeat and
protection of forests is critical to the vell-being of the rural population
(firewood.\hunting and gathering. and medicinal plants), as well as to the
development of primary exports (timber) and to the nation's industrial
productionl Moreover, CAR straddles the East and West African ecosystems and
has one of the most diverse wildlife populations on the continent.
78.      These resources are being degraded #t an accelerating rate through
deforestation, poaching, land-clearing and brush fires.  Measures must be
taken to enhance the value of this natural heritage and preserve its
environmental balance. Two new government program will be implemented in
line with initiatives already taken with the aid of external financing-
-     a natural r~source management support program tp provide the means
necessary for better management and more effe tive protection of
forests and wildlife, for eand understanding of the production

potentlal of the forest ecosystem, for pilot programs to reduce
agricultural pressure on forest rangeo and for developamnt of nature

strategy for thb sector and ibcb would Include preparation of five
complementary investment orientatios. Integration of forestry In
land  management  system,  developomnt  of  forest  industries.
Improve met of forest range productivity in terus of 'wood anergy',
conservation of ecosystems, and Institutional strengthening.
79.      In addition to these efforts, *1ich will be supported by an IA
Credit negotiated in March 1990, other lnitiatives vill-be taken to Improve
the management of the sector's resoureces. Chief among these are the revision
of the Forestry Code (introduction of logging petmits, user fees on lots
replanted or developed by individuals or collectivities, and monitoring of
forestry  industries  to ensure  their compliance with natural resource
protection policies), and creation of a Forestry Fund, financed by domestic
taxes and foreign resources, to implement program for the protection of
natural resources and for reforestation, forest; and park manageusnt.
80.      In general terims, the Government wishes to promote a long-term
environmental protection policy. A seinar organised oan this subject in
Bangui in January 1990 recommended, among other things. the establishment of
a national cotmittee on the environment.  Such a body would serve as a forwm
for discussion, education and coordination and would set ub,ut developing an
environmental data base. Contacts would be pursued with similar bodies
around the world and the complittee i6uld work to promot  the exchange of
ezperience and the initiation, of scientific and technical cooperation. Somu
of the topics to be considered by the *ational commLttee will be. protection
of the forest, fighting bush fires, the defidition and organLzation of a
range management system, the prevention of toxic waste dumpfing, highwby
routing and the uonitoring of atmospheric pollution.
PART VI. PRIVATE SECTOR DIULOPHENT
81.      Development of Private Business. The industrial sector Is made up
of public industrial and commercial enterprises and of prlva&8  enterprises
In both the formal a4d informal sectors. Industry and comu_rce have suffered
from the economic crisis that has caused a reduction In aggregate demand, A
liquidity crisis in the banking sector and the flight of private sector
enterprises from the formal to the informal sector. A particular effort has
lready been made to restructure and revitalize the parastatal sector (Part
* V). Results to date are promising.and the Governm!It is (onvimced that this        i
sector, once stabilized and performing more officisetly, will be an Important'
source of growth In thi coming years.
82.  -  A number of initiatives have already been undertaken in favor of the
private sector under SALs. I and IIx price deregulation, transport sector
decontrol, the decision to create a one-stop agency -to facilitate private
i_iestment, the promulgation of an Investment Code and a law Intended to
promote Small and Nedum Znterpriss, discussions oan the role of the Chamber



-77                               ARO=f V
of Ca_rce, and a micro-entorpt.se pilot project. Further Witiatives will
be taken  to  consolidate  gai"    ad  to  Increase  thei private  sector'*
lnvolvement in cimerce and Industry.
83       The Qoverntnt vill take the necessary legislative and regulatory
steps to allow progressive liberalization of prices still subject to control.
Specifically.    the  prices  of  *sz  itm_  --  canned  products,  tomato
concentrate, hurricane lamps, irona, hoes and mchotes -- will 11e liberalized
before June 30, 1990 and the rm-laning products still subject to price
control, except for sugar, before December 31, 1990, thereby bringing price
control of all products to an end.
84.      The Government has taken the necessary  steps to bring about
restructurlng of the Chamber of Cnmerce, Industry, Mines and Artisanal-
Trades and to ensur its fanclal autonmy nd integration Into the private
sector.\ Tbe reorganization plan designed to bring this about provides for
elections in November 1990 and the inauguration of the new structure in
'January 1991.
as.      The Government has already opted for the one-stop approach to
promotion of private investment by nationals and foreigners. It now Intends
to finalLse the study on this approach by August 31, 1990 ani to establish
the *one-stop" office by end December 1990.  The Government will also carry
out a study almed at the definition of a CommercLal and IndustrLal Code and
will prepare a draft code before March 31, 1991.
86.      The Government has already taken,a number of steps to promote _mal
and medium scale enterprisqs and industries. Including Law No. 88 014 of
Aqgubt 27, 1988 and accompanying decree No. 90.030 of January 30, 1990
which instLtute a preferential regime for SNEs.  The actions the Government
_~mtends to take a8  designed to promote SMEs and maintain a favorable climate
for investment In the country.  The Government, in cooperation with the
Chamber of Commerce and CAHMAl, will review the impact of existing
legislation on the SMS sectot and an the level of new investment In the
private sector at least once a year. Following these reviews, the Government
will consult with IDA tn the results of its analysis and on what corrective
measures, 'if any, are needed.
87.      The Government Is committed to present to the National Assembly a
draft law modifying the provisions of Law 88.014 of August 29, 1989,
concerning regulation of property transactionp, before May 15, 1991\ This
draft law, ihile maintalning provlsions intended to facilitate the
acquisition of property by nationals, will ensure that such, provisions do not
constitute a constraint to private foreign Investment in CAR.
88       The lftrav Sector. The high cost of energy and the lack of reliable
energy production Is restricting the development of CARhs industry.  She
expansion of thermal energy production and capac4ty depends chLefly on the
reorganizatio of MDUCA and of its capacity to generate and recover the
'resources  needed  for  operation.    The  )'Bali  dam,  currently  under
constructLon, should considerably Increase and stabili;e production of
bydroelectric power in 5990.   Petroleum  resource exploratioa  has been
suspended.  Nevertheless, the dover~ment will engage consultant services to
e.mine the technical, legal and taution conditions *ich could make, renewed



- 78 -                  i          ANNEX V
exploration attractive.  The consultant will begin work In 1990 and the
report will be submitted to the Godvermont In 1991 for a decision within
three mouths.  In order better to evaluate all the factors affecting the
price of petroleum products in CAR, the Government will iitiato a study of
the supply, pricing and distribution systems. Terms of reference for this
study have already been approved and the study will be conducted as part of
the IDA-financed Energy Project. The consultant will be chosen before mid-
June 1990. Depending on the study recommendations. the Government, in
agreement with IDA, will, if necessary establish a program for improving the
operation of this sector.
89.      The Transport Sector.   CAR's enclave position, its  geographic
extent, the scattered nature of the population and the dilapidation of the
infrastructure network in the 1970s mke the cost of transport very high.
Moreover, transit of goods is often uncertain and subject to long delays.
This impedes the socio-economic development of the nation and, to remedy the
problem, the Government intends to take the following measures under a
Transport Sector Project (TSP) scheduled to come on line in 1991 t
-     develop  regional cooperation  and  improve  transit procedures,
particularly within UDEAC;
-     pursuit  of  further  transport  liberalization,  in  particular,
following through on the reform of SARC and application of the road
transport policy, easing of controls, the reorientation of the
Central African Freighters Council (CCC)  to make it a positive
contributor to the economyg
-     strengthening of transport security, particularly road and air
transport security;
-     management of the Public Works Workshop on a commercial basiss and
_     improved coordination between the Ministry of Rural Development and
.the Ministry of Public Works to establish a strategy for mproving
maintenance of the secondary road system in the rural sector.
90.      The Financial Sector.  In its effort to adjust and restructure the
economy, the CAR Government has decided to rely more an private initiative
and market signals to guide the allocation of resources.   However, an
effective financial system is needed In order to draw the greatest benefit
from this expansion of the role of the marketplace.
91.      The Institutional Framework.  As a member of the Bank of Central
African States (BEAC), CAR shares with the other member countries a common
currency whose parity is fixed against the French franc, and C4R applies a
monetary policy which is largely determined b? the entire anion. CAR
financial institutions have traditionally preferred to supply services to
short-term activities essentially geared to general trade, and to foreign
trade only in the form of crop credits.
\92.      There are no appropr\iate banking structures for financing medium-
or long-term credit, which isX generally thought too risky and In which thX
CAR banking sector has shown little Interest.  Moreover, CAR has relied to



- 79,-                            ANEX V
a great extent on external financing for nvoestment and to meet its budget
deficit.   The result is that financial ntEermediation is very weak and the
situation is compounded by a low savings rate. A large part of the money
supply is held In liquid form and outside the banking system, reflecting the
poor development of the financial networks,, inadequate credit interest rates
and a low level of confidence iu the banking sector.
93.      In the early 1980., the financial sector encountered serious
difficulties which culminated In the liquidation of three banks.   the
financial sector is currently composed of the Central Bank, three commercial
banks, three Insurance companies and, oe postal savings bank. Of the three
active commercial banks, two are operating more or less on a solid footing,
the third is in difficulty following the bankruptcy of its principal overseas
shareholder. The Government bIas recently authorised the People's Bank of
Morocco to operate in CAR    This bank, known for its successes with
mobilisation of rural savings in several African countries, will operate with
a minority shareholding by the CAR Governments its mission is to revitalize
savings collection.
94.      A New Banking Sector Policy.   In collaboration with BEAC, the
Government intends to strevgthen financial intermediation. This will involve
several lines of action to be further specified as thinking in this area
evolves. First, a study is underway to evaluate the situation and establish
a plan of action. Its primary purpose is to examine the conditions under
which the CAR could create more solid and better managed financial structures
(increases in equity, settlement of bad and litigious debt in both the public
and private sectors), within its own macroeconomic framnwork and in
accordance with the banking system reform presently under study for the whole
DEAC monetary region. Revitalization of the banking sector should be geared
to support the promotion and the development of SHEs and SMIs.
PART VII.  UNAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
95.      The development of human resources is not only a primary means of
achieving the objectives of the Structural Adjustment Program, it is also
the essential aim of the program. Accordingly, the Government has committed
itself to a number of actions in this regard.   First, a strategy for
development of the education sector been defined and is supported by the IDA-
financed Third Education Project. Second, a health sector strategy is being
prepared in collaboration with experts from IDA and other donors. Third, the
Governmert intends to increase non-salary current expenditures in the health
and education sectors, as was done in the 1990 Finance Law, on an annual
basis.
96.      Education.  The Government has been following a series of policies,
aimed at rehabilitation of the education system since 1981.   Strategic*
priorities were identified and set in place upder the 1986-90 Five-Year. Plan,
These,have received support from various multilateral and bilateral donors
and  the  Government has  also made a  significant  contribution  through
allocation to this sector of a quarter of its budgetary resources.  However
these=efforts-4o not seem to have yielded satisfactory results so far. On
analysis, it becomes clear that development of the education system is
