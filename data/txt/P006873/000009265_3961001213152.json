(MOPT); (c) improve road\n            maintenance planning and practices; (d) rationalize the\n            structure of MOPT; (e) provide a smooth transfer of part of\n            the national road system to the autonomous regional\n            governments; and (f) improve the environmental management of\n            MOPT.  The project finances a share of the five-year\n            investment program, including:  (i) completion of about\n            2,000 km of roads; (ii) twelve new road projects totalling\n            about 400 km; (iii) a bridge rehabilitation program; (iv) a\n            river training and dredging program; (v) equipment purchases\n            and rehabilitation; (vi) road safety works; and (vii)\n            technical assistance, studies and training in the areas of\n            organization and management, road engineering, road\n            maintenance, management information, supervision of works,\n            and environmental control."}, "docdt": "1992-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
