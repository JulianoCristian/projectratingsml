F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of health and pension insurance systems
by provision of high quality technical assistance and training to help implement existing
reforms and to help design options for future social insurance reforms.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The project development objective was not revised. However, three intermediate
outcome indicators were added prior to MTR in November 2005 and one indicator was
added after the MTR in March 2006.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) faced several challenges in the period following the war,
including prominently that of weak institutional capacity. Reform of its public sector
institutions was thus a priority as the country moved its focus from post-war
reconstruction and recovery towards building a sustainable economy. Concern about
sustainable social services and the need to reduce household risk and vulnerability
featured prominently in the reform agenda. The social protection system, in particular the
outdated and fragmented pension and health insurance systems were of concern, and
reforming social insurance had become an important part of the Government agenda.

The health and pensions systems were built on Bismarckian principles that guaranteed
universal coverage through universal contributions. While this system worked in the pre-
conflict context of high formal sector employment and well-functioning institutions, it
was no longer adequate in the post-war environment. The government had initiated some
reforms of the social insurance system aimed at fostering good governance and strong
and accountable institutions at state, entity and local levels through the Public and
Finance Sector Adjustment Credit (PFSAC II). However there were still many unresolved
issues that needed to be addressed, chief among these were: (i) a high wage and tax
contribution burden; (ii) low compliance with wage tax obligations; (iii) inadequate
inclusion of farmers and the self-employed; (iv) inadequate data exchange and access in
the social contributions collection system and (v) lack of portability of pension and health
insurance benefits.

Pension System
BiH had a single centralized pension insurance fund and despite post-war reforms the
pensions system still faced a number of problems including: a significant decline in the
pension contribution base after the war; a rapid increase in the number of pensioners;
financial imbalances; growing pension arrears and fragmented financing mechanisms
resulting in unequal distribution of social assistance funds. The pension system was also
plagued by outdated managerial structures and practices, weak business processes and
internal controls, human resource issues and poor coordination between the two Entities
pension funds.

Health Sector
After the war ended, each of the Entities in BiH was responsible for delivery of its own
health services. The health sector therefore comprised of 12 distinct health systems; one
centralized system in the Republika Srpska (RS); the decentralized system in the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) with one health system for each of its ten
cantons; and one in the independent district of Brcko. The health care delivery system
placed a big emphasis on tertiary care and specialized services as opposed to primary care,
with the country having too many hospitals. Post war decentralization of the health



                                              1

system in BiH resulted in an unreasonably low level of risk pooling for health insurance
funds, and as such a large share of the country's GDP (more than 12%) was spent on
health care. Over one third of these expenditures were covered by out of pocket payments
by private citizens with the poor disproportionately affected. Although new health
insurance laws which aimed at universal access to a basic health care package, equal
access to services and efficient financing and delivery had been passed these were not
fully operational. The existing health insurance funds in both entities required
institutional reforms to enhance risk pooling, build capacity and increase the use of
modern health management methods.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The rationale for Bank assistance in the social sectors and in health and pensions in
particular, is set out in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (FY00-02), dated June 14,
2000. The main objective under this was to improve the sustainability, effectiveness and
equity of social services and social safety nets. This project was an essential input into the
overall sector reform process, as it was aimed at building the institutional capacities in
BiH to implement the commitments it was entering into in the adjustment credits
(Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit [EMSAC] and Social Sector
Adjustment Credit [SOSAC 2]) that were being put in place during this same period and
that were shaping the policy framework for a modern social protection structure. Hence
the project was in line with the main objectives of the CAS- it aimed at providing the
skills that were needed to strengthen institutions and governance in the two sectors and
render them sustainable.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

Project Development Objective. The objective of the Social Insurance Technical
Assistance Project (SITAP) was to "strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of health
and pension insurance systems by provision of high quality technical assistance and
training to help implement existing reforms and to help design options for future social
insurance reforms".

The PDO was to be achieved through the provision of interactive technical assistance and
capacity building that would strengthen institutional and business processes. Key
institutional areas included strategic policy planning and options for systemic reform;
planning and management of policy implementation; communications; and stakeholder
involvement in policy planning. Key business processes included resource mobilization
and use of resources; coverage; and customer service standards.

In turn, these interventions were to result in improvements in governance, sustainability,
coverage, and service provision, resulting from a better understanding by agencies of
their goals and objectives. Project interventions would also result in greater capacity for
strategic planning and policy making, as well as improved business processes
emphasizing greater transparency and accountability.



                                              2

Key indicators relating to the PDO. Achievement of the PDO was to be measured by
one key outcome indicator: "Favorable independent evaluation indicating that
effectiveness and efficiency will have improved within the health and pension insurance
systems as a result of the technical assistance and training provided".

In addition, the project had 24 intermediate outcome indicators (outlined in the results
framework) relating to the three project components. Three (i, ii and iii) intermediate
outcome indicators were introduced just prior to the mid-term review (MTR) of the
project in November 2005 and one (iv) was introduced after the mid term review in
March 2006. They were as follows:

  i.    Percent of target population uninsured through health insurance
  ii.   Increased financial sustainability for social insurance, health and pensions
 iii.   Health Insurance Funds (HIF) and Pension & Invalid Institute (PIO) completed
        modeling for revenue and expenditure projections
 iv.    Steering Committee constituted and meeting

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
The original objective and key outcome indicator were maintained for the duration of the
project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The primary beneficiaries of the project were to be the managers and staff of (i) the
Ministries of Health, Labor and Civil Affairs; (ii) the Pension and Health Insurance
Funds; and (iii) the Tax Administrations. Secondary beneficiaries would be the clients of
these agencies ­ the already insured and newly covered individuals, as well as people
seeking health services. Project activities were also expected to have a beneficial effect
on sub-national services ­ by clarifying where strengthened central agencies were best
equipped to take the lead in social insurance and health care; and by offering technical
support in areas where local authorities would normally play the lead role in
implementation.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The SITAP had three components:

Component 1: Developing a policy framework for social insurance (US$4.19 million
total baseline costs). This component aimed to support the effective implementation of
health and pension insurance reforms, and the development of social sector institutions
capacity to formulate strategies and mechanisms for expansion of insurance coverage.



                                             3

This component included five sub-components, as follows:

    · Sub-component 1.1: Expansion of coverage and portability of health care and
       pension benefits: Interventions under this would help in the expansion of coverage
       and portability of health care and pension benefits and in the development of
       options and mechanisms to more effectively include farmers and the self-
       employed in the social insurance system and improve the system's financial
       sustainability;
    · Sub-component 1.2: Reporting, control and enforcement of payroll taxes: This
       was aimed at reducing the payroll tax burden as well as identifying and
       implementing mechanisms to consolidate the social insurance revenue collection
       and enforcement system through the development of a harmonized data exchange
       system;
    · Sub-component 1.3: Risk pooling and rationalization of service provision: These
       activities were directed towards the development of options to increase the HIF
       risk pool and rationalize the provision of health services;
    · Sub-component 1.4: Contracting of health services: This aspect was focused on
       the development of new mechanisms for the purchasing and payment of health
       services;
    · Sub-component 1.5: Medium-term reform of pension policies: This was aimed at
       the introduction of medium-term systemic reforms of the pension system.

Component 2: Organizational Management (US$3.92 million total baseline costs).
This component aimed at improving governance and service provision in the social
insurance agencies. It focused on (i) developing and refining strategic goals, institutional
mandates and business planning in the health and pensions sectors; (ii) building capacity
for effective execution of activities under the Policy Framework component; and (iii)
strengthening the information technology capacity of the health and pensions sectors to
allow harmonization of data across institutions.

Component 3: Project Implementation Support (US$1.10 million total baseline costs).
This component financed support for project coordination and implementation, including
fiduciary responsibilities by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in FBH and the
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the RS. The PIU and PCU were also responsible for
project supervision and monitoring, the provision of training, and coordination of the
technical assistance among the eleven implementing agencies.

1.6 Revised Components

During the mid-term review in March 2006, five technical assistance packages under
components 1 and 2 were cancelled and the funds were reallocated to other activities that
were deemed more relevant in achieving project objectives. Table 1 below lists the
packages concerned under the relevant project components.

allocations)

There were no other significant changes made to the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

This project focused on creating an enabling environment to reform the two main
elements of the social insurance system in Bosnia Herzegovina - the pensions system and
the health sector. This was to be achieved through capacity building and knowledge
transfer to the relevant institutions in the two Entities of BiH (FBH and the RS). On the
surface, it was a relatively simple technical assistance project, with two project
components, a reasonable time frame, and an appropriate size of the credit for the
planned activities. In addition, there appears to have been interest, involvement and
ownership of the Government in the preparation of this project. However, in reality,
project implementation proved to be more complex and the project faced significant
implementation challenges during its early stages. These challenges arose mainly as a
result of (i) the complex operating environment and weak institutions, and (ii) insufficient
ownership by the relevant institutions.

(i) Complex operating environment: The project was to be implemented by eleven
implementing agencies (IAs), in the two separate entities (FBH and the RS) which had
very different organizational structures and generally weak organizational capacity.
Coordination of the project and the technical assistance, as well as some training was to
be done by the two project management units, one in each of the two entities ­ the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The project
Steering Committee (SC) consisting of high level officials from each of the IAs as well as
from the entities' Ministries of Finance would in turn provide support to the PCU and
PIU and oversight to the entire project. The IAs were thinly staffed, unfamiliar with the
tasks at hand, and often at odds with each other on the aims and content of the studies to
be undertaken. The IAs perceived this project as complex, with unclear terms of


                                                 5

reference (TORs) relating to the various activities of the project. Additionally, they had
little experience in working with and handling the various aspects associated with the
selection and hiring of consultants, and this led to significant delays in the project's initial
implementation. The selected project consultants were also unprepared for this complex
environment and the challenges it posed in order for them to get their work properly done.

(ii) Ownership: Although there appears to have been significant commitment to the
project during the preparation phase, this turned out not to be the case during much of the
first half of the project's life. In fact, as became evident later during implementation, the
IAs felt that their views were not fully taken into account by the Bank team during the
preparation period and the project had strong elements of a top-down design - with the
TORs written by Bank staff and consultants. This subsequently contributed to the slow
start of implementation and was exacerbated by the lack of active participation and
involvement on the part of the project Steering Committee. The Steering Committee
which was supposed to meet on at least a quarterly basis to address issues related to
project implementation met only once at the start of the project and did not meet again
until almost three years into the project. Despite these challenges, the project was
implemented and was completed within the original timeframe and generally
accomplished what it aimed to achieve. This was due to a number of changes which were
made mid-way through the project to improve implementation arrangements and to
mobilize the Steering Committee. This is described in more detail in Section 2.2 below.


2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

At the time of project preparation, the Bank already had acquired considerable
knowledge about the health sector and the pension system in BiH, and had a good
understanding of the working environment, the political climate, lengthy decision-making
processes, and fragile institutions. Policy changes in health and pensions were already
being pursued under adjustment lending, and the SITAP was to develop options for
reforms and build the capacity to implement them. Relevant lessons of this experience
were outlined in the PAD. They included the following: (i) reform is a long-term
undertaking; (ii) project design should be kept simple; (iii) Government commitment and
ownership must be strong, with a real partnership, particularly during project preparation;
(iv) simple but effective coordination arrangements must be in place before
implementation begins; and (v) capacity building is crucial for development effectiveness.

The design of SITAP reflected some of these lessons. The project emphasized capacity
building which was necessary for the reforms to be undertaken effectively in the long run.
Efforts to ensure coordination between the many implementing agencies were made
during preparation through the establishment of a Steering Committee which was to
provide state-level oversight and resolve issues where the IA's could not come to
agreement. Project coordination was assigned to the already existing project
implementation units in the FBH and RS, whose staff were experienced in Bank
procurement and fiduciary procedures. Focal points were appointed for each



                                                6

implementing agency to facilitate implementation at the agency level and these were to
be the main points of contact for the consultants.

However, as mentioned above, the top-down Bank driven project preparation and design
did not sufficiently involve the Borrower in the preparation process and was a key issue
which later undermined the Borrower's sense of ownership of the project. In addition,
while the project may have appeared relatively simple to the Bank team, it was, in fact, as
mentioned above, rather complex for the existing capacity, particularly given the nature
and the context of the reforms and issues at stake. This complexity was noted earlier by a
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) and later by the Borrower, especially with regards
to the structure of the project sub-components. The project had multiple sub-components
and TORs which were to be implemented simultaneously; activities related to some
TORs were linked to more than one sub-component with some activities under sub-
components divided into multiple TORs to be done by different consultants. This
subsequently made for difficult implementation as well as unnecessarily complex
monitoring and reporting of project progress by sub-components. The QER of the project
which was undertaken prior to project appraisal stressed the need to curtail the broad
agenda of the project. In addition to the project complexity, the QER raised the following
other points about the project design: (i) the overly ambitious PDO; (ii) component
activities should include only those feasible in project time frame; and (iii) the need to
include quantifiable and easily monitored performance indicators. In response to these
recommendations, the Bank team, made changes that emphasized the projects' capacity
building focus and introduced a set of output based indicators relating to strengthening
institutions and business processes that were more relevant for this technical assistance
project.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)

According to a Quality at Supervision Assessment (QSA) conducted by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) in August 2004, project implementation was assessed as highly
satisfactory. It is important to note that this assessment was done only nine months after
the project started when few actual activities were under implementation. The supervision
of the project was given a highly satisfactory rating based on the Bank team's ability to
work well with government counterparts in BiH and its effective resolution of
procurement problems that arose in the early stages of implementation. The performance
of the project coordinating units in both Entities was also deemed as commendable as
they were able to successfully aid the IAs in clarifying and revising TORs related to the
various project activities, resolving issues related to consultants, and managing the
procurement and fiduciary aspects of the project.

Despite this favorable assessment by QAG, by the end of its first year, the project ran into
difficulties that in part reflected the IAs' limited input in preparing the TORs, their
inexperience in working with consultants and their limited capacity to program work and
review outputs. Also, the absence of active involvement in project implementation by the
Steering Committee during the first three project years left the project bereft of necessary



                                              7

oversight and coordination. Project implementation was slowed down further by
challenges ranging from multiple revisions of TORs, to under-performing and non-
performing consultants, and weak or non-existent collaboration between the over-
stretched IAs and consultants. The focal point arrangement that had been created to
coordinate the knowledge transfer activities between the consultants and IAs proved to be
inadequate as the amount of activities under the project increased. IA staff that were
assigned to be focal points were unable to cope with the extra burden of activities related
to the project in addition to their every day responsibilities. This was critical as project
execution (report-writing and knowledge transfer) was almost totally in the hands of the
consultants - very little executing, apart from facilitating, reading and commenting and
learning, was expected from the executing agencies. The consultants were largely left to
their own devices to seek contacts and information from agencies that felt themselves
increasingly burdened by requests for information and disinclined to cooperate. A survey
of executing agency staff done prior to the mid-term review indicated that the technical
assistance had achieved little in terms of capacity building or knowledge transmission,
and that report-writing was proceeding with difficulty.

The lack of ownership and commitment as reflected in the non-performance of the
Steering Committee and lack of effective management of the technical assistance by
some IAs were identified as the main factors affecting project implementation at the
MTR carried out in March 2006. These weaknesses were further exacerbated by the
overall lack of clarity on the direction to be taken in the country's social insurance policy
reform agenda. These problems appear to have played a significant role in the gradual
deterioration of project performance.

Despite this, a strong supervision effort following the MTR by the Bank task team and
the renewed commitment by the Government kept the project moving forward, and the
health and pensions flagship courses that were subsequently organized for the IA staff,
compensated to some extent for the initial absence of direct knowledge transfer. To get
the project back on track, the mid-term review set a number of performance indicators
that served to revitalize the project and, ultimately, bring it to successful closure.
Benchmarks were set to re-activate the Steering Committee, multi-sectoral thematic
working groups were established to work with the consultants in addition to the focal
points, component-specific targets were set and funds reallocated to TORs that were
deemed as priorities (see Table 1 above).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project indicators included one outcome indicator ­ "a favorable independent
evaluation of the project indicating improvements in effectiveness and efficiency", as
well as 24 intermediate outcome indicators (as presented in the Data Sheet of this ICR).
With respect to the main outcome indicator, it can be considered a reasonable qualitative
indicator. However, while this evaluation was carried out at the end of the project, as
planned, it would have been even more informative had it been carried out some twelve
to fifteen months after project's completion. This would have better assessed the full
impact of SITAP and to what extent options for policy reform that were developed under



                                              8

SITAP were being actively pursued, including undertaking semi-structured interviews
with the people responsible for the reforms to better measure the influence of the project.
Nonetheless, the assessment does provide an adequate level of information on the
achievement of each of the project's key areas.

The 24 intermediate outcome indicators mainly constituted the production of strategy and
policy option notes, reports, plans and capacity building efforts, all of which reflect the
real intention of this technical assistance project, i.e. to strengthen capacity of relevant
institutions to make appropriate policy and operational decisions in the future.

2.4 Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)
The project did not trigger any safeguard or fiduciary issues. Overall performance with
respect to procurement activities was considered satisfactory. In terms of financial audits,
project financial statements were audited on an annual basis by independent auditors and
all audit reports had unqualified opinions.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The recommendations ensuing from SITAP have been accepted by the governments in
both Entities and the implementation of these recommendations is underway. Reforms
related to the Tax Administration which were developed under SITAP are being
implemented under the USAID funded ELMO project, while activities related to the
restructuring of the primary health care system are being continued under the Bank's
ongoing Health Sector Enhancement Project (HSEP). Under the HSEP, a training
program for further training of HIF staff in contracting of health services has been
developed and training is currently scheduled to occur in November 2008 in the RS.
Training of managers of health care services in the implementation of essential changes
in service provision including the expansion of the Family Medicine model in Primary
Health Care Centers is also ongoing with more than half of health facilities managers
targeted trained to date. Additionally, all 53 health centers in the RS have initiated the
process of internal reorganization and implementation of the Family Medicine model as
part of the efforts to move away from the traditional model of specialist delivery of
primary health care. Similar efforts in the restructuring of the primary health care system
are underway in the health systems of the FBH's ten cantons.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The objective of the SITAP was and remains relevant and consistent with BiH's current
development priorities in the health sector and pensions system, as well as with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (2000). The outcomes achieved under SITAP are in



                                             9

line with the Bank identified priorities (CAS 2005) of continued reforms aimed at
improved public financial sustainability especially in the health and pensions sectors, as
well as improvements in the management of the health sector and better access to quality
health care.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)

The PDO aimed to strengthen effectiveness and efficiency through the development of
capacity and the strengthening of institutions which would enable the formulation and
implementation of reforms. As mentioned above, this was to be assessed by one outcome
indicator (a favorable independent evaluation) and 24 intermediate outcome indicators.
This ICR bases its assessment of the project outcomes on the results of the independent
evaluation as well as on the outcomes of the 24 indicators under eight main areas
supported by the project. The main measure of success of this project is whether it
created an enabling environment for policy makers to make informed decisions in policy
formulation as well as whether the project helped to initiate changes in institutions and
business processes in order to make the overall operating environment more effective.

A. Independent Evaluation: The evaluation was carried out prior to the project closing
(in November 2007) by a team of international consultants to assess achievements of the
project. The methodology employed in this evaluation included; (a) interviews with IA
staff, project coordination units, and members of the Steering Committee; (b) a survey
which was completed by 8 of the IA's; and (c) a review of project documents and reports
produced by local consultants.

The evaluation team produced a report in December 2007 outlining project
accomplishments. Overall, the evaluation found that SITAP had contributed to significant
progress towards the PDO, although it found that the timing of the evaluation was
probably too premature to fully evaluate whether effectiveness and efficiency had
improved by that time. This supports this ICR's point of evaluating the project from the
perspective that its mission was to set the basis for reforms in BiH and provide
recommendations for setting and implementing these reforms. The report pointed out that
improvements have been made in policy development, improved organizational planning,
training and capacity building and improvements in harmonization of approaches to
social insurance between the two project Entities. It was also noted that more progress
had been made under the health aspects than the pension. A summary of the
achievements of SITAP in the health and pension sectors presented in the evaluation
report follows.

Health. The evaluation found that SITAP made a substantial contribution to (i) improving
provider payment mechanisms through the Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) approach
and the capitation method of payment in primary health care facilities; (ii) reform of the
Basic Benefit Package; (iii) health facilities rationalization. The DRG manual produced
under SITAP was disseminated at the State and Entity levels and the approach was



                                            10

piloted in hospitals in both Entities with plans to expand the approach after purchase of
the requisite software. In addition to this, the recommendation to use the capitation
method of payment in family medicine clinics was adopted. With regards to the Basic
Benefit Package, benefits provided under the HIF's in both Entities were reviewed and
reports prepared on this. But given the sensitive nature of this issue, public discussions
will have to be held before this can be considered at the Parliamentary level. Draft facility
rationalization plans were prepared under the project for both Entities and at the time of
the evaluation were being disseminated for public discussion and stakeholder review.

Pension. The following were the findings related to the pension system;
    · Improvements in social insurance collections: Analyses and reviews conducted
        highlighted the impact of low compliance rates and poor enforcement of
        collections on the social insurance system and brought this to the attention of the
        concerned agencies. Consultations, study tours and discussions resulted in
        commitments by both Entities to put in place a single social insurance mechanism
        under the Tax Administration, and implementation of this was to be supported by
        the USAID ELMO project.
    · Pension policy development: Under this, actuarial training was provided to staff
        of the pension funds however progress in developing a pension policy was
        hampered by the lack of an effective working group. A working group was only
        established in early 2007, thus not much progress was made under this.
    · Institutional strengthening: Members of the pension funds went on study tours to
        observe international best practice. Additionally, a human resource plan was
        produced for the RS that analyzed current employment and human resource
        structures in the PIO and identified areas of excess capacity, leading to a proposal
        to reduce human resources in the organization.

In sum, a number of positive steps have been taken under the project and although actual
measurable improvements in effectiveness and efficiency were limited at the time of the
evaluation, it is clear that the real impact of the project will be manifested over time as
improved policies and practices are implemented. Indeed, the Government has already
launched a number of important initiatives, which are likely to lead to significant
institutional and operational changes. The findings of the evaluation are consistent with
what could maximally be expected to be achieved under SITAP in line with the original
project intention and within the project's time frame.

B. Accomplishments in key project areas/intermediate outcome indicators: The
outputs set out under each of these key areas, described briefly here were for the greater
part successfully achieved in both Entities and are described in further detail in Annex 2.
The key issues to be addressed under SITAP in order to achieve the PDO were:

(i) The expansion of insurance coverage and improvements in portability of social
insurance benefits: activities aimed at expanding insurance coverage included analysis
and detailed reports on various options for achieving this. The recommendations from
these reports have been used in the modification of the Health Insurance Contributions,
Pension and Disability Laws which are awaiting consideration by lawmakers in the



                                             11

Entities. In addition, the RS HIF and FBH health care providers signed contracts that will
enable patients from the RS to receive health care in the Federation. However, the targets
set prior to the MTR for decreasing the percentage of the uninsured in the target
population were not met by the time the project ended;
(ii) Enforcement and control of social insurance contributions: A key result of the
technical assistance provided in this area is the reform of the Tax Administration system.
The action plan for the unification of the collection of social insurance contributions
under the Tax Administration was adopted and is currently being implemented in both
Entities by the USAID funded ELMO project. In the FBH a draft Law on Tax Collections
is also under development. In the RS, the introduction of a control department in the
Health Insurance Fund resulted in greater collection of revenues. Additionally, both
Entities reported having the recommended level of reserve funds on hold in their HIF,
which was previously not the case. Funds reallocated at the MTR were also used to
purchase IT equipment and software for the establishment of a financial information
system for the HIF in the FBH;
(iii) Improvement of risk pooling and rationalization of health service provision: Health
service rationalization plans were developed for both Entities and in the FBH consensus
is being sought among its ten cantonal health systems prior to implementation. In the RS,
funds that were reallocated at the MTR were used to further develop and implement a
Human Resource Plan for the public hospital system, and to support the implementation
of the rationalization of the hospital system. As a result of this work plans for three
specialties and productivity benchmarks for medical doctors at three pilot health centers
were defined; a database on hospital staff and related IT infrastructure was developed;
staff planning based on the scope of work was done and the accuracy of hospital staff
records was improved. In the FBH discussions on ways to improve risk pooling across
the cantonal health insurance funds are also ongoing, and for the time being a solidarity
fund was created to which each canton contributes 8% of their budget to finance tertiary
health care services;
(iv) Piloting of health services contracting and new payment mechanisms: The existing
provider payment mechanisms were analyzed and options developed for new payment
mechanisms. Pilot testing of the new provider payment systems was carried out in both
Entities and proposals to introduce the Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) system in
hospitals was accepted in both Entities. In the FBH clinical pathways for hospitals were
developed to help support the implementation of the DRG system and some IT
equipment and software were purchased using the funds reallocated at the MTR. The
capitation payment method for primary health care was also piloted and was adopted and
will be expanded for use in PHC. Hospital and HIF staff were also trained in the
purchasing and contracting of services under this new system;
(v) Medium term reforms of pension system: Reports detailing options for parametric
adjustments to the pension system were produced and the recommendations from these
are currently being used by the Pensions Working Groups that were established in both
Entities to oversee the pension reform process, in planning and implementing changes to
the pension system. Furthermore, a Law on the Pension Reserve Fund was passed in the
RS and in the FBH the pension reform strategy produced under the project was adopted
and agreed to by the government. Revenue and expenditure models were also completed
at the State and Entity levels. Funds reallocated from the MTR were used to provide



                                             12

additional training in actuarial projections for PIO staff and members of the Pension
System Reform Working Groups that will enable them to incorporate the results of these
analyses into the pension funds internal and external reporting framework;
(vi) Development and refinement of strategic goals and institutional mandates of
health and pensions agencies: Activities under this area resulted in the development of
strategic plans for the Ministries of Health, and the Pension and Health Insurance Funds.
In addition to this these organizations internal rule books were revised based on the
strategic planning exercises that took place in order to improve the functioning of the
organizations;
(vii) Strengthening of organizational technical capacities of health and pensions
agencies: Human resource planning exercises were completed for the Ministry of Health
and the PIO and HIF with changes made in the job descriptions of managers and staff in
order to create more efficient and effective organizational structures. In addition
managers participated in training events and study tours that were designed to improve
managerial skills and decision making capacity. Funds from the reallocation of activities
were further used to provide training to Ministry of Health staff in human resource
management as well training to Ministry of Health, HIF and Public Health Institute staff
in monitoring and evaluation which resulted in the establishment of an M&E unit in the
Ministry of Health in the RS; and,
(viii) Strengthening of Information Technology capacities of health and pensions
agencies: Activities focused on training of technical staff in new and improved IT
standards as well as the provision of IT and telecommunications equipment to allow
improved data exchange across the Ministry of Health, HIF, PIO and Ministry of Labor.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Since the project was a technical assistance project, no cost benefit or cost effectiveness
analyses were carried out at project appraisal. However, once the recommendations in the
project outputs are implemented, both health and pension systems are expected to reap
significant efficiency gains from better functioning and more effective institutions.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
While the project achieved its intended outcomes for the most part, i.e. to strengthen the
capacity of relevant institutions to make appropriate policy and operational decisions, the
design and the implementation of the project could have been much more effective and
results could have been even stronger. Specifically, the project could have developed a
clearer set of outcome indicators to measure its true intended outcomes better. Also, a
more transparent implementation plan could have averted significant delays that occurred
in the initial phase of implementation. In the end, the project was completed on time and
many of the planned outputs were produced which helped to map out key paths to reform



                                                  15

that underpin the current reform efforts in BiH. This is evidenced by the extensive set of
institutional and legislative steps taken (see Table 2 above). This is also supported by the
results of the independent evaluation which showed that the project made significant
progress in contributing to the reform effort. However, as the evaluation also showed, it
is still too early to say that all the steps taken under the project have produced tangible
changes in the effectiveness and efficiency of the health and pension insurance system.
Hence, the more appropriate rating for the project is moderately satisfactory rather than
satisfactory although on balance the project achieved what it could have possibly
achieved given its nature and its relatively short duration.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
While the project was not focused on poverty, gender or social development, its
recommendations, when implemented, should reduce economic risk, first to formal sector
households, including to previously unprotected households, and second, by ensuring that
services to non-contributing beneficiaries, presumably low income ones, can continue to
be subsidized. This, in turn, should have a favorable impact on human capital
development and risk taking in beneficiary households.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)
The process of implementing the operation has had two immediate and significant
impacts: (i) it has brought a better contextual understanding of social insurance issues and
policy reform to management and staff of Ministries and agencies ­ this appears to be the
combined effect of workshops, flagship courses and reviewing and commenting on the
outputs of the technical assistance; and (ii) collegial working relationships have formed
between agencies in the Federation and the RS, which seem to be particularly valued by
the parties concerned.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The level of cooperation and collaboration between institutions in the Federation and the
RS were greatly enhanced as a result of the process of working on the SITAP.
Additionally, knowledge sharing between institutions increased and there are greater
efforts to harmonize approaches to addressing common issues in the health and pensions
sectors between the two Entities. As an example, a Standing Conference of Ministers of
Health which arose from the Steering Committee has been established to discuss issues in
the health sector as well as the implementation of recommendations from the SITAP. It is
composed of Ministers of Health from the State, Entity and Cantonal levels.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The overall risk to development outcome is rated as moderate. Reform of social
insurance is firmly on the Government's agenda, and the project has laid a strong
technical foundation for it, as well as serving as a catalyst for reform. Project outputs
form the impetus for commissions and working groups that have been set up, and donors
have been recruited to carry on the reform process based on the outputs of the SITAP.
However, this process will be lengthy and challenging given the nature of the reforms
and the environment in which they are being undertaken. A sustained commitment by
Government will be required to see the process through.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The project was in line with the Bank CAS, and focused on important elements of the
Bank's lending program in BiH which were also important to the Government's reform
agenda. That said, the top-down Bank approach in preparing the project undermined
ownership on the side of the Borrower, and alienated key middle-level managers and staff
in implementing agencies. Although the Bank identified institutional weakness and
limited capacity as key areas to be addressed by the project, it is concerning that the
institutional absorptive capacity for the significantly large amounts of technical capacity
planned was not sufficiently considered. The complicated structure of the sub-
components and the TORs for the various project activities created additional difficulties
in the practical execution of the project. Additionally, implementation arrangements
regarding the local agencies' process for working with consultants were not clearly
addressed despite the fact that they had no prior experience with this. Finally, the lack of
clearly defined benchmarks in project implementation with regards to progress towards
achievement of the outputs (e.g. passage of legislation, institutional and financial
changes) rendered adequate monitoring of implementation progress difficult. These
factors contributed to the early implementation problems that the project later faced.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
As mentioned earlier, a Quality at Supervision Assessment by the Quality Assessment
Group was conducted a year into the project, and it gave a highly satisfactory rating. The
task team's ability to solve procurement problems and work well with senior officials and
politicians was particularly lauded. The subsequent deterioration of implementation
performance may have reflected relatively less focus on the effectiveness of the
implementation arrangements as evidenced by the findings at the Mid-term Review.
However, the mid-term review refocused supervision for the remainder of the project
duration through the introduction of new indicators and setting of benchmarks which
ensured the achievement of meaningful outputs and the timely closure of the project.



                                             17

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
This rating is based on the modest quality at entry but a much stronger supervision effort.
The project preparation could have given more consideration to fostering greater project
ownership by the Borrower, and designing a simpler, clearer project, with more effective
implementation arrangements, all of which might have prevented the significant
implementation challenges later on. Despite this, the Bank made marked efforts in the
later stages of the project to ensure that these challenges were addressed, with the result
that the project was still able to implement all the components, achieve intended results,
and close successfully on schedule.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
While the government demonstrated high commitment during project preparation, there
was a significant change in its level of commitment for much of the project's first two
years. This is evidenced by the lack of the Steering Committee's engagement and failure
to perform its overall coordination function until more than two years into the project,
despite this being a key factor in project progress given the country's complex political
and governance structure.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Initial difficulties were faced by agencies in both Entities in understanding the activities
under the various project components and in assimilating consultant activities in their
daily functioning. However, their efforts to fairly support the consultants, internalize the
vast amounts information that they had to review, comment on and agree to, was a key
element of the success of the project. Furthermore, the performance of the PCU and the
PIU, in fulfilling fiduciary requirements and mediating often complex problems with
consultants, was strong.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Although there were delays in implementation in the project's early phase, the high level
of commitment and performance of the implementing agency staff and project
implementation units, contributed to the project achieving it's objectives despite initial
shortcomings.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

A number of lessons can be drawn from this project:

1) Technical Assistance needs to be manageable. A careful assessment needs to be made
of the capacity of clients to absorb technical assistance; project implementation plans
need to be drawn up that appropriately pace the introduction of TA and TA activities;



                                             18

and appropriate working arrangements that ensure sufficient operational interaction
between client and consultant need to be formalized as part of project design;

2) The quality and intensity of project supervision can make a difference in whether a
project achieves its intended outcomes. Active engagement with the client in resolving
problems during implementation is especially important in situations where the type of
project being implemented is new to the counterparts responsible for implementing it;

3) While it may not be easy particularly with projects of this nature, having clearly
identified and measurable targets or indicators from the start of the project would help to
facilitate measurement of progress towards the final project outcome and could serve as a
red flag if project implementation is beginning to stagnate;

4) Stakeholder involvement at all stages of the project cycle and particularly in the
preparation phase cannot be stressed enough, as this helps to ensure commitment and
ownership to the project and it's objectives from the counterpart side and also ensures
that local expertise and knowledge of the context are taken into account. As is evident in
this project the commitment of implementing agency staff was a critical factor in the
success of the project;

5) A critical area to be considered particularly in technical assistance projects where
capacity building is a key goal is that of retention of staff in local implementing agencies
once knowledge transfer and improvements in capacity have occurred.              Agreement
should be reached with the local agencies during project preparation on clear strategies of
staff retention;

6) Workshops, well-designed study tours and training courses are effective ways of
transmitting knowledge. Where issues are complex, or the subject matter broad, initial
flagship-type courses are more usefully run before project start-up rather than during
implementation, as these provide context.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This section summarizes the outputs under the first two components that are directly
related to the main project objective. Almost all of the outputs that the project set out to
achieve were accomplished by the time it ended, despite initial implementation
challenges.

Component 1: Developing a social insurance policy framework (US$4.67 million
actual total cost)

Options to expand coverage and improve portability of pension and health care benefits
drafted. Five reports addressing this sub-component were produced for each of the
Entities. These reports focused on providing policy options for the expansion of health
and pension insurance coverage to include farmers and the self-employed. The various
recommendations provided in the reports were reviewed by the implementing agencies
concerned and these were subsequently used to modify the Laws on Health Insurance,
Contributions, and Pensions and Disability Insurance in the RS and FBH. Technical
assistance was also provided in the development of medium term expenditure
frameworks for the health sector to improve financing and identify measures to ensure
equal access to basic health care. The recommendations arising from this were adopted
by the working groups and in the FBH a Law on the Basic Health Package was drafted
and is due to be considered by Parliament this year. Models for revenue and expenditure
projections that allowed an assessment of the revenue impact of various policy options
for reforms in the health and pension system were also completed.

Options drafted for improvement of reporting, control and enforcement of social
insurance contributions. Under this sub-component 21 reports were produced for each of
the Entities. In depth analysis of the main constraints of the current collection, reporting,
enforcement and control system for social insurance contributions were carried out.
Based on these mechanisms to consolidate the social insurance revenue collection system
were developed and agreement was reached to work towards the establishment of a
unified collection gateway under the Tax Administration. Implementation of the action
plan developed under this sub-component is currently underway with the support of a
USAID project in both the RS and the FBH.

Options drafted for improvement of risk pooling and rationalization of service provision.
Several reports were also produced under this sub-component. The risk pooling portion
of this component focused mainly on the FBH which has decentralized health insurance
funds for each of its ten cantons, and not on the RS which has a centralized HIF and
hence inbuilt mechanisms for sharing risks within its regions. Functional assessments
and utilization reviews of the secondary and tertiary health care facilities was undertaken
in both Entities and an additional situation analysis of hospitals in the RS. Based on
these activities a Draft Health Service Rationalization Plan was completed and is
currently awaiting implementation in the FBH. In the RS the Draft Rationalization Plan
was used to develop a Human Resource Plan for the public hospital system which will




                                            21

serve as a medium-term framework for Human Resource planning in the hospitals.
Strategies for secondary and tertiary health care delivery were also developed in the RS.
Pilot test conducted using selected options for contracting of health services. Pilot testing
of the new provider payment systems was carried out in both Entities. Analysis of current
payment mechanisms was done, followed by proposals for the introduction of the new
payment system. The capitation method of payment was piloted and will be expanded for
use in all health centers, while an output based methodology using the DRG system was
piloted and selected for use in hospitals.     The DRG manuals developed under this
component were officially disseminated at the State and Entity levels. Hospital and HIF
staff were trained in purchasing and contracting of services under this new system.
Additionally, hospital staff were trained in hospital performance monitoring and a list of
indicators for monitoring this was defined. Eight reports and a DRG manual were
produced under this component.

Options drafted for medium term reform of the pension policies. Activities under this
component resulted in the production of 17 reports for each of the Entities. These
addressed issues ranging from pension system simulation, situational analysis of different
categories of pensioners, coverage of farmers and self-employed under the current system,
and international and regional best practices in pension reform design and
implementation. Pension fund staff also received training in actuarial mathematics and
modeling, and also undertook study tours to various European countries to learn about
pensions systems there. A strategy for pension reform was drafted and considered by the
Entity governments, and Pension Reform Working groups were established by the
government to oversee the reform process. An action plan on improved policy making,
coordination and more effective pension administration within and between the Entities
was also developed and approved by the governments.

Component 2: Organizational Management (US$2.61 million actual total cost)

Development and refinement of strategic goals and institutional mandates of health and
pensions agencies. Strategic plans were developed for the Ministries of Health, the HIF
and the Pension Funds in both Entities. Business planning exercises were also undertaken
for these agencies, and new business processes were designed and implemented. The
internal organizational rulebooks were revised based on the recommendations from the
strategic planning processes.

Strengthening of organizational technical capacities of health and pensions agencies.
Under this component organizational management reviews and human resource planning
exercises were undertaken for the Ministries of Health and the Health Insurance and
Pensions Funds in both Entities. These activities have resulted in tangible management
reforms. Job descriptions for managers and staff were updated, organizational structures
were changed and new departments created, and these are contributing to improved
functioning in these organizations. Staff and managers also participated in various local,
regional and international training events and study tours as part of the efforts to
strengthen institutional capacity. In the RS Ministry of Health staff were also trained in
management of human resources. Activities related to the development of public



                                             22

communications capacities and improvement of customer service standards in the health
and pensions services were cancelled after the mid term review.

Strengthening of Information Technology capacities of health and pensions agencies. Six
reports analyzing various aspects of the IT and telecommunications systems of the
Ministry of Health, HIF's and Pension Funds were produced for the RS and FBH.
Telecommunications and IT equipment was upgraded to enable data exchange and data
harmonization across the agencies and technical staff were trained in new IT standards.

Component 3: Project Implementation Support (US$2.13 million actual total cost)

Under this component, support was provided to the two project implementation units
(PIU and PCU) in the two entities in their project coordination functions. Given the
complex nature of the project and the problems faced with its startup, more staff than
were initially envisioned during the preparation phase were hired to coordinate the
technical assistance activities for the two entities eleven implementing agencies. The
fiduciary and procurement aspects of the project were handled by the PIU and PCU
according to Bank protocols.      In addition, the PIU and PCU were instrumental in
assisting the IAs to coordinate and manage the activities of the consultants during the
implementation of the project. They were also responsible for some training components
and monitoring and evaluation of the project. Project progress reports were produced and
submitted on time by the PIU and PCU.

Annex 7b. Summary of Borrower's ICR

                                  REPUBLIKA SRPSKA

I.      Assessment of the Project's objective and design

The major problems in the social insurance sector had effectively been identified during
the Project design. The Project Development Objective (PDO) reflected the major issues
identified, but had been not realistically set. Namely, there was a design gap between the
Project Development Objective and activities planned to be implemented under the
Project. The key Project activities were oriented towards consideration of options and
design of future reforms, not towards provision of support for implementation of the
policies designed under the Project. Implementation of the reforms has, on the other
hand, been necessary to achieve strengthening of the effectiveness and efficiency of the
system (which was the PDO), and this could not have been achieved within the Project
timeframe. Results of the Project implementation have contributed significantly towards
achievement of the PDO, but the concrete evidences of improvements are limited at this
point. In the most cases, the impact of the Project might only be measurable and visible
over the coming years and the PDO can only be achieved over the coming period.

The Project was ambitious, broad and aimed to tackle numerous issues within the limited
funds and timeframe.       This complexity resulted in multiple subcomponents and
numerous TOR's that were to be implemented simultaneously. Design of the Project was
occasionally confusing for both implementing agencies (who had to coordinate parallel
activities under the Project) and for consultants working under the Project (who needed
to coordinate their activities with activities of other consultants). As a paradox, under
section D of the Project Appraisal Document, under point 79 "Lessons learned and
reflected in the project design" was noted that "simple projects with relatively
uncomplicated implementation arrangements are more likely to succeed".

The confusion on implementing agencies side was enhanced by the facts that 1) activities
under some of TOR's (e.g. 1.2 and 2.1) were linked to more than one subcomponent
objectives, 2) some pension TOR's (e.g. 1.5c and 1.5d) were planned under Component 1,
while in reality these activities contributed to achievement of objectives of Component 2
and 3) some of the subcomponents (e.g. 1.3 and 1.5) were split into multiple TOR's,
supported by different consultants.

The Project design made monitoring and reporting based on (sub) components practically
impossible and unusable. The decision was made early during the Project to switch to
monitoring and reporting based on the individual TOR's. This was a practical solution,
but, in consequence, it made monitoring of the component and Project objectives
achievement more difficult.

At the time of the Project negotiations, the Technical Annex with all TOR's for technical
assistance was prepared by the WB consultants, which was a good practice, as it allowed
for immediate initiation of procurement of technical assistance. However, given the
lengthy procurement procedures and later initiation of some of the activities,
implementation of some of the TOR's started after period of 2 years from the TOR
preparation. Such TOR's were outdated at time of the implementation and needed to be


                                             30

redrafted. In order to better adjust scope of the Project to the real needs, five TOR's were
cancelled by Steering Committee after the MTR. This was followed by joint drafting of
new TOR's by PCU and implementing agencies and introduction of new activities in the
Project. The new activities were mainly continuation of previously implemented TOR's
(through support for the implementation of recommendations provided under completed
TOR's).

The initially planned TOR's were completely written by WB consultants and briefly
discussed with implementing agencies just before the Project negotiations.              The
implementing agencies had no chance to go in details through the TOR's with WB
consultants who prepared them. Consequently, the RS institutions were not completely
clear what to expect from particular consultants' work. The PCU was even asked to
interpret scope of the work to both the institutions and consultants (e.g. TOR 1.5b, 1.2
and 1.3b). This caused additional complications in monitoring and control of consultants
work by implementing agencies.

III. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES BY PROJECT (SUB) COMPONENTS

           Component 1: Developing Policy Framework for Social Insurance

Though the objectives of the subcomponents 1.1-1.5 can be individually regarded as
achieved (as elaborated below for each subcomponent), the objectives of the Component
1 can only be regarded as partially achieved. Key feature of this Component was to be
knowledge transfer and capacity building of the implementing agencies staff, which was
not fully achieved under each TOR implemented. There was a relatively high degree of
turnover of consultants under some subcomponents. International consultants tend to
spend relatively little time on-site, often sending local consultants instead. Numbers of
activities were implemented in parallel, which added to consultants fatigue and made
participation of implementing agencies staff more difficult. Appointed representatives of
implementing agencies had to combine regular work with additional burden of the work
under the project. Consulting firms, unlike individual consultants, tended to concentrate
on delivery of the reports, neglecting planned action learning component of the problem
solving process in interaction with local counterparts. All of these added to reduction of
the value of knowledge transfer and capacity building achieved under the Project.

   Subcomponent 1.1: Expansion of Coverage and Portability of Health Care and
                                      Pension Benefits
Policy options to expand health and pension insurance coverage (including farmers and
self-employed) and assure contribution payments were developed under this and other
subcomponents.     Different options were considered by implementing agencies and
recommendations provided under the Project were taken into account in process of
changing the RS Law on Health Insurance, the RS Law on Contributions and the RS Law
on Pension and Disability Insurance.

During the period of the Project implementation, the RS HIF started with signing of
contracts with healthcare institution from FBiH/District Brcko for provision of healthcare
services (contracts were signed with clinical centers in Mostar, Sarajevo and Tuzla, and



                                             31

hospital in Brcko). Given the fact that, no further assistance in development of
mechanisms to ensure portability of health insurance benefits was required under the RS
part of the Project. Administrative and financial mechanisms to implement signed inter-
Entity agreements are at place and allow for flow of the patients from RS to FBiH.

        Subcomponent 1.2: Reporting, Control and Enforcement of Payroll Taxes

The major problems with the current system of collection, reporting, enforcement and
control of health and pension insurance contributions and individual taxes were analyzed
in detail. The series of analytical reports provided a solid base for identification of
mechanisms to consolidate the social insurance revenue collection and enforcement
system in a manner consistent with the broader directions of tax administration reform.
This was followed with parallel development of the action plans for RS and FBiH, which
allowed for harmonization of some of the solutions. The unified collection gateway,
together with changes in institutional mandates proposed in the Action Plan, are to lead to
1) reporting system allowing for individual entitlements recording crosscutting them with
contribution payments, 2) reduction of reporting burden to employers and 3) simpler and
more effective collection, enforcement and control of pension and health insurance
contributions payment. One of the main outcomes of the component was building of the
consensus on future reforms among 11 implementing agencies and other stakeholders.
Implementation of the action plan recommendation in RS Tax Administration is currently
supported by USAID ELMO project.

        Subcomponent 1.3: Risk-pooling and Rationalization of Service Provision

The RS HIF is centralized institution, covering the whole RS territory, and, as such, it has
the mechanisms for sharing risks among its regional branch offices. The risk pooling part
of this subcomponent thus focused primarily on FBiH, with no activities being
implemented in the RS. Though the project documentation proposed that option of
pooling certain risks across Entities in the medium term might be explored, the
authorities in both Entities did not wish to elaborate this option further under the Project.
After carrying out functional assessment and utilization review of the secondary and
tertiary healthcare institutions and considering options for rationalization of the current
provider network, the draft Rationalization Plan for Republika Srpska was prepared. As
the analysis and the Rationalization Plan did not provide sufficient details to further
develop facility level plans, these were only accepted by RS Ministry of HealthSW as
bases for further activities. To obtain additional data needed for development of the
Secondary and Tertiary Healthcare Strategy in the RS, the RS HIF financed conducting
of the situational analysis of RS hospitals in late 2006 and early 2007. Additional data
on hospital services, utilization, human resources, objects, internal acts, information
systems, quality improvement mechanisms and equipment were collected through the
situational analysis. The strategy was completed in mid 2007, incorporating important
recommendations from the Rationalization Plan and the situational analysis. At about the
same time, the HR Plan for the RS Public Hospital System was developed, using the
Rationalization Plan as one of the starting points and providing medium-term framework
for HR planning in hospitals.




                                             32

In support of achieving the strategic objectives defined in the Secondary and Tertiary
Healthcare Strategy in the RS, two additional activities were finally supported under the
Project: (1) Development and implementation of the model for electronic maintenance of
databases on staff in hospitals, which is to allow for more reliable data needed for future
HR planning and (2) Pilot work on development of job plans for doctors in three clinics
of Clinical Center Banjaluka, followed by training of representatives of all RS hospitals
in job planning techniques and initiative of the RS Ministry of HealthSW for rolling out
the process. As a legacy initiated by the work on Rationalization Plan, the RS Ministry of
HealthSW and the RS HIF initiated the ambitious multiyear project on introduction of
the management and quality systems in the RS hospital sector.

        Subcomponent 1.4: Contracting of Health Services

In order to build on the experience with contracting of health services initiated under the
Basic Health Project, the RS Ministry of HealthSW decided that Gradiska and Doboj
general hospitals and Laktasi and Doboj PHC centers would be used to pilot new
purchasing mechanisms. After analyzing current mechanisms of provider payment for all
healthcare levels, proposal for introduction of the new purchasing mechanisms in hospital
sector (output-based payment methodology, using DRGs), and refinement and fine tuning
of capitation payments mechanisms in PHC were developed and accepted by RS
implementing agencies. The strategic decisions on new provider payment mechanisms
were presented in the Secondary and Tertiary Healthcare Strategy in the RS and the
Primary Healthcare Strategy, and, as part of the strategies accepted by the RS
Government. In addition, the DRG manual produced under the Project was officially
promulgated at Entity and State level. Though it was planned that the new systems
would be piloted in designated facilities, the real piloting work did not take place. The
feasibility of introduction of the new payment mechanisms was confirmed instead,
through collection of data from pilot institutions and simulation of the piloting exercise
without the real pilot contracts being signed. However, the staff of the designated
facilities and RS HIF received training in purchasing and contracting under the Project.


The need for two additional activities was identified in second half of the Project and
these were implemented in order to support introduction of output-based payment
methodology in RS hospitals: (1) Support to building capacities in the RS HIF for
healthcare provider performance analysis provided on-job training to appointed team,
using action learning approach during the process of analysis of the RS general hospitals.
The training also resulted in development of better performance measures and indicators
for the part of hospital sector and provided blueprint for analysis of other health sector
segments' performance. (2) Activities related to hospital information system created a
basis for systemic approach to the system development and were closely coordinated
with parallel RS Ministry of HealthSW initiative for the E-health strategy development.
Integral part of the hospital information system specifications are those related to better
determination and monitoring of costs of providing health services at hospital level.


        Subcomponent 1.5: Medium-Term Reform of Pension Policies




                                             33

The training in actuarial mathematics, tools and models was provided for representatives
of the RS PIO Fund and the RS Pension Reform Working Group. Initial training was
provided under the ToR 1.5a (implemented in period from September 2004 to December
2005), producing at the same time up-to-date actuarial analysis and modeling of the
Entity pensions systems.       Five representatives of RS implementing agencies were
involved in the modeling work and preparation of the first long-term financial projections
for pension system. Given the lack of participants' experience with other programming
languages, the models were built as Excel spreadsheets. Further step in the actuarial
capacities building were the courses on structure and use of the World Bank's pension
forecasting model ("PROST"), held in June 2006 and October 2007, which were
followed by provision of the model to the RS PIO Fund and the RS Pension Reform
Working Group. There were proposals to form specific work posts/department through
internal reorganization of the RS PIO Fund, which would be responsible for future
actuarial work, but such reorganization did not occur during the Project implementation
period. However, the training course was provided to a small group of RS PIO Fund
employees who should ultimately be responsible for generating forecasts of pension
system on ongoing basis.

The long-term financial projections of reform options were provided in 2005 and 2007 by
actuarial consultants working under TOR's 1.5a and 5.4. These projections were taken
into consideration while reviewing options for medium-term reforms of the pension
system, together with the actuarial projections prepared by the WB and presented in
"Bosnia and Herzegovina Pension System Note".

After reviewing the organizational arrangements, structures and systems for the design,
co-ordination and evaluation of pension policy and pensions administration within and
between key Government Ministries and agencies in each Entity, specific systemic steps
and reforms were recommended in order to improve policy making and co-ordination
and the effectiveness of pension administration within and between each Entity; and co-
ordination of their bilateral relationships on pensions policy with neighboring states. The
recommendations were presented in the form of the Action Plan and approved by the RS
Government.

In examining options for medium-term reform of the pension system, implementing
agencies considered regional and international experiences, through contacts with
international consultants, study tours, participation in international training programs on
pension reforms and numerous local capacity building workshops and conferences.
Technical assistance provided for design of the pension reform and the future system
worked majority of the time directly with RS Ministry of Health and Veterans Protection
and RS PIO Fund.          As part of the work, the technical assistance also supported
implementing agencies in assessment of the necessary preconditions for future
introduction of funded privately managed pensions, in addition to the PAYG pillar, and
the feasibility of their medium-term introduction. The RS Pension Reform Working
Group was appointed only in last year of the Project implementation, after consideration
of the first draft of the Pension Reform Strategy by RS Government in early 2007. At the
time of the Group forming, majority of the activities under pension part of the Project
were completed. However, the Project was able to support work of the Group in period
March-December 2007. As of end of the Project, the work on development of the



                                             34

Pension Reform Strategy for RS was still ongoing, with aim to complete it in first half of
year 2008.

                        Component 2: Organizational Management

The objectives of Component 2 can be regarded as partially achieved, same like
objectives of the subcomponents 2.1-2.3. The main reason for partial achievement of the
objectives was cancellation of four TOR's originally planned under this component.
Development and refinement of implementing agencies' strategic goals and institutional
mandates were done in RS Ministry of HealthSW, RS HIF and RS PIO Fund, and these
were followed by business planning exercises. In support of strengthening the capability
of staff, they participated in numerous local, regional and international training events,
study tours and on-job training. This resulted in enhancement of technical and
management skills necessary for effective execution of activities under the Component 1
and execution of previously approved health and pension reforms.

        Subcomponents 2.1 (Strategic Development) and 2.2 (Business Planning)

Support to strengthening overall strategic goals development and business planning was
provided to RS Ministry of HealthSW, RS HIF and RS PIO Fund. Strategic goals and
directions were agreed for all three institutions and presented in the respective strategic
plans. Consequently, as result of strategic planning processes, revisions of the internal
rulebooks were made by these institutions. Improved internal organization, with more
efficient and effective organizational structure and new departments, was followed by
improved job descriptions of staff and managers in all three institutions. Human resource
planning was also conducted in these three institutions.

Support to RS PIO Fund in financial planning/control and alignment of reporting
standards to IFRS was planned under TOR 1.5d. The contract for technical assistance for
the TOR was signed with the consulting firm Progeco Srl. in June 2005 and the work
commenced at end of June 2005. It was originally planned that the assignment should be
implemented over 5 month's period. The contract expired at the end of February 2006,
with 2 major outputs remaining uncompleted. The consulting firm submitted no invoices,
within deadlines defined in the contract, for the work performed. The consulting firm
submitted request for extension of contract by end of April 2006, which was not
approved by SITAP implementing agencies and SITAP Steering Committee.                     The
Steering Committee also approved reallocation of remaining funds from this ToR to
other activities.

Training in results-based monitoring and evaluation for health sector implementing
agencies built capacities necessary for initial functioning of the M&E sector of the RS
Ministry of HealthSW and prepared ground for implementation of the Component 3
(Health Policy Formulation and Project Support) of the WB supported Health Sector
Enhancement Project. Joint training of Ministry of HealthSW, HIF and Public Health
institutes staff allowed for harmonization of their views on M&E function in the health
sector. Through consensus on strategic directions for introduction of the results-based
monitoring and evaluation system, these institutions confirmed their commitment for the
system establishment.



                                              35

The TOR 2.2 was cancelled in 2006 by the Project Steering Committee, following
recommendations of the Mid-Term Review. This part of the Project had supposed to
deal with 1) development of public communications capacities, 2) standardization and
improvement of customer service standards in health and pension services and
development of new approaches to improve the effectiveness of stakeholder and
community involvement in the development of health and pension policies and priorities.
These activities, though initially planned, were not supported through the Project.

                  Subcomponent 2.3: Information Technology Strengthening

Harmonization of technical standards among implementing agencies supported systems
harmonization and data exchange across the various institutions involved in the reporting
and enforcement of taxes and social contributions, and/or responsible for expenditure
execution and monitoring of social insurance programs. The data exchange was further
supported by development of plans for new telecommunication network systems, which
would be in line with up-to-date technical solutions. The IT support capacities of the
institutions were strengthened through technology training and minor upgrading of
equipment and data communications networks.

The TOR 2.5 was cancelled in 2006 by the Project Steering Committee, following
recommendations of the Mid-Term Review. This part of the Project had supposed to
deal with establishment of key indicator data for all institutions to support policy
formulation and monitor program implementation in a timely and effective manner.
These activities, though initially planned, were not supported through the Project.

                     Component 3: Project Implementation Support

The Project Coordination Unit of the RS Ministry of HealthSW performed satisfactory
all tasks envisaged in the Project Appraisal Document. The objectives of the Component
3 can, therefore, be regarded as achieved.

        III. ASSESSMENT OF THE PROJECTS' IMPLEMENTATION AND
                           OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE

The major factors affecting Project implementation and outcomes were the following:

Implementing structures: It was initially planned that 2-3 employees, nominated as
"focal points", from each implementing agency would be responsible for implementation
on behalf of the agency. This approach was followed in first half of the Project and it did
not work well. The focal points were not relieved from other duties, in order to be able
to work on Project implementation. In addition to regular duties, a focal point had to
work with different consultants in parallel, which led to their overburdening and
consultant fatigue.    The focal points were not able to effectively insure adequate
involvement of other staff from their institutions in the Project implementation. This
approach neither allowed for adequate capacity building in the institutions. Following
the MTR recommendations, working groups were formed for each TOR and they were
tasked with duties previously performed by the focal points. Working groups, formed
mainly from implementing agencies' staff, were acceptable solution for majority of the



                                            36

TOR's, except for the TOR 1.5f. Formulation of the pension reform strategy required
involvement of wider group of stakeholders, which called for appointment of the Pension
Reform Working Group by RS Government.

Changes of the key Government officials:           There were frequent changes of key
Government officials in the implementing agencies over the scope of the Project. There
were four different RS Governments in place over the SITAP implementation period.
Social insurance sector had not the same position on all of four Governments' agenda and
the importance of the SITAP was seen differently. Like the Ministers, changes of the
directors of implementing agencies were frequent.          This influenced continuity of
activities and required additional negotiation and coordination work on the PCU side. It
also created problem with leadership, as not all Ministers/directors regarded the Project to
be important operation.

Steering Committee functioning: The Steering Committee was officially established at
beginning of the Project, but it did not met at all by the time of the Mid-Term Review.
Two main problems hindered its functioning: 1) lack of leadership by the Ministry of
Civil Affairs, as the Minister of Civil affairs was chairman of the committee and 2)
changes of Governments officials (the committee members were initially appointed by
name, not by their functions) led to situation where almost none of the initial members
was still at position of Minister/director of the implementing agency. Few important
decisions (e.g. possible termination of a consulting contract, cancellation of TOR's,
acceptance of annual work program) could not have been made, due to non-functioning
committee. New appointment of the committee members (by functions) took place after
the MTR, which was about the same time when the current RS Government came to
power. Functioning of the committee was initiated successfully and it continued well
during the second half of the Project. Actually, the work of the committee became a
blueprint that was copied by an EC health sector project and it led to establishment of the
health sector ministerial conference.

Ownership issues: Problems with ownership of the Project culminated at the time of the
MTR. Lack of managerial support to implementation of Project, low involvement in
monitoring of consultants work, lack of involvement of implementing staff (apart from
the focal points) and lack of initiative to implement approved recommendations were
some of these. With the new RS Government in place immediately after the MTR, these
problems were continuously addressed during second half of the Project, strong
leadership was provided and the ownership level was increased.

Motivation of implementing agencies' staff and working groups' members: The
work of implementing agencies staff (including focal points) and working groups'
members on Project implementation was not financially supported by Project funds. This
had significant impact on their work motivation, as implementation of the Project tended
to be seen as an addition burden of work, which was not followed by the additional
compensations. Lack of the remunerations was problem throughout the whole Project.
Though participation in training and study tours under the Project was seen as a partial
surrogate for the remunerations, this was more the case in pension sector than in the




                                            37

health sector. It has to be noted that participation in the Project implementation
occasionally depended solely on personal enthusiasm.

Capacities of implementing agencies to receive the technical assistance: At start of
the Project, the RS Ministry of HealthSW and Department for Pension and Invalid
Insurance of the RS Ministry of Health and Veterans Protection did not have sufficient
number of staff to be able to effectively use the technical assistance. The situation in the
Ministry of HealthSW improved towards the end of the Project.             Parallel work of
multiple consultants, however, had impact on all implementing agencies, as even the
institutions with larger number of staff struggled with insuring active participation in
multiple activities at the same time. A technical assistance project was a new form of
Project to all implementing agencies.           At the same time, responsibility for
implementation in health sector shifted from PCU to the Ministry of HealthSW and HIF.
At the start of the Project, the implementing agencies were not clear of their role in the
implementation, nor completely ready to effectively accept services of the technical
assistance.

Inadequate financial planning during the Project preparation: The market value of
international consultants' fees was underestimated when preparing Project budget. The
figure for a man-month used for planning purpose, was, in reality, insufficient to obtain
good quality consultants. This became obvious at the very beginning of the Project,
when first financial proposals were opened. The lowest price proposals were about twice
higher than the budget planned. It was very difficult to find the way to negotiate the
contracts without significant reduction of activities. Though we succeeded in negotiating
significant price reductions for majority of consulting contracts signed under the Project,
this had an adverse impact on composition of the teams and quality of the work. Not
surprisingly, consulting firms tended to shift as much of work as possible from
international to local consultants, achieving thus savings under the lump-sum contracts.
In long-term, the poor financial planning led to situation that we were receiving mainly
applications of middle or low quality consulting firms, as good quality consultants lost
interest in applying for inadequately paid work.

Quality of technical assistance: This issue was particularly important for consulting
companies engaged early in the Project and implementing activities over the longer
period. Frequent changes of consultants, periods of consultants inactivity, periods of
consultants hyperactivity (prior to deadlines), non-responsiveness of consultants,
provision of off-the-shelves reports, delivery of unacceptable quality reports prepared
without proper discussions and previous agreements with implementing agencies,
numerous revisions of the reports and repeated extensions of the contracts were common
denominators for many subcomponents.            The blueprint WB contracts, used for
consultants under the Project, did not allow for sufficient sanctions to be easily exercised
over the non-performing consultants, nor allowed for financial sanctions in case of late
delivery of the outputs. Unlike consulting firms, both local and international individual
consultants performed well under the Project. Awareness that payment of their individual
fees were dependent on the quality of the work was important factor in making the
difference. Apart from Progeco Srl, who hasn't been even able to complete the



                                            38

implementation of the TOR 1.5d, the main problems were noted with consulting firms
working in parallel on implementation of two or three contracts under the Project. The
firms had tendencies to make their internal prioritization of activities and to focus their
resources and work at one TOR at a time, neglecting other contracts' obligations.

Cooperation between Entities: As multiple TOR's were implemented in two Entities in
parallel, this required cooperation and coordination at level of Steering Committee,
implementing agencies, working groups, evaluation committees and PCU and PIU. Good
cooperation at all levels and coordination between two Entities has to be emphasized. A
collateral impact of the Project certainly was the improved inter-entity collaboration in
social insurance sector. It took some effort to establish working protocols between PCU
and PIU for joint procurement, joint reporting to the WB and joint planning, but the
established arrangements worked well.

Sharing of consultants between two Entities: In principle, this worked well and had its
advantages in harmonizing reform directions, but it was occasionally seen as competitive
by one of the Entities. A consultant could work at one place at a time, and some
consultants tended to focus more at one Entity at a time. Apart from Medicare Australia
consultants, working under TOR 1.4, this caused no serious problems. There was a
period of about six months, over which the Medicare's consultants completely focused
their attention to FBiH, as the activities in RS had been in more advanced stage at
beginning of the period. It was unfortunate fact that this occurred at a time when
consultants' support in initiating piloting of the proposed contracts was the most needed.

Attrition of staff: Not all implementing agencies paid due attention to retention of the
staff trained under the Project. Loss of actuarial staff from the RS PIO Fund and loss of
the staff from Department for Pension and Invalid Insurance in the RS Ministry of Health
and Veterans Protection are the cases in point. This diminished value of the capacity
building efforts.

Rejection of the Project extension proposal: The request for extension of the Project
for six months was rejected by the WB. This had adverse effects on both pension and
health sector achievements. At the end of the Project, the RS Pension Reform Working
Group was left without support in finalization of the pension reform strategy. The funds
planned for public discussion on pension reform strategy remained unused.              The
proposed activities on further development of DRG payment system were not
implemented.

Implementation of approved recommendations and policies: It was initially planned
that other forthcoming WB operations (EMSAC and SOSAC 2) would support
implementation of policies formulated under the SITAP.            The main question that
implementing agencies faced at end of implementation of each SITAP TOR was how the
implementation of approved recommendations and policies would be financed.
Implementation costs are to be very high in some of the cases (e.g. building prerequisites
for introduction of DRG payment method; developing hospital information system;
implementation of Action plan for to improve effectiveness of social insurance reporting,



                                              39

collection, control and enforcement system; implementation of pension reform strategy;
implementation of HR strategy and program). It should be noted that there are realistic
skepticisms that some of the recommendations/policies would remain on paper only, as
there are currently no financial sources to support their implementation.

                          IV. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE

Borrower's performance during the Project preparation and implementation could be
rated as Satisfactory. Project preparation was supported by the PHRD and was led by
the WB team. Borrower actively participated in the Project design, but all the key
documents (Project Appraisal Document, Technical Annex, Procurement Plan, and costs
tables with budget) were prepared and finalized by the appointed WB team. Given the
preparation arrangements, Borrower's performance during preparation phase could be
rated as Satisfactory. The Borrower's performance in the implementation of SITAP
could be divided into two phases. By Mid-Term Review in early 2006, the Borrower's
performance could be rated as Modest. The above noted problems with ownership,
commitment, implementation arrangements, Steering Committee functioning and quality
of consultants' work characterized this period. Timing of the MTR concurred with
appointment of the new RS Government (who was on power all the way to the project
completion) and change of the WB team leader. Under strong leadership of the new RS
ministers of health and labor, much has been achieved over the last year and half of the
Project implementation. In the period after the MTR, the Borrower's performance could
be rated as Satisfactory. It's important to note that, under the new WB Team Leader, the
implementing agencies were given more power to decide on the inclusion of relevant
activities in the Project, which also helped to improve their ownership of the Project.

                              V. BANK'S PERFORMANCE

World Bank's performance during Project preparation and supervision could be rated as
Satisfactory. The faults in the Project design were becoming evident throughout the
implementation. The project was supervised by Bank's staff and consultants located at
Headquarters in Washington and in the Sarajevo Resident Mission.               During the
supervision missions, Bank staff thoroughly reviewed and carefully analyzed all issues
that appeared in the implementation of Project activities and provided advices for
overcoming them. Bank's staff provided close support for many aspects of project
implementation, including procurement and financial issues. Bank staff coordinated well
with other organizations and donors, especially with DFID, USAID, WHO and EC.
Bank's leverage and involvement in establishment of the Project Steering Committee was
crucial for performing its function, as defined in the PAD.

                                VI. LESSONS LEARNED

When designing future WB operations in social sector in BiH, the following lessons
should be taken into account:

Volume of technical assistance: Technical assistance under the project should be limited
to the volume that can be absorbed by implementing agencies and project beneficiaries.



                                             40

Volume of technical assistance under similar projects should be well matched with
training and delivery of equipment and software.

Timing of technical assistance: The technical assistance should be divided adequately
among all years of project implementation. Too much technical assistance at a time
cannot be absorbed and contributes to overburdening of implementing agencies staff.

Objectives achievability:       Both Project Development Objective and objectives of
components, subcomponents and TOR's should, inter alia, be attainable and time bound
to project timeframe.

Early consensus on implementation agencies' roles and expectations: The roles and
expectations of the implementation agencies, including arrangements for their staff
participation, should be defined early during the project preparation, clearly
communicated and agreed with them, so that at the time of project commencement
everybody are clear on their roles. Otherwise, the initial implementation period might be
lost in clarifying this issue. Formal acceptance of the Project Implementation Manual
prior to project commencement is not sufficient to serve this purpose.

Support to implementation of policies: Providing only technical assistance for reform
options consideration and policy formulation, without linking it early on to certain
support in implementation of the policy, jeopardizes impact of the project.

Complexity of project: As noted earlier, simple projects with relatively uncomplicated
implementation arrangements are more likely to succeed. The future operations should
focus on full implementation of a narrower set of activities, rather than grasping widely
over the sector.

Involvement of local experts in project preparation: Involvement of local experts in
implementing agencies staff in project preparation (including preparation of the TOR's)
is crucial for ensuring ownership, managing expectations from consultants on
implementation agencies side, ensuring adequate monitoring of the consultants work by
implementing agencies and creating local capacities for similar planning work.

Motivating implementing agencies staff: It is necessary to plan in advance how to
maintain staff motivation. Possible approaches, that should be considered at preparation
stage include, inter alia: 1) provision of financial incentives by implementation agencies,
2) provision of financial incentives through Government contributions funding and 3)
relieving staff from other regular duties, while making project implementation part of
their job descriptions.

Individual consultants vs. consulting companies: Individual consultants and small
respectful consulting firms can be more flexible, responsive to client's needs, responsible
and can provide better quality outputs than large international consulting firms.

Using regional experiences in reform design: Regional study tours and exchange of
experiences with neighboring countries proved to be more useful than international
comparative studies presented by the consultants.

Strong leadership: Strong and creative leadership at the level of implementing agencies
is one of the key elements for the success of project implementation.

                                    VII. CONCLUSION

The Social Insurance Technical Assistance Project had the aim of strengthening the
effectiveness and efficiency of health and pension insurance systems by the provision of
high quality technical assistance and training to help implement existing reforms and to
help design options for future social insurance reforms. The Project provided support for
policy formulation in this regard. Based on the analysis of project outputs/outcomes and
results of the independent evaluation, the project had impact that "contributed to
significant progress towards the Project Development Objective". The objective, as
defined in the PAD, was only partially met, mainly because its achievement required not
only design but also the implementation of the reforms. Design of the SITAP did not
envisaged that the Project would support implementation of the options developed
through the Project.     To contribute further to achievement of the PDO, through
implementation of the formulated policies, the future operations in social insurance
sector would be needed. The operations should focus on full implementation of a
narrower set of activities, rather than grasping widely over the sector.

                FEDERATION OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

I.      ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES BY PROJECT SUB-COMPONENTS

Component 1: Developing Policy Framework for Social Insurance
Subcomponent 1.1: Expansion of Coverage and Portability of Health Care and
Pension Benefits

The following outputs were produced for FBiH health sector under this subcomponent:

Policy options to expand health and pension insurance coverage (including farmers and
self-employed) and assure contribution payments were developed under this and other
subcomponents.     Different options were considered by implementing agencies and
recommendations provided under the Project were taken into account in process of
changing the FBiH Law on Health Insurance, the Law on Contributions and the Law on
Pension and Disability Insurance.

Technical assistance provided assistance to the governments of both entities in
developing mid-term expenditure frameworks for the health sector in order to set up a
more sustainable health sector financing and identify specific mechanisms for ensuring
more equal access to basic health care within the current financial constraints. A special
attention was paid to seeking new possibilities of expanding the insurance coverage,
increasing the transfer of benefits, more effective risk pooling, a proper proportion of
public and private health sector financing. A significant aspect included support to local
capacities building with a view to utilizing mid-term expenditure planning as a regular
tool for planning and monitoring public expenditures in the sector based on cost-
effectiveness and in line with the government's goals.

A set of recommendations were proposed and adopted by working group:

Federation Ministry of Health formed expert team for preparation of inputs for drafting
the Law on Basic Package for Service Delivery and after reviewing by FBiH government
it will be sent on Parliament for final adoption. Federation Ministry of Health formed
second expert team to continue work on DRG system introduction in FBiH health system.

      Subcomponent 1.2: Reporting, Control and Enforcement of Payroll Taxes


The following outputs were produced for FBiH health and pension sector under this
subcomponent:

The major problems with the current system of collection, reporting, enforcement and
control of health and pension insurance contributions and individual taxes were analyzed
in detail. The series of analytical reports provided a solid base for identification of
mechanisms to consolidate the social insurance revenue collection and enforcement
system in a manner consistent with the broader directions of tax administration reform.
This was followed with parallel development of the action plans for RS and FBiH, which


                                           43

allowed for harmonization of some of the solutions. The unified collection gateway,
together with changes in institutional mandates proposed in the Action Plan, are to lead
to 1) reporting system allowing for individual entitlements recording crosscutting them
with contribution payments, 2) reduction of reporting burden to employers and 3) simpler
and more effective collection, enforcement and control of pension and health insurance
contributions payment. One of the main outcomes of the component was building of the
consensus on future reforms among 11 implementing agencies and other stakeholders.
Implementation of the action plan recommendation in FBiH and RS Tax Administration
is currently supported by USAID ELMO project.

      Subcomponent 1.3: Risk-pooling and Rationalization of Service Provision

The following outputs were produced for FBIH health sector under this subcomponent:

The main, expected Project output were the general and specific proposals for hospital
network rationalization at the level of each individual Entity, and the State level. The
rationalization project objective was to strengthen the capacities of ministries and health
insurance institutes in health care insurance planning to satisfy the needs of the
population, more efficiently and economically, in line with the available funds, and there
from to identify the options for hospital services' rationalization.

The FBiH HIF is decentralized and organized in 10 Cantons, covering the whole FBiH
territory. The risk pooling part of this subcomponent focused primarily on FBiH, with no
activities being implemented in the RS. Though the project documentation proposed that
option of pooling certain risks across Entities in the medium term might be explored, the
authorities in both Entities did not wish to elaborate this option further under the Project.

After carrying out functional assessment and utilization review of the secondary and
tertiary healthcare institutions and considering options for rationalization of the current
provider network, the draft Rationalization Plan for FBiH was prepared.

Specific recommendations pertain to categorization of all hospitals into four levels
(multifunctional centers, general inpatient care hospitals, regional hospitals, and clinical
hospitals and clinical centers), which should result in rationalization of provision of
hospital health services. For each hospital category, the types of cases are outlined, which
should be treated, as well as indicators of the appropriate number of beds for the hospitals
in each category.

Another recommendation is that, between hospitals providing the same type of services,
and having underutilized capacities, redistribution of capacities can be made with the
objective to reduce or eliminate duplication of required capacities.

                  Subcomponent 1.4: Contracting of Health Services

Project Task "Development of new payment models for health services" was
implemented as a part of the SITAP, with consulting assistance from "Medicare"
Australia. The Project Task objective was the development and testing of new payment
models for health services in primary, secondary, and tertiary hospital health care.
Introduction of new payment models was aimed at increasing the health care efficiency



                                             44

and effectiveness, and reduction of unnecessary costs in the health system, which was
identified during the project task implementation.
New payment models for health services at the primary and secondary health care level
were tested in pilot facilities, UKC Tuzla, KB Mostar, Health Centre in Kladanj, and
Health Centre in Capljina. The Task output constitutes the basis for the expansion of
"new" payment methods for the entire Federation of BiH, during the transition period.
The model covered all services financed from the compulsory health insurance funds.
The Consultant proposed three basic service payment methods and contract formats for
hospital services, outpatient treatment (non-hospital, outpatient specialist services), and
primary health care.

After analyzing current mechanisms of provider payment for all healthcare levels,
proposal for introduction of the new purchasing mechanisms in hospital sector (output-
based payment methodology, using DRGs), and refinement and fine tuning of capitation
payments mechanisms in PHC were developed and accepted by FBiH implementing
agencies.

According to the pilot project results, the new payment model that is to take hold at the
health centre level is the capitation payment model, through indirect contracting.
Analysis of the current payment models for hospitals was made and they are mainly paid
based on invoiced services (nursing day, diagnostics and therapeutically procedures,
medications, etc.). The focus is on invoicing, and not on control of clinical work. Pilot
project was focused on three tasks: diagnosis and procedures recording, selection of the
principal diagnosis, and development of quality criteria for provided health care.
Progress was made in all three areas.

The recommendation for the basic structure was to create model according to the formula
of payment per case (according to DRG). Payment per case according to DRG will
create better stimulus and provide better data for planning and evaluation.

During the project, the pilot project aimed to test classification of outpatient services for
the purpose of payment. Current classification methods have certain flaws originating
from the methods used by the previous system that are different from the ones used in
countries with good health system management. The tested classification originates from
the international standard classification of inpatients called the "Diagnosis Related
Groups (DRG)".

In addition, the DRG manual produced under the Project was officially promulgated at
Entity and State level. Though it was planned that the new systems would be piloted in
designated facilities, the real piloting work did not take place.        The feasibility of
introduction of the new payment mechanisms was confirmed instead, through collection
of data from pilot institutions and simulation of the piloting exercise without the real
pilot contracts being signed. However, the staff of the designated facilities and FHIRI
received training in purchasing and contracting under the Project.

            Subcomponent 1.5: Medium-Term Reform of Pension Policies

The training in actuarial mathematics, tools and models was provided for representatives
of the FBiH PIO Institute and the FBiH Pension Reform Working Group. Initial training


                                            45

was provided under the ToR 1.5a (implemented in period from September 2004 to
December 2005), producing at the same time up-to-date actuarial analysis and modeling
of the Entity pensions systems. Five representatives of FBiH implementing agencies
were involved in the modeling work and preparation of the first long-term financial
projections for pension system. Given the lack of participants' experience with other
programming languages, the models were built as Excel spreadsheets. Further step in the
actuarial capacities building were the courses on structure and use of the World Bank's
pension forecasting model ("PROST"), held in June 2006 and October 2007, which were
followed by provision of the model to the FBiH PIO Institute and the FBiH Pension
Reform Working Group. There were proposals to form specific work posts/department
through internal reorganization of the FBiH PIO Institute, which would be responsible for
future actuarial work, but such reorganization did not occur during the Project
implementation period. However, the training course was provided to a small group of
FBiH PIO Institute employees who should ultimately be responsible for generating
forecasts of pension system on ongoing basis.

The long-term financial projections of reform options were provided in 2005 and 2007 by
actuarial consultants working under TOR's 1.5a and 5.4. These projections were taken
into consideration while reviewing options for medium-term reforms of the pension
system, together with the actuarial projections prepared by the WB and presented in
"Bosnia and Herzegovina Pension System Note".

After reviewing the organizational arrangements, structures and systems for the design,
co-ordination and evaluation of pension policy and pensions administration within and
between key Government Ministries and agencies in each Entity, specific systemic steps
and reforms were recommended in order to improve policy making and co-ordination
and the effectiveness of pension administration within and between each Entity; and co-
ordination of their bilateral relationships on pensions policy with neighboring states. The
recommendations were presented in the form of the Action Plan and approved by the
FBiH Government.

In examining options for medium-term reform of the pension system, implementing
agencies considered regional and international experiences, through contacts with
international consultants, study tours, participation in international training programs on
pension reforms and numerous local capacity building workshops and conferences.
Technical assistance provided for design of the pension reform and the future system
worked majority of the time directly with Federal Ministry of Health and Social Policy
and FBiH PIO Institute. As part of the work, the technical assistance also supported
implementing agencies in assessment of the necessary preconditions for future
introduction of funded privately managed pensions, in addition to the PAYG pillar, and
the feasibility of their medium-term introduction. The FBiH Pension Reform Working
Group was appointed only in last year of the Project implementation, after consideration
of the first draft of the Pension Reform Strategy by FBiH Government in early 2007. At
the time of the Group forming, majority of the activities under pension part of the Project
were completed. However, the Project was able to support work of the Group in period
March-December 2007. As of end of the Project, the work on development of the Pension
Reform Strategy for FBiH was still ongoing, with aim to complete




                                             46

Support to Federal PIO Institute in financial planning/control and alignment of reporting
standards to IFRS was planned under TOR 1.5d. The contract for technical assistance for
the TOR was signed with the consulting firm Progeco Srl. in June 2005 and the work
commenced at end of June 2005. It was originally planned that the assignment should be
implemented over 5 month's period. The contract expired at the end of February 2006,
with 2 major outputs remaining uncompleted. The consulting firm submitted no invoices,
within deadlines defined in the contract, for the work performed. The consulting firm
submitted request for extension of contract by end of April 2006, which was not
approved by SITAP implementing agencies and SITAP Steering Committee.

The Steering Committee also approved reallocation of remaining funds from this ToR to
other activities.

                       Component 2: Organizational Management

The objectives of Component 2 can be regarded as partially achieved, same like
objectives of the subcomponents 2.1-2.3. The main reason for partial achievement of the
objectives was cancellation of four TOR's originally planned under this component.
Development and refinement of implementing agencies' strategic goals and institutional
mandates were done in Federal Ministry of Health, Federal HIRI and Federal PIO, and
these were followed by business planning exercises. In support of strengthening the
capability of staff, they participated in numerous local, regional and international training
events, study tours and on-job training. This resulted in enhancement of technical and
management skills necessary for effective execution of activities under the Component 1
and execution of previously approved health and pension reforms.

      Subcomponents 2.1 (Strategic Development) and 2.2 (Business Planning)

The following outputs were produced for FBiH health sector under these subcomponents:

Support to strengthening overall strategic goals development and business planning was
provided to Federal Ministry of Health, Federal HIRI and Federal PIO. Strategic goals
and directions were agreed for all three institutions and presented in the respective
strategic plans. Consequently, as result of strategic planning processes, revisions of the
internal rulebooks were made by these institutions. Improved internal organization, with
more efficient and effective organizational structure and new departments, was followed
by improved job descriptions of staff and managers in all three institutions. Human
resource planning was also conducted in these three institutions.

The TOR 2.2 was cancelled in 2006 by the Project Steering Committee, following
recommendations of the Mid-Term Review. This part of the Project had supposed to
deal with 1) development of public communications capacities, 2) standardization and
improvement of customer service standards in health and pension services and
development of new approaches to improve the effectiveness of stakeholder and
community involvement in the development of health and pension policies and priorities.
These activities, though initially planned, were not supported through the Project.

              Subcomponent 2.3: Information Technology Strengthening




                                             47

Harmonization of technical standards among implementing agencies supported systems
harmonization and data exchange across the various institutions involved in the reporting
and enforcement of taxes and social contributions, and/or responsible for expenditure
execution and monitoring of social insurance programs. The data exchange was further
supported by development of plans for new telecommunication network systems, which
would be in line with up-to-date technical solutions. The IT support capacities of the
institutions were strengthened through technology training and minor upgrading of
equipment and data communications networks.

The TOR 2.5 was cancelled in 2006 by the Project Steering Committee, following
recommendations of the Mid-Term Review. This part of the Project had supposed to
deal with establishment of key indicator data for all institutions to support policy
formulation and monitor program implementation in a timely and effective manner.
These activities, though initially planned, were not supported through the Project. 1 6

                      Component 3: Project Implementation Support

The Project Implementation Unit of the FBiH Ministry of Health performed satisfactory
all tasks envisaged in the Project Appraisal Document. The objectives of the Component
3 can, therefore, be regarded as achieved.

Training in results-based monitoring and evaluation for health sector implementing
agencies built capacities necessary for initial functioning of the M&E sector of the
Federal Ministry of Health and prepared ground for implementation of the Component 3
(Health Policy Formulation and Project Support) of the WB supported Health Sector
Enhancement Project. Joint training of Federal Ministry of Health, FHIRI and Public
Health institutes staff allowed for harmonization of their views on M&E function in the
health sector. Through consensus on strategic directions for introduction of the results-
based monitoring and evaluation system, these institutions confirmed their commitment
for the system establishment.


II. CONCLUSION


The Social Insurance Technical Assistance Project had the aim of strengthening the
effectiveness and efficiency of health and pension insurance systems by the provision of
high quality technical assistance and training to help implement existing reforms and to
help design options for future social insurance reforms. The Project provided support for
policy formulation in this regard. Based on the analysis of project outputs/outcomes and
results of the independent evaluation, the project had impact that "contributed to
significant progress towards the Project Development Objective". The objective, as
defined in the PAD, was only partially met, mainly because its achievement required not
only design but also the implementation of the reforms. Design of the SITAP did not
envisaged that the Project would support implementation of the options developed
through the Project.      To contribute further to achievement of the PDO, through
implementation of the formulated policies, the future operations in social insurance
sector would be needed. The operations should focus on full implementation of a
narrower set of activities, rather than grasping widely over the sector.
