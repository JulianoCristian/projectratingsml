Technical Assistance Project for Bosnia and Herzegovina are\n            as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to the\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also rated as moderately satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned included: 1) technical assistance (TA) needs to be\n            manageable. A careful assessment needs to be made of the\n            capacity of clients to absorb technical assistance; project\n            implementation plans need to be drawn up that appropriately\n            pace the introduction of TA and TA activities; and\n            appropriate working arrangements that ensure sufficient\n            operational interaction between client and consultant need\n            to be formalized as part of project design; 2) the quality\n            and intensity of project supervision can make a difference\n            in whether a project achieves its intended outcomes. Active\n            engagement with the client in resolving problems during\n            implementation is especially important in situations where\n            the type of project being implemented is new to the\n            counterparts responsible for implementing it; 3) while it\n            may not be easy particularly with projects of this nature,\n            having clearly identified and measurable targets or\n            indicators from the start of the project would help to\n            facilitate measurement of progress towards the final project\n            outcome and could serve as a red flag if project\n            implementation is beginning to stagnate; 4) stakeholder\n            involvement at all stages of the project cycle and\n            particularly in the preparation phase cannot be stressed\n            enough, as this helps to ensure commitment and ownership to\n            the project and it's objectives from the counterpart\n            side and also ensures that local expertise and knowledge of\n            the context are taken into account. As is evident in this\n            project the commitment of implementing agency staff was a\n            critical factor in the success of the project; 5) a critical\n            area to be considered particularly in technical assistance\n            projects where capacity building is a key goal is that of\n            retention of staff in local implementing agencies once\n            knowledge transfer and improvements in capacity have\n            occurred. Agreement should be reached with the local\n            agencies during project preparation on clear strategies of\n            staff retention; and 6) workshops, well-designed study tours\n            and training courses are effective ways of transmitting\n            knowledge. Where issues are complex, or the subject matter\n            broad, initial flagship-type courses are more usefully run\n            before project start-up rather than during implementation,\n            as these provide context."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
