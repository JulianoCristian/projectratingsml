medium-size boilers and\n            induce more energy-efficient practices in the architectural\n            design and operation of new residential buildings; and b) to\n            demonstrate interfuel substitution and improve the overall\n            energy efficiency throughout the heat supply chain, as a\n            means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The project\n            comprises the following components: 1) investments in the\n            conversion of small and medium-size coal-fired boiler houses\n            to gas-firing and in the installation of energy-efficient\n            equipment in new residential buildings; and 2) technical\n            assistance to project participants, including project\n            management, environmental monitoring, and nationwide marketing."}, "docdt": "1994-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
