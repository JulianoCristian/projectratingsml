The many lessons\n            learned reinforce the need for Government commitments, for\n            early assessment of local capacities, for secured\n            counterpart funding, and, point at the importance of project\n            ownership. Also highlighted is the fact that the requirement\n            to use English language at all levels of project\n            preparation, seemingly limits local access to the project,\n            and hinders project implementation. This requirement\n            excluded some bidders and made implementation more difficult\n            (sworn translations of receipts were required, which was\n            neither time- nor cost-effective). It is suggested that\n            English language should perhaps not be required below the\n            level of the Implementation Agency, or local consultants.\n            Moreover, the requirement to have the bidding process open\n            to companies from other countries, potentially limits the\n            successful participation of local firms. Such process,\n            especially in the case of small engine procurement, blocked\n            local firms from strengthening their position on the market,\n            slowing their local and national potential expansion. The\n            Public Procurement Law was already enforced, and indeed,\n            national competitive bidding (NCB), provides flexibility in\n            the procurement process."}, "docdt": "2004-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
