The\n            project components are five. The first universalizes quality\n            primary education by supporting community and school-based\n            projects that improve access and learning outcomes by a)\n            supporting services to prepare, sign, monitor, and evaluate\n            contracts, b) providing quality inputs to improve school\n            management, teaching processes, and staff development; and\n            c) rehabilitating infrastructure and supplying furniture and\n            equipment. The second improves quality of and access to\n            secondary education, particularly in rural areas, by\n            supporting school-based pilot programs with subcomponents\n            similar to those of the first component. The third component\n            improves access to quality textbooks and teacher-learning\n            materials to primary schools by a) producing new titles\n            including teaching guides; b) printing and distributing\n            textbooks and teaching materials; and c) holding in-service\n            teacher training. The fourth component strengthens key\n            functions in the education ministry at central and local\n            levels including educational planning, bi-annual learning\n            assessments and financial management strengthening, and\n            pre-investment studies. The fifth component supports reform\n            of higher education in assisting institutions to modernize\n            and to diversify."}, "docdt": "1998-02-13T00:00:00Z"}
