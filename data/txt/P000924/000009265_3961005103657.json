"The main objective of the Rural Water\n            Works (RWW) Project (Community Water and Sanitation Project)\n            is the full-scale demonstration of the proposed National\n            Community Water and Sanitation Strategy. In so doing, it\n            will help achieve the objectives of the National Community\n            Water and Sanitation (CWS) Program - that is to: (a) provide\n            basic water and sanitation services to communities that will\n            contribute towards the capital cost and pay the normal\n            operations, maintenance and repair costs of their\n            facilities; (b) ensure sustainability of these facilities\n            through community management, private sector provision of\n            goods and services, and public sector promotion and support;\n            and (c) maximize health benefits by integrating water,\n            sanitation and hygiene education interventions. There are\n            three main components: (i) provision of water and sanitation\n            facilities to rural communities; (ii) provision of water and\n            sanitation facilities to small towns on a pilot basis; and\n            (iii) capacity building for public and private sector. In\n            all, some 1,000 water points and 30 small town water\n            supplies will be provided."}, "docdt": "1994-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
