"The Colombo Urban Transport\n            Project's outcome was rated as satisfactory. Key\n            lessons learned from the project include: 1) As a project\n            evolves during identification, preparation and appraisal, it\n            is important that a realistic match is maintained between\n            project components, objectives and indicators. 2) The Bank\n            must be realistic about results of institutional\n            strengthening. Changing a government department into a\n            supposedly autonomous body would be unlikely to have a\n            noticeable impact on efficiency unless this was accompanied\n            by a deregulation of service provision and tariff setting;\n            and genuine autonomy regarding cost control, use of\n            revenues, and access to capital markets. 3) It is important\n            to avoid having too many implementing agencies involved with\n            the project, which weakened the impact of Bank discussion\n            with the government on project matters and policy reforms.\n            4) Projects are more effective if they are being implemented\n            by an established unit as part of the regular work program\n            of the executing agency. The project can then contribute\n            directly to the institutional strengthening of that agency.\n            5) Bids for major civil works and goods and proposals for\n            major consultancy studies should be obtained before board\n            presentation. The procurement process needs to be well\n            advanced by the time of negotiations, particularly in\n            countries where procurement is a slow process."}, "docdt": "1999-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
