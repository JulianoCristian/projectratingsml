and Olcott Mawatha including implementation of short-term,\n            cost-effective measures of the TSM program comprising\n            junction improvements (signals, channelization), bus\n            passenger facilities (terminal improvements), bus lanes,\n            sidewalks, footbridges and rehabilitation of road pavement\n            in the Petah and adjoining Olcott Mawatha areas; (c)\n            Maradana Junction improvements including construction of a\n            gyratory, improvements of the approach roads and the\n            provision of inter-linked signalization; and (d) consultancy\n            services for implementation support.  The second component,\n            long-term urban transport planning will provide for\n            consultants to:  (1) carry out the Colombo Urban Transport\n            Study; and (2) provide on-the-job training of the\n            counterpart staff involved in urban transport planning.  The\n            third component, institutional strengthening includes: (i)\n            transport regulation consultancy services to train the\n            National Transport Commission and Provincial Council staff\n            to increase their managerial capabilities to monitor the\n            safety and provision of bus services including technical\n            assistance to initiate the process of reform and evaluate\n            different options for the Sri Lanka Railways privatization;\n            and (ii) technical assistance to prepare a comprehensive air\n            quality control program and train the Central Environmental\n            Authority staff."}, "docdt": "1993-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
