The overall objectives of the\n            Second Technical Assistance Project (TA II) were to assist\n            the Government: (i) prepare and implement annual recovery\n            and development programs in the major productive sectors and\n            public finance; and (ii) strengthen its capacity to\n            formulate and implement a medium-term development strategy.\n            Project components are (i) short term institutional support\n            through provision of the service of resident advisers and\n            short-term consultants in key government agencies; (ii)\n            long-term institution building through-on-the-job and other\n            training for national staff. Conclusion and lessons learned\n            are the Second Technical Assistance Project provided\n            expertise and training which have brought immediate,\n            measurable benefits. The results in the key diamonds and\n            forestry sectors are particularly valuable to the economy.\n            Without the important reforms brought about in debt\n            management and the civil service -- reforms which are\n            directly attributable to project activities -- and the\n            important studies financed, it is unlikely that the\n            Government could have successfully pursued its structural\n            adjustment program. The cost of the services of the resident\n            advisers involved in these activities is more than justified\n            by the benefits they helped the Government to obtain."}, "docdt": "1990-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
