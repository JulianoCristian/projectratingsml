Environmental Impact Assessment
Executive Summary
North China Electric Power Design Institute
January, 1996
Introduction:
1.    The proposed Tuoketuo Power plant is located in the Tuoketuo County, Inner-
Mongolia Autonomous Region, about 80 km southwest of Huhhot City. The planned capacity
of the power plant is 6 x 600 MW, with 2 x 600 MW sub-critical, intermediate reheat,
condensing type turbine-generators to be instaled for Phase I of the project. Auxiliary facilities
include: water intake and delivery structures; ash disposal area; railway siding and transmission
line. The environmental impacts of the power station and each of the auxiliary components
has been assessed. The project is designed to meet national and World Bank effluent and
emission standards. Hgh efficiency electrostatic precipitators (not less than 99.76 %), and low
NOx burners wil be used, and space wiD be provided in the plant layout for flue gas
desulfurization. The two generating sets will share one 240 m high reinforced concrete
chimney. Continuous stack gas and ambient air monitoring equipment wil be installed. A
closed cycle condenser cooling system would be used, as wel as ash slurry water recycling,
and recycling of other process waters where possible, due to the scarcity of local water
resources. A geotextile leachate liner system will be installed at the ash disposal area to prevent
groundwater contamination. An environmental management unit would be established in the
power company. This environmental unit would cooperate wiD local authorities and other
institutional experts in desertification control, and would undertake an ongoing soil
conservation and desertification control project to be funded by Tuoketuo Power Company.
Project Descrintion:
2.        Coal Source: On the basis of the coal supply agreement signed between the
Zhungeer Coal Industry Corporation and the Tuoketuo Power Plant, the plant wil burn the
bituminous coal from the Zhungeer Coal Mine. The first phase of the coal mine project has
began cwnstruction. The state-run mines wil have a total annual output of 12 million tons and
local mines 3 million tons. The coal mine project is scheduled to reach the design output in
1996. The feasibility study report for the second phase of the project has been pre-reviewed.
The completion of the second phase will bring the total annual output of the coal mine up to
30-40 million tons. The annual coal consumption required by the first phase of the Tuoketuo
Power Project will be about 4 nillion tons, which can be fully ensured by the Zhungeer Coal
Mine.



3.        Coal properties: Zhungeer mine coal will be washed at the mine, and four qualities
of coal will be produced. The check coal sulfur content is 0.47 %, and the ash content is 30 %.
This is the lowest grade of Zhungeer coal alter washing.
4.        Coal consumption: the first phase (2x 600 MW) will consume 14,520 tons/day
(check coal); the capacity power station (6 x 600 MW) will consume 43,560 tons/day (check
coal).
5.        Coal transportation: The coal will be transported to the site through the Zhungeer-
Fengzhen railway line which is under the unified control of the Zhungeer Coal Industry
Corporation, and then along a dedicated (43.75 km) railway line owned by the power plant.
6.       Power evacuation: The power plant wiDl evacuate electricity via a 500 KV
transmission line running northward, then turning eastward and finally entering Beijing District.
7.       Water supplies: Cooling, potable, fire fighting and process water supplies wil be
drawn from the Yellow River. The water supply project includes 3 components: intake from
the Yellow River; water treatment (clarification), and delivery to the power plant. The water
intake will be placed at Putanguai, on the north bank of the Yellow River, about 12 km
southwest of the plant site. Cooling water treatment will include elongated sedimentation
ponds, acid dosing, and precipitation. Cooling water wiDl be chlorinated to prevent biofouling
in an installation located near the cooling towers.
Baseline data:
8.    Site characteristics: The site is located within the boundary of Yanshanying, in the
south of the county, about 0.3 lan east of the Huhhot-Zhungeer Highway, 7 km north of the
Yellow River, and about 20 km southeast of the county town. The ash yard is located on a
dune sloping-field of Gaobaoshiying Village about 2 km south of the plant site. The area is
rural; there are no neighboring large-scale industrial facilities. There are no power stations
existing or planned within 80kmn of the site.
9.    Location and zeography: Tuoketuo County is located in the southeastern part of the
Inner Mongolia Front Bend Plain, at the juncture of the Yellow River-Daheihe River alluvial
plain and the Helingeer Hill pediment alluvial slant plain The whole county is an open plain
except a very small area in the southeastern part belonging to Helingeer Hill Zone. The
elevation of the plain area ranges from 1070 m in the northeastern part to 992 m in the
southwestern part. There are many large and small dunes scattered over the southern part of
the plain area where the power station site is located. The dune heights range from 5 to 10 n,
covered with sparse vegetation. The northern part of the plain area is vast, flat, uncultivated
land. Land use in the county is divided into a third each of i) cultivated land, ii) "shelter forest"
and grassland (for desertification control); and, iii) wasteland.
10.   Climate: The climate is semi-arid with average annual rainfall of 395.2 mm, and annual
evaporation of 1825.6 mm. The climate is classified as continental semi-dry monsoon, with
prevailing westerly.



11.      Hydrology and floods: The Yellow River passes Tuoketuo County to the south.
No definite flood river courses or channels exist within the boundary of the county. The few
low-lying lands do not form complete flood channels because of the interrupted terrain. Floods
that have occurred during rainy seasons have mainly seeped into the ground or evaporated
from the low-lying lands where the floods accumulated. The site is 3 km west of the Shagou
flood discharge canal. Since the 1.0 % flow rate of floods in Shagou makes some threat to the
site, the top level of Shagou dike would be raised. In addition, there is a hiDl zone covering a
30.8 km2 area to the south of the site; storm floods from this zone will threaten the site to a
certain degree. Therefore, the bed for the dedicated railway line shall be raised and reinforced
as a flood control measure. The power station itself will be constructed above the elevation of
the 100 -year flood.
12.      Siesmicitv: The area is rated 7th degree for earthquake damage, with a probability
of 10 % in 50 years. The damage potential rating is a national standard with a range of I to 12.
An earthquake of 7th degree is a strong earthquake, with potential to cause structural damage;
therefor the power station wil be engineered to withstand this level of quake. There have been
no major earthquakes in the area of the site in recorded history.
13.   Ambient air qualitv: The background values of S02 and NOx are very low in this
region, with the monitoring results far below the permitted values specified by the national
standard. Ambient air quality has not been affected by industrial pollution. Random and
average daily concentration of SO2 are lower than national standard class II in both heating
and non-heating seasons. The random and average daily concentration are also lower than
national standard class I in two seasons at all monitoring points except the point at the
Tuoketuo county town.
14.   During the heating and non-heating seasons, the random sample concentration and
average daily concentration of NOx are lower than national standard class II at each
monitoring point. The average daily concentration of NOx is lower than national standard class
I at most monitoring points.
15.   Both random and average daily concentration of particulate (TSP) meet national class
II standards at each monitoring point in the non-heating season. The daily TSP average
concentration was 14.3-57. 1% above standards at aD monitoring points during 6 of 7 days in
the heating season. TSP concentration in the town residential district is not higher than that of
the countryside. This observation indicates that it is wind erosion and desertification, rather
than pollution, that is the main cause of high ambient TSP in Tuoketuo county.
16.      Socio-economiocs: Tuoketuo County has a population of about 0.16 million,
among which 12 thousand are county town residents. Agriculture is Tuoketuo County's
economic mainstay. The county is well-known throughout the country for its indigence.
Highways connect all villages of the county and neighboring banners and counties. The county
has a program of encouraging development to help move subsistence agricultural workers into
more lucrative forms of employment. The power station and related econornic spin-off are
viewed as a positive impact on the local economy.



Imnacts and mitigation:
17.   Impact on flora and fauna: There are 248 species of plants in assessment zone
including 194 species of wild plants. They are all common species and occur in uniform
distribution. Consequently, construction of the power plant will not result in local loss of
rare indigenous species, change the composition of local plant species, or result in
extinction of species. Animals in the assessment zone are low in species diversity and
common in agricultural areas. Even fewer species are found around plant site and ash
disposal yard. Construction will cause emigration of some animal species without
resulting in large changes of species diversity or number. More botanical species will exist
after completion of the power plant due to greening and beautification of the plant area, as
well as the desertification control program, providing more habitat for avifauna.
18.   Changes of vegetation around ash yard and plant area: The two alternative ash
disposal yard locations are characterized by sparse vegetation, low species diversity, and
fixed or semi-fixed sandy soil. Gaobaoshi ash yard is the poorest with respect of structure
and stability of vegetation. All original vegetation within the ash disposal and plant areas
will be destroyed completely during the construction. Such factors as construction and
transportation will also affect the growth of vegetation outside ash disposal and plant
areas. Water and wind erosion will be intensified because the final elevation of ash disposal
area wiDl be 19-30m higher than-the original ground surface. Growth of vegetation on ash
disposal areas through natural evolution is impossible. This will result in desertification of
soil. Therefore, the ash disposal areas will be reclaimed using principles of arid land
vegetation establishment developed by local experts.
19.   Air emission controls: A high-efficiency ESP will be used in the phase I project, with
efficiency 299.76 %, caculated to meet Bank emission standards of 100 mgtNm3. Use of coal
with low sulfur content, and a 240 m high chimney will satisfy emission standards for S02.
Low NOx burners will be used with emission concentration below 400 ppm
20.   Dispersion modeling of air emission impacts: The North China Electric Power Design
Institute used the U. S. EPA CRSTER point source dispersion model to analyze eniission
impacts of the proposed power station, with controls as detailed above. The worst case
scenario was used in the impact modeling: "C' class stability, because it gave the high value of
GLC max. Wmd speed was chosen according to data from a local weather monitoring station,
the wind speed chosen was an average value, since at chimney height lower wind velocities
seldom occur. The maximum height of inversion layer, during the diurnal cycle when it is
maximum (after sunrise), was used. The height of the inversion layer in the area never exceeds
139 in, and the chimney height is 240 m; therefor the chimney design allows for favorable
dispersion. Conditions are similar from summer to winter.
21.   Sulfur dioxde (SO2): Ambient air quality monitoring has shown low background
values of S02, with concentrations <50 tggm3. The Tuoketuo area can be classified according
to Bank criteria for S02 as a "unpolluted" area, therefor the Bank standards of 500 t/day



emissions of SO2 and an ambient air concentration of no more than 50 jig/m3 apply. The daily
SO2 emission of Phase I of Tuoketuo Power plant (Plant A) is estimated at 100.54 t/day with
design coal and 113.70 t/day with check coal. According to the model, the maximum annual
average concentration of SO2 in the plume of the plant is 14.5ig/rm3 and 16.4jg/r3 for check
coal and design coal respectively, which are 29% and 33% of World Bank standard. In the
case of planned capacity (6 x 600 MW) of Tuoketuo Power plant, the daily SO2 emission is
301.62 t/day for design coal and 341.10 t/day for check coal; the maximum annual average
concentration of S02 for design coal and check coal would be 43.5g/rm3 and 49.2 pg/m3
respectively.
22.       Noise control measures: An analysis of equipment noise has been performed.
Accordingly the boiler exhaust pipes will be equipped with silencers, and the allowable noise
levels of relevant standards will be stipulated in bid documents.
23.       Wastewater treatment: Process wastewater will be treated at the point of
generation to meet national and World Bank effluent standards, then drained southward to the
Yellow River via a discharge pipeline (5.5 km) into the Gengqinggou Canal. Separate drainage
systems will be used in the power station for sanitary sewage, industrial waste water and rain
water.
24.       Wate rervclinR and conservation measures: Various water conservation measures
will be used including: a demister inside the cooling tower; decreasing the water-ash ratio for
hydraulic ash removal; ash slurry water recycling; closed-loop circulation for industrial and
condenser cooling water; and, recovery of water from ventilation and blowdown of cooling
towers. The make-up water requirement in summer will be 3895 m3/h for 2x600 MW, and
10980 m3/h for 6x600 MW capacity.
25.       Ash disposal area: The ash disposal area wiD be located on a gentle slope with a
hill forming one of the sides, about 2 km south of the power station site. The ash disposal area
will be constructed in stages and utilized in sections. Each section will be reclaimed when full to
prevent erosion. A shielding forest belt wil be planted around the ash disposal area The area
occupied for Phase I will be 3.36 km2, with an average dam height of 15 m, and storage
capacity for 17.3 years for 2 x 600 MW. The final total occupied area of ash yard will be 6 36
km2, with a height 30 m and a total ash storage capacity (6 x 600 MW) for 24 years.
26.   Leachate liner: There is sufficient clay within most of the ash disposal area to
provide a 300 mm minimum base layer for a geotextile/plastic liner. The liner material is
in use internationally (Japan, England, France, U.S., and others), and is 3-4 mm thick. In
areas where a sand or clay base is not available, a minimum of 300 mm clay will be spread
as base material for the liner. In order to prevent liner damage from construction and
weathering a protective 300-500 mm thick layer of clay will be installed above the liner as
well. International experience with these liner systems has shown that they are serviceable
for 20-30 years, sufficient for the life of this project.
27.       Soil Conservation and Desertification Control Proiect:  The project would
contribute to the effort already planned in the "San Bei" (Northeast, North and Northwest
A



China) area, to arrest progressive desertification through soil conservation techniques;
establishment of vegetative cover to combat wind erosion, and improvement of soil
rnicroclimate, water retention and fertility properties. The Tuoketuo County overall target for
revegetation is to establish a forest cover for 40 % of the land area, (Long-Term Plan in 2000
of Tuoketuo County). The forest cover in an area within 30 kmn of the power station site is 15
% of the land area at this time (1995). Local people will be employed in the revegetation effort,
with preference given to land oustees.
Analysis of alternatives:
28.   Plant site: Three plant sites were considered for TuoKeTuo Power Plant A:
Yanshanying; Majiaqi; and, Namujia. All are located on the south side of TuoKeTuo
County and north side of the Yellow River and would have level ash disposal areas
(except for Gaobaoshi ash yard). One common problem of the three plant sites considered
was the proximity of a water source and FenZhun railway.
29.   On comparison of site conditions, Yanshanying had advantages over the other two
plant sites. Though there are some disadvantages, e.g. movement of two villages
(Daduiying and Gaobaoshiying) and adoptation of flood prevention measures, its
advantages were still obvious. The Yanshanying location is close to the ash disposal area,
has convenient sewage drainage, transportation and is mostly wasteland. The most
obvious advantage is that natural foundations can be used for the main buildings saving
considerable investment and shortening 1-1.5 years of the construction period for the first
phase. The significance of a more immediate power supply is inestimable.
30.   Conditions at the Majiaqi site are similar to those at Yanshanying except that the
foundations would have to be constructed artificially.
31.   The Namujia site had less favorable conditions than the other two, but would also
have been suitable for construction of a power plant
32    Schemes of cooling water treatment: The circulating cooling water discharge will
meet national discharge standards without treatment. Scale prevention will be carried out
for the turbine circulating cooling system by addition of acid or lime to circulating water.
The concentration ratio and discharge quantity of circulating cooling water will vary with
the different treatment processes. Two schemes were considered:
Scheme 1: Adding acid and stabilizing agent
Scheme 2: Lime pretreatment and adding stabilizing agent
The evaluation showed that from an economic comparison, the advantage of scheme I
would be low investment, fast results and convenience for operating management and
maintenance. The disadvantage of this scheme is that the concentration ratio is small,



requiring a larger amount of make up water. From an economic comparison, the primary
investment for scheme 2 is high and the operating management and maintenance are
complicated. The concentration ratio is high, so scheme 2 would require less make up
water. For this project, scheme 1 was selected.
33.   Selection of an ash disposal alternative: The EIA discusses alternatives of dry or
hydraulic ash disposal systems. The hydraulic method was chosen for the following
reasons:
i) the climate of the project area is arid, with low annual rainfall, and a high
evaporation rate; therefore the water requirement to keep down fugitive dust on
the dry ash disposal pile would be high;
ii) there are many days each year with high winds ("gale">17m/sec) in Inner
Mongolia, (7 gale days, 11 sandstorm days), another problem for fugitive dust
emission;
iii) the dry ash disposal scheme requires a more complicated process, and,
iv) only one plant in Inner Mongolia is currently using the dry ash disposal
technique, there is not much experience with this process.
The overriding advantage of hydraulic ash disposal is the available water cover to hold
down fugitive dust. With the use of a liner, ground water contamination can be prevented.
Public consultation:
34.   In order to ensure the improvement of the living standards of PAP's and fulfill the
resettlement plan successfiully, the Electric Power Corporation of Inner Mongolia has
undertaken the following activities in order to enlist community participation.
35.   Svmposium for social survey: In October of 1993, 15 persons from villages, the
town, and the county affected by the project attended a symposium for social survey
organized by the Electric Power Corporation of Inner Mongolia. Land acquisition, the
scope of resettlement and requirements of residents and local government were discussed
in this meeting.
36.   Forum for drafts of resettlement plan: In April of 1994, 20 persons from villages
affected by this project, the local environment department and the local government were
invited by TuoKeTuo Power Plant Preparatory Department (TPPPD) to participate in a
forum for drafts of the resettlement plan. The drafts for the resettlement plan drawn up by
TPPPD and approved by Electric Power Corporation of Inner Mongolia were announced,
and the contents of the draft, compensation standard for PAP's and arrangement for the
immplementation of the resettlement plan were discussed in this meeting.



37.   Report of investigation of opinions of PAP's in occupied land. TuoKeTuo Power
Plant and ash yard: From June 20 to June 22, 1994, a meeting of cadres from villages and
the town was held at Xikoukou village of Yanshanying county. The opinions on land
occupation of the power plant and relocation of PAP's were sought.
38.   Symposium  attended by representatives of residents:  In July of 1993, 16
representatives from Yanshanying township government and 6 villages affected by the
project participated in a symposium of representatives of residents organized by TPPPD.
In this meeting, methods of labor arrangement and construction of new residences were
discussed.
Resettlement and Rehabilitation:
39.   A total of 26 families would be resettled in this project, including all auxiliary
facilities. In addition, cultivated lands will be occupied by the power station, ash pond,
water intake and delivery system, railway and transmission line. A total of 772 residents
will be affected by this project.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
The check coal sulfur content is 0.47 %, ash content is 30 %. Since the power plant is
located near the mine mouth, it is unlikely that another source of coal would be used,
because of transportation costs. Therefor ash and sulfur content are not likely to increase,
since this is the lowest of the coal quality grades after washing.
2.2.3.3 Fuel consumption
Daily coal consumption is calculated on 20 hours' utilization and annual coal consumption
is calculated on 6000 hours' utilization.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
See Figure 2.2-1 for the water quantity balance chart for the dry ash removal alternative,
and Figure 2.2-2 for the water quantity balance chart for the hydraulic ash removal
alternative.
2.3 Main pollution sources and discharges
2.3.1 Main pollution sources
TOUKETUO PLANT A is a coal-fired electrical power generation plant that will use coal
and water as raw materials. Flue gases, waste water, ash and slag, and noise are the main
potential environmental pollutants. Flue gas has an impact on ambient air quality,
production waste water and domestic sewage have impacts on surface water, the dry ash
disposal altemative could impact ambient air and ground water. Power generation noise
and coal dust fugitive emissions canalso have negative impacts on the environment.
2.3.1.1 Flue gas
The main constituents of flue gases discharged from an electrostatic precipitator and the
stacks after fuel coal firing in the boiler are S02, suspended particulates (SPM), and NOx.
2.3.1.2 Ash and slag
Ash will be collected by the electrostatic precipitator and air preheater and slag discharged
from the bottom of boilers.
2.3.1.3 Emuent
(I) Drainage of circulating cooling water:
Natural draft circulating cooling water towers will be used for turbine condenser cooling
in the project. Cooling water temperatures are elevated from heat exchange in the
condenser and tail section of the turbine. The heated water is pumped to the cooling water
tower, cools through evaporation, and is then pumped back to the condenser for next heat
exchange cycle.
The evaporative loss in the cooling tower can reduce water quantity and increase mineral
concentration. In order to maintain normal operation of the system, a large volume of
water must be made up. Waste cooling water must be concentrated and drained; this
wastestream is called circulating cooling water blowdown.
(2) Chemical acid and alkali waste water:
The raw water is to be deionized with an ion exchange resin in the demineralization plant
to become boiler feed water. Acid and alkali waste water rom the DM plant is produced

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
when renewing ion exchange resin with acid and alkali. The major pollutant is acid and
alkali.
(3) Oil contaminated wastewater:
Oil contaminated wastewater comes mainly from the heavy oil unloading area and rainfall
runoff from the oil storage area. The major pollutant is oil.
(4) Sanitary sewage:
Sanitary sewage is generated from the residential areas and officer's facilities in the power
station: production office building, shift operator building, building for singles, guest
house, canteen, and bath room. The major pollutant is BOD5.
(5) Runoff from the coal handling system:
Contaminated runoff waters are generated dust suppression sprays and wash water from
the coal handling system. The major pollutant is total suspended solids (TSS).
(6) Ash slurry water:
The volume of waste water from ash disposal depends mainly on the mode of ash
transportation to the disposal area.
In the hydraulic ash removal system, slag or bottom ash is slurried at the bottom of the
boiler. Fly ash from the electrostatic precipitator is slurried at the ESP with industrial
waste water in a set ratio and pumped to the ash disposal area along with the bottom ash
using ash and slag pumps. A certain volume of ash slurry water is kept as cover for the
ash disposal area to suppress fugitive dust. In order to save water, the ash slurry water is
to be recycled.
In the dry ash removal system, ash and slag are handled separately. After being collected
in the slag removal system, slag is pumped to a dewatering hopper and then transported
to the ash disposal area by conveyer belt. Ash is conveyed to an ash silo by a collecting
system, wet mixed and conveyed to the ash disposal area. This method of ash disposal has
no waste water discharge.
Rainfall runoff can become contaminated in the ash disposal area. The major pollutants of
rainwater collected in the ash disposal area in the rainy season are pH and total suspended
solids(TSS).
(7) Waste from acid cleaning boilers:
Acid cleaning of the inside wall tubing of the boilers is done to get rid of metal scraps and
impurities before the boiler is put into use. The effluent is contaminated with acid.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
2.3.1.4 Noise
Equipment noise originates from the turbine generator set and coal mill, etc. in the turbine
hall; the cooling tower outside the main building, and electromagnetic noise from the
main transformer station.
2.3.1.5 Fugitive dust
Fugitive dust is generated from the dry ash disposal area and the coal yard of the power
plant.
2.3.2 Project environmental impact factors
The environmental impacts of a coal fired power plant are not complicated and potential
environmental impacts are easily identified. According to the characteristics of TuoKeTuo
Power Plant A, the environmental setting and the identified wastestreams, a matrix
sensitivity analysis for the environrnent around the power plant was performed to identify
and compare the potential environmental impacts.

2.4 Ash disposal area
There are two altemative schemes, namely Fengyan ash disposal area for dry ash disposal
and Gaobaoshi ash disposal area for hydraulic ash disposal. Both alternatives have been
analyzed, and the Gaobashi Site with hydraulic ash removal has been chosen as the
preferred alternative.
2.4.1 Gaobaoshi ash disposal area
Gaobaoshi ash disposal area is located on sloping land belonging to Yangshanying Village,
which lies 2 km from the Yanshanying plant site to the south, between Mahuangtan and
XihaoLai Village. The elevation is high in the northeast and low in the southwest. The
natural slope of the ground is between 10 and 15%. The elevation of the ground is
between 1080-1110 msl. Gaobaoshi Village with 2 households and 4 persons is located in
the ash disposal area. When the plant is built, they will be resettled.

2.5.4 Principal construction machinery and construction methods
2.5.4.1 Land leveling and earthwork
Because the elevation differences of the project grounds are not large, bulldozers and
scrapers will be used for land leveling. Excavation for the construction of main buildings
(main building, cooling water tower, stacks) will use large excavation techniques with
backhoes and manual bottom cleaning. The excavated earth is to be piled in the
transforner station area temporarily. Extra earth can be used as fill for leveling in the
plant area.
2.5.4.2 Concrete construction of main buildings (foundations) ± 0 m elevation
Large area construction methods will be used in the main building area of the two units
Pump trucks for concrete handling will be used. In some areas in which pump trucks can
not get in, trestle or pipe construction methods would be used.
2.5.4.3 Lifting of steel structure above ±0 m of main building
Lifting for coal bunker and deaerator is to be completed with the method of primer
comprehensive lifting combined with the method of backwards lifting with moving type
caterpillar crane. Large sized equipment of various floors is to be lifted on at the same
time as civil engineering construction.
2.5.4.4 Stacks
The stacks (240m) will be reinforced concrete structures built with reverse molds.
2.5.4.5 Cooling water tower
The body of the cooling water tower is to be built with reverse mold Vertical conveyance
will use a folded arm crane, provided with curved construction man lift.
2.5.6 Social activities during construction
With respect to social arrangements during construction, a worker's union organization
will be established for each contractor. Worker programs would be formulated by the
unions to organize construction staff member participation in entertainment activities and
sports during holidays or after work. These would include library. sport activities, TV or
video, cinema and recreational performances.

Chapter 3 Environmental baseline of plant area
3.1 Natural environment
3.1.1 Geological land form
Plant area is located in the southeast part of Qiantao Plain, Inner Mongolia. It lies in the
intersection of the alluvial plain of Yellow River, Daheihe River and flood alluvial plain at
the base of the Zhungeer Hills.
The elevation of the plant site is from 1063 to 1067 msl. It is highest in the southeast and
lowest in northwest. The slope is 0.5%. The terrain of the plant site is broad and flat and
belongs to the Motechuan plain land forn.
The plant site and ash disposal area lie on the Arduous mass and TuoKeTuo Lake deposit
platform of Huhe over fault depression slope. The basic earthquake intensity is 7th degree.
3.1.2 Climate
The plant area is in the continental semidry monsoon climate area, with prevailing
westerlies. South winds prevails in summer, west winds prevail in the other seasons.
Owing to the control exerted by the Mongolian high pressure, winters are severely cold
and long. Under the control of subtropical high pressure of the Pacific, the sunmner is hot
and short. The climate is arid, with average annual rainfall of 395.2 mm. Evaporation rate
is 154.4 mm. The average temperature ranges from -12.4 °C in January to 22.9 °C in July,
(see Table 3.1-1).
A meteorological station was established in the end of the 1950's and is 18 km from the
power plant site. Its geographic coordinates are east longitude 1 l l I l', north latitude 40°
16'. The ground elevation is 1016 msl.
Meteorological information used here is from historical statistics from 1959 to 1990
compiled by the meteorological station of TuoKeTuo County.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
3.2.4.2 Soil status
(1) Soil at the site of Touketuo Plant A and surround the planned ash disposal area is poor
with low fertility. Total nitrogen (N) content of the soil in all sampled areas is of the
poorest level (level VI) according to specified standards of the national soil survey, which
shows N content in the soil in the area of fairly poor status. Average organic matter, and
quick-acting potassium (K) content in the soil of 80% of the sampled area belongs to the
poorest level (level VI) and the remaining 20% belongs to the inferior poor level (level V),
which has fairly poor organic matter and quick-acting potassium (K) content. Quick-
acting phosphorous (P) content in the soil is relatively rich: P content in 40% of the soil
samples belongs to the inferior poor level (level V); while the remaining 60% belongs to a
bit poorer than average (level IV). The above data show that due to low levels of organic
matter, nitrogen and potassium, the soil is of fairly poor quality for agricultural and
livestock production.
(2) A large portion of the area surrounding Touketuo Plant A is irrigated land and
floodplain land irrigated by taking water from the Yellow River. As a result of high
ground water levels in the area and long-term irrigation, the soil hardens with a high salt
content, poor physical and chemical characteristics, and widespread salinization. This is a
disadvantage for development of agricultural production.
(3) More than 60% of the farmland surrounding Touketuo Plant A is sandy, dry, hilly land
except for the irrigated areas. Low annual rainfall, high evaporation and heavy seepage in
the sandy soils results in dry farmland poor in both fertility and moisture. The fragile
ecological environrment for agricultural and livestock production depends on natural
meteorological conditions, resulting in unstable and low unit production. For instance, in
early June, 1994, the group undertaking this field sampling operation visited the North
China site during the season of high temperatures and little rainfall. Several successive
months of drought and high evaporation rates in the sandy soils prevented sowing seed in
almost all dry farmland in the area, especially in the hilly areas, resulting in the risk of
laying waste to the plowed farmland.
(4) Sand soils or sandy soils cover more than 90% of the Touketuo Plant A site. Heavy
winds and excessive sand result in wind erosion and desertification. More than 60% of the
area is subject to heavy and extremely heavy wind erosion and desertification according to
calculations made of the sampled areas. Wind erosion and desertification affects farmland
and forest, degrading the ecological environment impacting development of agricultural
and livestock production critically. For example, one sample spot, Mahuantan, was
originally sand sandwiched light soil with relatively good soil structure, suitable for
agricultural production. The higher terrain in the southeast of the village slowed wind
speed and power, causing sand to build up in this area. This resulted in loss of the original
forest, grass land and formed fixed or semi-fixed dunes critically eroded by wind and sand.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
3.2.4.3 Forest land in assessed area
The greater portion of forest is scattered with poor growth. The area is difficult to
afforest. Drought stunts young growth.
The greater part of forest in the assessed area is growth under 20 years old and of a single
species. The main vegetation on the sandy land is scattered forest of willow green in
summer. Natural grasslands no longer have the natural vegetation community structure.
The lowest productivity and highest exploitation is found on field borders, steep slopes
and low land in various stages of salinization. Vegetation coverage is under 15%.
Agricultural by-products, grassland and forage from forest areas are the main feed sources
in the area. Plant diseases and insect pests of livestock, crops, vegetables, fruit trees and
forest have done no serious harm on a large scale in the area.

The above figures show that cultivated land for agricultural purposes accounts 42.76 % of
the total area; but because of low fertility and poor meteorological conditions in the area,
60 % of the cultivated lands are impacted by drought, infertility, poor irrigation and
excessive cultivation. Grain yield is well below the national average
3.2.5 Analysis of ecological environment
The assessed area is typical of an artificial ecological system with a long and history of
cultivation and exploitation. The fragile artificial ecosystem resulted arid meteorological
conditions and extensive cultivation by humans.
Wildlife species are not rich in the assessed area. There are 50 families, 164 categories,
and 248 species of wild animals, in which 24 orders, 43 families and more than 90 species
are common wild animals. There are no animal or plant species near extinction or in need
special protection in the assessed area.
The Yellow River and groundwater resources are used for irrigation supply. Soil hardened
or salinized in a large portion of the area results from high levels of ground water in the
area. This is especially true in the eastern portion of the assessed area, due to long term

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
irrigation and heavy evaporation. Dry land dominates in the hilly areas, but poor
cultivation technique resulting in wastelands is common. Agricultural activity depending
on natural meteorological conditions, drought and land infertility are the main causes of
low agricultural productivity.
Land desertification prominently reflects the weakness of the ecological environment.
Wind erosion of soils and desertification ratios in the assessed area reaches 100 % of the
farmland. Sand accounts 31 % of the total area, in which fixed sand accounts 5.54 %,
semi-fixed sand accounts 20.02 % and moving sand accounts 5.4 % ( Kubuqi sand belt
accounts 4.64%). Degleyed meadow, dark brown soil, and windblown sandy soil are the
main soil categories in the assessed area. Soil are characterized by high sand content,
infertility, and an average organic matter content of 0.26--1.15 %.  The poor soil
classifications of levels V and VI are predominant, and are short of potassium and
nitrogen. The trace elements fluorine F, arsenic As, cadmium Cd, and lead Pb are within
the common national and worldwide ranges.
In summary the area where Touketuo Plant A located is infertile, and has progressive
salinization, heavy wind erosion and desertification and low productivity. Extensive
agricultural cultivation, poor production means and monocropping result in low and
unstable agricultural incomes. The area is impoverished and backward.
The Inner Mongolia Environmental Protection Agency (INEPA) has stated that there are
no protected areas within TuoKeTuo County (see letter from TuoKeTuo County City and
Town construction and Environmental Protection Bureau, Annex 1).

ENVIRNOMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Coal is the major fuel in TuoKeTuo administrative area. Annual coal consumption is 152,229 tons.
Annual coal consumption of the assessed area is 130,201 tons, taking 85.5 % of the annual water
consumption of the whole county.
There are more than 20 big coal users (including 5 users in town) in the assessed area. Their coal
consumption rates are 70,881 tons, and annual flue gas and dust emissions are 3732.5 tons with
510.33 tons of annual sulfur dioxide.
Among the five big units in the county town, boilers of four enterprises are in good condition with
precipitators in nonnal operation; the exception is TuoKeTuo Paper Plant.
Although more than ten prickline have no precipitation measures, they can not cause atmospheric
environmental problems currently because their locations are widely distributed.
3.6.1.2 Ambient air quality
In 1992, the Inner Mongolia Environment Science & Research Institute and Huhehot Environment
Protection Science & Research Institute carried out seven (7) days of monitoring quarterly for ambient
air quality in two seasons (non heating season and heating season) respectively in March 28 - April 4
and in August 23 - 30. The monitoring parameters were total suspended particles (TSP), sulfur
dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen oxide (NOx) and Fluorine. Monitoring points included 8 points in the
countryside, town, county town and around the plant site. See Figure 3.6-1 for the monitoring point
locations. See Table 3.6-6-Table 3.6-9 for monitoring results.
The methods for atmospheric environmental quality for individual pollutant index were used for the
assessment:
Ii= Ci/Si

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Both primary concentration and daily average concentrations of S02 are lower than
national standard class II in the area in heating and non-heating seasons based on
atmospheric environmental quality monitoring results in 1992. The primary concentration
and daily average concentrations of S02 are also lower than national standard class I at all
monitoring points except the point at Chengguan Town in TuoKeTuo county in both
heating and non-heating seasons.
The primary concentration and daily average concentration of NOx are lower than national
standard class II at each monitoring point in heating and non-heating seasons, and even
lower than national standard class I at the majority of points.
The background values of S02 and NOx are quite low in this area, where the monitored
values are far lower than national standards. Fluoride concentration in the air is far lower
than the limit of local specification as well. Ambient air that has not been impacted by
industrial pollution has a large capacity. The atmospheric environmental quality in the
assessed area is relatively good.
Primary concentration and daily average concentrations of SPM meet the national class II
standards at each monitoring point in the non-heating season. The primary concentration
exceeds the limit with a ratio of 3.6-4.0 % at three monitoring points in the heating
season. In the heating season the pollution index is 1.47 at the monitoring point of the
highest concentration. The limit exceeding ratio of SPM daily average concentration is
14.3--57.1% at all monitoring points during 7 days monitoring in the heating season
except at the Zhanggaiying Monitoring Point. The average of 7 days exceeds the limit
slightly at three points, among which the concentration at Lashihao is the highest with a
pollution index 1.28. The measured SPM in the township residential district is not higher
than that in rural areas. This indicates the main cause of high SPM in TuoKeTuo county is
not industrial pollution enissions, but meteorological conditions and desertification of bare
.sandy land.
According to the requirements for environmental assessments of the World Bank,
Touketuo Plant A is undertaking an ambient air quality monitonng program for one year.
A "BF-7000 Atmospheric Pollution Monitoring System" is being used. This equipment is
manufactured by the Beijing Analysis Instrument Works under arrangements to introduce
manufacturing technology in environmental monitoring instruments and systems from
IJSA Monitor Labs, instrument manufacture technology from USA Daxibi Co. and
Germany Mehac AG. The system automatically monitors S02, NOx, SPM, flying dust.
etc. atmospheric quality parameters successively in the atmospheric environment, as well
as temperature (T), relative hurnidity (RH), wind direction (WD), wind speed (WS),
atmospheric pressure (P), and other meteorological parameters. The system is equipped
with a special data processing system to acquire and process the monitored data in the
system and control the system. The special data processing system controls calibration and
other functions related to time automatically, and calculates average value, vector, sum
and report average.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Two sets of BF-7000 Atmospheric Pollution Monitoring Systems procured for Touketuo
Plant A have been installed at two automatic monitoring stations, one at the plant site and
the other at the TuoKeTuo countytown to monitor parameters including S02, NOx, SPM,
and fugitive dust. The monitoring data is included as an Annex to this report.

Dispersion modeling has been performed to assess the impacts of the project, including
impact on the largest village (Xinyingzi) near the plant site. The EPA CRSTER single
point source model was used. The model yielded yearly average maximum 24 hour
concentration, meteorological conditions for maximum ground level concentration, value
and location of maximum ground level concentration (GLC max). Results are compared to
World Bank standards on Table 4.1-17 (SO2); Table 4.1-18 (SPM); and Table 4.1-19
(NOx). The project is designed to meet Bank standards.
Prevailing winds in the area are from the west, which would carry emissions from the
project site away from TuoKeTuo County, the largest nearby population center. To- the
east of the project site there are no population centers within 30 km TuoKeTuo County
has a sparse population, and the area east of the project site is largely devoid of
agricultural activity.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.1.1 Analysis of meteorological conditions
4.1.1.1 Vertical wind profile
(1) Wind direction profile
Figures 4.1-1 and 4.1-2 show  the wind frequency measured with a small balloon on
various regulated height levels to 1200 m during a two season atmospheric test in March
and August of 1992. From the drawings, we can see, the prevailing wind direction at
increasing altitude in the plant area deflects to the right (clockwise).
In summer, below the height of the stacks (10-200 m), the prevailing wind direction is S-
SSW; above the height of the stacks (250-400 m), the prevailing wind direction is SSW; at
the height of 600-1000 m, the prevailing wind direction is SW; above 1000m, the
prevailing wind direction is WSW.
In the heating season, below the height of the stacks (1 0-200 m), the prevailing wind is S-
SSW; above the height of the stacks (250-600 m), the prevailing wind direction is W;
above 800 m, the prevailing wind is direction WNW.
(2) Wind speed profile
Statistical analysis of the field measurement data show: the average wind speed in the
plant area increases rapidly with height; the average wind speed is more than 5 m/s above
the height of 100 m, and more than 6 m/s above stack height (250m). Frequency of
stagnant conditions decreases with altitude. The frequency of stagnant conditions at the
different levels above stack height (250m) is less than 4% in summer and less than 3% in
winter (See Table 4.1-1)

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
(3) Wind speed power index
To describe the vertical variation of the wind speed, an exponential function is employed:
z
U(Z)=U 1 (-------)p
ZI
where:
U(Z),U I are the average wind speed at the height of Z, Zl respectively, P is the power
index which is in relation to atmospheric stability and ground roughness coefficient.
Table 4.1-2 shows the wind speed power index under different atmospheric stability
conditions in the plant area, the ground roughness coefficient of this area is Z0= 0.24m.

4.1.1.2 Atmospheric temperature profile
(1) Common characteristics of temperature profile
Under the influence of the ground, the atmospheric temperature near the surface rises in
the day time after absorbing radiation from the sun, and heat is sent upwards with the help
of convection; the atmospheric temperature decreases with increasing altitude. At night,
owing to the cooling radiation from the ground surface, the ground temperature decreases
rapidly, leading to a temperature inversion structure. When the sun rises the next moming.
and ground temperatures rise, the temperature inversion near the ground disappears, but
the night temperature inversion structure can still exist, which leads to a lifting inversion of
temperature.
Figures 4.1-3 and 4.1-4 show the variation curves of temperature vs. height of near
ground layers during the field observation period in 1992. From the figures, we can see, in
summer time in the plant area, from 0:0 o'clock to 4:0 o'clock, the max. inversion layer of
temperature exists before sunrise. The temperature inversion near the ground can still last
for one or two hours after sunrise, and it is broken up and a lifting temperature inversion
begins at about 8 o'clock. At about 10 o'clock, the unstable structure of the lower levels
becomes stronger, and the inversion structure disappears completely. At dusk, inversion
begins again and becomes stronger and thicker.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
The daily change in temperature vs. height still follows the above mentioned trends in the
winter.
(2) Characteristics of temperature inversions
a. Frequency of temperature inversions
The statistical results of atmospheric field observations shows that the frequency of
inversions is 61. 1% during the observation period, in which half was radiation inversion
and half was inversion of the upper layers. The frequency of inversions in winter is 63.5%,
of which most are radiation inversions (Refer to Table 4.1-3)
Table 4.1-3
Frequency of inversions in the plant area
Season    Prospecting times       Inversion times       Frequency (%)
Summer   95                       58                    61.1
Winter    85                       54                   63.5
Table 4.1-4 and 4.1-5 show the characteristics of inversions in summer and winter and
daily changes in the plant area. From Table 4.1-5 we can see inversions near the ground
are formed mainly at dusk, the strength and thickness increasing with time to the
maximum value. The next morning, after sunrise, the ground surface temperature increases
quickly, the base of the inversion near the ground rises and a lifting inversion begins with
strength and thickness decreasing until it disappears at about 10 o'clock. Higher layer
inversions can occur in summer or winter.

4.1.1.3 Classification of atmospheric stability
The classification of atmospheric stability in the TuoKeTuo area has an obvious seasonal
variability. With atmospheric stability classifications (Table 4.1-6) made from the statistic
information of ground observations of the county meteorological station, we can see: i) in
winter, the static layer structure is Class E and F with a high frequency, the frequency of
unstable conditions is low; ii) in summer, the frequency of unstable conditions increases
and the frequency of static conditions decreases, iii) in spring and fall, the frequency of

4.1.1.4 Mixing layer height
Determined by atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics. there is a discontinuous
interlayer at the plant boundary layer, under which atmospheric turbulence is generally
stronger. This interlayer restrains the upward diffusion of pollutants from the lower layers
and makes them reflect downwards and spread. The atmospheric layer under this
interlayer is usually called the mixing layer, and it height is the mixing layer height.
See Table 4.1-7 for the recommended value of the mixing laver height under different
stabilities in the plant area, which is calculated according to the measured curve of lou
atmosphere exploration and reference to the Nozaki experience formula:
121                    0.169Ps

4.1.2 Atmospheric dispersion parameters
Atmospheric dispersion parameters of the power plant area are measured and obtained by
using the balance balloon which is also called zero lifting force balloon. The balloon is
filled with a mixture of air and brought to a certain height of release, where it is in a
condition of random balance and is displaced with atmospheric movements. The balloon
displacements reflect three dimensional atmospheric diffusion directly. The vertical and
horizontal diffusion parameters of the plant area are shown as follows:
Oz = Y2Xo2
where: ay--Horizontal dispersion parameter
csz--Vertical dispersion parameter
X--- the down wind distance from the source
yl,aI,y2,a2---diffiusion parameter related to stability
Table 4.1-8 shows the 'yl,al, y2, a.2 of the plant area according to the statistics of
observation data. The analysis of statistic results shows that the atmospheric parameters of
the power plant area are between the Briggs urban diffusion parameters and rural diffusion
parameters.

4.1.3 Dispersion model
According to the nature of the predicted atmospheric pollutant emissions and local
meteorological conditions, the Gaussian plume model for an elevated point source with
the boundary conditions of a mixed layer was used for prediction of the concentration of
sulfur dioxide. From analysis of the pollution meteorological characteristics, in summer
and winter, the low velocity wind frequency is less than 4 % at the altitude above stack
height (300 m), so calculation for low velocity winds were not made in this assessment.
4.1.3.1 Gaussian plume model of elevated point source
Taking the ground position of the stacks as the point of origin and average wind direction
as the X axis, the ground concentration at any point down wind of the pollution source is:

direction from the right lower corner is J and latitude direction is I. The coordinates of the
emission source are I=15-16, J=15-16, located at the center of the assessed area.
Owing to the smooth terrain in the assessed area, there is no topographic modification
made in this assessment.

See Table 4.1-D10 for plume rise parameters for Touketuo Plant A. According to the
calculations using the GB formula, the maximum concentration value of pollutants
discharged from Touketuo Plant A would occur under stability class C. When one boiler
is in operation burning design coal and check coal, the primary maximum concentration of
sulfur dioxide is 0.046 mg/m3 and 0.052 mg/m3 respectively, which is 9.2 % and 10.4 %
of the national standard grade II. The primary maximum concentration of suspended
particulate matter is 0.013 mg/m3 and 0.016 mg/m3 respectively, which is 2.6 % and 3.2
% of the national standard grade II; the maximum concentration point (GLC max) is 6876
m and 6930 m away from the point source respectively.

TOUKETUO POWER PLANT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
When the power plant is at planned capacity (6 x 600 MW), the primary maximum ground
concentration of sulfur dioxide is estimated at 0.203 mg/m3 (design coal) and 0.227
mglm3 (check coal), which is 40.5 % and 45.4 % of the national standard grade II.
(2)Daily average concentration
a. Selection of a typical day
Meteorological conditions observed during the field survey can be divided roughly into
two types of atmospheric conditions, system circulation and local circulation. The
characteristic of local circulation is that the direction of a low velocity breeze changes
between west and south during the day. When under the control of system circulation,
the wind is west (in winter) or south (in summer) with higher wind. Table 4.1-13 shows
the average wind direction, speed, stability and frequency at the height of 250 m-600 m in
ten typical days in winter and summer.

b. Prediction of daily average concentration of sulfur dioxide
The power plant will have a stack height of 240 m for flue gas emission. The temperature
of flue gas having a certain initial speed is much higher than that of the ambient
temperature, which produces the plume rise and increases the effective height of the stack.
Therefore the direction and speed of wind in the air above the stack has much more direct
influence on dispersion of atmospheric pollutants.
See Figures 4.1-5 - 4.1-7 for the predicted daily trends of ground concentration
distribution of sulfur dioxide from the project phase 1, based on the measured data of
wind direction, wind speed and atmospheric temperature above the height of stack. From
the figures we can see, the highest values of daily concentration of sulfur dioxide change

with wind direction. When a wind direction persists all day with a higher relative speed,
the highest daily average concentration of sulfur dioxide is at the downwind distance of 9-
10 km, with a center concentration of 0.0003-0.0101 mg/m3. This concentration is 6.7 %
of the national grade II standard (March 28th). When the wind speed is 2-5 m/s, most of
the pollutants from the power plant are accumulated in the highest ground level
concentration area about 2-3 km from the plant site (August 30th). When the wind
direction changes, it is possible to have multiple high concentration areas distributed in the
assessed area (April 5th). Maximum values of daily average concentration in this case are
0.0037-0.0326 Mg/M3 which are 2.5-21.7 % of the national grade II standard.
The distribution of daily ground SPM concentration of the power plant is sirnilar to that of
sulfur dioxide, the emission of the former is just 28 % of that of the latter. Therefor the
impact on air quality of suspended particulate from the power plant is much less than that
of sulfur dioxide.
At the planned capacity of 6 X 600 MW, the daily average concentration is 3 (three) times
of that of Phase 1.
4.1.5.4 Allowable sulfur dioxide emission rate of the power plant and the analysis of
allowable concentration in flue gas
Calculated according to "emission standard of atmospheric pollutant of coal firing power
plant" (GB13223-91), the highest allowable concentration of flue gas at the outlet of the
precipitator of the boiler of 2008 t/h from the power plant is 386 mg/m3(dry flue gas),
when burning design coal, the lowest precipitation efficiency of the precipitator for this
requirement is 98.88 %, when burning check coal, the lowest precipitation efficiency is
99.08%. Efficiency of the precipitator of engineering design is 99.76 %, when burning
design coal and check coal, the actual concentration of flue gas at the outlet of the
precipitator is i 00 mg/m3 (dry flue gas), which will meet World Bank standard (See Table
4.1-14).
Allowable sulfur dioxide emission rate is 26.867 tlh (design coal) and 27.341 tVh (check
coal). Actual sulfur dioxide emission rate of the first phase project of the power plant is
5.027 t/h (design coal) and 5.685 t/h (check coal), which is 18.7% and 20.8% of the
allowable emission rate. Actual sulfur dioxide emission rate of the planned capacity is
15.081 t/h (design coal) and 17.055 tAh (check coal), which is 56.1% (design coal) and
62.4% (check coal) of the allowable emission rate.(See Table 4.1-15 ).
The actual concentration of the fly ash in flue gas and actual ernission rate should be in
conformity with the stipulations of "For emissions standard of atmospheric pollutant of
coal firing power plant"(GB 13223-91) issued by the state, and World Bank guidelines.

(2) Analysis calculation concerning World Bank guideline for sulfur dioxide emission
Taking into account of the wide spread distribution of sulfur dioxide and potential
possibility of acid rain and the regulation of "World Bank Guideline for emission", sulfur
emissions must meet two independent standards (refer to Table 4.1-16 "Sulfur dioxide
emission standard"). Standard I mainly concerns background conditions and sulfur
content of fuel; Standard II concerns background conditions, local meteorological
conditions, topographic conditions and stack height. A certain quantity of desulfurization
is required to meet each standard. Calculation of the maximum requirement of
desulfurization should be made when allowable emissions are being defined. A proper air
quality model is required in Standard II to define the concentration increment.

Note:* Linear interpolation method can be used for the middle value between 5 and
100 ig /m3;
** Projects with any sulfur emission are not acceptable in this kind of area.
According to the measurement of air quality, the background concentration of sulfur
dioxide in TuoKeTuo area is very low. The measured average concentration of S02 at
the site is <50 .ig/m3; therefor TuoKeTuo is defined as an unpolluted area.
At Touketuo Plant A project phase 1, daily emission of sulfur dioxide is 100.54 t with
design coal and daily allowable emission of sulfur dioxide is 1 13.70 t with check coal. The
maximum annual average ambient air concentration contribution of sulfur dioxide from
design coal and check coal respectively is 14.5 I±g/m3 and 16.4 p.g/m3; just 29% and 33%
of the World Bank standard respectively.
In the plan for (6 x 600 MW) capacity of Plant A, the daily sulfur dioxide emission of
design coal is 301.62 t, and daily sulfur dioxide emission of check coal is 341.10 t, annual
average maximum concentration contribution of design coal and check coal is 43.5 gg/m3
and 42.9.Ig/m3 respectively. Therefore, sulfur dioxide emissions and the increment of
ground surface concentration caused in the assessed area are much lower than the limits of
Standard I and Standard II of the World Bank under the condition of no controlling
measurement adopted in the first phase project (2 x 600 MW) of Touketuo Plant A. So
desulfurization equipment is not needed according to the World Bank guideline for sulfur
dioxide emission. In the plan for 6 x 600 MW, the sulfur dioxide emission and the
increment of ground level sulfur concentration in the assessed area can meet the criteria I
and II of the World Bank sulfur dioxide emission standard as well.

4.1.5.5 Analysis of NOx emission
There is no regulation conceming NOx emissions in the existing national standards for
coal fired power plants. The NOx emission of the Touketuo Plant A is estimated (no
control) and compared with other power plants in China.
(1) Estimation of NOx production
According to the formula recommended by the Chinese Academy of Environmental
Research Sciences, the NOx emission rate of the power plant is to be calculated with the
following formula:

Note: The above calculation is based on the consideration of boiler without low NOx
burners
(2) NOx emissions of domestic power plants
According to the general investigation of boiler NOx emission of 59 representative boilers
of various power plants of our country carried out by the Xian Thermo-Engineering
Institute under Ministry of Electric Power in 1986-1987:
Pulverized coal-fired boiler with slag discharge in solid state: NOx concentration in flue
gas is 600-1200 mg/m3.
Pulverized coal-fired boiler with slag discharge in liquid state: NOx concentration in flue
gas is 850-1500 mg/Nm3;
Oil-fired boiler: NOx concentration in flue gas is 720-1680 mg/Nm3;
The conservative calculation data in the above table reveals that if no measures are taken
for NOx control, the ernission rate of TuoKeTuo Power Plant will exceed the upper limit
of the current emission standards for the domestic power plants.

NOx control strategy
Based on the calculation, the emission of NOx in the first phase of TuoKeTuo A has
exceeded the upper limit of emission standard for domestic large-scale power stations. As
new emission standards for coal-fired power plants will be followed and concentration of
NOx will be restricted, low NOx combustion technology will be used to control the flue
gas concentration of NOx to within the allowable value (see section 4.12 for further
details).

4.2 Impact on water quality
Impacts of effluent discharge on the environment are discussed below. Details of the
wastewater recycling and treatment systems are given in section 4.12.
4.2.1 Effect of wastewater discharge on the Yellow River
In accordance with the power plant design, the industrial wastewater and sanitary sewage
of the plant will be discharged to the Yellow River via drainage pipelines after being
treated to meet national and World Bank standards.
4.2.1.1 Wastewater discharge (1200 MW)
Both dry ash removal and hydraulic ash removal approaches were proposed in the
feasibility study. For the hydraulic ash removal alternative, the wastewater discharge
volume is 400 tfh, including 100 t/h sanitary sewage, 200 t/h cooling water blowdown
and 100 tfh acid & alkali wastewater.
For the dry ash removal alternative, the wastewater discharged is 700 t/h, including 100
t/h sanitary sewage, 500t/h cooling water blowdown and 100 t/h acid & alkali
wastewater.
4.2.1.2 Discharge route
A wastewater pipeline will be laid from the wastewater pump house at the site to the
Gengqinggou Canal on the bank of the Yellow River. Gengqinggou Canal will be dredged
in order to channel the drainage into the Yellow River.
Refer to the Figure 4.2-1 for the location of the point of discharge and a general view of
the receiving water course. The figure shows that the receiving course, or Lamawan
section, has a low gradient and is straight, with an average uidth of 600 m
4.2.1.3 Characteristics of discharge
As water quality of Yellow River must conform with the Standard of Category IUl in
"Standard for surface Water Environment Quality" (GB 3838-88), the discharge from the
proposed Power Plant is required to follow the Grade I of "Comprehensive Discharging
Standard for Industrial Wastewater (GB8978-88)" which applies to newly-built, extension
and reconstruction projects.
l(I) Industrial wastewater includes cooling water blowdown, effluent from the boiler acid
treatment system and sewage from the laboratory, etc. The principal pollutants are acid
and alkali, and will be discharged after being treated to meet the discharge standards for
pH.

(2) Sanitary sewage: the flow volume is 100 t/h; and the concentration of BOD5 is
approximately 30 mg/I, after treatment in the two-stage biochemical process.
(3) A volume of 10 tons of oil contaminated wastewater is discharged twice a month for a
one hour period. A petroleum concentration of 10.0 mg/A can meet the requirements of the
Grade I "Comprehensive Discharging Standard for Industrial Wastewater (GB8978-88)"
which applies to newly-built, extensions and reconstruction projects.
(4) Water quality at the discharge outlet of the power plant will meet the requirement of
the Grade I "Comprehensive Discharging Standard for Industrial Wastewater (GB8978-

Comparison with actual operational data of existing power plants shows that the quality of
the various wastewater streams at the discharge outlet would satisfy the control index of
the Grade I of "Comprehensive Discharge Standard for Industrial Wastewater (GB8978-
88)" which applies to newly-built, extension and reconstruction projects. It can be
estimated that no negative environmental impacts will result from wastewater discharged
into the Yellow River. The environmental protection requirement for the Yellow River is
thus satisfied.
4.2.2 The impact of ash leachate on groundwater
Both hydraulic ash removal and dry ash removal approaches are considered in two
proposed ash disposal areas, Fenyan ash disposal area, and Gaobashi ash disposal area
respectively. The preferred alternative is hydraulic removal. Dry ash removal system has
been discussed. Water used in this system is used only for wetting and mixing dry ash. No
ash water seepage would occur. Therefore, there will be no effect on quality of
groundwater around the ash disposal area.
88



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                          89
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Gaobashi ash disposal area is located on mountainous terrain. The hydraulic ash removal
alternative is proposed here. For the hydraulic ash removal alternative, the ash and water
slurry would be pumped to the ash disposal area, and clear water recycled in the ash
disposal system. The ash disposal area will be operated with a water cover on the ash to
control fugitive dust. If the ash disposal area were located on permeable soils without a
liner system, the phenomenon of phreatic water rising around the ash disposal area would
take place because of ash water seepage through soils and the dikes. The ash disposal area
can not be efficiently operated with losses from seepage and evaporation, in addition to
the requirement to maintain a water cover.
Material for the earth dam will be borrowed from the interior of the ash disposal area if
found suitable. If borrow from other areas is used, these borrow areas will be backfilled.
Groundwater modeling indicates that the ash disposal area would pollute groundwater
(see Annex 7). There are potable water wells within 500-1000 m of the disposal area.
Therefore, soil and groundwater pollution will be prevented by installation of a plastic
leachate liner. There are 4 potable water wells within 500 m- 1000 m of the proposed ash
disposal area. These wells are monitored regularly and monitoring will continue
throughout the life of the protect (see Table 3.6-13, wells Gaobashi, Mahuangtan,
Huwulangying.
Geotextile liner system
There is sufficient clay within most of the disposal area to provide a 300 mm minimum
base layer for the geotextile/ plastic liner. The liner material is in use internationally(Japan,
England, France, U.S., and others), and is 3-4 mr thick. In areas where a sand or clay
base is not available, a minimum of 300 mm clay will be spread as base material for the
liner. In order to prevent liner damage from construction and weathering a protective
layer of clay will be installed above the liner 300-500 mm thick. International experience
wkith these liner systems has shown that they are serviceable for 20-30 years, sufficient for
this project.
Runoff collection trench
A runoff collection trench will be installed around the perimeter of the ash disposal area,
water collected will drain to a sump, and be pumped into the ash slurry system.
The groundwater impact analysis of Gaobashi ash disposal area follows.
4.2.2.1 Selection of pollution factors
In the proposed project, all the water used in ash disposal shall be recycled, except for that
which evaporates or blown down from the system. The recycling rate is 50%. Make up
water for ash removal will be replenished with cooling tower blowdown. Water from the

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
rainfall collection trench is drained to a sump and put back into the ash slurry transport
system. The amount of water used in ash removal is about 1200 m3/h (2 x 600 MW). The
ratio of ash and water is 1:4.5-1:5.5.
According to ash leachate test results (see Annex 8) on coal ash of the Zhungeer coal
conducted by Imer Mongolia Electric Power Design Institute (IMEPDI), all parameters
can meet Class III for surface water quality and sanitary standards for potable water,
except for the pH value and concentration of fluorine in the ash leachate. Thus we chose
pH value and fluorine as major pollution factors for water quality impact predictions.
4.2.2.2 Survey of hydrogeologic conditions of Gaobashi ash disposal area
(1) Survey of Gaobashi ash disposal area
Gaobashi ash disposal area is located on a hillside, dams would be built on three sides and
the mountainside would form the fouth side. When hydraulic ash removal is used, the
dams will be built on several phases. There are two methods for building the dams, i.e.
making upper stages high or lower stages high. All the parameters of the ash disposal area
for these two methods are shown in Table 4.2-6.

Flow direction of ground water is affected by topography and the catchment water system.
The hydraulic gradient is about 2-5 %, flowing from northeast to southwest.
Groundwater in the area of the ash disposal area is recharged with seepage from upper
reaches, and precipitation.
Groundwater modeling results
The results of groundwater modeling indicate the need for a liner in the ash disposal area
The groundwater modeling results are shown graphically and explained below. Leachate
tests indicate that pH and flouride are the pollution parameters of concern, therefore,
modeling was carried out on these two parameters.
Figure 4.2-2-Figure 4.2-21 show the concentration of pH and flouride At the 5th year,
15th, 20th, 25th year in the lowest level of ash disposal area Taking rise in pH value of
0.5 ppm and rise of flouride concentration of 0.1 ppm as the criteria, we can see:
(1) The concentration of pH and flouride will rise as groundwater is affected by ash water
within the range of 500 m outside ash disposal area in 5th year.
(2) The dispersion zone of pollutants is approximately 0-1000 m from the 5th year to 10th
year .
(3) The impact area of pH value and flouride is steady and limited within the range of
1000 m basically from 10th to 15th year.
(4) From the 15th year to 25th year, the affected zone is limited within 1500 m.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Figure 4.2-22-Figure 4.2-31 show the vertical and horizontal distributions of pH and
flouride. At the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, years, under the worst case conditions.
(1) The concentration of pH and flouride will rise as groundwater is affected by ash water
within the rang of 700 m outside ash disposal area.
(2) The impact zone of pollutants is approximately 0-1000 m from the 5th year to the
10th year.
(3) The impact area of pH value and flouride is limited within 1200 m from the 10th to
the 15th year.
(4) Pollution quantity tends steady basically from the 15th year to 25th year. The impact
zone of pollutants is controlled with 1500 m.
(5) The dam is 500 m from Huhulangyeng at the closest point. So the leachate of the ash
disposal area would affect Huhulangying during operation period of ash disposal area
within 5 years.
4.2.2.3 through 4.2.2.6 (Void)
4.2.2.7 Engineering geology of Gaobashi ash disposal area (Section drawing for
Gaobashi Ash Yard Dam: see Fig. 4.2 AAA)
In addition to groundwater modeling, an engineering study of Gaobashi disposal area was
conducted to evaluate pollution potential. In feasibility study design of TuoKeTuo Power
Plant A, the survey department of North China Electric Power Design Institute carried out
a field survey during March to April, 1994 and completed "Engineering Geologic Survey
Report of Ash and Slag Centralized Transportation Station and Ash Disposal Area
Engineering of Houqipu (Gaobashi) on New Construction Project of TuoKeTuo Power
Plant A (feasibility)" in May, 1994. The report is summarized below.
According to the repon, six borings were made at Gaobashi, the total footage is 55.00 m
The maximum depth of borings was 10.00 m. The following field activities were
performed at ten deep wells: standard penetration experiments (11), undisturbed soil
samples (10), and disturbed soil samples (11).  In excavations (160m3) with maximum
depth of 4.0 m and total footage of 31.00 m, undisturbed soil samples (17), and disturbed
soil samples (2) were taken. The locations of sampling wells are shown on Figure 4.2-3 2.
Engineering geology sections from boring data are shown in Figures 4.2-33-4.2-40.
From Engineering geology section diagrams we can see that ground water level in wells
6,7,8,8',T4,K4,K1 is higher, depth is between 1.70 m-6.10 m.

Conclusion:
For the option of hydraulic disposal at Gaobashi, based on the site geology as surveyed, if
no measures are taken against seepage, the ash water would contaminate groundwater
around the ash disposal area.
4.2.2.8 Groundwater contamination prevention measures in the ash disposal area
According to the engineering geology reports (feasibility stage) on Gaobashi ash disposal
area and calculations of ash leachate impact on groundwater using a two dimensional
model, the conclusion is that ground water around the ash disposal area will be affected
after the ash disposal area is in operation for five years. In the design of Gaobashi ash
disposal area, therefore, a geotextile liner system will be installed to prevent leachate
contamination of groundwater.
Geotextile liner system
There is sufficient clay within most of the disposal area to provide a 300 mm minimum
base layer for the geotextilel plastic liner. The liner material is in use internationally
(Japan, England, France, U.S., and others), and is 3-4 mim thick. In areas where a sand or
clay base is not available, a minimum of 300 mm clay will be spread as base material for
the liner. In order to prevent liner damage from construction and weathering a protective
layer of clay will be installed above the liner 300-500 mm thick. International experience
with these liner systems has shown that they are serviceable for 20-30 years, sufficient for
this project.
The drinking water for the villagers will not be affected by the ash leachate with the
seepage prevention measures installed.
In order to monitor the potential impact of seepage water on the drinking water.
monitoring wells will be built around the ash disposal area.
4.2.3 Mitigation measures for wastewater
4.2.3.1 Wastewater treatment
Sewage and wastewater of the power plant will be treated as mentioned above. The
discharged industrial wastewater, oil-contaminated water, and sanitary sewage will be
treated and discharged only after meeting standards.
4.2.4 Water conservation measures of the power plant
(I) The cooling water of auxiliary equipment will be recycled. The cooling water of the
auxiliary equipment within the main building will be collected in pipes and drained to the

cooling tower pond, and then mixed together with circulating water, finally to be boosted
by circulating pumps for next cycle.
(2) When a demister is mounted on the cooling tower, the water loss caused by wind will
be reduced from 252.04 t/h to 126.02 t/h; a water savings of 50 %.
(3) Maximize cooling water recycling and minimize make up water usage.
a. The cooling water blow down will be taken as the water supply for wash water in the
coal handling system, water for dust removal, seepage of boiler wastewater, dry ash
wetting, slag removal and spray water to control fugitive dust in the coal yard.
b. Reuse of water recovered from the slag dewatering bin system in the dry ash removal
alternative.
c. Reuse of water from ventilation and air-conditioning in summer would be discharged
into the circulating cooling water system.
With these various water saving measures adopted for TuoKeTuo A, the water saved can
be used for plantation, spraying pond and beautification of the environment, etc. In this
way, the original situation of simplified structure and unitary species has been changed to
various species, high cover rate and better growth of plants. Thus the waste land will be
changed to oasis.
4.2.5 Conclusion of impact analysis on water quality
4.2.5.1 Analysis of impact on the Yellow River
(1) The sewage discharged by the power plant can meet the requirements of the Grade I of
"Comprehensive Discharging Standard for Industrial wastewater (GB8978-88)" which
applies to newly-built, extension and reconstruction projects It can be estimated that no
negative environmental impact will result from wastewater discharged into the Yellow
River. The environmental protection requirement for Yellow River can thus be satisfied.

analysis has been performned on the impact of releases of incompletely treated sewage
during startup and stabilization (section 4.11).
4.2.5.2 Analysis of impact of ash disposal area on groundwater
(1) The water resource of TuoKeTuo county will not be affected by ash water during
operation of Gaobashi ash disposal area.
(2) Without leachate control measures, when the ash water is stored at the lowest terrain
in the ash disposal area, the groundwater at the area of 500 m surrounding the ash disposal
area would be polluted by the ash water in 5 years. The area 1500 m surrounding the ash
disposal area will be polluted in the period of 15 -20 years. When the ash water is stored
at most unfavorable position, the groundwater in the area about 500 m away from the ash
disposal area and Huwulangying village would be polluted by the ash water in 5 years. The
area about 1500 m away from the ash disposal area would be polluted in the period of 15
-20 years. In accordance with these impact assessment results concerning groundwater
contamination potential a geotextile leachate liner system will be used.
(3) Monitoring wells shall be set up at a certain distance around the lower reach of the ash
disposal area in order to sample and analyze any impacts on groundwater on a regular
basis.
4.3 Noise impact analysis
4.3.1 Purpose of assessment
According to actual information about domestic generator units of the same type, the
noise impact regulation, after units (2 x 600 MW) are put into operation, can be predicted
and prevention measures shall be adopted based on local specific conditions. Noise control
requirements will be included in bid documents. Since noise is a localized phenomena, the
impact of 6 x 600 MW cannot be calculated at this time, since the noise level of the units
to be used is not known.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.3.2 Analysis of Noise Sources
4.3.2.1 Estimation of noise source
Estimation of noise level for the source has referred to actual data of noise level for
operation of 600 MW units in related power plant of the country (Yuanbaosha Power
Plant, Douer Power Plant). See Table 2.3-4 for the noise level of estimation for each noise
source.
4.3.2.2 Characteristics of noise source
(I) Noise sources where the noise level are greater than 100 dB(A), e.g. steam exhausted
outlet for boiler, exhaust outlet of air accumulator for air compressor, etc., are outdoor
intennittent noise sources. Steam exhaust valves of boiler only opens in case of boiler
start-up and overpressure in the boiler, while exhaust outlet of air accumulator for air
compressor only starts exhausting in case of excess air and overpressure in air
accumulator, so, neither of them has regulation.
(2) Other outdoor noise sources included cooling tower, main transformer, etc. have
larger volume and lower level of noise. Their levels are 82.2 db(A) and 79.9 db(A)
respectively.
(3) Level of noise for main turbogenerator, boiler and auxiliary equipment is higher and
about 90 db(A), but all these are indoor noise sources. Indoor noise will be mixed in the
shop and can be reduced by the shop structure. So, each separate shop can be considered
as an independent noise source.
4.3.2.3 Simplification of indoor noise sources
Wall of shop consists of homogeneous walls, doors and windows which are of combined
acoustical structure.
(I) Calculation of acoustical volume for combined wall
I) To calculate proportion of combined doors and windows area and homogeneous wall;
2) To calculate difference between acoustical volume of homogeneous wall and that of
door and window;
3) To find out loss of acoustical volume in calculation table of acoustical volume for
combined parts,
4) Total acoustical volume for combined walls can be got bx acoustical volume of wall
minus loss of acoustical volume.

4.3.3.2 Impact of continuous noise sources
Continuous noise sources include turbine house, boiler house, ID fan room, slurry pump
house, air compressor room, cooling tower and main transformer, etc.
We can see from Table 4.3-2 that outdoor noise level of turbine house, boiler house, ID
fan room, slurry pump house and air compressor room is relatively small due to acoustic
function of room structure, which does not exceed 65db(A). Therefore, it has little impact
on plant area and surrounding environment. Therefor, the only noise impact of cooling
tower and main transformer is discussed.
(1) Cooling tower
Two cooling towers, situated at the north of main building, are used for the first phase of
project. The distance between them is 210 m. It is 220 m to the north of plant area and
290 m to the west of plant area. Refer to Table 4.3-3 for distribution of noise.

Internittent noise sources mainly consist of steam exhaust outlet of boiler and steam
exhaust outlet for air accumulator of air compressor.
(1) Steam exhaust outlet of boiler
There are two groups of outlets that are located on top of boiler house. Refer to Table

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Noise and the 3600 MW installation: Since the estimates and measurements above refer
to distances nearly adjacent to the noise sources, they will apply to the 3600 MW phase,
should the same types of equipment be used. Equipment specifications will require
compliance with noise standards.

Two types of noise sources have higher noise level, longer dispersion distance and a wider
range of influence. Noise of steam exhaust for boiler, in particular, shall be reduced
respectively at distances of 1788 m, 3162 m and 10000 m to reach noise standard IV &
III of day and night values in the plant, which would exceed the scope of the plant area.
Noise at steam exhaust outlet for air accumulator can reach noise standard IV & III of day
value but it must disperse for a distance of 562 m in order to reach the night noise
standard, which would exceed the scope of the plant area. These noise sources will be
treated with attenuators.

4.3.5 Noise Prevention Measures
4.3.5.1 Control of noise source at steam exhaust outlet of boiler
The main noise source of this project is the eftlux noise caused by steam exhaust of the
boiler. Control of the noise at this place can avoid exceeding the noise standard. Silencers
based on the principle of "throttling and pressure dropping" and "spraying of small hole"
can be used for this noise. After silencer is mounted, the noise level is 93-100(dbA). Due
to factors such as air absorption and reduction by distance, etc., it would not have major
impact on the surroundings. Furthermore, after normal operation of units, times and
period to open and close for boiler steam exhaust and safety valve shall be reduced, having
little impact on the noise envirornment.

4.3.5.2 Simultaneous control of other noise sources
Other noise sources to be controlled include Turbine house, Boiler house, Air compressor
room, etc.
With regard to prevention of these noise sources, selection of equipment shall be first
considered to meet the requirement, and meanwhile double-layer lighting acoustical glass
and door shall be adopted. Other measures will include vibration reduction of equipment
foundation, amortization of piping, mounting of muffler at draining outlet, reduction of
leakage for valve, provision of acoustical room in duty room, etc
Noise control standards can be met by taking measures for other noise sources to
rinimize the noise in this project. In this way, it shall not pollute the environment.

Fugitive dust is released in the process of coal unloading from trains, coal stacking in coal
yard and coal piling and fetching activities in order to control fugitive dust, a spray system
will be installed.
4.4.2.1 Unloading coal from trains
The coal is unloaded by bottom-dump, the flying dust is caused by the wind during coal
unloading process when the coal falls due to the effect of gravity.
4.4.2.2 Coal stacking
Influenced by the surface wind of coal yard. Flying dust is caused by mechanical force of
coal stacking and fetching extractors.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.4.2.3 Stacking and reclaiming
The coal layer containing moisture is destroyed during coal handling processes. The dust
on the surface of new coal layers will be subjected to wind and result in fugitive dust
emissions.
Under normal working conditions, the fugitive dust caused by mechanical coal fetching
and coal falling in the coal yard will take place continuously. The amount of fugitive dust
depends upon the moisture contained in the coal and the wind speed, in addition to the
grain diameter of coal & dust and working conditions (see Para. 4.4.3 for an analysis of
fugitive dust emissions).
103



4.4 Comparative Investigation and Analysis of Flying Dust Impact of Coal
Yard
4.4.3 Features of emission source for coal dust
4.4.3.1 Grain diameter of coal dust
The portion of coal dust sized under 200 to 250 plm is considered to be the
source which affects coal yard and its surroundings. The coal dust of bigger size
is not considered as source. Its spreading distance is near emitting source which
is only tens of meters or less caused by turbulent flow and falling effect of
gravity.
4.4.3.2 Moisture content contained in coal
According to American Standard of Testing Method for Dust (ASTMD 547-41),
the test conducted for one kind of coal under range of conventional wind speed
shows that the amount of flying dust appears in e exponential decay relation with
the moisture content increases. When the moisture content increases from 1%
to 7%, the amount of flying dust decreases 90% accordingly. In natural
conditions, it is proper to set the 8% moisture content as dust-holding upper
limit.The moisture content on the surface of coal layer will be secured by the
spraying facilities of coal yard.
4.4.3.3 Wind speed causing dust flying
Starting wind speed is defined as critical one which does not result in dust flying
of the coal pile. The minimum wind speed which makes the dust flying is defined
as dust flying speed.
The impact on the surroundings by fugitive dust is mainly caused by the surface
wind except of which caused by mechanical activities. The tests results are listed
in Table 4.4-2 for the starting wind speed of coal pile surface with 50-30 pm
grain diameter of coal dust by flume test. The Table shows that starting wind
speed is in direct ratio relation with moisture content of coal pile and the grain
diameter. The starting wind speed is above 3m/s for different sizes of coal dust.
In general, the flying dust speed is 10 % higher than starting wind speed.

The statistics results of surface wind direction and wind speed materials in many
years in Tuotetuo show that the annual frequency is 42.13% when wind speed is
less than 1.0m/s(including static wind frequency 23.50%),the annual frequency
is 27.69% when wind speed is 1.0-2.0m/s, the annual frequency is 16.50%
when wind speed is 2.0-3.0mIs, the annual frequency is 12.85% when wind
speed is 3.0-6.0m/s the annual frequency is 1.05% when wind speed is more
than 6.0m/s. It is obvious that the annual frequency is the highest when wind
speed is less than 2.0m/s in TuoKeTuo. According to the test results in Table
4.4-2, relation between starting wind speed on mimic coal pile surface and grain
diameter ,the starting wind speed is defined as 3.3m/s, the annual frequency of
the flying dust caused by wind is 14% during operation of coal yard. In addition,
according to meteorology statistics information of meteorological observatory
station in TuoKeTuo county, the annual strong wind is 7 days (wind speed is
more than 17m/s) in this district and the annual sandstorm is 11 days. In such
specific meteorology conditions, the measures shall be taken in time during coal
yard operation such as increase the time and number of spraying water, keeping
moisture content in the surface of the coal pile in coal yard so as to minimize
the dust flying.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.5 Comprehensive utilization of ash and slag
The total amount of ash and slag produced by all national power plants is 7,982 x 104
tons, but the amount used in secondary applications (utilization) is 2,547 x 104 tons (rate
of utilization is 32 %). It is predicted that the total amount of ash and slag in 1995 will
reach 110 million tons, an increase of 37.8 % over 1992. The amount of ash and slag
currently utilized is 3,400 x 104 tons (rate of utilization is 30.9 %). It is predicted that the
total amount of ash and slag in 2000 will reach 153 million tons, an increase of 91.7 %
over 1992, and the amount of ash and slag utlized is 4,500 x 1  tons, a utilization rate of
29.4%.
With the rapid development of power plants, the amount of ash and slag will increase by
a large margin, and the task of omprehensive utilization of coal ash will be extremely
difficult.
According to document No. 89, otice regarding discussion of creating conditions for
comprehensive utilization of coal ash of new, extending, rebuilding projects, issued by
the Electric Design Institute in 1994, the comprehensive utilization of coal ash shall use
suitable measures for local conditions and a varietv of technologies. An alternatives
investigation will be conducted by Touketuo Plant A according to the policies of
combining storage with utilization.
Comprehensive utilization of ash and slag is not limited to building materials; it can be
used to pave roads, and improve soil. TuoKeTuo Power Plant A will develop works
according to the needs of construction work in the power plant area.
In the design of TuoKeTuo power plant A, the outlet for comprehensive utilization of ash
and slag has been considered in the altemative for dry ash removal, but the outlet has not
been considered in the alternative for hydraulic ash removal. The ash silos and
dehvdration ash bin will be provided with outlets for the comprehensive utilization of ash
and slag in accordance with investigation and study results.

4.6.2 Environmental survey of railway route
4.6.2.1 Railway alingment
The special railway is located in the west of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and
runs from WangGuiYao station centre on the FengZhun line and passes through
WangGuiYao, LanJiaYao, TaKe, and WangYuYing to the YanShanYing Plant site.
4.6.2.2 Environmental survey
(1) Topography and geomorphology
The region through which the line passes is mainly in the lower and medium mountain
district with a height above sea level between 1000-1350 meters. The greater part is
covered with loess. River erosion is relatively severe, and V-shaped gullies and box
canyons have formed in large numbers with depths of 10-30 meters. Bed rock is exposed
in some of them. Deep gullies and canyons are crossed along the railway line. Alluvial and
lake plains surround the power plant site, where there is flat terrain.
(2) Geological structure
The railway line passes over red mudstone strata. New loess is distributed widely along
the whole line. Some areas around power plant are salinized.
(3) Hydrology and hydrogeological characteristics
This railway is located on the eastern bank of the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia and
belongs to the Yellow River system. The streams in all local gullies and channels are
seasonal, with the exception of the main channel of the Yellow River The flood season is
between July and September. In the rainy season, floods are charaterized by their short
duration and sudden rise and fall of floodwaters. Groundwater in the southeast plain of
TuoKeTuo county is found at depths of 3-10 meters. Confined aquifers are found below
50 meters. Groundwater in the foothills and mountain areas is found in bed rock fissures
with little storage volume.
(4) Earthquake intensity
The area is classified 7 on a national standard scale for earthquake damage intensity. This
standard is used in design of the railway.
4.6.2.3 Social environmental survey
This railway line is located south of Huhehot city which is in the west of Inner Mongolia.

.Four stations are set up for this railway project, WangYuYing station acts as operating
imechanical service section, LanJiaYao station as a turnaround depot for locomotive
auxiliaries. Railway type is determined as electric locomotive. The pollution on railroads
mainly comes from the noise and whistle of running trains as well as "solid, liquid and gas
waste " which are discharged by industrial and domestic facilities at all stations and depots
along the line. The running train is defined as a moving pollution source. Industrial and
domestic facilities of all stations and depots along the line as well as standstill trains are
defined as continuous pollution sources. The pollutants include waste gas, waste water,
waste slag and noise.

4.6.3.3 Mobile pollution sources
The noise of running trains is regarded as a moving source which propagates out in a
columnar shape along two sides of the line, its intensity decay is comparatively slow and
the affected distance is relatively long. The transient noise level at a point 30 m may reach
84-87dB when the train travels at a speed of 70-1 10 kn/h.
The traveling of trains on tracks corresponds to the running of objects on the surface of
elastic media. Thus vibration remains in the range of microvibration will be produced and
will exert no bad effect on the safety of buildings nearby or human health.
This railway line is designed for electric-powered traction which will cause an
electromagnetic interference at nearby wire and wireless communication facilities,as the
train passes.
4.6.4 Pollution mitigation measures
4.6.4.1 Atmosphere
Due to the oil-firing of internal combustion locomotives and the coal-burning of boilers,
the flue dust and waste gas will be exhausted and can pollute the ambient air. During
selection of boilers, the equipment with flue elimination and dust collecting efficiency
above 85% will be provided. All stations, depots and residential areas will be landscaped.
4.6.4.2 Surfacewater
The oil contaminated industrial wastewater at Lanjiayao station and Wangyuying station
will be treated in a horizontal oil separation tank. The wastewater containing lead and acid
will be treated by chemical methods. The sanitary sewage will be treated in septic tanks or
anaerobic filter tanks.
4.6.4.3 Waste slag treatment
Waste slag on this line mainly relates to slag accumulated at TaKe station and
WangYuYing station, discharged from coal-burning industrial and domestic boilers. Such
slag will be used as building material after centralized treatment.
4.6.4.4 Noise vibration
It is recommended that elastic track structure should be adopted in order to reduce noise
pollution. Long rails should be replaced and the whistling portion of the line will also be
controlled after a start-up period.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Trees will be planted along two sides of the line and around the stations and depots so as
to reduce the noise of running locomotives and trains.
4.6.5 Impact of railway construction on natural environment and measures to be
taken.
4.6.5.1 Line
A major section of this line is characterized by deep excavations, from Lanjiayao to
Qianzaigou, and will destroy the natural state of the mountain, which is mainly composed
of loess and mudstone. Grouted slice stones will be used along the cuts in order to
maintain slope stability. In the design of Honghekou Bridge, the arch should be as high as
possible so as to keep water flow direction unchanged and to prevent the river water from
eroding the mountain base.
The terrain along the line from TaKe station to power plant is flat. The special line should
be kept away from economic crop zones. The irrigation canals for water conservancy
should be passed through culverts. Those canals obstructed by the railway line should be
compensated reasonably, and payment should be made for the reconstruction of irrigation
canals.
4.6.5.2 Bridges and culverts
There are II different size bridges and 160 small culverts along this line. The majority of
flood drainage bridges and culverts are located at natural river trenches. The trenches with
low flows and specially difficult utilization should be re-built. The bridge arches with
larger oblique angles should be enlarged properly. In this manner, floods should be
maintained at natural levels so as to reduce the impact on upstream and downstream
beaches.
4.6.5.3 Tunnels
The vegetation around tunnels at TaKe station is sparse and gullies form a criss-cross
network. The windblown loess and sandy clay beneath are very easily eroded. Disturbance
of should be restricted. Paving protection is conducted after dug slopes and gutters are
built properly. Protective treatment should be made for those active gullies around the
exits and entrances of tunnels.
Since slag from tunnels is generally dumped into trenches or onto the slope, slag walls
should be biult along the side of trenches. Vegetation will be planted on the slag surface to
improve the ecological environment and to prevent the water and soil erosion.
The ditches inside tunnels may be connected with dug trenches or existing ditches outside
the tunnels, so that water from tunnels is drained into them in order to prevent water from
overflowing to the farmland and polluting surface water.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
A tunnel exit is close to TaKe Village, here the mechanical equipment only should be used,
and blasting should be avoided construction so as not to disturb the inhabitants.
4.6.5.4 Machine service and trains
Wangyuying Station on this line will be provided with one operation and maintenance
shop having service facilities for internal combustion locomotives and electric
locomotives. In the shop there are oil depot, sand storage chamber, servicing rails and
devices for diesel and electric locomotives. The oil contaminated sewage from oil tank,
grease chamber, and locomotive inspection pit on servicing rail should be treated in a
horizontal oillwater separation tank. Grinders should be equipped with dust collection
devices. A check-up point will be also built at WangYuYing station. Wastewater
containing lead and acid shall be treated by chemical methods. Trees and flowers will be
planted on the open ground at those points to improve the environment.
4.6.5.5 Water supply and drainage
Impact of railway water usage on groundwater resources
The areas along the railway are sparsely populated, and the water volume required for
industry, railway and mine is very small. So the overall impact on local groundwater is
rnegligible.
]Railway sewage discharge and treatment
Small amounts of oil contaminated industrial waste water will be discharged from
WangYuYing station and LanJiaYao station (only when leakage occurs) and will be
treated in a horizontal oiVwater separation tank. Waste water containing lead and acid
fTom check-up point at WangYuYing station will be treated by chemical methods. The
treated waste water will be discharged into a seepage pit.
The septic tanks and anaerobic filter tanks will be arranged at all stations Part of sanitary
sewage will be treated through the septic tank and then discharged into a seepage pit. The
remaining part will be treated by anaerobic filter tank and then discharged into local
surface water.
4.6.5.6 Stations
I'he four stations, namely WangGuiYao, TaKe, LanJiaYao and WangYuYing, will be set
up along this line, among which WangYuYing station serves as an industrial station, the
rest are intermediate stations.
The following measures will be taken in the design of stations in order to reduce the
irnpact of the railway on the surrounding environment.



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
(1) The roads in the areas of stations should be provided with overpasses or other suitable
and safe means to guarantee convenient and safe travel for residents.
(2) Two sided drainage slopes will be set up at stations so as to make drainage
unobstructed.
(3) This line is located in a very windy and dusty region. Trees and grasses should be
planted at stations for the purpose of windbreak and sand fixation, reduction of noise and
environmental beautification.
4.6.5.7 Power supply for electric train
One electric trailing substation will be built at TaKe station. Transformer oil will be
discharged into an underground oil storage tank. The waste oil will be sent to a treatment
facility. These will be new transformers, and no PCB transformer oils will be used. The
transformer is installed in the power substation. The noise will not cause an impact on the
surrounding environment.
4.6.6 Impact of railway construction on ecological environment and measures to be
taken
(I) This railway, which is characterized by ditch and valley, has a varied topography and a
steep-slope riverbed. So the excavated soil should be used for filling ditches during
construction in order to avoid unnecessary excavation of the mountain side and maintain
slope stability.
(2) A section of this line will pass through loess area where an economic zone and gullies
are developing. In these sensitive areas the railway line will be routed so as to reduce
occupying land and to protect farmland.
(3) Bridges and culverts on this line are laid out according to natural river channels. The
span of arches, and culvert size should be greater than the width of main river channels.
Diversion dykes and large diversion channels should not be built. Water flow in the river
channels should be kept in natural the state as far as possible so as to reduce impacts on all
existing irrigation facilities built along the river. Bridges and culverts should be designed
so as to guarantee the original function of irrigation facilities.
(4) The sand ground and sand dunes should be delineated and excavation of earth
prohibited in order to protect the original vegetation in these fragile areas.
(5) Those pits and waste piles remaining at the stations should be immediately leveled after
construction. The trees shall be planted upon completion of construction.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
(6) Landscaping should be carried out in areas such as the roadsides and around houses in
the district of stations.
(7) Trees will be planted along two sides of the railway line within the right of way.
(see Chapter 9 for land use and compensation details).
4.7 Impact analysis of power transmission lines
4.7.1 Impact analysis of electromagnetic field intensity
When human beings or animals are exposed to high voltage electrical fields, a "steady-
state" current flows through the body or a corona spark discharge is produced. In
addition, hair irritation, tetinus and stabbing face pain may be experienced. What is called
"field effect" means only those reactions which are in connection with field intensity where
people are present but not in connection with current. The seriousness of the effect will be
decided by field intensity.
Research on EMF effects has been done in many countries. According to Ultra High
Frequency (UBF) Plan, sensory reaction tests on humans in the strong electric fields have
been conducted under test lines. The results of tests showed that 1 0 % of persons begin to
be sensitive in a field intensity of 10-15 KV/m (the field intensity indicated in this section
means effective values). When the field intensity reaches 15-25 KV/m, reactions such as
hair irritation and stabbing pain within the body (especially arms) and sensed by a small
number of persons. If no spark discharge occurs when ground field intensity is up to 25
KV/m, a person has no harmful abnorrnal reaction. When repeated spark discharges occur,
persons feel oversensitive and to weak to continue work. However, repeated spark
discharge generally don't take place under normnal working conditions or below power
transmission lines. Even if it occurs accidentally, the human response will be of short
duration, with recovery in the first day. US investigators have made systematic studies of
persons who have worked for many years in strong EMF fields, such as live line inspectors
and maintenance personnel for UHV power transmission lines. Negative health effects
were not disovered. To date there is no evidence of negative health effects from exposure
to electrostatic fields of power transmission lines and power substations.
The research conclusions of the Water and Electricity Bureau of Quebec and Water and
Electricity Research Institute of Quebec in Canada, showing interference from the
electrostatic field below power transmission lines and in power substations produces direct
biological effects have been made without good basis. The only direct influence is that
stabbing pain and sensitivity on a person's scalp is be perceived, and this sensation
shouldn't be seen as an unfavorable bioeffect, though continuous inductive alternating
current, especially inductive impulse current of very short duration, would have effect.
Neither the continuous alternating current nor the discharging impulse current possess the
strength to cause direct physiological injury, but these will cause painful sensations more



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                        113
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
or less. Under unfavorable conditions, continuous inductive current may reach drop-away
current. The painflul sensation caused by inductive alternating may lead to stress reactions.
The term "stress reaction" reflects the following fact that a series of reactions will be
produced in the organism for any strong actions on human beings and animals (such as
happy or unhappy). Among these reactions some will be immediately observed, for
example adrenal gland increase, but maybe thymus gland and lymphatic gland decrease.
According to the different type, strength of actions and different characteristics of objects,
other kinds of reactions may also be observed, e.g. ulcer aggravation, nervous reaction,
impotence etc. It may be acceptable if strong noise or electric shock occurs only
accidentally. However if they repeatedly occur, a syndrome may develope.On the other
hand, thwe effect may be felt to be unacceptable at the beginning of exposure; but upon
aclimation, the syndrome will disappear gradually.
Researchers from West Germany tested personnel using field intensities up to 30 KV/m.
This research did not concluded that any influence or harm was done to human health.
A proclamation was officially issued by CIGRE in 1980, which stated that "the assessment
of the danger from electricomagnetic fields was given too far to much importance in the
past," and declares that the field intensity of existing high voltage power transmission lines
does no harm to human health, and there is a large margin of safety for allowable electric
field intensity.
According to the domestic information, an electric field will be produced around the the
conductors when they are energized. For 500 KV power transmission lines, maximum
field intensity on the ground in the corridor is less than 9 KV/m . As compared with this,
field intensity of household electrothermal blankets is between 0.24 KV/m and 10 KV/m.
In addition, field intensity for power transmission lines will rapidly decrease as the distance
from the power lines increases. So the influenced range is limited.
With 500 KV power transmission lines, the short-circuit current experienced by persons at
ground potential is approximately 0.114 mA. For a woman of 55 Kg weight, the average
biological current is approx. 0.67 mA, for a man of 80Kg weight, it is about I mA. The
safe range of biological current for the human body is 5-30 mA. It is thus clear that
inductive current produced by the power transmission lines on the human body is far less
than average existing current. Therefore, an unfavourable influence on human health is
unlikely.
Voltage can be induced on human beings as well as objects by electric fields. Therefore if
large-sized objects nearby the HV power transmission lines (such as fences or other large
metal objects) are insulated from earth, then painfuzl electric shocks may result when a
person touches these objects at ground potential.  It is therefor stipulated in some
countries (U.S.) that all iron fence, metal structures and other metal objects should be
earthed within a fixed distance from 500 KV power transmission lines. The corresponding
fixed distance is normally in the range of 50 m, according to the type of object.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
The research results concerning influence on plant growth from alternating current shows
that the leaftips of certain plants will be injured slightly under the action of field intensity
15-20 KV/m. This is because the field intensity nearby conductiive pointed objects will be
enhanced greatly. When this field intensity reaches a certain level, corona effect may occur
and lead to heat build up and a withered leaftip. However, the circular section of the plant
will not be injured even under the action of field intensities of 50 mv/rn. In all plants,
including those with leaftips injured by corona effect, the growth speed and output is not
influenced.
4.7.2 Power transmission lines impact on bird migration
Midway rest stops are necessary for long range bird migrations. Generally the choice is
made for elevated positions free from human beings and other animal interference. Power
transmission towers and lines are ideal resting places for birds. Frequent perching on
towers and high voltage transmission lines will always result in deaths due to electric
shock, affect the normal breeding of birds and impact the ecological system. There are no
migratory bird flyways in the area of the transmission lines.
4.7.3 Impact analysis of transmission line corridors
The are no historical sites, scenic spots or tourist areas near the planned 500 kv
transmission line.  The right of way passes through farm  land and wasteland.
Transmission line construction will not have a negative influence on cultivation or an
unfavorable impact on land utilization.
4.8 Impacts of the water intake project
The analysis of impacts of the water intake project was undertaken to solve two major
problems: i) whether the natural environment allows location of the water intake mouth in
this area, and, ii) the impact of hydraulic engineering buildings on the natural enviroment
4.8.1 Baseline conditions of the river at the water intake
4.8.1.1 Flow and sediment
Upon the completion of large hydraulic and hydroelectric projects in the upstream reaches
of the Yellow River, including the Liujiaxia project, the sand content of upstream flows at
Toudaoguai was changed, the flow was reduced and the sand content was obviously
reduced. Water and sand flow, and sediment transport over the years have become
comparatively stable since the completion of Liujiaxia reservoir according to surveys. This
is favorable to stability of the river course.



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                        115
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.8.1.2 Geologic conditions of river bed
Most of the river section from Toudaoguai to Lamawan is covered with loose deposits of
the Quaternary Period and in some places stratum of the Tertiary Period are exposed.
Within the river section from Haojiayao to Putanguai, mudstone, with erosion-proof
capability, is exposed on the left bank of the proposed water intake mouth, while the right
bank is eolian deposit layers of fine silt and active sand dunes. At the base of the sand
dunes there is a sod layer which extends from the bank to river bottom with strong
erosion-proof capability. This mudstone on the left bank and sod layer on the right bank of
the river section forms a natural node. Therefore, it is an ideal water intake position.
4.8.1.3 River bed conditions
The river section from Toudaoguai to Shalahutan is located downstream of a bend in the
river. The river reach in the section of the intake structure has few changes and the water
course is comparatively stable and straight. The main flow is changed from right bank to
left bank.
Flow direction of the mainstream of the river course from Haojiayao to Putanguai has
large changes. The left bank of Putanguai is mudstone and the right bank is sod node. The
main channel in the wet season and average periods is close to left bank. The river bed of
this section forms a deep trough and becomes relatively ideal for a water intake mouth.
According to the analysis the above mentioned flow and sediment conditions, geologic
conditions of the river bed course and river characteristics, the natural environment of the
river course from Haojiayao to Putanguai is suited for location of a water intake structure.
The immediate surroundings of this location are suitable for water intake structures and
treatment facilities as well.
4.8.2 Impact of hydraulic engineering buildings on environment
4.8.2.1 Effect of dredging project on river course
Layout of dredging project refers to Diagram 4.8-1.
Based on the analysis for the purpose of dredging project of river course, the hydraulic
engineering buildings of this project have an influence on the nature of the river course, by
preventing erosion, and controling the main channel, as well as stabilizing the river course
so that the left bank cannot be eroded, and ensuring the safety of people and properties in
this area. These influences are advantageous.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.8.2.2 Impact on siltation
As inferred from the result of a backwater siltation analysis perforned by Wuhan
hydroelectric college, (physical model), the water intake buildings have little influence on
both variation of water bed, flood control and drainage. Sedimentation and return water
caused by construction of the water intake buildings is limited and cannot result in
damage, i.e. having little influence on the environment. The design scheme is reasonable.
Refer to Diagram 4.8-2 for a sectional view of water intake buildings.
4.8.3 Impact of cooling water intake settling basins on groundwater
4.8.3.1 Geologic conditions
Three strata are found within the excavation area for the settling basins. The bottom layer
is tertiary Pliocene lateritic mudstone (laterite) in half-rock status. The geologic condition
is comparatively uniform, compact and hard plastic with good water-proof properties. The
middle layer is quaternary intermediate-lower Pleistocene lacustrine deposit with
horizontal layers. The main content is green clay with fine silt lens in some places. The
clay is in plastic-hard plastic status. The upper layer is quaternary Holocene alluvial
deposit, in which the top layers are brown clay with stable and continuous distribution of
loose structure and in plastic-hard plastic status while the bottom layer is fine silt with
loose structure and uniform particle classification and saturated.
4.8.3.2 Infiltration
The following formula is used to calculate infiltration of reservoir:

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
q--- Infiltration of unit width (m3/d.m)
The calculation shows that the infiltration per width (q) is q=l .8m3/m.d which is similar to
actual values of fish pond infiltration.
The surface clay on north side of water pond is relatively thick and can be used for
preventing infiltration after being rolled. The same case lies on east side of water pond, the
clay is thick and water-proof, Groundwater level at the east platform toe (with spring
water elevation of 999-1003 m) is higher than the design level of the water pond.
Therefore, no permnanent infiltration would occur on the east and north sides. Only
infiltration on the south and west sides shall be taken into account.
Length of infiltration section on west and south sides of water pond is 2280 m and 100 m
respectively, and the total infiltration volume of the calculated section is 4284 m3/d.
Total annual infiltration volume is
W= t x q = 365 x 4282 = 1.564 x 106m3
4.8.3.3 Immersion
Problems of saline soils on the east of the water purification plant area have existed before
construction of fishponds.  As per existing survey information, after completion of
fishponds for storing water, salinization problems occured within 300-500 m on the west
side of the fishpond. Therefore, drainage works outside the dam of the water pond shall be
properly handled after the completion of the water pond to prevent the area of salinization
from enlarging.
Villages are distributed to the east of the water pond. Foundations of residential houses
are 988 m away and far away from the water pond. Consequently. drainage measures will
have little influence on residences.
4.8.4 Impact of water intake project on navigation
4.8.4.1 Conditions and plan for navigation of the Yellow River in TuoKeTuo
County
Just like navigation on whole main stream of the Yellow River, navigation capacity in
TuoKeTuo County is in decline. However, as a means of transportation, navigation of the
Yellow River TuoKeTuo section has its own characteristics and beneficial values.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
In the 1980s, long-distance freight transport was in gradual decline. Up to 1985, long-
distance freight had almost stopped after the completion and use of Lamawan Bridge.
4.8.5 Impact of hydraulic engineering buildings on navigation
Buildings of the water supply project that may affect navigation include water intake
buildings such as water intake piers, pile weir, backwater gate, etc. and water course
dredging projects.
Water intake pier is the main building at the beginning of the water intake. It is located on
the main channel (See Diagram 6.3-2) which is 50 m away from the left bank, the deck
size is 9 x 28 meters.
We can see from Diagram 6.3-2 that the water intake pier is 6 m above water level. The
water course for about 60 m, from the left bank to the main flow zone would be occupied
by water intake facilities. In addition, it would occuppy the main channel of this river
section. Therefore, it would be difficult for selection of passage ways for ships. However,
design of water intake buildings has taken into account the navigation requirements in the
feasibity study phase and reserved space for navigation on the right side of the water
intake pier, so the adverse effects on navigation caused by the water intake buildings are
insignificant.
4.8.6 Submergence and land acquired
Submergence and land acquired means land dredged for the water intake pond, and
occupied by the water purification, delivery and discharge projects. The discharge will
travel by pipeline to an existing water channel to the Yellow River downstream of the
intake structures.
'Water pond only occupies a used fishpond. It will neither occupy cultivated land nor cause
moving of houses. The submerged land has no vegetation except some plants such as
Achnatherum splendors (Trin.) Nevski. Therefore, it has little influence on local residents
Layout of water purification project, excluding sludge discharging yard, covers an area of
9.6 km2. It will occupy as little cultivated land as possible and make full use of
wastelands. There are few plants or trees on the occupied land and they will not be
dcestroyed during the construction of the water purification project. Therefore, it has little
influence on the natural ecology.
For the water delivery pipe, the depth buried will be under the frozen soil layer, so it is
unnecessary to consider the influence of occupation. It will only occupy cultivated land
temporarily during construction.
(see Chapter 9 for land use and compensation details)

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.8.7 Impact of water intake project on environment
4.8.7.1 Main beneficial impacts
The beneficial impacts of the water intake construction project on the natural environment
can be regarded as: i) stabilization of the water course; ii) strengthening the bank slopes
of the water courses near Dongying village from scouring by the Yellow River; iii)
improving the safety and protection of properties and agricultural production of local
residents from the flood damage of the Yellow River. The beneficial impact is significant
with respect to both the natural and social environment.
The water supply project will benefit navigation due to stabilization of the water course
and channel. Vertical and side infiltration of the water pond would have no effect on
ground water and salinization of soil.
4.8.7.2 Main adverse effects
Environmental impact of silt treatment is the main adverse effect Sediment disposal yard
covers an area of 71.3 ha; dry silt will be stacked at this area 3.4 m high. If no mitigation
measures are taken, in time it will surely become a pollution source. Therefore, great
attention shall be paid to environmental impacts of silt treatment, and necessary mitigation
measures shall be taken, such as planting windbreak forests, and improving the properties
of the silt, to enable planting of grasses, trees and crops. In addition, silt can be developed
into rich soil to minimize the adverse impact on navigation.
Hydraulic engineering buildings may adversely affect navigation. This mainly refers to the
fact that the water intake pier and auxiliary buildings will narrow the navigable water
course by 60 m, which will affect the selection of passage. Location of passage way has
been reserved in the design. However, small boats are used for shipping in TuoKeTuo
County that do not pass the water intake building site Therefore, it has little adverse
effect on the navigation.
4.9 Ecological environmental impact assessment
4.9.1 Main impact factors of construction of the power plant
TuoKeTuo A is coal-fired power plant, and its impact on the ecological environment
during operation mainly involves flue gas emissions: the main pollutants include S02,
NOx, SPM & flourine. A large amount of ash and slag will be generated from the
electrostatic precipitator and boiler bottoms. There is a potential for groundwater
contamination from the ash disposal area. Regarding pollutants discharged from the
power plant, control of the total amount of pollutants generated by the plant has already
been considered in the design and construction plans for the power plant, which will keep
pollutants released to the surrounding area at the lowest economically and technologically
feasible level. The direct impacts caused by operations can be negligible.



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                        123
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.9.2 Ecological impact
Civil works during construction of power plant such as the ash disposal area, living
quarters, roads, and pipelines will require excavation, earthwork transport, and mechanical
work. The construction project will result in an increase in local population. Construction
activities will destroy or damage vegetation cover, thus affecting the habitat of some living
beings. Basical1y the area in the plant site and ash disposal area is a loose type of soil, most
of which is fixed or semi-fixed sandy land. There are even sand dunes in some places.
Vegetation includes poplars, shrubs of C. microphylla Lam. and weeds. Canopy density of
forests is relatively low and cover rate of grasses is less than 5 %. Since the climate in this
area belongs to semidry grassland, the main ecological environmental problem caused by
construction of the power plant is the drifting of sandy land due to damage to existing
vegetation. These impacts will be mitigated by revegetation of all construction areas (see
Chapter 5). In addition, a large capital soil conservation and desertification control
program is planned to coincide with project development. Resettlement and compensation
issues are detailed in Chapter 9.
4.9.3 Impact of pollution factors on ecological environment
(1) Flue gas
If concentration of flue gas from power plant exceeds certain limits, it will be potentially
dangerous for the soil-crop ecological system. Gaseous fluoride will increase fluorine
content in vegetation and have direct or indirect affect on human health. During blooming
periods of crops, S02 will affect fertilization.
According to the predicted results for ground concentration of atmospheric pollutants and
from the view of growth of vegetation, daily average ground concentration of S02 in all
typical days is very low or relatively low, and meets the requirements of GB9137-88
'Maximum Allowable Emission Concentration of Atmospheric Pollutants for Protection of
Crops' This standard refers to floufide and SOx For the most sensitive types of crop
grown in the assessment area, the (ambient air) standard for flouride is 5.0 pg per square
decimeter per day; and 1.0 gg per square decimeter per day average over the growing
seasyn. The SO2 standard for sensitive crops is 0.15 jg /m3, 24 hour average; and 0.05 p
g /m average over the growing season. This is the same as the Class II standard as well
as the World Bank standard used in this assessment. SOx will not impact growth of
vegetation, based on this, it can be inferred that concentration of other pollutants (e.g.
fluoride, hydroxide, etc.) is also within the scope of corresponding concentration,
therefore, no unfavorable impact will be imposed on the environment and ecological
system. High efficiency electrostatic precipitator will be used in the power plant, so
concentration of SPM will meet the requirement of allowable emission standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
(2) Ash and slag
TuoKeTuo Power Plant A is a large-scale coal-fired power plant with high coal
consumption and ash content, so the power plant will discharge a large volume of ash.
Ash disposal area of TuoKeTuo A will be a closed-cycle flow area with a leachate liner
system to prevent groundwater contamination. But in some special cases, e.g. in case of
heavy rain or thunderstorm, rain water will submerge the ash disposal area. Overflow ash
water will possibly harm soil and vegetation with alkali matters or other pollutants.
Therefore, a rainfall runoff drainage system is included in the design which will prevent
overflow ash water form affecting soil and vegetation. The collected runoff will be
pumped into the ash slurry water recycling system (for details see section 4.12).
(3) Industnral waste water
TuoKeTuo Power Plant A will discharge large volumes of waste water with complex
water quality. Industrial waste water will be treated in the process area where it is
generated without dilution to meet discharge standards before being released. In this way,
pollution of the soil-vegetation system due to distributed discharge will be reduced or
avoided (for details of wastewater treatment and recycling systems, see section 4.12).
4.9.4 Impact of construction of power plant on macroscopic ecological environment
4.9.4.1 Natural resources impacted by planned project
(1) Scenery and change of land utilization
Construction of the power plant will change present scenery composed of cultivated lands,
sparse forests and villages into that composed of modem towns and factories. The main
building, chimney, coal yard, ash disposal area and water tower will have influence on
natural scenery, especially the flue gas from chimney and water/steam discharged by the
natural draft cooling tower, which will be visible for several kilometers
Due to the land occuppied by the power plant (2 x 600 MW) to be constructed, cultivated
land in the assessment zone will be reduced by 0.12 %, and forests by 0.99%, and the land
occupied by factory or mine land will increase 1.18 %. Construction of the power plant
will make full use of land which otherwise difficult to develop.
(2) Loss of land resources
Table 4.9-1 shows the area and type of the land occupied by the power plant at the project
phase 1. The assessment for loss of land can be seen in Table 4.9-2.

The equipment designs for the next phases of development have not been made, therefore

(3) Impact on flora and fauna
There are 248 species in assessment zone which include 194 species of wild plants. These
plants are of common and extensively distributed species. Consequently, construction of
the power plant will neither result in local loss of native plant species, nor change
composition of plant species, nor result in extinction of species. There are few different
species of wild animals in the assessment area and those found use agricultural lanis for
habitat Even fewer species are distributed around the proposed power station site and ash
-disposal area The construction will cause emigration of some animal species without
resulting in a large change of their species composition or number of species More plant
species will exist after the completion of the power station due to landscaping and
beautification of the power station area, and some birds use the new vegetation for habitat.
(4) Impact on evolution of vegetation
A. Changes of vegetation around ash disposal area and plant area
The common characteristics of the two ash disposal areas and plant site are sparse
vegetation, low species diversity, and fixed or semi-fixed sandy soil. Gaobaoshi ash
disposal area is the worst with respect to structure and stability of vegetation. All original
vegetation within the ash disposal areas and plant site will be destroyed completely during
construction. Such factors as construction and transportation will also affect the growth of
vegetation outside ash disposal areas and the plant area. Water and wind erosion will be



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                       126
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
intensified because the final elevation of the ash disposal area will be 19-30 m higher than
the original ground surface. Growth of vegetation on ash disposal areas by natural
evolution is impossible. This will result in desertification of soil. Therefore, scientific and
stable vegetation around ash disposal area and plant area shall be established by The
Touketuo Plant environmental department on the basis of mastering the requirements of
adaptable vegetation.
B. Vegetation pattem changes in the regional environment
Construction of the power plant will occupy land which will result in unfavorable influence
in some places. However, if mitigation measures are taken during the construction, serious
problems can be avoided. Meanwhile we can conclude that construction of the power
plant will have a favorable influence locally: first, labor and capital investors will form a
great construction force; second, improvement of education and technology enables
peasants to improve the natural environment and enhance their own production
capabilities.
The demand for food such as meat, eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables will be increased with
growth in population for construction of the power plant. In this case, peasants will
change their original planting pattern, which is cultivation of grains to establishment and
protection of stable man-made summer green forests for development of forestry and fruit
trees; and establishment of artificial grassland and forage for development of animal
husbandry. Grain output can be increased by planting grass and crops alternately. In this
way, wind erosion and desertification will be reduced by means of the combination of
ecological environment improvement and economic development. Thus the expected
ecological impact would be positive.
4.10 Environmental impact analysis of power plant construction
4.10.1 Impact on social economy under local administration
The construction of TuoKeTuo Power Plant A will bring greater changes to the features
of social economy under local administration. It is always beneficial for this project to
analyze the power plant construction from the econormic viewpoint. TuoKeTuo county
and nearby villages and township enterprises will benefit from this project. First of all,
subordinate economic activities which result from the employment opportunity increases
will be reinforced. With the development of the local economy, the corresponding cultural
technology of peasants will be improved, which may improve the natural environment and
increase productivity. With the growth of the population related to the power plant and
the greater demand for non-staple foods such as meat, eggs, milk, fruit, and vegetables,
the peasants will transform their former cropping structure, which gave priority to grain
crops. The development of a diversified rural economy will be promoted.



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                        127
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Construction materials are in such great demanded for power plant construction, this
should promote the development of a local construction material industry and engineering,
and stimulate economic growth in the local area side by side.
4.10.2 Employment and labor forces
The large construction labor force (5,000 - 6,000 construction laborers, not including
temporary workers) required for power plant during construction may be recruited locally.
Hosts of idle manpower in rural areas around power plant may be utilized so that a great
number of employment opportunities will be provided,(see section 7.1.2).
4.10.3 Housing
The casual laborers employed for all stages of construction may be recruited locally, and
they have their own housing. Those regular staff and workers taking part in the power
plant construction will reside in the dormitory buildings for staff and workers (adequate
for 5,000-6,000 people) in the plant site. Power plant construction therefore will not exert
pressure on the local housing.
4.10.4 Public facilities and services
The highway traffic load from Huhehot to the plant site will be somewhat increased due to
weekend bus service, trucks for material transport and large pieces of electric equipment
transported to the power plant. However the traffic load increase on the highway will be
limited due to occassional usage. Most employees will commute between the power plant
and dwelling places during power plant construction. Moreover, a special road will be
built between the power plant and residential areas. There will be no need to use Huzhun
highway for staff and workers living in the residential areas in the plant when they travel to
work.
Cultural life and activities for construction personnel after workhours in the power plant
will have little effect on public facilities and service in the locality during plant
construction. The residential area of the plant is at a distance from county towns. The
recreational activities of staff and workers focus mainly on residential areas where dance
parties, ball room and chess games are often held in new self-built cultural palace, stadium,
club and cinema. The staff and workers are satisfied and given recreational opportunities.
A hospital and child-care centre for staff and workers will be established in the power
plant for staff and their family members. Most single staff and workers will settle in
.Huhehot city and can get back home every week. So they will not feel lonely. There will
be a labor union which will take an individual interest in the members.
4*.10.5 Impact on land utilization and the landscape
The utilization of existing land and land forms will be influenced during construction
period. The land will be excavated and piled, because necessary warehouses for storage of

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
equipment and materials as well as walls are to be built. The activities for building will
temporarily result in impact on the landscape. Therefore, protective measures have to be
taken by the contractors in order to minimize the impact and side effects on the
environment TuoKeTuo County Environmental Protection Bureau has juristiction for
supervision of environmental impact control measures during construction. The following
will be included in contractor bid specifications:
* Water and soil conservation measures shall include the preservation of
vegetation covers in the construction area.
* Reduction of soil exposure measures shall include the development of
temporary surface coverage to reduce the soil erosion.
* Management of construction garbage shall include the clean up of construction
garbage and related matters.
*  Compliance with the local and national regulations on security and health shall
include the legal and administrative construction regulation.
* Maintanance of the landscape on the construction site shall include the
greening and gardening work in accordance with design requirements.
4.10.6 Impact on sutface water quality

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.10.7 Impact on ecological system
The impact of construction of the power plant on the ecosystem shall mainly include the
damage and migration of vegetation groups, and separation, breakage and interference
with natural vegetation. Only some ordinary vegetation will be influenced in the
construction of Touketuo Plant A, such as salix Matsudana. Its loss shall have small
impact on the vegetation and varieties of habitat species for wildlife.
4.10.8 Impact on soil
After the transformation from farming and communal land to impervious buildings and
roads the infiltration of precipitation into soils will be minimized, and surface runoff will
increase. The impact will be quite small in TuoKeTuo area owing to the level plant site
and favorable infiltration properties of the soils. Moreover, the precipitation in this area is
small (395.2 mm) and would result in little impact.
4.10.9 Impacts on ambient air quality
During construction the unfavorable impacts on ambient air quality should be minimized as
much as possible; law and management requirements on atmospheric pollution control
stipulated by the state and local authorities should be strictly carried out. During the
construction period of the power plant, category II standard of BOILER ATMOSPHERE
POLLUTANT  DISCHARGE  STANDARD  GB3841-83  (300400  g.g/Nm3  SPM;
Ringleman Index Class I opacity) will be implemented for the flue gas emissions from
heating and drinking water boilers. Water will be sprinkled to moisten the ground surface
iin dry and windy seasons in order to prevent fugitive dust pollution and flue gas emissions
of construction machinery and vehicle exhaust will meet the relevant requirements for
hydrocaron emissions and carbon monoxide. Hydrocarbon, CO, NOx, and dust will
increase near the Huhhot-Zhungeer Highway and roads in plant area during the power
plant construction but with little impact.
4.11 Sanitary wastewater discharges during wastewater treatment plant start up
It is very important to prevent the water quality of the Yellow River from being polluted
since the Yellow River is one of major rivers in China. The waste water discharged by the
T-ouketou Power Plant A to the Yellow River can meet the requirements of the Grade I of
"Comprehensive Discharging Standard for Industrial wastewater (GB8978-88)" which
applies to newly-built, extension and reconstruction projects. Nevertheless, operations of
the sanitary sewage treatment facility may be experience process upsets in the initial
operation period, pTior to system stabilization, resulting in discharges of wastewater that
exceed the permited standards. Therefore, a risk assessment has been conducted
concerning impacts on the Yellow River from discharge of untreated sanitary sewage.

The wastewater discharged to the Yellow River will affect the water quality in some
sections of the river. A two dimensional mathematical model was employed to predict the
polluted zone.
4.11.1 Model of water quality
In accordance with characteristics of the Lamawan section of the Yellow River, a two-
dimensional mathematical model with vertical mean was adopted for calculation and
prediction of velocity of flow and concentration of pollutants.
Condition of simplification for model:
(1) Uniform distribution of flow velocity and concentration along with the
direction of water depth;
(2) Items of K force and wind stress in momentum equation are neglected,
(3) Diffusion coefficients in calculation area shall be of constants.

irregular boundaries, and has been used for the prediction and calculation of several
projects, and has given reasonable results.
4.11.2 Calculation conditions and parameters
(1) Analysis & determnination of calculation conditions
a. Quantity of sewage and waste water discharged from the power plant:
The discharged wastewater volume is 400 t/h with hydraulic ash removal scheme and 700
t/h with dry ash removal scheme.
b. Main pollution factors and discharging concentration
Based on the characteristics of discharged wastewater, BODs and CODcr are selected as
a major index for assessment of sanitary sewage.
The concentration of BOD5 in sanitary sewage is approximately 200 mg/l when two-
stage treatment process is not adopted. After mixing with other waste water discharged
BOD5 is 50.0 mg/l (400t/h) and 28.6 mg/I (700t/h) respectively. The distribution diagram
of polluted zone and its isoline enveloped area reveal that there exist two main factors
controlling the distribution scope of the polluted zone, namely, discharge concentration
and flow rate upstream in the river course.

4.11.3 Analysis results
The selected calculation area is the Yellow River at Lamawan section, indicated in Figure
4.2-1. The calculation area is about 5.0km long and 600m in average width with total area
of about 3.0km2. There are 858 irregular triangle units in the calculation network with
total joints of 529, including 4 oasis. Refer to Figure 4. 1 1 -1 for details.
Both average annual flow and monthly average lowest flow conditions are considered for
the prediction and calculation. Monthly average lowest flow is approximately 305 m3/s
with corresponding design water level of 984.93 m; average annual flow is approximately
725 m31s with corresponding design water level of 985.63 Sn Discharged wastewater Nor
dry ash removal and hydraulic ash removal are 0.194m /s (700 t/h) and 0.111 m /s
(400t/h) respectively. Initial wastewater discharge concentration will be Co(CODcr) =
100 mg/l and Co (BOD5 ) = 28.6 mg/l for dry ash removal, and Co (CODcr) = 100 mg/I
and Co (BOD5) = 50.0 mg/I for hydraulic ash removal.
Based on the analysis for existing monitoring data collected upstream of the discharge
piont during dry the season, the background concentrations of CODcr and BOD5 are
11.67 mg/i and 2.94 mg/I respectively.
Refer to Figure 4.11-2 for the prediction of flow velocity for average annual flow and
monthly low flow conditions.
The distribution results of the pollutants in the water area are given in the form of
concentration lines. The predicted results for the mixing zone with recieving a wastewater
volume of 700 tfh are shown in Figures 4.11-3 and 4.1 1-4; whereas the predicted results
for the mixing zone with recieving 400 t/h of wastewater are shown in Figures 4.11-5 and
4.11-6.
The corresponding isoline enveloped areas are shown in Figures 4.11-2 and 4.11-3.
Predicted concentration of CODcr and BODS have already taken the background values
into consideration, such as the distribution over the river sections and enveloped areas.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
The predicted pollution gradient diagram and enveloped area values of isolines shows: the
two major factors deciding contamination plume size are the discharge concentration and
flow rate of the river.
Discharge concentration, namely, the source intensity, will have direct influence on the
distribution of concentration in contamination plume. With high source intensity, the area
of the higher concentration isoline will be enlarged. The scope of lower concentration
isoline will be enlarged too, but not so obviously. If the source intensity is constant and
waste discharge is different, the distribution of contamination plume will basically be the
same. Therefore, the impacts of wastewater discharge concentration is the controlling
factor in the distribution of contamination plume size. For higher concentration
distributions, the impact will be significant.
The flow rate of the river will affect the length and width of the contamination plume.
With large flow rate, the river's self purification capacity will increase and the
contamination plume size will be decrease, and vice versa. This phenomenon was proved
by the comparison between the two predicted result for river flow rate listed in each
diagram of concentration distribution.

Comprehensive analysis on the two flow rates and calculated enveloped area of each
isoline indicate:
With 700 tlh of wastewater discharge, the CODcr index (plume area exceeding standards)
will be in the range of 0.543 kMn2 of water exceeding Class 111, 0.155 km2 of water
exceeding Class IV and 0.058 km2 of water exceeding Class V; the BOD5 index will be in
the range of 0.467 km2 of water exceeding Class III, 0.265 km2 of water exceeding Class
IV and 0.013 km2 of water exceeding Class V.
With 400 tlh of waste water discharge, the CODcr index will be in the range of 0.556 km2
of water exceeding Class 111. 0.159 km2 of water exceeding Class IN' and 0.056 km2 to
water exceeding Class V. and the BODs index will be in the range of 0 604 km2 of water
exceeding Class Ill, 0.396 km2 of water exceeding Class IV and 0.059 km2 of water
exceeding Class V.
Therefore, domestic sewage discharge will have an effect on the Yellow River when the
sanitary wastewater treatment facility malfuinctions, but the impact is insignificant.

4.12 Mitigation and control strategies
4.12.1 Control strategy for stack gas
Conclusion of Atmospheric Assessment
In general, construction of 2 x 600 MW units for first phase of the TuoKeTuo Power
Plant A is feasible based on the analysis of ambient air quality, meteorological
characteristics of pollution, enission rates of S02 & fugitive dust and their impact on
ground level concentrations in the assessment and key conservation zones.
TuoKeTuo Power Plant A, as a new construction project, will employ the following
control measures for stack gas:
(1) High chimney: The two boilers share one 240 m chimney with single cylinder in
the first phase project. The dilution and diffusing ability of the atmosphere is used
to reduce ground level concentration of pollutants. When one or two boilers are in
operation, their stack gas velocity and plume rise can meet requirements of
environment protection and technology.
(2) High efficiency electrostatic precipitator: In the first phase project, a four fields
high efficiency electrostatic precipitator will be chosen. Its design dust collection
efficiency is more than 99.76 %. It still can keep collection efficiency of 99.76 %
when one power block is in failure. The actual amount of S02 emissions from the
power plant and concentration of flue gas is less than permitted values stipulated in
the international standard.
(3) Low sulfur content coal is to be bumed: The design coal and check coal of
TuoKeTuo Power Plant A are from Zhungeer, its applied sulfur content is 0.47 %.
Use of low sulfur coal is an effective measure for long term reduction of S02
emissions. Desulfurization equipment would not be installed in this phase of the
project according to the ambient air quality and impact analysis; however, space
has been reserved in the plant layout for FGD equipment.
(4) Low nitrogen oxide bumers: The power station will use low NOx combustion
technologies in the design. The project will import low NOx burners made with
advanced technology from abroad, to control NOx discharge concentration below
400 ppm.
The above advanced technology air pollution controls will be used in TuoKeTuo Power
Plant A, with efficient ESP and selection of low NOx burner. Calculations have been made
of S02 emissions according to guidelines of the World Bank, based on statistics of
meteorology measurements of pollution and dispersion model results. Engineering
investment and unit cost were considered as well, and the selection for type of chimney

and installation without desulfurization are considered proper and the requirements of air
emission standards and ambient air quality can be met.
4.12.2 Wastewater treatment measures
4.12.2.1 Drainage system
The distributed and concentrated treatment scheme for drainage system will be adopted in
Power plant: continuous water drainage (mainly acid and alkaline waste water discharged
from chemical demineralization and regeneration ) will be treated at the DM plant;
temporal water drainage (mainly flushing water of air preheater and waste water of acid
cleaning for boiler) will be treated concentratedly.
Drainage manner of power plant: industrial waste water and rain in plant are concentrated
to drain off, domestic sewage is treated with a two-stage treatment process prior to
drainage to pump station.

4.12.2.7 Waste water treatment
(1) Result of wastewater treatment
The discharge of industrial waste water, oil contaminated wastewater and domestic
sewage will be in compliance with the permited standards after treatment.
(2) Treatment scheme of cooling water and its drainage
Drainage of cooling water is unpolluted. So the quality can meet the permit drainage
standard without treatment. But cooling system of steam turbine needs anti-scaling, the
anti-scaling method is to pretreat the water by adding acid or lime. The concentration and
drainage volume of circulating cooling water will be contaminated and require treatment.
Cooling water represents the largest volume of water consumption by the power plant,
and the drainage volume covers a large percentage of the total drainage of wastewater
from power plant. Two schemes for cooling water treatment are provided for comparation
according to operating conditions of cooling water, make up water quantity and water
quality.
Scheme 1: add acid and stabilizer.
Scheme 2: pretreat with lime and add stabilizer
The recommended scheme for cooling water is pretreatment with lime and addition of
stabilizer.
A schematic for recycling of cooling water is shown in Figure 4.12-6

Figure 4.o2-6 Condenser cooling water recycling
The quantity of fresh water for power plant is amount of vapouization loss and wind
tlowing loss and drainage loss of waste water. Evaporation loss and wind flying loss
depends on local climate conditions and heat diffusion conditions of cooling tower, so they
are difficult to change, because of this, the key for saving water and reducing drainage
water  is to increase the concentrated rate of cooling water. For increasing the
concentrated rate of cooling water, some power plants tgied to use water quaof cling wtzer
phosphate free or with low phosphate and obtained some achievements. So it is
recommended that some necessary experiments shalo be carried out to deter vine qu and
dosage of stabilizer (either low phosphate or no phosphate) and suitable concentrated rate
of cooling water . No zinc or chromium compounds will be used.
Another alternative for drainage cooling water is to fully utilize drainage cooling water.
The draining cooling water can be main water source for flushing water of hydraulic ash
removal and for humidifying of dry ash and flushing water of coal handling system etc..
iBy this way, the features of stable water quantity and good water quality of cooling water
can be used fully to ensure safety operation of dust Temoval system and to improve quality
of drainage by rnining with other draining water so that a kind of water water can be
utilized in many ways not only waste water, but reducing drainage amount of waste water
and protecting environment.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.12.5 Mitigation measures for regional ecological environment
4.12.5.1 Mitigation measures
(1)  To strengthen administrative means and environmental protection functions,
strengthen composition for professional personnel of ecological environmental protection,
and enhance the knowledge concerning environmental monitoring work (Details are given
in Chapter 8).
(2)  Environmental protection organization of the plant is not only responsible for
monitoring pollution source inside and outside of power plant, but also for construction,
improvement and maintenance of shelter forest, and shall be responsible for assist local
government to improve regional environment (Details are given below and in Chapter 5).
(3) It is suggested that shelter forest be constructed before the construction of power
plant in order to guarantee growth of vegetation and achieve better effects of protection.
4.12.5.2 Vegetation community construction techniques
The plant area and surrounding it are an integrated ecosystem. Vegetation construction
and improvement of the ecological environment around the plant has the function of
promotion and protection for production of the power plant. With increasing population in
the plant area, demands for various foods will increase, therefore, it is necessary for the
plant to harmonize with improvement of the environment and development of production.
P'easants will take measures to enhance grain output and productivity force for forestry,
husbandry, by-products, under the influence of construction of the power plant.
Production can be developed only when environmental conditions are improved.
4.12.5.3 Construction of forests
Stable and integrated vegetation with a combination of arbors, shrubs and grasses will be
established in sandy areas. Planting of seedlings in trenches is proper for arbors and
shrubs. Leguminous forage grass, e.g. Melilotus svaveolens Ledeb., A.adsurgens Pall. and
Medicago sativa L. etc., will be planted between rows of arbors and shrubs. In this way,
growing trees can have the function of protection with herbage. Seedling stage is the key
period for planting herbage. The seeds shall be sowed in appropriate conditions of rainfall
period, at first small area shall be protected and then extended year by year. In sparse
forest, forage grasses shall be sowed based on local conditions so as to improve
productivity of grassland in forest areas in the short term, while having the functions of
protecting against wind erosion and fixation of shifting sands, and improving the fertility
of the soil.
Loess hills shall be trenched and planted with arbors, such as Chinese pine, oriental
arborvitae, etc., for the purpose of water and soil conservation and wind protection, while
embellishing the landscape.



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                          145
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Plantations of fruit trees shall be developed on the lower rises of hills and slopes or shoals
as well as the sides of houses of peasants. These places are appropriate due to sufficient
sunshine and available water.
Construction work (e.g. dam construction) shall be performed at first for gully vith
intense water erosion, after which these areas will be developed for timber. Branch gullies
shall be treated first.
Sparse vegetation grows on salinization grassland. This area can be used to plant Ta.
chinensis Lour. and Elaeagnus angustifolia L.. Successful trials of these species have been
demonstrated to the north of the assessment zone in Zhijihao.
4.12.5.4 Grassland construction
The area with steeper slopes and hills is not suitable for agriculture. If irrigation of the
areas is deemed impossible, they shall be developed as pasturage and forest instead of
cultivated land. Artificial and semiartificial grassland shall be set up in these areas to
develop pasturage. Purple alfalfa was planted on loess slopes at Yinbei in Qingshuihe
County; now communities of Stipa bungeana Trin., Medicago sativa L. and weeds have
formed cover on these areas with heights of 55 cm and canopies of 40-60cm. Grass
output can amount to 1000 Jin/mu.
According to the purposes of land utilization, artificial or semiartificial grassland or forage
fields will be established. Single species seeding, mixed seeding or supplemented seeding
can be adopted for sowing. Supplemented seeding or mixed seeding of species shall
consider the combination of long-tenn, medium-term and short-term effects as well as
competition or mutual supplementation between species. Selection of proper seeding time
is the key technique for construction of grassland in this area. Seeding of grass in spring is
improper because of spring drought in this area, so seeding of grass shall be performed in
the later period of spring or in the rainy season so as to guarantee seedlings develop at
almost the same time. Newly-built grassland cannot be used for livestock for one or two
years, after which limited areas can be delineated for use by livestock. This is helpful for
botanical community structure and soil conservancy.
Cultivated land with lower fertility can be used to grow grass and crops in rotation, that is,
leguminous plants as forage grass or green manure to improve the fertility of land and
produce grain in the following year to enhance grain output.
4.12.5.5 Preservation and utilization of topsoil (cultivated soil)
In disturbed areas the cultivation layer and surface soil become a viable topsoil after
cultivation and the action of vegetation over the years. For establishment of vegetation,
topsoil cannot be substituted by the uncultivated soils of deeper layers (subsoil), since the
stopsoil plays key roles in the sprouting of seeds Therefore, cultivated topsoils of 0-30

cm in the surface layer shall be protected and utilized during the construction of the power
plant, and stockpiled to be utilized for construction of shelter forest.
4.13 Favorable and unfavorable impacts of power plant construction
4.13.1 Favorable impact
The power plant will be built to meet electricity shortage requirements, especially to solve
various problems caused by lack of power, by transmitting electricity to the Capital City -
Beijing.
Construction of the power plant will effectively serve the public in the district as well as
industry, agriculture, commerce and other utility services.
Short-term benefit of the power plant construction will be gained even during the
construction period. For example, a great number of employment opportunities will be
provided, commerce in the district and the related secondary economic activities will
quickly increase with the construction of the power plant, consequently, local tax revenue
will grow a formerly backward economy will rapidly develop. People's living standard will
be raised in varying degrees. Industry, economy, commerce and public in the Capital City
will benefit from the power plant construction because the power will be transmitted to
Beijing to relieve electricity shortages.
4.13.2 Unavoidable unfavorable impact
The environmental impacts, which may be caused by putting the Touketou Power Plant A
into operation, have been discussed and analyzed above. These impacts are the conditions
under which benefits will be exchanged with the impacts after the power plant is put into
operation. However, in most cases, the impact will be reduced to a smaller extent after the
control measures have been taken.  These control measures address stack gases,
wastewater, and atmospheric quality controls. This may alleviate the unfavorable impacts
on the environment and meet each of the World Bank and state standards, and relevant
stipulations of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
4.13.2.1 Water quality
Industrial wastewater, produced by the power plant during operations, and domestic
sewage will meet the state concentration requirement on wastewater discharge. Therefore,
the wastewater will have almost no impact on water quality of the Yellow River, and
ecological equilibrium of aquatic life.
4.13.2.2 Air quality
The TuoKeTuo Power Plant is a coal-fired power plant which will emit atmospheric
pollutants during operation. In addition, pollutant emissions can not be thoroughly



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                       147
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
controlled by means of the flue gas control system. But the atmospheric pollutants emitted
by the power plant during operation, and ground concentration can meet the requirement
of the state atmospheric emission standard and environmental quality standard. It is
possible to not only protect environment so as to prevent the known and estimated
unfavorable impacts; but also control pollutant emissions within a reasonable, safe scope.
4.13.2.3 Land
With respect to land utilization, the Touketou Power Plant will occupy 361 ha land, in
which farmland, woods and wasteland are included. Even though most land in the district
is seriously desertified with poor agricultural output, the power plant construction will
have an influence on local land utilization, such as landscape. The method to ease up
impact is gardening and greening of the power plant.
4.13.2.4 Ecological system
The land occupied by the power plant is those difficult to use for any agricultural purpose,
vegetation is sparse, species diversity is low with mainly fixed and semi-fixed aeolian soils,
During the power plant construction vegetation within the occupied land will be
completely damaged and the surrounding vegetation outside will be affected to a certain
extent in development, so the way to solve the problem is to set up scientific and stable
man-made vegetation in the ash disposal area, plant area and surroundings. This will
gradually reduce deflation and desertification of the land occupied by the power plant and
lead the ecological environment in a sound development direction.
Land occupation of the power plant will have some effects on the habitat of wild animals,
as it changes into the industrial landform and green belt. However, there are no national or
provincial protected animals or plants in the district, and the ecological system will be little
affected.
4.13.3 Irredeamable and unrecoverable resources
The natural resources to be used for the power plant construction and operation will be
unrecoverable after utilization.
4.13.4 Fuel
The coal with low sulphur content from the Zhungeer Coal Field will be used in the
Touketou Power Plant A and the main solid wastes after combustion are slag and fly ash.
Fossil fuels are non-renewable. Compared with the structure of original materials, that of
remainder after combustion is greatly changed. Therefore, the coal used as the fuel of the
power plant is unrecoverable; this is natural resources consumption.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
4.13.5 Land utilization
After the power plant is put into operation, 361 ha land resources will be tumed into
industrial land. The land occupied by the power plant will certainly not be reused for
agricultural production after the service life of the power plant elapses, because the service
life of the power station will probably be extended. So the project is an unredeemable loss
for agricultural production.
The project can increase electric power generation, boost the development of new
commerce and private economy and improve land utilization, but the development is not
easy toforecast due to increased land unrecoverability.
4.13.6 Water
Water consumption (mainly evaporation loss) of the Yellow River during the 30 year
operation period of the project is unrecoverable. In addition, the present original condition
of the Yellow River water quality will be changed as the wastewater of the power plant is
discharged into the Yellow River.
4.13.7 Construction materials
The construction material wastes can be utilized and materials can be recycled for use. In
addition, most man-made materials will be unconvertible and consumed, or their service
life will be shortened. These materials will include steel, copper, nickel, lead and oil fuel as
well as cement.
4.13.8 Labor
Unrecoverable labor resources, which are necessary for construction and operation of the
power plant, will be consumed during the power plant construction

Chapter 5 Industrial Hazards
5.1 Plant layout
Fuel oil storage and the coal yard will be located in a comer opposite from the hydrogen
plant. There will be no concentrations of workers in these areas during normal plant
operations. These potential hazard/areas are also remote from the unit control room.
5.1.1 Firewater
The Yellow River water will be used for the firewater system, separate from the
condenser cooling water system. Specifications to which the plant fire fighting system are
designed are included in, Power Plant and Substation Firefighting Design Code, and
Technical Regulations for Power Plant Domestic and Fire fighting Water Supply and
Discharge Design.
5.2.1 Hazardous materials storage and handling
Hazardous materials and storage areas at the power station include: i) fuel oil storage
tanks and railway loading racks; ii) acid and canotic tanks at the demineralyzed water
plant, and, iii) hydrogen produced in an electrolytic cell process. Chlorination of drinking
water will be carried out using an electrolytic process.
5.2.2 Condenser cooling water
Condenser cooling water will be chlorinated at dosing stations located near the cooling
towers. A shock dosing system (1/2 hour every 2 hours) will be used to maximize
effectiveness in bilfouling control and minimize chlorine usage. Dosage concentration
will be 1-2 ppm, with a residual of 0.1-0.2 ppm at the outlet of the cooling towers. Usage
is estimated at 100 kglhour for each 600 MW. Chlorine will be dispersed from one ton
cylinders. The dosing buildings will be equipped with a leak alarm with relay to the
power station control room. The alarm will be available outside the dosing building, and
a windsock will be installed in a spot visible in all directions. If the chlorine detecter
senses leak-age above a preset concentration, an air evacuation system is activated
automatically to draw the spilled chlorine gas into a counter-current flow neutralization
column. The fiberglass neutralization column is supplied from a reservoir of NaOH, and
is packed with ceramic beads. Chlorine gas can be refluxed through the column.
5.2.3 Personnel protective equipment
Personnel protective equipment will be provided for chlorine handling personnel,
including: SCUBA, protective clothing and bak stemming gear. Personnel will be trained
in safe handling practices and emergency spill response. Emergency spill response and

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
5.2.4 Oil storage and handling, spill control
The oil storage tanks will be contained within a diked area with a base impervious to
sillage. The volume of the available containment will be at least equal to the volume of the
largest tank. Rainfall runoff will be collected in a sump, with connection via pump over the
dike crest to the wastewater oil /water separation system. There will be high and low level
alarms on the tanks, with remote readout at the oil loading pump control station. All oil
storage tanks will be grounded. Regular inspections for tank wall integrity will be carried
out, with attention to the bottom edge of the tanks.
The railway oil loading racks will be equipped with impervious spill containment, with
drainage to an oil/water separation system. The drainage sump will not be continous with
the oil/water separation system(manually operated pump in between) in order to prevent a
massive spill from draining directly to the oiVwater separation system. The loading racks
will be equipped with grounding provisions for the tank cars. Foam and water fire
suppression systems will be installed.
Spillage in either the oil storage area or railway loading racks will be cleaned up
immnediately to prevent fire hazard, (see also " fire fighting -detection and suppression
systems").
5.2.5 Acid and caustic storage and handling
Acid and caustic tanks will be contained within separate diked areas with impervious and
corrosion resistant coating of base and dike wall. The tanks will be equipped with high and
low level alarms, and redundant tanks for acid and for caustic will be included in the plan
to be available as reservoirs in case of massive spills. The high and low level alarms will be
relayed to the loading pump control station. The spill containment dike area will have a
volume equal at least to the largest tank. There will be a closure device (gate or valve)
between the containment dikes and the neutralization pit to revent accidental massive spills
from draining in an uncontrolled manner directly into the neutralization pit. These closure
devices will normally remain in the closed position in case of accidental spills. Acid tank
vents will be equipped with vapor knock out drums. Truckloading connections and bases
:for acid and canotic tanks will be provided with (separated) spill containment berms and
blend sumps, or closure devices to prevent direct uncontrolled drainage of an accidental
spill to the meutralization pit. All loading connections to the tanks will be equipped with
check valves. Hoses will be pressure tested on at least an annual basis.
Steel tanks will be equipped with corrosion resistant liner material. The integrity of the
tanks will be cheked on an annual basis, and the tanks replaced or re-lined as required.
E-yewash fountains and emergency showers will be provided at the acid caustic storage
tank areas as well as at the tank loading connections Two sets of eyewash fountains an
emergency showers will be installed at each area-one set immediately available in case of

small accidental exposures, and one set at a safe distance from a potential massive spill
(irritating vapor inhalation hazard).
Personnel protective gear will be maintained at the acid and caustic storage and loading
areas, including: boots, gogeles, protective clothing and acid mist respirators. Personnel
will be trained in the use of this equipment, and drills in spill control and first aid will be
conducted on a regular basis.
5.2.6 Hydrogen generation plant
The hydrogen generation plant building will be provided with adequate ventilation to
prevent enclosure of explosive atmosphere. Explosive gas sensors and automated alarm
system will be provided, with relays to the control rooms of the hydrogen plant and the
power station. All electrical equipment will be explosion proof, (see also "fire fighting -
detection and suppression systems").
5.3 Earth dam safety monitoring
The ash disposal area will be equipped with a leachate liner system. However the
possibility of liner breakage exists. Breakage of the liner could result in an increase of
seepage through the earth dam with the possibility of compromising the structural integrity
of the dams. The earth dams will initiallly be raised to a height of 15 m (2 x 600 MW) with
an ultimate planned height of 30 m (6 x 600 MW). The dams will be equipped with a toe
drain/runoff collection systems, with collection in a sump and discharge into the ash slurry
water recycling system. This should minimize potential for damage to the dam structure
from liner leachage. This and other potentially hazardous conditions will be the focus of a
regular earth dam inspection and monitoring program. Weekly inspections(with written
reports) will note for immediate remedial action:
i) erosion on either side of the dam
ii) growth of woody vegetation on the dam
iii) animal burrows into the dam
iv) seepage breakouts at the dam toe
As the power project progresses, the ash disposal area will be reclaimed in stages as
sectons are filled. The weekly inspections can then be used to monitor progress of
revegetation efforts, and institute remedial measures on a timely basis if probems are
noted.
The structural integrity of the earth dams will also be monitored with the use of
piezometers installed within the dam itself, to monitor seepage, and monuments installed
and precisely surveyed onto the dam crest to monitor lateral movement and settling. The

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
piezometers will be checked in the rainy and dry seasons to establish baseline conditons
and thereafter as part of the monitoring program.
Survey monument on the dam crests will be checked (re-surveyed) annually.
Ash slurry pipelines between the power station and ash disposal area will be inspected for
leakage on a daily basis. There will be alternate pipelines constructed to be used when
maintenance operations call for   down one of the liner. Leakage of ash slurry will be
immediately attended with pipelind repaire.
5.4 Disaster management
5.4.1 Stability of the power plant site
TuoKeTuo Power Plant is located about 70km southwest of Huhehot City. The terrain of
the plant site is level and belongs to Tumotechuan plain land form. The plant site lies on
the arduous mass and TuoKeTuo Lake deposit platform of Huhe over fault depressive
slope. There is no landslide, mud-rock flow or bad soil liquefaction in this area. So the soil
stability in this area is acceptable for plant construction.
5.4.2 Earthquake
In the " China Earthquake Intensity Area Division Map " published by China Earthquake
Publishing House in Feb. 1991, the plant site is located in the area of 7 degrees earthquake
area. The TuoKeTuo plant site does not have any historical record of big earthquake. Only
the earthquake in the area between Huhehot and Datong had some effects on this area in
the history.
5.4.3 Flood
The design elevation of the plant site is higher than the 100 year flood water level.
Therefore, the power plant won't be affected by flood during its operation.
5.4.4 Fire
Fire is one of the disasters which the plant will pay most attention to. Some facilities in the
power plant are combustable and explosive, so the design standards for fire and explosion
prevention and fighting for thermal power plant are high and strict in China.(refer to fire
fighting section of Industrial hazards). There are also strict relevant production
management regulations and operation codes for the above mentioned facilities. The plant
fire fighting brigade often offer training courses to all the employees of the plant on how
to use firefighting tools. There are also mock drills held for all the employees. The
automatic fire alarm system can monitor and detect fire in the whole area of the plant.
When there is fire, the alarn starts in the central control room, the relevant equipment is
switched off* and appropriate control measures taken. The plant personnel will contact the

local fire fighting department with information on the place and object of fire. The local
fire department people can come to the fire site within shortest time to help.
Each and every employee of the plant has knowledge of fire fighting. When a person finds
fire, he knows what to do to extinguish th efire and how to contact the plant and local fire
departments for help. The telephone number of the special line for fire is " 119", which is
known to everybody and can never be used for another purpose.

Chapter 6 Greening for preventing wind erosion
6.1 Construction of green vegetation
Green vegetation is the base of ecosystem and primary producer. Good green vegetation is
the precondition for making artificial ecosystems.
6.1.1 Construction target
In the production period of power plant (in 2000), the forest cover rate target is 40 % in
the assessment area, (quoted from Long-term Plan in 2000 in TuoKeTuo Country, "the
covering rate of forest will be 40 % in south of TuoKeTuo county"). The green vegetation
canopy of will be 40-50%. After meeting this target, the sand in this area will be fixed,
wind erosion and desertization will be reduced, and the environment will be improved.
6.1.2 Greening principle
There is a topical northern climate in TuoKeTuo with little rainfall, relatively greater
evaporation rate, and wind erosion and windblown sand, with some mobile sand dunes.
The technical measures of combining revegetation with erosion prevention and sand
fixation shall be adopted for greening in this project. Based on the present siuation of the
ecological environment in this area and character of the power plant, the construction of
green vegetation for the power plant shall follow the following principles:
(1) Before construction of power plant or at the same time.
(2) Combination of biologic and engineering measures
(3) Combination of short, middle,long-term efficiencies
(4) Suitable measures to local conditions, to chose advantageous environment
resistant species.
(5) Identical with local long-term developing plan, combination of plantation and
cultivation, and to develop diversified economy and establish good artificial
ecosystem.
6.1.3 Prevention as priority to strengthen enclosed plantations
'Vegetation would grow well with a large canopy, and sand dunes remain stable around
the location of the power plant, if the vegetation can be protected, and wind erosion and
sand drift can be checked. Prevention measures would be to protect ground vegetation
and to prevent damage to existing vegetation, especially damages during construction.
Biesides this, measures shall be taken to establish an enclosed belt of a certain width to
help plants grow naturally.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
6.1.4 Prevention of enviornmental damage to power station
Prevention of enviornmental damage to the power station will include measures to
prevent wind and sand damage to the power plant. The damage potential of wind and sand
is closely connected to the direction windblown sand and the number of sand sources. The
prevailing summer wind direction in this region is south, and in other seasons west.
According to the harmful characteristics of windblown sand in this region, natural
conditions and social factors, the prevention system should include a shelter belt for wind
and fixation of sand and enclosure belt. The principle for establishing a wind prevention
and sand fixation belt is to take measures artificially based on the physics of windblown
sand, that is to isolate sand from the airstream, and restrict resuspension of the sand
particles. The enclosure belt is set up for prevention of artificial damage to vegetation,
which leads to the extension of desertification.
6.1.5 Enclosure for cultivation and protection of vegetation.
There are a few fixed dunes in the scope of the plant location. The vegetation canopy is
relatively better. The dominant species is S.matsudana et skv., with better growth and
species richness and good natural renewal, it has the correct properties for sand drift
prevention and grass cultivation.
Natural vegetation protection and prohibition of woodcutting and grazing is requiresd to
control sand drift and for cultivating grass belts. In addition it is necessary to sow and
plant herbage as a supplement, such as A.adsurgens pall., Agriophyllum squarrosum (L.)
Moq. The vegetation coverage of should be kept above 60%.
The sand fixing belt requires shrubs such as C. microphylla Lam., S. flavtda Chang et skv.,
as supplements in the original natural vegetation zone. The coverage of vegetation should
be kept above 70 %, and protection and management strengthened.
Forest belts should not be too wide. Row spacing should be 3 x 4 m or 2 x 3 m. Tree
species can include Populus simonii carr., Elaeagnus angustifolia L. Survival rate and
conservancy rate of afforestation should be improved, along with strenghthening of
management.
6.2 Botanical species suitable for growth in the assessment area
According to the local peasants' experiences, consultation with research documents and
our own experiences, (planting tests in assessment area of Zhungeer Coal Mine in 1986),
the following plants are suitable for this region.

6.3 Greening in ash disposal and plant area
6.3.1 Greening in ash disposal area
At present, a large area of sand dunes exist near the two selected ash disposal area sites. In
order to prevent the ash disposal area from submerging in sand accumulated by the wind
and protect the surroundings against the influence of fugitive dust from the ash disposal
area, a three-dimensional greenbelt with width of 100 m surrounding the ash disposal area
shall be planted, the greening scheme is as follows:
(1) The big deciduous arbors shall be planted mainly within 30 m outside of ash
dam. The main type of tree considered is Populus simonii Carr.
(2) Evergreen arbors are planted within 30 m around the above. The main type of
tree considered is pines.
(3) Shrubs suitable for drought climate shall be planted at outermost scope with 40
m wide, the main plant considered shall be S.flavtda Chang et skv. and
C.riicrophylla Lam., extensively grown in the locatity. Requirements of greening
belt include row spacing of the arbors 3 x 4 m or 2 x 3 m. Survival rate of
afforestation shall be improved, meanwhile management shall be strengthened. The
shrub belt serves to protect vegetation and prohibit wood gathering and grazing.
Supplementary plantings shall be done in original natural vegetation areas so as to
form a large percentage coverage of vegetation, and the protection and
management shall be strengthened.
(4) Vegetation activities will be undertaken while the ash is being deposited in the
ash disposal area. In the final stages, the ash disposal area will be covered with
perennial green vegetation.
Currently, there is sparse artificial vegetation that is green in the summer at the ash
disposal area and power station site. The vegetation community structure should be
improved further before the power station is put into operation. A combination of arbors,
shrubs, grasses, and coniferous trees for pollution prevention should be increased around
the area of the power station, plants adapted for saline and alkaline soil conditions should
be planted in the ash disposal area, finally, a stable mixed forest of coniferous and broad-
leaved species would form an outer zone so that the optimum effects for controlling dust,
pollution and windblown sand can be deveoped.
As the final elevation of the ash disposal area is higher thannatural ground, a little plain
shall be built at the top of ash disposal area for controlling water losses and soil erosion.
Revegetation will be undertaken during ash disposal. In order to assure success in
recovering soil and developing long-term economic benefits, a 50-200 cm thick soil layer
shall be replaced after the useful life of the ash disposal area expires. Greening measures
shall be taken on the two sides of newly built road during construction.

6.3.2 Greening in the power station area
(1) Green belt as flower bed is adopted in the center of the road to plant. Holly and hedge
is planted around, one tree will be planted every 20 m in the center and the grasslands will
be in the other area. Many layers greening is adopted on both sides of the road with pines
in the inner, willows on the outside, and poplars in the outermost section.
(2) The front area of plant is big flower bed, large area of grassland, holly and hedge and a
large quantity of ornamental coppices. A big fountain is located before production and
administration building and there is large area grassland around it .
(3) Large area of grassland will be planted between water towers in the water tower area
outside row A of main building to absorb dust and prevent the electrical equipment from
pollution of water and steam with dust.
(4) The green belt 10 m wide is considered around coal yard behind boiler. Three rows of
tall arbors 6 m wide are planted inside, 4 m shrubs such as C. microphylla Lam. and
S.flavtda Chang et skv. are planted outside so that dust and noise are isolated and
influence of coal yard on plant area is reduced.
(5) Road trees are planted on the both sides of all roads.
(6) Total greening area shall section to 15 km2, greening coefficient in whole plant
exceeds 12%.
(7) Water pipes for greening irrigation are laid in the scope of whole plant for convenience
of watering. It is suggested to use domestic sewage after being treated as water source for
irrigation.

Chapter 7 Analysis of alternatives
7.1 Comparison of external conditions for selection of plant site
Three alternative plant sites were selected for TuoKeTuo Power Plant A, i.e.
Yanshanying, Majiaqi and Namujia, all of which are located on the south side of
TuoKeTuo County and north side of the Yellow River. All have level ash disposal areas
(except for Gaobaoshi ash disposal area). A perimeter earthdamn would be constructed as
the ash disposal area. Wastewater will be discharged to the Yellow River after being
treated to meet emission standards. Water for the three sites would be taken at Putanguai
water intake and delivered by two-stage pumps to the plant after solids settling.
Refer to Table 7.1-1 for comparison of external economical conditions for the three
alternative plant sites.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
In accordance with above comparison of conditions, Yanshanying has the most advantages
over the other two plant sites. Though there are some disadvantages, e.g. movement of
two villages (Daduiying and Gaobaoshiying) and use of flood prevention measures, its
advantage is still obvious. Concerning site conditions, the location of the plant is best in
close proximity to the ash disposal area, with convenient sewage drainage and
transportation. A site with the largest proportion of wasteland is also preferred. The most
obvious advantage is that natural foundations can be adopted for main buildings so as to
save an investment of 120 million yuan RMB and shorten 1-1.5 years of construction time
for the first phase. The significance of earlier access to additional power supply is
inestimable.
Conditions at the Majiaqi site are simnilar to those at the Yanshanying site; except that the
foundations would have to be constructed artificially.
Namujia site has the least favorable conditions of the three, but is also suitable for
construction of a power plant.
One common problem for all three plant sites is that the water source and the intersection
of FenHuai railway and the special power station railway are located some distance apart.
If plant the site selected is to be located at a place nearby a water source, it will be far
from the railway intersection. On the contrary, if the plant is built near the railway
intersection, it will be far from a water source.
7.1.2 Comparison of environmental impacts associated with the three plant sites
The three plant sites are located on the plain with similar construction conditions, and
there are no scenic spots or historic sites, airports or important environmental protection
items in any of the three sites. The main protection issue is downtown TuoKeTuo county
and villages with dense population near the power plant sites
The three sites are in triangular distribution with a distance of 6-8 km, between each
They have similar meteorological and atmospheric diffusion conditions, representative
environmental monitoring data and the same wastewater drainage route. Domestic
advanced equipment is to be used for environmental protection. Desulfurization facilities
will not be considered in the first phase.
Regarding Yanshanying site, two villages would have to be resettled. However, the
villages have very small populations. Construction of the power plant would improve
living conditions of the resettled people.
Therefore, all of three sites are suitable for power plant construction based on analysis
concerning environmental protection.

7.2 Condenser cooling water treatment alternatives
Cooling water represents the largest volume of water consumption by the power plant,
and the effluent accounts for a large percentage of the total effluent of the power plant.
Two alternatives for cooling water treatment were compared according to the operating
conditions of cooling water, make up water quantity and water quality.
Scheme 1: add acid and stabilizer.
Scheme 2: pretreat with lime and add stabilizer
Table 7.2-1 is a comparison of the two alternatives.

Notes: 900 ten thousand yuan is investment for lime factory in scheme 2
From the above comparison we can see that:
Scheme I is advantageous in economic comparison. This scheme has features of
less investment, quick effects, convenient operating management and maintenance;
however, it requires more make up water due to the large volume of water
consumption and low dissolved solids concentration.
*                      Scheme 2 requires a large capital investment in economic comparison, and the
operating management and maintenance are complicated, but demands of make up
water are less because the higher dissolved solids concentration.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
The recommended scheme of this project is pretreatment with lime and addition of
stabilizer for cooling water.
7.3 Ash disposal area
There were two alternative schemes, namely Fengyan ash disposal area for dry ash
disposal and Gaobaoshi ash disposal area for hydraulic ash disposal. Both alternatives have
been analyzed, and the Gaobaoshi Site with hydraulic ash removal has been chosen as the
preferred alternative.
7.3.1 Fengyan ash disposal area
Fengyan ash disposal area, belonging to Zhongtang Village of TuoKeTuo County, is 3.5
km from the Yanshanying plant site. The land and nearby area are level terrain to the
north. There are a lot of windblown sand dunes fully covered with perennial sand break
vegetation, Fengyan ash disposal area will be located on level ground. The ground
elevation of the ash disposal area is between 1055-1063 msl. There is a village and
TuoKeTuo water source well within 400 m from the ash disposal area to the north.
The annual rainfall in the area is 395.2 mmr/yr, evaportranspiration rate is 154.4 (See
Table 3.1-1). The geologic strata below the proposed ash disposal area site are shown in
figures 4.2-32 through 4.2 - 40.
7.3.2 Gaobaoshi ash disposal area
Gaobaoshi ash disposal area is located on sloping land belonging to Yangshanying Village,
which lies 2 km from the Yanshanying plant site to the south, between Mahuangtan and
XihaoLai Village. The site elevations are higher in the northeast and lower in the
southwest. The natural slope of the ground is between 10 and 15 %. The elevation of the
ground is between 1080-1110 Imsl. Gaobaoshi Village with 2 households and 4 persons is
located in the ash disposal area. When the plant is built, they will be resettled.
See Table 7.3-1 for ash disposal area characteristics. Figures 4.5-1 through 4.5-4 show
diagrams for lifting dust concentration on dry ash yard of Gaobashi.

8.5.2 Continuous flue gas monitoring
TuoKeTuo Power Plant A is a large-scale coal-fired power plant. There exists the
possibility to establish a power generation base in TuoKeTuo, therefore, it is necessary to
monitor the pollutants from the power plant, especially to continuously monitor pollutants
in the atmosphere. TuoKeTuo Power Plant A will be equipped with an automatic
continuous monitoring system for flue gas and ambient air quality.
Monitoring items for this system include: discharging concentration of S02, NOx,
particulate and CO and such meteorological parameters as flue gas temperature and
volume, wind speed, wind direction and atmospheric temperature, etc.

Chapter 11 Conclusions
11.1 Construction of the power plant
TuoKeTuo Power Plant A (Phase 1) is one of most important thermal power generation
projects that the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Electric Power have
planned for Inner Mongolia in China's Ninth Five-Year Plan. The power plant's purpose is
to supply power to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Network, particularly to Beijing, in order
to alleviate power shortages in the capital city. Implementation of the project will greatly
contribute to improving the existing state of power utilization in Beijing, and contribute to
a safe, reliable and stable operation of the BTT network. Consequently, it is vitally
necessary to facilitate construction of the project.
The power plant is the largest project ever seen in TuoKeTuo County. Its operation will
bring about development and prosperity in the county, leading to a fundamental change in
the existing economic backwardness. The plant construction will offer great impetus for
the development of industry, agriculture, trade, employment and other public services.
Furthermore, it will also play an important role in promoting the economic development of
Inner Mongolia as a whole.
The capacity of Power Plant A at phase I is 2 x 600 MW, of which a loan of some $400
rnillion is expected from the World Bank. The annual coal consumption is 3.85 million
tons, water consumption is 0.99 m3/s.
The plant is located in the rural area of Yanshanying Township, TuoKeTuo County, Inner
Mongolia, close to Huhehot-Zhungeer Highway. The plant construction will involve the
resettlement altogether of 127 households and 370 residents from two small villages.
Yanshanying Site of the TuoKeTuo Power Plant has good geological conditions, with
natural foundations available. The background of environmental contamination around the
site is at a low level. The plant is located in a plain, favorable for the diffiusion of fluegas
emitted from the plant.
The People's Government of TuoKeTuo County has expressed its full approval of the
construction of this large sized thermal power plant in the region, the Urban and Rural
Construction Bureau under Huhehote Municipality has also voiced its support, the Urban
and Rural Construction Division under Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region states that
the construction project installed with 2 x 600 MW coal-fired generating sets is practical.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
11.2 Control Measures for the Pollutants of the Power Plant
11.2.1 Control Measures for Fluegas
Two (2) boilers of the project phase I will share one 240-meter-high single-shaft chimney,
so the atmospheric capacity for diffusion will be fully utilized in reducing the ground
concentration of pollutants.
The project phase I will use a 4-field high efficiency electrostatic precipitator, with a
designed efficiency 2 99.76 %. Both actual SO2 emission and fluegas emitting
concentration caused by the power plant will be lower than the pernitted value of the state
standard.
Zhungeer coal is to be used in the plant. Its as-received basis sulfur content is 0.47%
(guaranteed by Agreement, see Annex 2) . Long-term use of low sulfur-content coal in
China has proven to be an effective measure in reducing S02 emission. In light of the
environmental assessment and the actual conditions of the plant site, there is no need for
desulfurization measures in the present phase. Space will be reserved for an FGD in the
power station layout.
In engineering design, low NOX combustion technology will be recommended so as to
keep the NOX concentration to 400 ppm, which is lower than the World Bank Guideline
value of 417 ppm.
11.2.2 Control Measures for Waste Water
A chemical waste water treatment system is to be installed for the centralized treatment of
collected waste water, which will not be discharged until the water quality meets the
standard concerned.
The drainage of circulating cooling water will be recycled as the washing water for dust-
removing and coal-conveying system, the rest will be discharged.
Oil contaminated sewage will be collected through the piping system to the centralized
treatment station. After being treated, the water with permitted quality is then discharged.
'Water drained from the coal yard and water used to wash the coal-conveying system will
be delivered to a coal setting pool. In slurry from it is to be pumped back to the coal yard,
while the cleaned water is to be recovered for reuse.
Sanitary sewage is to go through a two-stage biochemical treatment system and then
clischarged when water quality is up to the environmental protection standard.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
11.2.3 Control Measures for Ash and Slag
It is recommended in both the feasibility study design and environment assessment that a
hydraulic ash removal system be introduced at Gaobaoshi ash yard with seepage proof
measures.
The ash yard is to be segmented to enable reclamation of filled areas in series. The ash
yard, after being utilized one part after another, is to be turned into farmland immediately.
The ash disposal area will be maintained with water cover to control fugitive dust.
Vertical wind-proof greening-belt 100 m wide will be set up around the ash yard.
All around the ash yard, the water spraying system is to be installed. In case the yard fails
to maintain the water-retained operation, sprinkling will be executed to keep moisture on
the surface ash so as to control fugitive dust.
11.2.4 Control measures for coal handling system
The coal storage yard and the operating machinery are equipped with water spraying
system against fugitive dust.
Dust removal equipment is installed to various transfer stations, coal bunker bays and the
coal crushing room; the coal dust over the coal conveying gallery will be removed by way
of vacuum cleaning or hydraulic cleaning; there are flat-bag filters in the silos for removing
dust.
11.2.5 Noise control measures
For noise control, priority shall be given to equipment selection so as to ensure the
equipment meets relevant requirements. The equipment foundations will be treated to
attenuate vibration; silencers will be attached to the safety valves of boilers, to exhaust
pipes and drainage outlets; sound insulation cabinets will be set up for the shift room.
11.3 Environmental quality baseline
11.3.1 Ambient air quality
TuoKeTuo. County is a region backward in industry, with no large sized enterprises at
present that may cause industrial atmospheric pollution. There are 70,881 tons of coal
burnt each year in the region, and annual amount of flue dust and SO2 emitted is relatively
small.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Local atmospheric monitoring indicates that in the heating season and non-heating season,
both primary S02 concentration and its daily average concentration are lower than State
Standard Grade II. The primary S02 concentration and its daily average concentration
taken in both the heating and non-heating season at all monitoring points, except those at
the county town, are found lower than State Standard Grade I.
The primary NOx concentration and its daily average concentration taken at all monitoring
points in both the heating and non-heating seasons are found lower than State Standard
Grade II. The daily average NOx concentration taken at most monitoring points is found
lower than State Standard Grade l.
The primary TSP concentration and its daily average concentration taken at each
monitoring point in the non-heating season, can meet the requirement of State Standard
Grade II. In the heating season, the primary TSP concentrations taken at three monitoring
points exceed the State Standard by a rate of 3.6% to 4.0%. At the monitoring point
where the highest concentration was detected, the pollution index is 1.47. The daily
average TSP concentration measured over a period of seven days in the heating season at
all monitoring points, except that at Zhanggaiying, exceed the state standard by a rate of
14.3 to 57.1%. There are three monitoring points where the seven-day average TSP
concentration exceeds the state standard. Of the concentration taken at the three points,
that measured at Shilahao is the highest, the pollution index there being 1.28. The above-
mentioned results show that the TSP concentration found in the urban community area is
no higher than that in the deserted country side. Hence the conclusion can be derived that
the main factors affecting TSP concentration in the county lie in climatic condition and its
bare desertified soil, instead of industrial pollutants.
The local background S02 and NOx concentrations are significantly low, with the
monitored results far below the values permitted by the state standard. The tolerant
capacity of atmospheric environment appears fairly massive since it is basically not
impacted by industrial air pollution. The local atmospheric environment is thus assessed as
relatively good and graded as clean.
A one-year period of continuous ambient air monitoring around the plant site is under
way. The data already available are close to those obtained in 1992, which shows that
atmospheric environrment around the plant site and the county site is fine (see Annex 9).
11.3.2 Water quality
Monitored values of 8 items obtained at three sections of the surface water (the Yellow
River) met the requirements of GB 3838-88 "Surface Water Environment Quality
Standard".
For monitored values of I I items obtained at 8 sampling points, most can meet the
requirement of GB 5749-85 "The Sanitation standard concerning Drinking Water". Only

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
the result of such items as the total number of coliform bacillus and other bacteria exceed
the standard concerned.
11.3.3 Existing state of ecological environment
The evaluated zone appears ecologically fragile, being favored with few species, poor
natural vegetation, barren soil, heavy alkalization, wind erosion and desertification in some
areas.
11.4 Prediction of environmental impact
11.4.1 Prediction of atmospheric environmental impact
(1) Impact on the concentration of evaluated zone by SO2 and particulate matter emitted
from the plant phase I
The maximum primary concentration of atmospheric pollutants (SO2 and suspended
particulate) emitted from the Power Plant A having 2 x 600 MW generating sets installed
at the phase I will occur under the stability condition of Category C, with the peaking
point 8 km away from the plant site to the east. This is an area of fixed dunes and infertile
saline and alkaline land. There is sparse population and little agricultural activity in this
area.
The maximum primary concentration of emitted S02 is 0.068 mg/m3 for design coal,
accounting for 13.6% of State Standard Grade II; and 0.076 mg/m3 for check coal,
accounting for 15.2% of the Grade II; the daily maximum average S02 concentration is
0.0326 mg/m3, accounting for 27.6% of the Grade II.
The maximum primary concentration of suspended particulate is 0.019 mg/m3 for design
coal, accounting for 3.8% of the Standard Grade II, and 0.024 mg/m3 for check coal,
accounting for 4.8% of the Grade II.
The daily average concentration calculation upon 10 typical-day in the period of
atmospheric measurement reveals that within the daily average S02 concentration high-
value distributed area, the maximum is 0.0326 mg/m3, accounting for 27.6% of the
Standard Grade II. The S02 emitted from the project phase I contributing to the daily
average concentration of the air in the evaluated zone is greatly lower than the Standard
Grade II.
The amount of suspended particulate emitted accounts for only 28% of the S02 emission.
Hence the daily average concentration of suspended particulate is greatly lower than that



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                        193
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
of S02. The distribution of suspended particulate concentration is about the same as that
of SO2. Under the same standard of assessment, it can be seen that the daily average
suspended particulate concentration accounts for only a tiny percentage of Standard Grade
II.
The power plant A is located in the plain countryside, without any sensitive receptors in
the vicinity which would require particular atmospheric environmental protection. The site
is 18 km away from the county town, the air flow is favorable for diffusion.
(2) Permitted emission rate of S02 and fluegas
As calculated according to GB13223-91 "Atmospheric Pollutants Emission Standard for
Coal-fired Power Plants," in the case of two boilers sharing one 240 m high chimney at the
planned capacity of the Power Plant A, the permitted S02 emission rate is 26.87 t/h for
the design coal; and 27.34 t/h for the check coal. It is prescribed in the "World Bank
Standard Concerning S02 Emission" that in a pollution-free zone the daily maximum S02
emission rate is 500 t/d, and the maximum annual average value contributed to the ground
concentration is 50 pg/m3.
The actual S02 emission rate from power plant A burning design coal amounts to 5.027
t/h, that from check coal is 5.685 t/h, accounting respectively for 18.7% and 20.8% of the
permitted emission rate of whole power plant. The daily S02 emission rate from power
plant A burning design coal is 100.54 t, that from check coal is 113.7 t, accounting
respectively for 20.1% and 22.7% of the amount prescribed as a limitation in the above
mentioned World Bank Standard.
The power plant A will use electrostatic precipitators with efficiency of > 99.76 %, the
actual gas concentration is less than 100 mg/Nm3 for design coal, and 100 mg/Nm3 for
check coal, which can meet the World Band and State Standard as to the permitted
maximum concentration of total suspended particulate (SPM) emitted at the outlet of
precipitators.
As calculated according to State Standard "Atmospheric Pollutants Emission Standard for
Coal-fired Power Plant" and the "World Bank's Guideline Concerning S02 Emission
Standard," and taking into account the calculated result of the ground concentration of
atmospheric pollutants emitted from the power plant, it is proper for the power plant A to
use: burning low sulfur content coal, two boilers sharing one 240 m chimney, adopting
ESP with efficiency > 99.76 % etc. It can thus meet air pollutant emission standards and
the local requirements for ambient air quality.
When the power plant expands to its planned capacity of 6 x 600 MW, the actual S02
emission rate will increase to around 15 to 17 tlh, three times as much as that of the

TOUKETUO POWER PLANT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
project phase I, accounting for 56 to 62% of the permitted values of state standard, and
accounting for 60 to 66% of that prescribed by the World Bank Standard. Consequently,
the actual S02 emission rate is within the standard.
As a coal-fired power plant, it is unavoidable for Touketuo Power Plant A to emit
pollutants into the atmosphere in the course of its operation. And it is impossible to
completely avoid emissions by way of flue gas control measures; however, emissions of
the power plant, as well as calculated ground level concentrations can meet environmental
standards and can be controlled within reasonable, permissible and safe limits.
11.4.2 Prediction of water quality impacts
With the waste water treatment measures put into practice as proposed in the present
environment assessment, the industrial waste water and domestic sewage generated in the
operation of the power plant can meet requirements prescribed in GB8978-88
"Comprehensive Discharge Standard Concerning Waste Water" with reference to Grade I
standards for newly built, extension and reconstruction projects.
The condenser cooling water will be recycled not only to save water, but also to reduce
wastewater discharge.
Owing to the fact that Fengyan ash yard is found close to the water source of the country,
it is inadvisable to adopt a hydraulic ash disposal system. This alternative has been
rejected.
Environmental assessment calculation and analysis for the Gaobashi ash yard confirms that
no impact will be brought about by the ash slurry water on groundwater with the ash
disposal area leachate liner and runoff control measures as described herein.
11.4.3 Environmental impact of noise
The power plant is located in a sparsely populated region. There is no major community,
cultural or commercial centers nearby which requires particular protection against noise
pollution. The operational noise produced within the boundary of the power plant will
meet the requirement stipulated by emission standard after noise control measures taken.
11.4.4 Environmental impact of the dedicated railway
The dedicated railway for Touketuo Power Plant A runs from Wangguiyao Station, where
it joins with the Fengzhen-Zhungeer Railway, to the plant boundary at the Yanshanying
Site, covering 43.75 km. Electric-driven locomotives will be employed. As to
environmental impact mitigation measures concerning the railway, attention should be paid
to the management of railway construction and control of emissions of fixed pollution
sources during operations.
a



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                       195
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Impacts include pollutants produced in railway construction; the whistling noise and
vibration caused by a moving locomotive; and, the waste gas, water and slag discharged
by operating or living facilities at stations or sections along the railway line. The moving
locomotive is a mobile source of pollution, while all other facilities and stopped
locomotive represent fixed sources of pollution.
The dedicated railway will run through some sections where there is complicated terrain
and steep slopes. In construction, excavated soil will be used as fill where possible so as
to stabilize hills and sloping land.
The dedicated line will pass through loess area with well developed gullies. Those lines
will be straightened or detoured as required so as to minimize earthwork and preserve
farmland. Attention is to be paid to the conservation of the natural vegetation on sandy
soil and dunes in order to prevent wind blown erosion. No earth shall be allowed to be
taken from such places.
Running locomotives are mobile and linear sources of noise which spreads away from both
sides of the railway in cylinder-shaped mode. When the train travels at a speed of 70 to
110 km/h, the noise level may reach 84 to 87 dBA as measured at a point 30 m distant.
With a view to such noise pollution of the environment, it is recommended that elastic rail
structure be adopted, after a period of operation the long-type rail be replaced, and that
whistling be restricted to only certain specified sections. Along either sides of the railway a
belt of trees is to be planted in order to reduce the noise produced by the trains.
The vibration caused by a train moving along the rails is negligible, without any harmful
effect on buildings nearby or on human bodies. The running electric-driven locomotives
may produce electromagnetic interference on wire and wireless communication facilities,
which will be taken into consideration when the railway is designed.
Fixed boilers at stations along the railway are to be equipped with paniculate emission
control devices with an efficiency above 85 %. Trees are to be planned at various stations
and residential areas along the railway.
The oily water discharged from production at the Lanjiayao and Wangyuying Station will
be treated in slow-flow oil-separating tanks; lead and acid contaminated water and other
wastewater will be treated by chemical processes; domestic sewage will be treated in
septic tanks or by anaerobic digestion.
11.4.5 Environmental impact of substations and transmission lines
As indicated by many research results at home and abroad, and by practical experience,
electric field intensity of 500 kV overhead transmission lines cause no harm to the human
body, and is much lower than the permitted intensity for human safety.



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                       196
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
As shown by research results concerning the effects of alternating current on the growth
of plants, field intensity of 15 to 20 kV/m may slightly damage the leaf tip parts of certain
plants, but the round parts of leaves remain intact even under field intensities up to 50
kV/m. Moreover, the growth and yield of all plants, including those whose leaf tips are
damaged, will not suffer.
Nearby the planned 500 kV transmission line there are no historic sites, scenic spots, or
tourist resorts. Running through mainly farmland or waste land, the transmission line to be
erected will not interfere in people's farming, nor bring any harm to the land.
11.4.6 Environmental impacts of the water supply project
Construction of the water supply project will bring about favorable influences on the
natural environment in the following ways: 1) contribute to the consolidation of the river
course, 2) strengthen the dikes along the Yellow River, and prevent the river banks from
being washed away. As a result, flood damage in this section of the river will be alleviated,
and navigation will be facilitated.
Silt removal in the water supply project is an important issue. Because of the large
volumes of dry silt to be disposed in the large-size slurry yard, failure to treat the silt
properly will make it a man-made source of pollution. Therefor, great importance is
attached to silt treatment. Effective mitigation measures must be taken, such as
establishment of wind-break forest, soil property improvements for the disposal area silt,
reclamation of the area with grasses and trees, and cropping to fully utilize the silt and to
minimize harmful impacts.
The hydraulic structures of the water supply project will affect navigation. The main
problem lies in the intake pier and auxiliary structures which will narrow the navigable
river channel by approximate 60 m and thus limit the route selection. A channel for
navigation will be reserved in the project design Moreover, navigation within the
boundary of Touketuo County involves only small boats used as ferries to cross the river.
with no need to pass through the intake structures. Therefor the structures will not have
much impact on navigation.
11.4.7 Ecological environmental impact
Most of the land to be occupied by Touketuo Power Plant A can hardly be cultivated,
with poor vegetation, very few species of plants. Soils are sandy and stationary or semi-
stationary. Construction of the power plant will destroy the vegetation on the occupied
land and to some extent, will affect the vegetation evolution of the land nearby the site
The solution to the problem, therefore, is to cultivate a sustained artificial vegetation in a
scientific way in the area around the ash yard, and in and around the plant compound, to
gradually reduce wind erosion and desertification in the area and bring about a favorable
development of ecological environment.



TOUKETUO POWER PLANT                                                        197
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Construction will affect wildlife habitat, turning the area into a place of industry with
shelter forests. There are, however, no species of animals or plants in the region that are
assigned as the objects for conservation either at the provincial or national level. Hence
there are no serious ecological or biodiversity problems.
The area where the power plant and the ash yard are to be built is covered with wind
blown sandy soil, stationary or semi-stationary. Construction of the plant will destroy the
vegetation in the region and that around the site, causing a "breach in vegetation."
Therefore, tree-planting and vegetation cultivation should be carried out prior to the
construction or simultaneously.
The area where the plant is to be set up is one of serious wind erosion and desertification,
with poor productivity. It is sensible utilization of such a barren piece of land to set up a
power plant.
When all the environmental protection measures are put into practice for the power plant,
the unfavorable impact of pollutants produced by the plant, such as waste water, ash and
slag, flue gas etc. on the soil and biological system in the evaluated zone will be limited
vithin perrnitted standards.
Construction of the power plant will bring along with it local economical development and
prosperity.
11.5 Resettlement arrangement and community participation
Construction of the Power Plant A and its expansion will facilitate the development of
rural and township enterprises in the region, thus giving impetus to the optimal adjustment
of local agricultural production and leading to greater local output values. It will create
favorable conditions for the economic development in Touketuo County and raise the
income of the local population.
The plant construction, land requisition and resettlement plan have received the full
support from the local people and authorities. The county government has already
approved land acquisition for construction within the boundary of the county.

11.6 Management and supervision plan for environmental protection
11.6.1 Environmental management and monitoring during construction period
Articles concerning environmental protection are to be included in the construction
contracts and the implementation shall be put under supervision.
Environmental monitoring in the construction period shall include:
1) atmospheric quality monitoring will be carried out with the BF-7000 ambient air
quality automatic monitoring system;
2) monitoring of fugitive dust or particulate matter, accumulated water, slurry and
building rubbish; shall be cleared out if found;
3) monitoring of wastewater discharge and the noise produced in the course of
construction, such as that caused by construction machinery.
11.6.2 Environmental protection management plan for operations
An environmental protection department and monitoring station will be set up under the
plant; the station will be staffed with 5 to 6 specialized persons and equipped with specific
environmental monitoring and analysis instruments. The Environmental Management Unit
(EMU) will have responsibility for: management, monitoring, supervision, propaganda,
education in connection with environmental protection, follow-up investigations of the
social and economic impacts of the power plant construction.
The EMU, consisting of full-time staff members, will undertake the jobs of leadership and
supervision of all activities in this field. It shall prepare the monthly, quarterly and annual
reports concerning the environmental situation, and also sel up various technical files and
systematic diagrams relevant to the subject.
11.6.3 Environmental monitoring plan for operations
In the course of the commercial operation of Power Plant A, monitoring work will be
carried out on pollution sources and environmental quality in accordance with the national
standards for, "Environmental Supervision Regulation for Thermal Power Plant." As to
the pollution sources, the following items will be monitored: the fluegas emitted from the
gas duct after boiler, the efficiency of the precipitators; the water quality at each discharge
point of wastewater. As to environmental monitoring, the following items will be
measured: ambient air quality in the production area and living quarters; quality of the
receiving waters; quality of groundwater around the ash yard; noise pollution in the
production area and in the living quarters (see Chapter 8 for details). The fund for

purchase of monitoring instruments has been itemized in the design budget. The
monitoring station building will have a floor space of 300 m2.
11.7 Comprehensive conclusions
The environmental quality and conditions in Touketuo County are generally good for the
construction of a large-sized thermal power plant. It is an area of barren soil, backward in
industry and agriculture, with a relatively poor standard of living. The plant construction
will play a very important role in promoting economic development in the region. The
project will bring about very significant and comprehensive benefits and advantages. So it
has received the support from the local government and people. The resettled people can
expect improvement in the quality of their lives.
The location of the plant is reasonable, the measures of coping with the various
environmental problems are advanced and feasible; the pollutants discharged from the
plant are within the standards permitted, and the potential environmental impacts will not
exceed the permitted values. From the viewpoint of environmental protection,
consequently, the construction of the Phase I project of the Touketuo Power Plant A is
feasible.
The planned capacity of the power plant is 6 x 600 MW. When planning and designing the
power plant, full consideration has been given to its possible extension in the future and
necessary conditions have been technically reserved. Seen from the angle of environmental
protection, the planned capacity is also practical in general. Supplementary assessment of
environmental impact involved in the extension stage will be made in due time.

3. ALL KINDS OF INDUSTRIAL AND DOMESTIC WASTE WATER SHOULD
BE DISCHARGED AFTER IT IS TREATED UP TO THE CLASS I STANDARD
FOR NEWLY BUILT, ENTENSION AND RETROFITTING PROJECTS IN
'EFFLUENT DISCHARGE STANDARD" TO REDUCE THE IMPACT ON
YELLOW RIVER.
4. WE AGREE WITH THE GAOBASHI ASH YARD AND HYDRAULIC ASH
REMOVAL SCHEME. THE SEEPAGE PROOF MEASURES IN THE ASH YARD
SHOULD BE FURTHER DEVELOPED IN THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF THE
PROJECT TO PREVENT THE ASH WATER POLLUTION OF THE GROUND
WATER.
5. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT DURING
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE POWER PLANT, THE MANAGEMJENT
SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES SHOULD BE
a0



TAKEN. THE PLAN FOR COMPREHENSIVE UTILIZATION OF COAL ASH

4.2.2.3 The selection of prediction model and basic mathematics theory
According to feature of ground water seepage flow field in the area of ash yard,
we choose two-dimensional ground water quality mobile model -VS2DT
developed by USGS which is most advanced to predict and study ground water
pollution around ash yard. As ash water in ash yard spreads like radiation in
water layer, therefore, it is planned after study that the plane of two dimensional
analysis is to be carried out for the prediction and assessment of the impact of
ash yard on residents nearby and water quality of the water source in TuoKeTuo
county.
(1) Structure of model and calculating flow.
VS2DT water quality model is made up of twenty-six modules. Each one has
different calculating functions, including data file operation ,grid automatic
separation, automatic control of time length, identification of boundary condition
and physical and chemical process such as diffusion ,adsorption, radioactivity
decay, ion exchange for pollutants.
(2) Basic mathematics theory
The advective and migration of pollutants in ground water may be affected by
many kinds of processes such as diffusion, advection, adsorption, radioactivity
decay, ion exchange and chemical reaction. Three kinds of mechanism are
concluded: (1) effect of diffusion; (2) effect of advection;(3) sources and sinks.
As a matter of fact, the water quality model is the super imposition of seepage
flow model, pollutant convection and diffusion. The basic mathematics model for
the advective and migration of pollutants is as follows:
Seepage flow model:

Ss -= V (k VH) + SS'

Co(x,y)-Function of initial concentration
lF2(x,y,t)-Flux function of concentration on boundary,it is treated by model

VS2DT model is a confined differential model.Ali classes of skew differtial items
in time and space of the above mathmatics specific solution problem is replaced
by the manner of conseal cenetr difference, the amount of calculation work is
much great. But there is a main adventage which keeps stable no matter how
large the step of time and space are.
4.2.2.4 Calculation parameter and selection of calculation approach
The main calculation parameter of VS2DT water quality model and method
selection are as follows:
(1) Permeable coefficient K of water contained layer
There are three kinds of soil layers near this ash yard: layer No.1 is silt sand,
two-number experiment results shows that permeable coefficient of silt sand on
the surface is 0.25cm/min. According to materials on engineering geology
survey, average thickness of silt soil layer No.2 is 1.00m, permeable coefficient
is between 1.58x104 -4.52x1O4. Clay layer No.3 is in the same layer with
middle coarse soil, permeable coefficient is 1.04x10-8cm/s and 5.64x10-5cm/s
respectively. The permeable coefficient of non water contained media under the
surface in the model is counted by weighted average of the thickness of soil
layers:
Xki mi
k=
Where:
ki and mi are permeable coefficient and relevant thickness of various layers of
rock nature respectively.
(2) Porosity and storing water rate are determined according to the report of
engineering geology survey.
(3) Degree of diffusion of water contained layer use the data of similar rock
nature.
See Table 4.2-7 for the values of various parameters

4.2.2.5 Treatment of boundary and initial value conditions
Monitoring of ground water quality was carried out at Gaobashi ash yard and
nearby area in May and July, 1994. It is considered as initial state of the water
quality calculation. The distribution of water head of area background flow was
calculated according to the exiting topography and burial depth of ground water
with internal insert method.
There is no river in research area. Surrounding boundary is undefined flux
boundary. Stream current and solute flux are self-calculated by model according
to concentration field and speed field.
In VS2DT model,sources or sinks on element(D is source, out is sink) is
identified as a specific boundary. The most important source is ash water of ash
yard. As regional ground water burial depth is about 4-6 m and ground water
burial depth is 6m in the area of ash yard. The ground water level will not rise
beyond surface of earth and the unsaturation belt exist during operation of ash
yard at beginning. Now the area submerged by ash water is flux of the element
.When ground water level rises to the surface of earth or bottom of ditch for
seepage which is located at the dam edge of ash yard. The element changes to
the element with specific water head and relevant node is specific water head
node. As there is ditch for intercepting seepage with 5m depth designed in
Gaobashi ash yard, the height from bottom of basement of ditch controls
seepage flow field outside ash yard. We modified VS2DT model and add



calculation function for identifying ground water level of area of ash yard and
adjusting type of node.
Another source item is recharged water from precipitation .The seepage
coefficient is 0.1. The solute motion process will be subjected to all kinds of
physics chemical reaction such as adsorption of Fluorine,cushioning effect of PH
value and C02-H20 system each other,etc.
4.2.2.6 Results of groundwater modelling
(1) The conservation and safety are taken as directive ideas for the prediction,
the specific technical treatment is as follows. The groundwater impacts were
modeled in order to determine if a liner would be required.
<1> In fact, the soil has some absorbing effect for the movement of
fluoride,especially the clay in the third soil layer, which has high absorbtion
capacity. This effect was not considered in the prediction.
<2> The pH value of ash water and concentration of fluoride take the highest
value in the result of water soluble analogue experiment on Zhungeer coal ash
by IMEPDI are taken as the concentration value of ash water concentration
(F=1.77ppm, pH=12.82). At the same time, the cushioning effect of C02-H20
system upon pH value has been neglected, while the pHvalue will be buffered in
ash yard and other ground water system.
<3> The lowest terrain in ash yard will be considered at first operation. Suppose
percolation zone remains unchanged during operation of ash yard and area of
percolation zone is 1 km. In fact, this supposition is conservative, the range is
smaller. In the condition of equivalent quantity of ash water discharging, the area
of ash water in north area is less than 0.5 km2.
<4> Some quoted parameters of water quality model use conservative data
according to existing research results. For instance, surface seepage coefficient
of silt soil is employed. The dilution effect of atmospheric precipitation on the
concentration of pollutants was not taken into consideration.
<5> Regardless of the factor that the seepage coefficient falls year by year along
with the operation of ash yard.
<6> The measures are taken for ash water reuse by vertical pothole in ash yard
and the quantity of ash water reused is not considered in the calculation.
<7> Regardless of the water resistance effect by dam, therefore, the calculation
is conservative.



(2) Prediction results are as follows:
The predictive period of ground water quality in Gaobashi ash yard is 25 years.
The initial step time is 0.25 years, each time step will increase two times later
until the year of the maximum value. The calculation result of pH value and
concentration of fluoride dispersed in 144 nodes in ash yard and nearby district
in the 5th, 1 0th, 15th, 20th, 25th year are put out. The maxmium planned service
time of Gaobashi ash yard is 20 years. Suppose that the service time will be 25
years, the analysis is given for the changing tendency of surrounding ground
water quality after the final close of ash yard.
