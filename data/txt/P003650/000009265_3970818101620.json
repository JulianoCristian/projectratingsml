(2) improve the efficiency of energy supply and use\n            in the region by introducing modern technologies and\n            implementing effective operations and maintenance practices\n            and procedures in power generation, and reducing losses in\n            Beijing's transmission and distribution systems; (3)\n            advance the power sector reform process; (4) diversify\n            financing sources, improve the access of power entities to\n            international financial markets, and encourage\n            private-sector investment in existing and new power sector\n            enterprises; and (5) promote economic development and also\n            improve soil conservation and desertification control in\n            Tuoketuo county.  The first and largest of the two\n            components, the Tuoketuo thermal power plant and associated\n            technical assistance, includes construction of the first two\n            coal-fired subcritical thermal units in Inner Mongolia, the\n            power station's first phase; technical assistance to\n            the Tuoketuo electric power company for accounting and\n            management systems; and a desertification control and\n            dryland management program to improve environmental\n            conditions. The second component includes construction of\n            two indoor substations at Xibianmen and Xizhimen, the\n            addition of a third transformer in an underground substation\n            currently under construction, and technical assistance to\n            the North China Power Group Company for implementing\n            accounting and financial management systems."}, "docdt": "1997-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
