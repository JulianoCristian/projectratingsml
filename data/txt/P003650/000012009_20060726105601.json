Lessons are\n            addressed as follows. Of general application: on Procurement\n            - neither implementing agency had prior experience with\n            international competitive bidding (ICB). It is suggested\n            allowances should be made for cases where the cost\n            differential is small. As a mitigating measure, for major\n            contracts, the pre-qualification requirements should be\n            tightened, reflected in more detail, while specific bidding\n            documents could show the differences in bidder\n            qualification, to be clarified and evaluated early on in the\n            process. Overall, more intensive training, support and\n            knowledge sharing in contract management should be planned\n            for implementing agencies with little experience with ICB,\n            and international practices. Specific to the power sector in\n            China: Technical Assistance (TA) and Training - as the\n            reform evolved, new needs arose, and some of the originally\n            designed TA was rendered less relevant. It became imperative\n            for the Bank and implementing agencies to keep sight of the\n            project's ultimate developmental objectives, while\n            making adjustments to the appraised plans to reflect the\n            situation on the ground. Also, when the power sector\n            undergoes major changes (with the borrower's capacity\n            quickly building up), flexibility should be built into the\n            design of the TA component. As for implementing agencies,\n            the overall observation on TA and training involving\n            international consulting firms, was that these consultants\n            often play useful roles in providing advice on concepts and\n            principles, and in sharing knowledge and international experiences."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
