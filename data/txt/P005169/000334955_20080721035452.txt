I IEGWBMission: Enhancing developmenteffectiveness through excellence and independencein evaluation.               I
 About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroupassessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bankfor two purposes:
 first, to ensurethe integrityof the Banksself-evaluation processand to verify that the Bankswork is producingthe
 expectedresults, and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthrough the
 disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEGWBannuallyassessesabout 25 percent of
 the Banks lendingoperations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those that are
 innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which
 Executive Directorsor Bank managementhaverequestedassessments;andthose that are likelyto generate
 importantlessons. The operations,topics, and analytical approachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger
 evaluationstudies.
        A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR)is basedon a review of the Implementation Completion
 Report (a self-evaluationby the responsibleBank department)and fieldwork conductedby IEGWB.To prepare
 PPARs, IEGWBstaffexamineproject files and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases
 visit the borrowing country to discussthe operationwith staff of the Bank and the government, other stakeholders,
 and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to validate and augmentthe informationprovidedin the ICR, as well
 as examine issuesof special interestto broader IEGWBstudies.
        Each PPAR is subject to peer review and IEGWBmanagementapproval. Once cleared internally,the PPAR
 is reviewed by the responsibleBank departmentand amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent to
 the borrower for review; the borrowers'comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
 Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

 About the IEGWB Rating System
        The time-testedevaluationmethods used by IEGWB are suitedto the broad range of the World Banks work.
 The methods offer bothrigor and a necessary level of flexibilityto adapt to lendinginstrument, projectdesign, or
 sectoralapproach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arriveat their projectratings. Following
 is the definitionand ratingscale usedfor each evaluationcriterion (additionalinformationis availableon the
 IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
        Outcome: The extentto which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expectedto
 be achieved, efficiently.The ratinghas three dimensions:relevanceof objectives,efficacy,andefficiency.
 Relevanceofobjectivesis the extent to which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's current
 development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoralassistancestrategiesand corporategoals
 (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies,Sector Strategy Papers,
 OperationalPolicies).Efficacyisthe extent to which the project's objectiveswere achieved, or expected to be
 achieved, taking into accounttheir relativeimportance.Efficiencyis the extent to which the project achieved, or is
 expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the opportunitycost of capitaland benefitsat least cost comparedto
 alternatives. The efficiencydimension generally is not applied to adjustment operations.Possibleratings: Highly
 Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, ModeratelyUnsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.
        Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes(or
 expectedoutcomes) will not be maintained (or realized).Possibleratings: High Significant,Moderate,Negligibleto
 Low, Not Evaluable.
        Bank Performance: The extent to which services providedby the Bank ensuredqualityat entry of the
 operationand supported effectiveimplementationthrough appropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
 transitionarrangements for regularoperationof supportedactivitiesafterloankredit closing,towardthe
 achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
 Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,ModeratelyUnsatisfactory,
 Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrowerassumed ownershipand responsibilityto ensure
 quality of preparationand implementation, and compliedwith covenantsand agreements,towardsthe
 achievement of development objectives and sustainability.The ratinghas two dimensions:government
 performanceand implementingagency performance. Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory,
 ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.

        The PPARwas conducted to assess the outcomes of largeandlong-lasting
projects ina country that has seen much economic development. The PPAR i s basedon
the following sources: Implementation CompletionReports (ICRs), Staff Appraisal
Reports (SARs), Loan Agreements for the projects, andproject files, particularly the
supervision reports. Also, IEGconsulted the research literature, reports on Egypt, and
data on schoolingtrends. An IEGmissionvisited EgyptinNovember 2007 to interview
officials, donors, andbeneficiaries, observe instructioninschools, andcollected other
pertinent information. Field visits took place inthe governorates o f Kaliubeya, Qena,
Luxor, and Cairo. The author thanksthe government officials who received the mission
for their extensive cooperation.

        Following standard IEGprocedures, copies ofthe draft PPARwere sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. The Borrower's
response was taken into account inthe text and i s presented inAnnex D.

Summary

        This document reviewsthe performanceoftwo projects inEgypt: (i) Basic
                                                                            the
EducationImprovement Project (Cr. 2476, approvedinFY93, and(ii)        the Education
EnhancementProgramProject (Cr. NOOS; approved inFY97). Overall, these aimed to
improve accessto basic educationinunderservedareas andfor girls, improve quality,
andenhancethe efficiency ofthe educationalsystem. The EuropeanUnioncofinanced
the secondproject.

        Despite initialdelays andanimplementationperiod of 9-10 years, most project
activities were concluded and funds were almost completely disbursed. Most
expenditures were directed towards civil works andfurniture, but a lot o fteacher training
activities also took place. Innovativeefforts were madeto improve learning outcomes,
such as a school effectivenesssubprojectthat aimed to develop school-level goals
through community involvement. Several evaluative and sector studies were also
conducted. However, implementationfocused on acquisition o fhardwareand
managementinformation systems ratherthantheir use, so the institutional development
objectives ofthe projects were only partlymet. Duringthe project implementation
periods, the government didnot focus onpolicy changesthat would decentralizethe
systemandimprove equity inlearningoutcomes. (According to the Borrower's response
shown inAnnex D, changeshavemovedslowly butmanyhavetakenplace after
completion.) Also, the Ministry ofEducationdidnot assume direct responsibility for
implementingallWorldBank-financed projects, andaproject implementation unit
remainedinforce. According to staffinterviewed bythe IEGmission, this arrangement
may havelimited interactions between the Bankandsome beneficiaries, limited
dissemination of study findings, andreducedthe learningo f lessons from project
experiences.

         Evaluations suggestthat the access objective was fulfilled andthe gender gap in
primary and secondary educationwas reduced. Overall, learning outcomes seemto have
improved since the two assessedprojects becameeffective, buteffect sizes were small,
andfindings were at times contradictory. Extensiveteacher trainingwas provided, but
there was no measureofimprovement inthe quality o fteaching. Overall, no clear line o f
reasoningwas establishedto attribute outcomesto specific project activities andto
measureintermediate conditions (such as the amount of instructional time usedfor
learning.) The IEGmission found severalchildren inthe advancedprimary grades of
periurbanareas who couldnot readfluently andwho therefore would probably have low
test scores. Reading instruction and language issues inthe lower grades may pose
challengesfor the schooling ofthe poor, who cannot affordprivate tutoring. The
Egyptiansystemis capableofproviding quality education, butmoreattentionmustbe
givento ensuringthat the poor benefit fiom it.

        The objectives ofthe two projects were highly relevant to the needso fthe
country. The outcomes o fbothprojects are ratedmoderately satisfactory inlighto fhigh
relevance, modestefficiency andmodest efficacy; despitethe completion of many
activities, learning outcomes didnot improve significantly, andimportant institutional
developmentpolicies were not implemented. For bothprojects, risk to development
outcome isratedmoderate; the enrollment expansionhasprovedresilient over time, and

                                             X



quality-orientedinputs are likely to be sustained; but ifteacher salaries remainlow and
policy changes are slow, servicesto the poor may be limited. For the Basic Education
Improvementproject, Bankis ratedsatisfactory, and borrower performance is rated
moderately satisfactory due to limitedpolicy reforms; for the follow-on project Bank and
Borrower performance are ratedmoderately satisfactory.

        This assessmentprovides a number o flessons for the education sector:

   Governments may carry out project activities as expected inlendingdocuments but
   hesitate to implementpolicies at the agreedpace. Donors who finance hardware
   activities inexpectations o fpolicy changesmay face difficult decisions. The donor
   community may use study results and other informationto invite wider public debate
   on necessarypolicy changes (para. 4.11);

   Inall sectors, a line o freasoningisnecessaryfor linkingexpected outcomes with
   activities undertaken during implementation. A clear line ofreasoning and attribution
   o f causality is critical incomplex projects withmultiple components. Efforts mustbe
   made to measure intermediate outcomes (such as instructional time use or reading
   fluency ineducation) inorder to test hypotheses and determine which activities
   contribute the most to development outcomes (para. 4.15);

   Duringappraisal andimplementation, emphasis is often onthe "big picture" andon
   global indicators o f development objectives. To achieve the expected effects,
   however, the Bank should pay closer attention to executiono f the details, the "pixels"
   which constitute the bigpicture. State-of-the-art sectoral knowledgeand local
   language knowledge are important inmonitoringthe degree to which basic skills are
   achieved;

   Targeted awareness campaigns make itpossible to increase female enrollments even
   inareasthat arehardto reach. However, mere enrollments maynotbe sufficientto
   help girls' labor market outcomes. Quality educationi s necessary to increase
   educational attainment among the poor anddisadvantaged (para. 3.4); and

   Donor coordinationis important inthe financing o f activities that are to benefit the
   poor. Complementary skills among donor staff canresult inimprovedproject
   performance inways that can benefit large andcomplex countries, like Egypt (para.
   4.8).

   1. Background

 1.1      Egypt is a country of 74 millionpeople with aper capita income of about
US$1,250 (GNI, Atlas method) in2005. Governments have consistently shown strong
concern for social equity andpolitical stability, and significant public resources have
beenallocated to social-spending items. Inthe last decade, Egypthas made sustained
progress toward achievingthe Millennium Development Goals (MDG) relatedto poverty
reduction, water and sanitation, infant and child mortality, andmaternal mortality. To
become a competitive member o f the global economic community, however, Egypt faces
the challenge o f improving its humancapital. Inmanyrespects, there has been strong
educational progress inthe last decades. Just inthe first halfo f the 199Os,the
educational system expanded by over 170,000 students, or about nine percent per year.'
Thetraditional large gender imbalance hasbeengradually mitigated. Adult literacy has
expanded among the women and the poorer populations and stands at about 71 percent.*
However, there i s still a gap inthe opportunities and quality o f life between Upper and
Lower Egypt.The educational system perpetuates income inequalities by rewarding
through a series o fhigh-stakes examinations those who are better off and can afford
private tutoring. As a result, approximately 60 percent o f secondary education students
endup invocational educationtracks that infact offer little professional development so
graduates are not even eligible to become primary school teacher^.^ This and other issues
relatedto equity and quality o f education have beenthe focus of the Bank strategy.

  World Bank2007 (Education Sector Policy Note). Inthe 1991-92 school year, duringthe appraisal o fthe
Basic Education Improvementproject, 6.4 million students were reportedly enrolled inpublic primary
schools and 3.5 million inlower secondary (preparatory) schools nationwide. These enrollment levels
representeda total increase o f 1.9million students since 1984-85 at an average annual rate o f 3.3 percent
(1.1percent per year at the primary stage and7.9 percent at the preparatory stage), which was, higher than
the population growth rate. However, dropout was nearly 15 percent of the age cohort by the endof
primary and an additional 10-15 percent by the end ofthe lower secondary stage, creating a cumulative
dropout o f 72 percent (World Bank 1993,BEIP Staff Appraisal Report, p. 8). Inrecent years, promotion
from grade 1 to 2 has become automatic, reducingthis rate to some extent. The Borrower's responsestates
that before the currently implemented SecondaryEducationProject, 70 percent were intechnical education;
there are plansto reduce inequities further (Annex D).

 BankSector Strategy
 1.2     Lendingfor education inEgyptstarted in 1977, and six projects were completed
 before the two that are the subject o fthis report. The early projects focused on
 manpower development through vocational, technical, and agricultural education (Table
 1.1). Completionreports show that overall project objectives were fulfilled albeit with
 difficulties ininstitutional development. Delays incompleting various activities became
 progressively longer, and projects approved in 1983 onwards required 8-10 years for
 completion. Some o f the projects did not meet conditionalities or abide by policy
 agreements, and this pattern continued on to the projects assessedinthis document.

 1.3     In1990, Egyptembarked onaneconomic reformprogramconsisting of
macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment programs supported by an
InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) Standby Arrangement and a World Bank Structural
Adjustment loan. The internationalcommunity gave additional support, including debt
relief from the Paris Club and other creditors. Projects aimed at improving conditions in
the social sectors were also implemented. For the first time, primary education was
supported through the two projects that are assessedinthis document. For the education
sector, the government prepared a fifteen-year planthat was to be supported by a series o f
operations over 10-15 years. The planwas to improve conditions particularly inthe
poorer governorates o f Upper Egypt. The Education Enhancement Project (EEP)
represented a five-year slice o f this timeframe.4 Inaddition, a series o f 'enhancement'
projects were negotiated that covered specific activities inall subsectors, from preschool
to higher education. All but one o f these projects was still under implementationat the
time the current assessmenttook place.

1.4      Since 2000, the Bank has carried out much sector work on the Egyptianeducation
system that included a sector review, strategic options for early childhood education, a
public expenditure review, and skills training. These reports were appreciated but they
received little publicity. According to staff interviewedby the IEGmission, they had a

limited impact, but according to the government some changes were made based on their
 finding^.^

 1.5      Other donors. Several donors have invested extensively inEgyptianeducation.
The largest are US Agency for International Development (USAID) andthe European
Union(EU)6,UNspecialized agencies, and a number of bilateral donors, especially
Canada and DFID (United Kingdom Department for International Development.) The
donor group meets regularly and exchanges information, although large-scale multidonor
projects ineducation have not yet beenundertaken.

    2. ProjectObjectives and Implementation

 2.1       The two projects largely overlappedand lasted9-10 years. Bureaucratic
  limitations and delays inmakingimportant decisions were prominent reasonsfor the long
 implementationperiods. Prior experienceswiththe duration ofprojects inEgypt were
 taken into accountfor the first project (BEIP), but not for the second (EEP) one. As a
 result, the latter required extensions totalling 44 months. Bothprojects were implemented
 essentially as designed, with limitedrevisions.
 2.2      Policy goals. Project documents describe avariety o f activities, butboth
 operations to a large extent focused on construction of schools andtraining centers.'
 Various sections ofthe appraisaldocumentsinbothprojects discussedthe importance of
 promoting policies like decentralization and improved financial managemento fthe
 sector.' The BEIP includeda set o f studies that should leadto implementationof various
 decisions, while the EEP extensively discusseddecision-making issues andprivate gains
 ofteachers through tutoring. Aside from studies however, few actions were taken under
 the projectswith the aimofpolicy change. Therefore important policy issuesreceived
 limitedattention during implementation. However, government staffinterviewedduring
 the mission statedthat the projects actedas change agents for progressthat took place
 after completion.
 2.3      Bothprojects benefited from trust funds. The BEIP was appraisedthrough a
 UNDP grant ofUS$700,000, while the EEP usedan interimtrust fund(inlieuof IDA
 funds that at that time were unavailable) anda grant fkom the EuropeanUnionfor
 implementation. A project implementation unit(PIU) was formulated to execute this
 series ofprojects as well as the follow-on secondary education project. Duringthe later
 stages ofEEP, the Bankpromoted the policy of abolishing the PIUand empowering the
 Ministry ofEducationto undertake activities directly. However, the Ministry lacked the
 administrative flexibility to assumemany ofthe PIUfunctions, andthis issueremained
 animportantpoint oflong-term debate.
 2.4      The BEIP targetedsevenpriority governorates (Cairo, Sharkeya, Ismailia,
 Menofeya, Assiut, SohagandQena). Its initialobjectives were complex andunclear
 (Table 2.l),    andthey were simplifiedinthe LoanAgreement. However, the
 simplification (which is the version valid for legal purposes)' left out the equity goal of
the first objective and renderedcurricular revisioninthe second objective ambiguous.
This has createddifficulties inevaluatingthe extent to whichthese objectives were
attained.

* The policy content of the BEIP is discussed inthe Staff Appraisal Report(p. 9, para2.29 on policies, p. 14on

Appraisal Documentshows expectationsto reformdecisionmaking(p. 8) andmentions the existing decisionmaking
mechanismsas arisk to project outcomes.

2.5      With a PIUalready set up, the hardware-related activities ofthe EEPwere
implementedmore efficiently. Special implementation units were set up at the
governorates where the projects were implemented. The project targeted 15 governorates

 (Fayum, Sharkia, Qena, A1Behera, Bani-Swaf, Menia, Luxor, Aswan, Garbia, Dumyat,
Kaliubeya, Sohag, Kafr El Sheikh, Dakahlia, and Ismailia). The EUworked mainly in
the 15 governorates, whereas Bankfunds were usedthroughout the country. The EU
fhds ofUS$125 millionwere disbursedintranchesandwere usedto finance all
 activities eligibleagainst Guiding Criteria andIndicators agreedwith the Government.
 Over the years, the government counterpart increasedfrom US$835.5 millionto
US$2,2350.2 million. Thus, muchmore infrastructure was builtwith government
counterpart funds than initially expected.


   3. Achievement of the ProjectObjectives

3.1      This sectionpresents results and evidenceregardingefficacy that is the extent to
whichproject activities and inputsmay have contributed to outputs, outcomes, and
impacts.


OBJECTIVE: IMPROVINGACCESS (SUBSTANTIAL FORBOTHPROJECTS)

3.2      TheBasic Education Improvement Project (BEIP) builtnew schools andextra
classroomsinthe areas of seven needy governorateswhere there were no facilities, girls'
enrollment was low, schools were overcrowded, or there were multiple shifts.
Approximately 270 primary andlower secondary schools were to bebuilt, but an
earthquake inOctober 1992damaged several schools andnecessitatedan improvement in
construction standards that raisedcosts. Initiallythe number was scaleddownto 146but
as cheaper designs developed, 159were constructed (Annex B Table B-1). The
Education Enhancement Project (EEP)hada larger construction impact; it built about
404 schools basedon the above-mentioned criteria to house an additional 106,000
students. The school constructionprogram as conceivedinthe appraisal documents did
not fulfil all the country's needs, so the governmentmade additional investments.Infact
the Bankfinanced only about 2-5 percent of the school construction neededfor the
project period.loConsiderabletraining was given inpreventivemaintenanceand
inspections, although its long-term sustainability has beenuncertain. Communities were
askedto contribute landfor the schools. Attention was givento design and supervision
issues. The executing agency was the Government Authority for Educational Buildings.
For bothprojects, the National Investment Bankprovided construction supervision and
oversight to buildings built by contractors.

3.3      Enrollment data suggestthat inthe targetedareas the infrastructure provision had
animpact. Inabout 80 percentof the districts where BEIP constructed schools,
enrollments significantly increased. According to aproject-financed evaluation,l1
enrollment inthe catchment areas o fthe new schools increasedby 7-26 percent insome
sites (5-21.5 percent for boys and 9-30.5 percent for girls). The results suggestedthat

lo BEIP StaffAppraisalReport, p. 15. The Public ExpenditureReview (andEEP ICR,p. 22) states that
schoolconstructioncosts were not reducedfor the longterm and infact were higherthan other countries.
However, moredata were not availableon this issue. For EEP, the Borrower's responsestates that 404
schools were built,whereas the ICR(p.9) states that 229 were built.

girls benefited morethanboys. In81.2 percent ofthe schooldistricts, enrollment
significantly increasedfor girls, andin78.1 percent ofthe school districts, enrollment
significantly increasedfor boys after establishing the project schools. Overall, gross and
net enrollment ratios have risen (Figures 3.1-3.4). According to project documents, from
 1991/92to 2002/03, the gross enrollment rate (GER) for primary educationincreased
from 80 percent in 1991/92to 105percent in2002/03.'2 Thus, there was a 25 percentage
point increaseinthe overall national gross enrollment ratio, ofwhich the BEIP accounted
for 6.6 percent (about 70,000 ~tudents).'~Most ofthe enrollment increasestook place
duringthe periodofthe BEIP; EEP enrollments essentially keptupwithpopulation
increases.

3.4       Gender gap. Statistical information duringthe life of the project suggeststhat the
BEIP similarly influencedenrollments positively. Overall, primary school net enrollment
ratio for girls rose 9.1 percentagepoints (from 87.5 to 96.6 percent), andan increase for
boys of 8.8 percentagepoints, from 90.9 to 99.7 percent.At the lower secondary level,
there was ain increasefor girls of22.2 percentagepoints, from 59.5 to 81.7 percent; and
for boys an increase of21.6 percentagepoints, from 62.7 to 84.3 percent. (Primary-level
targets were 95 percent for girls and 98 percent boys; secondary-leveltargets were 77
percent girls, 78.6 percentboys.) The gender gap inenrollment ratios was reduced from
12.9 percent in 1992/93to 2.8 percent in2002/03. Although the gender gap was not
included as one ofthe outcome indicators o fthe project, there hasbeena significant
improvement inclosingthis gap. These increasesinenrollment havereducedthe gender
parityindex from 93.6 in 1996to 95.3 in2005 for primary andfrom 94.8 to 96.4 to
secondary. Egypt should attain 100percent net primary school enrollment inthe next few
years. Progressingirls' enrollments may bepartly due to the awarenesscampaigns that
accompaniedschool construction inrural areas.l4

3.5            One result ofthe infrastructure expansionwas the prevalencethroughout Egypt of
single-shift schools that are not usedinthe afternoons. The school authorities interviewed
by the mission consider this a worthwhile objective, becausethe number o f instructional
hours inlower secondary schools is high, andinmany areas it becomesdark before
students leave. Some also statedthat single-shift schools save electricity bills. However,
project documents do not show that any discussion ofthe relative costs and benefits took
placebefore this large-scale school expansion. School maintenancehas costs. Maybe
electricity andschool guards wouldhavebeenmore effective solutions insome areas.


OBJECTIVE: IMPROVING QUALITY (MODEST FOR BOTHPROJECTS)

3.6            The BEIP mostly focused onthe design, delivery and quality o fthe in-service
teacher training as a means to improvedteaching andlearningoutcomes. Inaddition to
these activities, EEP developed capacity to conduct examinations, andcarried out several
innovative activities inanumber of schools, aimed at improvinglearning outcomes.
These included an "effective schools" subproject, introduction o f "active learning"
classroomactivities, and ``smart school", an emphasison computer use in~ c h o o l ~ . ' ~
Second-chance schools focused on bringingback to school about 900 girls who had
droppedout to beeducatedinacceleratedclasses.

3.7            Teacher training. Bothprojects financed extensive teacher training activities
(Tables B-1 andB-2). A team o f Egyptianexperts was trainedto designdistance learning
packagesthat included videocassettes, anddistance education allowed the government to
reachvast numberso fteachers at a reasonablecost. About 127,000 teachers in 10
governoratesreceivedtraining invarious subjects (science, math, English, computer
basics), mainly through distance education. Training andevaluationunits were
establishedinall schools. A survey o fteachers showedhighlevels o f satisfaction anda



l5
 More thanhalfthe students surveyedbelievedthat although internetconnections were largely available,
computers were not used effectively. (El SheikhandKazem2004, p. 162)

                                             9


survey showedthat 88 percent ofthe studentsbelieved that project-trained teachers
performed better thanthose who hadnot receivedthe training.      l6


3.8      EEP continued to provide in-service training to large numbersofteachers in
various subject areas. For example, 13,253 trainers, 501,439 teachers and4,701
inspectorswere trained intopics that included technology use inthe classroom, effective
teaching methods; fundamental computer skills; dealing with learning difficulties;
cumulative evaluation.About 55,000 school managersandprincipals were trained on
modernapproaches ofeducationalmanagement.According to officials interviewed,the
multipleinputsto schools resulted inreducedrepetition to lessthan4 percent inprimary
educationand 8.5 percent inlower secondary education. (Target was an 8 percent
reduction.) However, teachers were not tested to find out what they had learned, andthe
content ofmaterials was not assessedindetail. The scores o f students whose teachers
hadreceivedtraining showed some increases, but the effect was weak. Overall the
contribution o ftraining to teacher performancewas considered"average."" However, a
longitudinal study showedhighvariability oftest scores at the classroom level,
suggestingthat teachers inEgyptianschools have a stronger role thaninother countries;
inthe sample ofschoolsusedfor the longitudinal study (see below), teachertraining
exerted a strong positive effect on student achievement.l8

3.9      Faculty of Education reforms. The EEP also supporteda comprehensive,
institutional reform ofthe 26 Facultiesof Education andprovided for newteaching
methodologiesand upgradedfacilities (including the establishmentof dataresource
centers, education technology centers, electronic libraries, multi-media study centers, and
a wide variety o fcomputer laboratories). Staffwho were interviewed expressed
satisfactionwiththe provision of equipment andbooks, but could not give clear examples
about the extent to whichthese improved teaching curricula and student-teachers'
learning. The ongoing Higher Education EnhancementProject continuedto provide
support for this activity, supporting for example the creation o f course descriptions for
the first time.

3.10     The "effective schools" subprojectstartedin2004 and helpedform boards of
trustees in300 plannedschools of 10governorates. With technical assistance, parents
andteacherswere directedto developamission andvision for their school. Logos were
also developed for each school, aiming at improving its image andfostering pride.
Schools that became `effective' trained others. Boards oftrustees were established in296
out of 300 schools, many of which succeededinobtaining donations from the community
as aresult o fthis sensitization. A longitudinal study (see next section) showedvery small
butstatistically significant differencesinlearningoutcomes favoring schools that had
undergonethe effective schools methodology. However, project documents and
mission interviewswith officials who were involved inthe project didnot clarify how
outcomes would beobtained. The school vision andmission didnot always leadto

  concrete actions somehow linkedto learning outcomes(e.g. increasedinstructional time,
  catch-up classes for those falling behind, parentalinterest leadingto vigilance during
  homework, or other inputsthat would result inincreasedinformation processingby

 3.11 The "active learning" subprojecthas beenan attempt to change student-teacher
 interactions from merely repeatingmaterial memorizedby rote ingrades 1-3 to using
 comprehensionand analytical thinking. Local officials explained to the IEGmissionthat
 students should learnhow to learn bythemselves andthat the teacher should merely be a
 facilitator." Teachers are trained to carry out a set of 13 activities that include showing
 students cardswith words, setting up games for language and math, undertakingprojects.
 Eachclassroomhas two teachers(one is an aide to helpmanageall the activities) and
 supervisors who work specifically withactive learningschools. The mission observed
 "active learning" classes inQena, where grade 1students were also learningto read
 without vowels andto identify unvoweled words (Figure 3.5). The intentions are
 laudable, but the cost-effectivenesso fthis approachis dubious; some ofthe methods
 introduced(such as whole-word reading) have beenshown to be ineffective inother
 countries and schools.       ''  Others may facilitate long-term consolidation and indeedhelp
make learningmore efficient. However, more researchi s neededto determine which
ones are worth keeping, and it has not beenundertaken.

may be conduciveto lower outcomes (see Kirschner et al. 2006 for areview).

 3.12    To observe the use ofproject inputs, the IEGmissionvisited seven schools inthe
 governorates o f Luxor, Qena, and Cairo.         22Inadditiontointerviewswithteachersand
 directors regardingproject inputs andrelated outcomes, the missioninformally tested the
oral reading fluency o f 22 students ingrades 2-6 (an Egyptiangovernment staff asked
comprehension questions.). Overall, the schools were well maintained, and students were
engaged inlearning activities. However, most of the sampledstudents were unable to
read fluently before grade 4. Intwo semi-rural schools outside Luxor, many students o f
grade 5 and about 20 percent of students ingrade 6 could not read fluently. Also,
students readhaltingly inEnglish, despite the number of years devoted to this subject.
These empirical findings are based on a small and non-random sample, andthey are
merely illustrative. Butthey suggest that despite muchtraining and emphasis on
achievement, teachers had limited knowledge about teaching basic reading or an
understandingofits importance. This is frequently seeninother countries, and inEgypt


22Schools visited were: Integrate primary school of Qena, girls' lower secondary school inMahdam(Qena
governorate), QenaTeacher Training Center, Mustafa Kamal Primary School (Luxor), Ali IbnAli Talib
Primary School (Luxor), BaltanPrimary School (Kaliubeya), Khalid IbnWalid Primary School
(Kaliubeya), Amin Salem Basha Preparatory School (Cairo). Some field visits were conductedjointly with
the EUevaluator. School visits couldnot beconducted at random. Theyhadto be approved inadvanceby
local authorities who sometimes proposedthe better schools. The approval process inCairo was time-
consuming, the government requiredsecurity arrangements. As a result few schools were visited, and
observations cannot be considered randomor representative.

 it may be one reasonfor the persistent needfor private tutoring. One problem with the
 readingfluency outcome is that the first grade textbook focuses on communication and
 on recognition o f entire words (Figure 3.6). It does not really teach letter values, which
 students need inorder to recognize new              Some teachers and staff stated that
 students should have learned letters inkindergarten, but only about 17 percent o f
 Egyptianstudents attendkindergarten. (See Issues section).

 3.13    Assessments and examinations. The projects supported training instate-of-the-
 art psychometric procedures andresearch design. The National Center for Educational
 ExaminationsandEvaluationdeveloped sample-based learning assessments inArabic,
 math, and critical thinking that were administered to 1700 schools in 11governorates.
 Thisprocesswas complex andhighlytechnical, andthe institution made mucheffort over
 several years to carry it out. Overall, for 5th graders, Arabic scores increased from 52.2 to
 58.9 percent; math scores from 43.2 to 50.2 percent, andcritical thinkingscores from
 48.4 to 50.8 percent. For 8thgraders, Arabic scores increased from 55.5 to 59.8 percent;
 math scores from 43.8 to 48.6 percent and critical thinking scores from 56.3 to 57.1
percent. The target was not a specific number, but 'statistically significant' improvement
 from baseline, which with large samples can be obtained with little change.
Improvementsincritical thinking were the weakest inboth grades (Table 3.1).

3.14     Test scores have been used in a three-stage longitudinal study o f learning
outcomes with multilevel analyses. Two stages were complete at the time o f the PPAR
mission. The studies show patterns that are not very clear and outcomes that are
somewhat confusing. Students inthe governorates that were included inthe EEP showed
better performance thanstudents inthe control group schools, but only inlower-
secondary education and for 4 out o f 5 school subjects. InArabic there were no
differences between project andnon-project schools. Inprimary education, apart from
English,where there seemedto beno difference betweenthe achievements at project and
non-project schools; in fact the non-project schools performed significantly better than
the project schools inmathematics, Arabic, science, and social studies. Also, girls
performed better than boys inall subjects except for science andmath, where there was
no difference. Lower Egyptperformedbetter thanUpper Egypt, and the poor inlower
secondary schools were particularly disadvantaged. The study also found that private
tutoring has a significant effect on student achievement, but parental tutoring, when
parents can help, has an effect that i s at least as         N o school leadership effects
were found. The second phase o fthe study found a similar patchwork o f effects, which
are summarized inTable 3.2.

3.15    Overall, test scores inthe system seem to have risen since the inception o fthe two
projects, but it is difficult to attribute this improvement to the projects and to their various
activities. More important, the intrinsic value o f these test scores i s unknown vis-&vis
performance inthe high-stakes examinations that determine students' future. It i s
unknownhow the two sets o f scores compare andwhether project activities aimed at
improvingquality have also raised the pass rates of the high-stakes examinations or
reduced tutoring hours or expenses.

 3.16    Unfortunately, the projects didnot attempt to improve the psychometric features
 of the high-stakes tests. Consequently the high-stakes examinations continue to have
 limited statistical validity andreliability, andresults cannot becompared from year to
 year. (The regionally administered gthgrade examinationthat determines entry into
 general or vocational secondary schools determines the fates ofthe students and would be
 inurgent needo frevisions.) TheBankhasconductedpolicydialogue ontheproblemon

 OBJECTIVE: INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT (SUBSTANTIAL FORBEIPAND
 NEGLIGIBLEFOREEP)

 3.18    BEIP aimedat enhancing MOE institutional capacity for policy analysis,
 management and educational planning. A council was established that decided the most
 appropriate actions to take, and a PIUwas established with the expectation that the
 MinistryofEducationwould take over its functions at the end ofthe project. However,
 performance indicators did not focus on various aspects o f improvedmanagement. They
 mainly focused on inputs, such as training andprovision o f computer equipment and
 software. These activities were carried out satisfactorily (Annex B Table B-1). School
 mappinghelped select sites for new construction. A unified management information
 system(MIS)containing all major educational measures was created and is hlly
 automated at the central, governorate, and district levels. It is also updated frequently and
 data are available on CDs as well as online. Personnel data are also available andcan be
 easily retrieved for personnel decisions. As a result, enrollment data are often transferred
 electronically betweenschools and district offices as well as to central databases. These
 functions have been made possible by telephone lines financed through the project, which
 ensuredthat directorates had dedicated computer lines. The management information
 systemhas been sustainable, but it is unclear whether these data have helpedimprove
 sectoral policies (see section on monitoring and evaluation).

                                                        15


3.19     The EEP continued to strengthen the Ministry's management informationsystem,
and as a result, the country was able to participate inTIMSS (Figure 3.7). About 897
senior civil servants receivedtraining, and about 600 o f them went abroad. The
beneficiaries gave highmarksto the training provision^.^^ However, project documents
suggest that training was a means to important policy changes through important
decisions based on the data produced by the system. Institutionaldevelopment was to
result inincreased autonomy andto transfer strategic management responsibilities to the
Ministry ofEducation. Despite the inputs, however, these changeswere not made. The
PIUcontinues to bethe implementing agency ofmost Bankprojects and acts as a go-
betweenthe Ministry and the Bankon one side, andthe agencies that receive funds on
the other.26Structural limitations continue to affect MOE capacity to respond with
flexibility and innovation. Overall, the management andplanningcapacity o fthe
Ministry o f Educationhas not improved.

OBJECTIVE: CONDUCTINGPOLICY STUDIES (MODEST FORBEIP)

3.20     The fourth objective o f the BEIPwas to conduct two policy-oriented studies. The
project supported eight policy-oriented studies and the development of a comprehensive
strategic framework for basic education which was the basis for the follow-on project
EducationEnhancement Program. However, the effects o fthe studies that were
conducted are unknown. Some were written by consultants only inEnglish, and
therefore may not have been dealt with at depthby the MOE. There have beenfew
dissemination activities o f study findings.

3.21     Along withthe studies financedby the assessedprojects, donors financed a large
number o f studies on various aspects o fthe Egyptianeducational system. (See
references.) However, dissemination inside Egypt has remained very limited. Some of
these studies exist only inthe Englishversion. This is an indicationthat at least some
were undertakento satisfl donor requirements rather thanto learnfrom them.
3.22     Partly as a result o f limited dissemination, there has been little or no progress in
issues raisedby the studies: eliminating the technical secondary schools that track the
lower-scoring students andteach limited skills, targeting the policy o f universally free
textbooks to reach only the poor, or revising the curricular system that leads to high-
stakes examinations. Dissemination could have helpedbuilda broader consensus for
reforms by objectively informing the public about the current educational system andthe
available options. (Anencouraging start was made through a conference inMay 2008.)




25A large-scale strategic plandeveloped in2006107 with UNESCO/IIEPsupport suggests that the Ministry
has the capacity to plan, but not necessarily the political will to implement plans.

26The Borrower(Annex D)has clarified that the Bank has dealt directly inmany instances with agencies
dependent onthe Ministryof Education as well as with training programs.

  4. Ratings

PROJECTOUTCOMES

4.1     The humanresource development strategy for Egyptwas relevant to the country's
economic needs. Itaimed to improve access andquality o f education particularly inthe
poorer governorates of Upper Egypt andhelp girls benefit from educational
opportunities. Project objectives were substantially relevant inthe 1990sandremained
relevant in2007. Bothprojects supported the priorities set by the government's Strategic
Planandfifteen-year programfor the education sector. They also respondedto one ofthe
key themes inthe 1994 Egypt Country Assistance Strategy (No. P-6263- EGT) regarding
the development o f humancapital to foster economic growth. The government's plan
constituted a fifteen-year programto which the project was to contribute duringthe first
phase o f five years.

4.2     The projectsmet or exceedednumericaltargets inthe implementation o f most
activities. For BEIPefficacy is rated modest. The project focused onhardware and inputs
andhadlimitedpolicy content. Inputsare certainly necessary, butthe missiondidnot
find sufficient evidence to confirm improvedteachingquality or improvedmanagement
capacity on the basis o f inputs.Also, there was no clear evidence regarding
advancements incurricular designthat this project aimed to achieve. For EEP, efficacy is
also rated modest. Learningoutcomes were ambiguous, andthe extent to which teachers
were indeed trained inrelevant materialprovedhardto establish. Furthermore, MOE did
not manage the sector better as a result o fthe investment^.^'

4.3     BEIPexecuted activities with modest efficiency. Effortswere madeto reduce
buildingcosts, anda great deal oftraining was conducted relatively inexpensively
through distance education. However, no documented evidence was collectedregarding
the extentto which teacherslearnedthe materialand improvedtheir ability to transmit it
to students efficiently. Overall, the constructionactivities were successfully carried out
andhadanimpact on enrollments, butthe instructionally oriented activities were rather
poorly defined andunmeasured inpart; thus it i s unclear whether the instructional time
was usedwell and whether inputs were deliveredefficiently to help improve learning
outcomes.

4.4     The efficiency o f EEPis also ratedmodest. An expenditure review has raised
questions, becauseunitcosts expected to be under control through this project have not
fallen over the last decade, andthe ratio o f administrative staffto teachers continues to
remainhigh. Despite adequate space inmany schools that now have one shift, classes are
large andteachers who could teach more hours do not. Despite efforts to reduce costs
throughthis project, textbooks inEgypt are more expensive than inother countries. EEP
anddonors suchas USAIDandKfWhave made efforts to strengthen maintenance
guidelines; but school maintenance is underfnanced, andthere are conflicting data
regardingthe average cost o fschoolconstruction. The expenditure review found that

Bank2007a).

                                               17


 costs remainedhighrelative to other countries because constructionmethods are
 inefficient, whereas the government claims that a needs-basedstrategy has reduced unit
 costs relative to the past.

 4.5     Overall, outcome is ratedmoderately satisfactory for bothprojects.

 RISKTODEVELOPMENT          OUTCOME

 4.6     Overall, risk to development outcome for bothprojects is rated modest. The
 governmenthas strong commitment, donor funds continue to flow, andthe existing
 programsare likely to continue. It is possible that many one-shift schools will revert to
 two shifts as the population increases, butunder conditions of student security and
 electric lights, studentsmay be able to complete a hllsecondshift inEgypt as it happens
 elsewhere. However, teacher salaries are low by international standards, and some
 teachers may spend significant time providing private tuition rather thanteaching all
 students.

 BANKPERFORMANCE

 4.7     Bankperformanceis ratedsatisfactory for BEIP. Quality at entry was
 satisfactory. The Bank's Quality Assurance Group evaluatedproject supervision inyear
 2000 andfound it also to be satisfactory. However, the initialproject objectives were
 complex andunclear (Table 2.1), andno efforts were madeto express them correctly in
 the loanagreement. Furthermore, the Bank didnot extensively discussor questionthe
 needfor single-shift schools throughout the country or demandevidencethat these
 buildingswould helpimprove learning outcomes.Arguably buildingsingle-shift schools
 may not constitute the best use of IDA funds, particularly since Egypt is now a middle-
 income country.

 4.8     Bankperformancefor EEP is ratedmoderately satisfactory. Quality at entry was
 unsatisfactory. Project risks were underestimatedat appraisal particularly with regards to
 systemic efficiency. The Bank appraiseda complex andunusually large project for the
 educationsector that hadunrealistic deadlines and few real assurancesabout the viability
 ofthe expectedpolicies. Efforts were madeto improve its performance during
 implementation. Duringsupervision, the Bank's task team worked inclose cooperation
 with the EuropeanUnionandattemptedto deal withthe many operational issues that
 arose. Mission findings were well-documented and relayedto the government, butthere
 was limitedfollow-up on complex policy issues. The Quality Assurance Group reviewed
 supervision effectivenesstwice, and it rated it initially satisfactory and subsequently
 'moderately satisfactory'. EuropeanUnion's staff interviewedby the mission were ofthe
 opinion that the collaboration facilitated the hlfilment ofproject objectives andthat the
two institutions hadcomplementary strengths.

4.9      The opinion of borrower staff about Bankperformance hasbeenpositive. Bank
 staff hada consultative stance anddidnot pressurehardon issuesthat the government

was unable or unwilling to deal with. The willingness to beconsultative, however, may
result inlimited outcomes when perhapsamore proactive attitude might help. The sector
work that the Bankproducedwas of excellent quality but the Bankdidnot focus on
disseminationandpublic debate on burning issues, like the extensive private tuition
needs. Project documents also suggest that staff (generalists and education specialists)
lackedup-to-dateknowledge about quality-oriented activities: curricula, teacher training
content, or the contents of questionnairesused for evaluation studies. Language
limitatioris were to some extent responsible, andthis problemresulted invery limited-
first handknowledge ofthe details that determine learning outcomes.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE

4.10     The borrower is committedto education(on which it spent 5.9 percentof GDP
and 19percentoftotal public spendingin2002/03). The Egyptiangovernment hasbeen
energetically spendingthe large amounts that the various donors have made available for
various activities. Construction andhardwareacquisition have receivedthe most attention
particularly during BEIP. Untilthe mid-termreview ofthis project, the government
focusedon school construction, andthe other componentsdidnotprogress at the same
speed. During EEP inparticular, the governmentalso showedconsiderable willingness
to adopt instructional methods on apilot basis, such aneffective schools model, "active
learning", critical thinking measurements, leadershiptraining, andthe complex
longitudinal study oflearning outcomes.

4.11     Duringthe implementationperiod ofthe two projects, the government showed
limitedwillingness to adopt policy changesstatedinthe appraisaldocumentsthat would
save money, improve decision-making changes at the central andlocal levels, or give
greater latitude to local initiatives. The paltry policy outcomeshave causedfatigue and
disappointmentamong donors. Staff o f donors' agencies have expressedconcernthat the
government implementsactivities but doesnot change policies as a result o f donor advice
or conditionalities.

4.12     Structural limitations continue to limitthe implementationcapacity o fthe
Ministry of Education, andthe PIUcontinuesto implement projects. Many discussions
on this issue have resulted indelays andfailure to close the PIUthat executes the Bank
andEuropeanUnionprojects. (This failure resulted inarating ofthe EEP outcomesas
moderately satisfactory by the Bank.) The continuation ofthe PIUhas caused some
internal problems with MOE staff who perceive that others doing the samejob are paid
better as well as with agencies inthe system (like the National Center for Examinations
andEvaluation) that want to managetheir share ofdonor funds ontheir own. Butthe
PIUalso functions as a parallel organizationto the Ministrythat, according to some
donor staff, filters donor messagesto the government andcitizens. One example is the
limiteddisseminationofthe studies, some ofwhich exist only inEnglish.

4.13     As aresult ofinattentivenessto policy issues, the system is still inequitablefor the
poor, 29 who may enter school butremain illiterate for years; it is also unsatisfactory for


29In2002, the poorestpopulationquintilerepresented25 percentofallprimaryschoolstudents,butonly
14 percent of secondary schoolstudents and only 4 percentofhigher education students. Also, spending on

the middleclassparents, who shape government's decisions. Discussionsofthe Country
AssistanceEvaluationmissions withgovernment officials outsidethe sector suggest that
middle-class parents see limitedbenefits from Bank-financed projects. Since the
Egyptian educational systemis sophisticated, the value-added of Bankprojects would be
inpolicy interventions that would lightenthe financial loadonparentsobligedto pay for
private tuition for years on end.30Only after project completion has the government
shownwillingness to engage ina broaddialogue onthe needed policy changes. For these
reasons, Borrower performance is ratedmoderately satisfactory for bothprojects.31

MONITORINGEVALUATION
                  AND                    DESIGN,    IMPLEMENTATION, AND UTILIZATION

4.14      For BEIP, monitoring and evaluationdesignis ratedmodest. The project was
appraisedat a time when monitoring indicators were not necessary. The staff appraisal
report (SAR) only hadperformance indicators (targets) for objectives 2 and 3, andan
evaluation systemwas retrofitted. A monitoring study of 64 schools usedquestionnaires
to ask stakeholdersabout project effects ratherthan assess them                            Overall this
project could show only a limited evidence ofproject outcomes.

4.15      Technical capacity has improved through time, andthe government becamemore
competentinresearchdesignandcomplex analyses. EEP hadextensive monitoring
indicators anda longitudinal study aiming at tracking learningoutcomes and
disentanglingthe various sources ofvariance. Inaddition, the project produced
evaluations of components such as the effective schools

4.16      Though for bothprojects teachertraining was a large component, none ofthe
projects collected evidence of actual learning or teacher training effects. Instead, the ICRs
andother project documentsrefer to teachers andprincipals who attendedtraining events
as "trained". (Officials interviewed by the IEGmission statedthat teachers were
supervised andthat supervisors wrote reports, but it's unclear how these were used.)
There is only evidence that teachersreceivedtraining. Course content, mastery, and
extent ofbehavioural changes are unknown.


education is unequally distributed across households, with the poorest populationquintile receiving about
15 percent o ftotal spendingand the richest populationquintile receiving about 24 percent o ftotal spending
(World Bank2002).

30Dangand Rogers 2007; World Bank 2002, p. 36

3'The BEIP ICRhadratedborrower performance satisfactory. According to staffinterviewed by the IEG
mission "moderately satisfactory" would have beenmore appropriate given the limitedpolicy and
monitoringeffects, butthe rating was not available at that time. The Borrower states that recently several
policychanges have gradually been made "such as the teachers' cadre, the teachers' academy and the
national quality assurance andaccreditation authority as well as the very recent secondary education reform
conferencewhich was presided by President Mubarak.." A strategic planwas newly established as an
effective planning tool, and a decentralization scheme for localplanning activities is being piloted insome
governorates.Also, a secondary education reformconference inMay2008 may result in future changes.

   5. Issues in Sectoral Strategy

 NEED ESTABLISHLINEOFREASONINGFORATTRIBUTINGPROJECTEFFECTS
        TO               A

 5.1     The government has implementedmany activities aimedat improving the quality
 of education (including pilots for innovative methods). However, Bank andgovernment
 staff have failed to establisha clear line o f reasoningthat would link interventions with
 outcomes. To improve learning outcomes, the innovations must somehow influence
 students' information processingand increasethe amount of durable learningthat they
 acquire inschool. This canbe done by making information more `memorable' and/or by
 increasing instructional time during class or after-hour~.~~

 5.2     Itis unclearhowthe various activities haveinfluencedthesevariables. For
 example, the effective schools subprojectfocused on peripheral changes that could not
 have easily affectedthe above variables anddidnot monitor interveningevents such as
 instructionaltime use. The ambivalent andfragmented results ofthe longitudinal study
 also make it impossible to attribute effects to specific project interventions andthen
maximize those. Without measurementof interveningvariables (e.g. instructional time
use) the researchersoften arrive at the conclusion that the effects can only be shown after
several years (e.g. Ashraf Bakr2006). Suchvague conclusions only serve to perpetuate
inefficient or ineffective interventions inthe education sector. Greater specificity is
neededon showing how various interventions will modify students' memory
consolidation processes.

IMPROVINGLEARNINGOUTCOMES: ACCELERATINGREADING FLUENCY                        AND
COMPREHENSIONOF STANDARDARABIC

5.3      As discussedinpara. 3.12, readingfluency may bea significant problemamong
poorer andrural populations ofEgypt. This issue hasnot been documentedextensively,
so its incidence remainsunknown. (A major donor is preparing a reading fluency study.)
A more extensive discussiononthe researchrelatedto this issue appearsinAnnex A.


  6. Lessons

6.1      This assessmentprovides anumberoflessons for the education sector:

    Governmentsmay carry out project activities as expectedinlendingdocuments but
    hesitateto implement agreedpolicies. Donors who finance hardwareactivities in
    expectation ofpolicy changesmay face difficult decisions. The donor community
    may use study results andother information to invite wider public debate on
    necessarypolicy changes (para. 4.1 1);




34For a review see Abadzi 2006, chapters4, 8 and 10.

                                        21


Inall sectors, alineo freasoningis necessaryfor linkingexpectedoutcomeswith
activities undertaken duringimplementation. A clear line ofreasoning and attribution
of causality is critical incomplex projects with multiplecomponents. Efforts mustbe
madeto measureintermediate conditions (such as instructional time use or reading
fluency ineducation) inorder to test hypothesesand determine which activities
contribute the most to development outcomes (para. 4.15);

Duringappraisalandimplementation, emphasisis oftenonthe "big picture" andon
global indicators o f development objectives. To achievethe expected effects,
however, the Bank should pay closer attention to execution ofthe details, the "pixels"
which constitute the bigpicture. State-of-the-art sectoralknowledge andlocal
languageknowledge are important inmonitoring the degreeto which basic skills are
achieved(para. 4.9 ); and

Targeted awareness campaigns make it possibleto increasefemale enrollments even
inareasthat arehardto reach. However, mere enrollments may notbesufficient to
help girls' labor market outcomes. Quality educationis necessaryto increase
educational attainment amongthe poor anddisadvantaged(para. 3.4); and

Donor coordination is important inthe financing o f activities that are to benefit the
poor. Complementary skills among donor staff canresult inimprovedproject
performanceinways that canbenefit large andcomplex countries, like Egypt (para.
4.8).

  ANNEX A. IMPROVING LEARNINGOUTCOMES:
  ACCELERATING READINGFLUENCY AND
  COMPREHENSIONOF STANDARDARABIC

  Research shows that students need a minimumreading speed o f 45-60 words per
  minute inorder to understandvery simple text; ifthey read more slowly or make
  mistakes, by the end o f the sentence they forget the beginning. More complex and
  advanced text requires faster reading speeds, so that students have more time within
  the limits o ftheir short-term memory to understand the text. Unvoweled Arabic
  requires fast reading early on because studentsmust maintaina list o f alternative
  pronunciations intheir short-term memory inorder to make sense o fthe text.

  Students become fluent readers faster ifthey learn the unambiguous values o f
  individual letters. The brain i s set up to recognize simple patterns most easily and to
  pair them up consistently with specific sounds. This canbe easily achieved with
  voweled Arabic. However, innovative reading methods focus on teaching students
  entire andunvoweledwords (Figure A.1). MOEhas a strategy o f focusing the book
  content o f the early grades on
  "communication)' rather than efficient            FigureA 1: Expectationthat first graders can

  decoding that will produce learning
  outcomes later on. Thus, patterns become
  large and complex, and students merely
  learnto recognize entire configurations
  rather than learnthe alphabetic principles
  and particular sound values.' Middle-class
  students who get help from parents may
  have no problem, but the poorer andrural
  populations may lack parental help.
  Textbooks should explicitly teach letter
  values, andMOE could track fluency. To
  accommodate the many students who
  cannot read fluently for years, textbooks
 mightmaintainthe vowels inall gradesof
 primaryschool.

  Spoken EgyptianArabic differs from                Source: MOEtextbooks

written standardArabic incertainaspects. However, textbooks from grade 1do not
 acknowledge differences, and do not explicitly teach students these differences.
 Thus, first andsecond graders readvocabulary and grammatical conjugations that
may be quite different from the language usedat home. This may affect students'
ability to acquire readingfluency and gainbetter understanding ofthe texts they read.

ANNEX D.BORROWER'S COMMENTS

The report, in general, provides some good insights in some aspects of the two
projects, however, it went beyond reasonable analysis on some o f its conclusions.
Besides, attempting to evaluate a project like BEIP after more than four years of its
closing seems very difficult andwould not necessarily leadto reasonableconclusions.

Moreover, the report completely neglected all the recent reforms which were
undertaken by GOE and MOE such as the teachers' cadre, the teachers' academy and
the national quality assurance and accreditation authority as well as the very recent
secondary education reform conference which was presided by President Mubarak.
Inaddition, the report neglectedthe mentionofthe newly establishedstrategicplanas
an effective planning tool, as well as the piloting of decentralization in some
governoratesinthe local activities to plan.

Our maincommentsare as follows:
   -   The rating of BEIP in the ICR for the Borrower's `performance was
       "satisfactory"   while under the PPAR was lowered to "moderately
       satisfactory'' with nojustification.
   -   In the Preface page No. vii, the report states that US$ 4.1 million were
       cancelled from EEP while the actual amount cancelled was SDR 377,000
       (which is equivalent to US$500,000).
   -   On page ix under "Summary",        the report states that the government did not
       focus on policy changes which, in our opinion, is not accurate as the
       government has made major changes in 1995 by beginning the reforms in all
       stages which was not the case before 1995. We believe that cooperation with
       the World Bank through these projects and also other donors such as USAID
       andEUledto such results. Reforms moved since that time on all fronts (may
       be slowly) but ledto havingnow: a strategicplanfor the first time for MOE; a
       cadre for teachers which started inJuly 2007, an academy for teachers is being
       established and a national quality assurance and accreditation authority has
       been     established   and     i s   currently   designing    the   criteria of
       accreditatiodcertification of schools and universities. Also a conference to
       reform secondary education has been held inMay 2008 and its results will be
       felt in the coming few years.        While it was a conference for secondary
       education, the results will affect the whole education system.
   -   In the same paragraph the mention of PIUs came along. We would like to
       clarify that establishing PIUs was the Bank's way of doing business at that
       time and we abided by the Bank's conditions thinkingthat they were suitable
       for Egypt.

ANNEX D                               38

  - Insame paragraphthe issue of interaction betweenthe Bank andbeneficiaries
    was raised. The interaction, in OUT opinion, was at a very good level. The
    Bank dealt directly in many instances with NCEEE, CCIMD, NCERD and
    GAEB as well as CDIST for the training programs, the Technology
    Development Center (TDC) and the EMIS department in the ministry of
    education andparticipated incapacity building activities with other donors for
    these departments and entities.
  - Regarding the comment at the end of the page (ix) on teachers low salaries,
    we have already answered this concern as the new cadre of teachers has
    started in July 2007. We believe that this cadre if implemented successfully
    will answer the above-mentionedconcern.
  - Policy changes do not come over night. It took GOE and MOE some time to
    actually start the policy reforms as stated above. While the projects did not
    lead directly to such reforms, they definitely played an important role as
    changeagents.
  - On the decentralization front, we would like to clarify that most of the serious
    actions needed (as in fiscal and administrative decentralization) are the
    responsibility of the government as a whole and not MOE. There is an
    experiment for decentralization ineducationbeenattempted.
  - On page 1 under "back ground", the report states that 60% of secondary
    education enrollment is in the technical branch. We want to clarify that the
    ratio was 70% before SEEP which meansthat there has been an improvement
    of 10% and it is still improving trying to reach 50% during the current five-
    year plan. Also, MOE is trying to get the two streams o f secondary education
    closer through having a joint trunk for both streams in grade 10 (first
    secondary).
  - Paragraph 1.4 (page 2): the PER reports of the Bank were not only well
    received but actually used in the areas of textbooks and construction. Inthe
    area of textbooks, many of MOE books were revised, reformulated and
    reprinted in accordance with the recommendations of the PER. Also many
    books were dropped from the list and only few numbers were printed for
    every school and not for every student as was the case.          In the school
    construction area, some procedures changed as a result and others were
    enforced. Also PPP was initiated during the same year as a result ofthe PER.
 -  Table 1.1 on page 3: Please change the cancelled amount o f EEP from 4.1 to
    0.5 USDollars as explained earlier.
 -  Paragraph 2.5, page 5, the project targeted 15 governorates and not 11. The
    missing governorates are: Sohag, Kafi El Sheikh, Dakahliya and Ismailiya.
    While EU worked mainly in the 15 governorates and financed the 15
    GPPMUs, the Bankworked inall governorates(26 plusLuxor City).

- Paragraph3.2, page 6: The number of schools financed by EEP was 404 (at
  30%). We do not understand where the figure 15% of the country's needs
  came from. EEP was considered as a program with government plus the
  projects of EU and WB. Therefore, all schools built during this period are
  considered contribution o f EEP. Also, this explains why the government
  contribution exceededthe original amounts.
- Paragraph3.5, page 6: There was no adequate maintenancebefore GAEN and
  there was no plan for it. However, after GAEB's establishment, a school
  maintenance planwas made and financed by GOE and also donors especially
  USAID and KFW.           GAEB also prepared maintenance guides and BEIP
  provided extensive training to GAEB engineers and school headmasters and
  teachers.
- Paragraph 3.9, page 9: the report mentions that there were no clear examples
  for improvement in the faculties o f education. May be these improvements
  are not felt yet but it is worth noting that most o f the 26 FOEShavejoined the
  reform efforts and for the first time, course descriptionsfor subjects have been
  prepared.
- Paragraph 3.17, page 14: please note that while Jordan scored more than
  Egypt in both science and math, Egypt scored higher than Lebanon and
  Tunisia inscience and is equal to Tunisia inmath.
- Paragraph 3.19, page 15: Please correct the number of middle management
  staff who receivedtraining to be 897 ofwhich 600 travelled abroad.
- Paragraph 3.19, page 15: Please note that MOE is implementing ECEEP
  without a PIU since 2005. We would like also to clarify that the capacity of
  MOE has improved substantially as it has managedto prepareits first strategic
  planwhich is currently under implementation.
- Paragraph 3.22, page: As explained earlier, the secondary education reform
  conference was held in May 2008 and actually discussed such concerns (as
  they review all related issues) such as high-stakes exams and revising the
  curriculum and examination systems which suggests that the policy studies
  were of some use.
- Footnote No. 26 on page 16: We could not verify that PPAR has rated BEIP
  as "satisfactory" inits outcome as illustrated inthe footnote. Inpage v it was
  rated "moderately satisfactory". Again inparagraph 4.3 the report talks again
  about modest efficiency. Please clarify.
- Paragraph 4.4, page 17: We believe that the cost of school construction in
  Egypt is less than the neighboring countries such as Yemen, Lebanon and
  Jordan.

ANNEX D                               40

  - Paragraph 4.11, page 18: Please refer to our previous comment on policy
    changes which were adoptedrecently by MOE such as the teachers' cadre, the
    teachers' academy and the national quality assurance and accreditation
    authority, etc.

  - Paragraph 4.13, page 19:     the report mentions' one more time that the
    government was not willing to engage ina broad dialogue on policy changes.
    We have already clarifiedthat this statement is not accurate.
