    Program Project for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the long\n            disbursement profile indicates that different approaches to\n            project design need to be adopted. Bank and government may\n            want to consider using loan instruments other than standard\n            investment projects such as developing policy lending, which\n            is linked to policy changes and indicators rather than the\n            management of outputs. If standard investment projects are\n            to be used, more realistic assessments of the disbursement\n            profile need to be incorporated into project design. Merge\n            sector dialogue with government-wide discussions. In many\n            cases, the impact of education projects is circumscribed by\n            government-wide constraints. Education sector improvements\n            are linked to progress in other government-wide reforms and\n            initiatives, such as decentralization, promotion of the\n            private sector, and civil service reform. To address\n            structural issues such as Ministry of Educations\n            (MOE's) absorptive capacity, teacher incentives, and\n            decentralization, policy dialogue that includes the MOE, as\n            well as a wide range of other government authorities and\n            education stakeholders, should be undertaken. Create the\n            conditions to successfully generalize promising approaches.\n            There are several successful initiatives introduced by the\n            project, such as the ESP, the use of community\n            participation, improvements in pre-service training, and\n            changes to the Educational MIS (EMIS) that have been\n            undertaken as pilots. To build on these successes, efforts\n            should focus on ways to incorporate and maintain them into\n            standard practice."}, "docdt": "2007-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
