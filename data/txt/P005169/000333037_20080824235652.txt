1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design:


1.I     Colzte.rt at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationalefor
Bank assistance):

 The first half of the 1990ssaw an increased effort by the government to expand the number of
 schoolplaces in primary and preparatory education. Public enrollment for these stages grew 9
percent from 1990-1996 as a result of a large-scale schoolbuilding program. The objective of
this program.wasto reduce the number of multi-shift schoolsand to provide greater access to
 school,particularlyin underserved areas.

As a result, by 1996,the gross enrollmentrate (GER) in primary education (grades 1-5) reached
 104percent for boys and 93 percent for girls. At the lower secondary (preparatory)level
 (grades 6-9), the GER for boys reached 88 percent, compared with 79 percent for girls, but the
 net enrollmentrate (NER)was significantlylower, particularly for girls. Therewere some areas
 in the country where girls accountedfor fewer than 40 percent of both primary and preparatory
 students.

 The government's school constructionprogram prior to this project did not completely take into
 account the constraints on the demand for girls' education in culturallyconservative areas.
 Factors such as distance to school, absence of sanitary facilities,the presence of male teachers,
 and girls' domesticresponsibilitiesat home were important impedimentsto girls attending
school.

 In additionto the need to expand enrollment, the sector continuedto experienceproblemswith
poor quality and system inefficiency. The low qualityof education resulted in poor outcomes
(high repetition and drop-out rates, low levels of achievement)stemmingfrom poor learning
conditions,overcrowdedclassrooms,inadequateteaching skills, and a lack of focus on student
 learningthroughout the system. At the time of the appraisal of this project in 1996,two-thirds
 of basic education schools operated doubleor triple shifts, with the concomitantloss of learning
 hours. In 1994f1995,only 7 percent of primary school teachers had a university degree in
 education. At the preparatorylevel, 63 percent of teachers had a universitydegree in education.
 Financial resources for teachers' in-service trainingwere almost nonexistent, and low salaries
 had resulted in a distorted incentivessystem where teachers derived substantial additional
 income from complementaryprivate tutoring.

 In October 1995,the government draftedMubarak's National Project, which aimed to address
 these issues. In June 1996,this was followed up by the Minister of Educationwith a letter
outliningthe govermnent's Strategic Plan for the education sector,includingperformance
 indicators. The project under review was to assist this effort, with the understandingthat it
 would be the first phase of a 10-15year program.

1.2     OriginalProject Development Objectives (PDO):

  1.     Increase access, particularlyfor girls (increaseannual enrollment for girls and boys by 2
  and 1.2 percent, respectively;and provide second-chanceeducation for children up to 14years

  old,particularly for girls).
  2.      Improve the quality of student learning (reduce repetition and drop-outs; improve
  quality of teaching and learningto ensure that students attainbasic skills; improve quality of
  pre-service training; and build capacityof implementingagencies).
   3.     Enhance the efficiency of the education system (improve efficiency of resource use;
   improve data accuracy and relevance; introducemechanismsto improve teacher motivation
   and accountability; ensure effective program management; strengthen implementation at the
  central and governoratelevels through annual work plans; integrate the governorate level in
  planning and implementation; and establish feedback mechanisms for ongoing assessment and
  program adjustment).                                                     -.             --


1.3      Revised PDO (asapproved by original approving authority), and reasons/justz~cation:




1.4      Main Beneficiaries, original and revised (brieflydescribe the "theprimary target group"
identified in the PALI and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and
organizationsexpected to benefitfrom theproject):

  The main beneficiaries were primary and lower secondary (preparatory) school students, with
  emphasison studentsin underserved areas, girls, and studentswith disabilities. In the process,
  this would benefit all relevant educationsector agencies at the central and governorate levels in

  1.      Improving access (total cost: US$448.5 million, of which IDA US$17.5 million).
 Included school construction in targeted areas to reach girls and students with disabilities, and
  technical assistanceto improve surveyingcapacity, to conductneeds assessments at the local
  level, and to review education materials.
  2.      Improving qualityof student performance (total cost: US$359.0 million, of which
  IDA US$5 1.6million). Included constructionof additional schools to reduce class size and
  multiple shifts, equipment,training of teachers, and technical assistance.
  3.      Improving system efficiency (total cost: US$28.0 million, of which IDA US$5.9
  million). Included technicalassistance for reform of decisionmaking process, capacity building
  in participatoryplanning and management, monitoring and evaluation, and areas related to
 pedagogy. Strengtheningthe Ministry of Education (MOE) agencies would occur at both the
  central and governorate levels, includingthe funding and staffingof the Program Planning and
  Management (later changedto Monitoring)Unit (PPMSJ).

1.6      Revised Components:

1.7     Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, andfinding allocatioizs):

--                      --                                                                       -
 Ln April 2002, the responsibility for pre-ser6e teacher training was shifted from MOE's
 PPMU to the Ministryof Higher Education (MOHE) to be managed under the Higher
 Education Enhancement Project (Cr.4658-EGT). In addition, in December 2004, it was decided
 to initiate a concerted quality and efficiency improvement program through an Effective School
 Program (ESP; seepara.3.2). Over time, the allocationof proceeds under the EEP Credit was
 changed, with substantiallymore allocated to training and technical assistance managed by the
 PPMU, and less to pre-service training managed by MOHE. Because of changes in the
 SDR/US$ exchangerate, availableproject hnding under the Credit increased by the equivalent
 of US$2.3 million, while US$0.6 million was left un-disbursed as of February 20,2007.
 Similarly, the grant from the European Union (EU) Euro 100million (including Euro 8 million
 for technical assistance) increasedby the equivalentof about US$5 million in US dollar terms,
 while the equivalent of about US$6.6 million has so far not been disbursed. Government
 funding turned out to be much more than projected at appraisal (see Annex I).


2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1     Project Preparation,Design Stage, and Quality at Ently (including whether lessons of
earlier operationswere taken into account, riskr and their mitigation identified, and adequacy of
participatory processes, as applicable):

 The project supported the priorities set by the government in its Strategic Plan for the education-
 sector: providinguniversal access to basic education, eliminating all multiple school shifts in
 basic education; focusing on enrolling girls; and improving the quality of education. It also
 responded to one of the key themes in the Egypt Country Assistance Strategy (No. P-6263-
 EGT, discussedby the Board of ExecutiveDirectors in March 1994) regarding the development
 of human capital to foster economic growth.

 The government's plan constituted a 15-year program to which the project was to contribute
 during the first phase of five years.

 The project was to cover the full range of policy planning and decision making at the central
 and local levels,teacher training, data collection and use, and community participation. It was
 properly focusedon the most disadvantaged areas, and projected to be implemented gradually.
 Efficient implementationwould be ensured through detailed working plans, to be agreed upon
 annually.

 Because of the need for MOE to improve its planning and administrative capacities, as well as
 the complexityof handling a sector-wideprigram, itwas decided t6 establish special project
 implementationunits, both at the central (PPMU) and the governorate (GPPMU) levels. This
 was also considered to be the onlyway ti ensurethat well-trained and experienced project staff
 would be recruited in an enviro&entbhere public pay was too low and hotivatiod among civil
 servants was absent. As mentioned in the StaffAppraisal Report (SAR, page 8),the role of the

 PPMU was extended to local GPPMUs to facilitate the elaboration of annual working plans at
 the governorate level, "with the participation of NGOs, parents, teachers, and headmasters.
 Institutionalizationof this process would be a major project benefit."

 The project was designed with the help of an experienced team of Bank and EU specialists who
 took into accountthe education sector lessons learned by those agencies, as well as those from
 the activities of USAID, UNICEF, and KfW. As mentioned in the SAR (p.4), "the key lesson
 learned fiom various donors' involvement is the difficulty of spreading positive innovations
 throughout the regular system without fully integrating activities with the public system from
 the beginning." Therefore,the project was designed to have the activities of the PPMU
1integrated into the overall MOE structure over the project period.

 The agreement to have ajoint operation with the EU was a positive development, allowing the
 Bank and EU to pool their resources, and the government to reduce the difficulty of donor
 coordination.

 However, certain project risks were underestimated, particularly with regards to the project's
 third developmentobjective (system efficiency). The overall rating given in the SAR was
 moderate and shouldhave been at least significant.Although risks were well detailed,
 measures to alleviatethem could not be implemented or did not have the intended effect:


      (9          Low teacher salaries were recognized as a potential risk to the sustainability of
     the project. Insufficientlevels of remuneration could make it more difficult for teachers
     and administratorsto permanently incorporate innovations introduced by the program into
     their practice. The SAR indicated that this issue would be addressed through teacher
     training and performance-based incentives in project schools (especially in the ESP). Also,
     it was assumed that the overall issue of teacher pay would be attended to over the life of the
     project. Teacher pay has proven to be a difficult and contentiouspolicy issue to resolve
     (includingthe notion of performance-based pay); as a consequence the sustainability of
     project outcomes with regards to improvements to instruction and schoolmanagement
     could be compromised.


     (ii)        As mentioned above, the PPMU and GPPMU were designed to be temporary
     entities that would eventually be integrated into the MOE structure. The project expected
     that training and equipping the MOE structures would mark the way for this transfer to
     occur, particularly with regards to program and strategic management hctions. However,
     because of the lack of incentives for MOE staff to play their newly expected roles and the
     ambiguous lines of authority that exist within the ministry (see more detailed description in
     Section 2.5), this handover could not occur. Although the staff members of the GPPMU
     (thoughnot yet those of the PPMU) have been reassigned to government positions, neither
     the MOE nor the governorates have incorporated the program and strategic management
     hnctions of these units.


     (iii)       Theproject was designed to be implemented in five years. This proved to be an
     optimistic projection considering the complexity and sector wide character of the project.
     As discussed later, the extension was primarily the result of difficulties with the

     management of the pre-service sub-component,which required the involvement of two
     ministries (MOE and MOHE). The standard disbursementprofile for Egypt has
     historically been nine years and this trend had not been taken into considerationin project
     design. One advantage to these extensions, however, has been the opportunityto
     commencenew activities (e.g., the EffectiveSchoolsProgram) that added definite value to
     the overallprogram.

2.2     Implementation (including anyproject changes/restructuring,mid-term review, Projecl
at Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable):

 Inlplementationarrangementswere not substantially changed over the life of the project. The
 final outputs of the project speak to the ultimate ability of the project team to deliver
 infrastructure, equipment, training and capacitybuilding. Project implementation benefited
 from staff continuityand the availability of specialistsfrom the Bank's Cairo office. However,
 theproject's closingdate was extended twice, though this was not the result of shortcomingsin
 overall project management. Extensionswere essentially the result of the lengthy approval
 process (inparticular,obtaining parliamentary loan ratification)that affects all Bank-financed
 projects in Egypt and delays in the transfer of responsibilities for certain sub-components(pre-
I

 service training) fiom the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of Higher Education.

 Once implementationcommenced (after loan ratification, which took 6 months following
 negotiations), the project initially focused on expandingaccess to schools in underserved areas,
 with school constructionas the main activity. Theproject subsequentlyshifted emphasis to
 capacitybuilding,training activities, and procurement of equipment for schools and the MOE.
 Followingthe mid-term reviews (MTR) in May 2001 and February2002, it was agreed that,
 with the accessand equity objectives substantiallyachieved, hrther efforts to improvequality
 and foster sustainabilitywould be implemented,includingthe measurement of student
 achievementand other impact outcomes. Thus, the project was to focus on: (i) qualityand
 bottom-up approachesto quality support; (ii) sustainabilityvia the creation of conditionsfor
 gradually shiftingreform andprogram management responsibilities to the relevant units within
 MOE and at the local levels; and(iii) improvedmonitoring and evaluation, includingstudent
 achievementtesting.

 Until the MTR, the sub-componentconcerning pre-service education had made little progress.
 Thiswas essentiallybecause the Ministry of Education was divided into two ministries in 1997
 (pre-university and university), with the responsibilityfor this componentto be transferred to
 the new Ministry of Higher Education. This change was linked to the larger reform of the
 Faculties of Educationto address the development of educationstandards,cumcula changes,
 and staffprofessional development. The modification required a special allocationunder the
 Credit of US$13 million equivalentto be managed by MOHE. This transfer slowed decision
 making, approvalsand assignment of responsibilities, leading to the initial slow implementation
 of this sub-component. As a consequence, once agreementwas reached between the two
 ministries, the first of two extensions was granted in order to finish the implementationof the
 Faculties of Education sub-component. However, implementationcontinuedto be slow
 because it was contingent on the start-up of the Higher Education Enhancement Project
 (HEEP). It took until mid-2003 for the HEEP project to establish a PMU responsible for

overall implementation,includingthe Faculties of Education sub-component. This led to an
agreementto a second extension until August 2006. This second extension also allowed the
project to continuethe implementation of the Effective Schools Project that had been initiated
in 2004 (see below).

To improve the prospects for sustainability,effortswere made to strengthenMOE's
commitment to the project, includinga specialstudyin 2003 that detailed arrangements for
transferring the program from the PPMU to MOE. However, as mentioned earlier, these efforts
could not addressthe structural limitations that have limited the possibility of the MOE to take
on many PPMU functions. Special effortswere also made to encourage a shift in MOE towards
a more decentralized approach,including increasingcomrnunityparticipationin school
management.

The project underwent a Quality of SupervisionAssessment (QSA) in Septemberand in
November 2004. The assessment's main implementation recommendations were that the
project : (i) carry out an early stock taking of resultsof the quality improvementsto be
undertaken; (ii) evaluate the impact of teacher and social worker training programs and the
computer laboratoriesat the school level; (iii) initiatenew policies on teacher incentivesthat
link pay to performance; (iv) follow up on the dismantling of the PPMU to ensure that there
was adequate capacity at the responsible central and governoratelevels; and (v) strengthen the
access and equity impact indicatorsbeyond output-basedmeasurements of schools and girls'
enrollment. The Bank and EU teams did pursue these recommendations, but apart fi-om
canyingout someproject-fimded studies, they have generally not yet been implemented. These
recommendations did not take into consideration someof the structural limitations to their
realization.

In December 2004, the project initiated the government's ESP, which was designed to enable
clusters of schoolsto improve performance in line with the new and improvedEgyptian
National Standards. The project targeted 300 schoolsin 10governorates; an additional 100
schools were added to the pilot in August 2006. The ESP aimed to develop: (i) systems and
procedures for supportingschoolimprovementactivities at the district level; (ii) a shared vision
and mission of the schools;(iii) improved community involvement in the schools; (iv)
improved systemsof professionaldevelopmentat the schools; (v) systemsaimed at improving
teaching and learning-in-placeat the schools;and (vi)improved evaluation systems at the
schools.

For the last year of project implementation,it was decided that the remaining h d i n g and
technical assistanceshould focuson the ESP, pre-service teacher training, computer acquisition,
monitoring and evaluation, and MOE capacitybuilding, includingmiddle-management
overseas training.

As the project was a constituent part of the overall government Program, the project extensions
overlapped with the continued implementationof government efforts to improve access, quality
and efficiency. As a consequence,the government contribution to the overallprogram was over
three times the amount originally appraised.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

 Proposed monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activitieswere initially affected by the absence ofa
 fully developed education management information system (EMIS). Before the start of the
 project, systems used by some of the major MOE agencieswere not integrated into a
 comprehensiveEMIS. As a result of the overall project effortsto improve the EMIS, this
 integration eventually took place. In consequence,project M&E progressively improved. In
 January 2005 the Bank-EU team encouraged the PPMU to make specific improvementsto its
 M&E capacity, which led to improved reporting.

 Various assessmentstook place over the life of the project,.including: (i) baseline assessments
 of Arabic, mathematics, and critical thinking in 11governoratesat the start of the project and in
 2003104; (ii) the first two phases of a longitudinal study in 2005 and 2006; (iii) a qualitative
 evaluationof community participation;(iv) a study of the impact of middle management
 training abroad; (v) an end-of project assessment of ESP in September 2006; and (vi) a
 qualitativestudy capturingbest practice and lessons learned from ESP, also in September2006.
 In addition, Egyptparticipated in the Trends In InternationalMathematicsand Science Study
 (TIMSS) in 2003.

 The standardized assessment (see Annex 5) was implementednationwide with a baseline
 measurement of 1,700schools covering all targeted governorates. The study measured
 achievement for students in grades 5 and 8 in the fields of Arabic, mathematics, science,
 English, and social studies. The'project financed internationalexpertiseto build capacity in the
 MOE in the areas of sampling and scalingmethods, and multivariate modeling. Two
 measurementswere completed in February2006 and early 2007; the third measurement has yet
 to begin.

 One of the keybeneficiariesof efforts to improve M&E was Egypt's National Center for
 Education Examinations and Evaluation (NCEEE), which piloted most of these assessments
 with project support. As a consequence, this agency has established a significant assessment



2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary ComplianceCfocusingon issues and their resolution,as
applicable):

 Both procurement and financial management were generally satisfactory,with relatively minor
 issues quickly resolved. Audit reportswere generally timely and satisfactory.

2.5     Post-completionOperationlNext Phase (includingtransition arrangement topost-
completion operation of investhentsjnanced bypresent operation, Operation & Maintenance
arrangements,sustaining reformsand institutional capacity, and nextphase/folZow-upoperation,
zj-applicable):

 Key achievementsof the project, such as higher enrollmentrates, gender equity, reductionsin
 classsize, and repetition and drop-out rates can be expected to be maintained after project
 completion. Because the project provided increasingly substantialresources for technical

assistance and capacity building, includingtraining of teachers and inspectors, and capacity
building for researchers and MOE administrationstaff (benefiting thousandsof individuals),
teachingpractices and regular school and administrativeoperations have made improvements
that are expected to be maintained. However,low teacher and administratorremuneration,
coupled with high administratorlteacherratios, provide few incentives to sustain many of these
improvements over the long term.

The earlier-mentionedMOHE-managed component,together with other teacher training
activities carriedout under the ongoing HEEP, led to substantial strengtheningof the Faculties
of Education. To fully ensure the sustainabilityof this component, HEEP funded an additional
year of implementationfor the Faculties of Education component.

Many project activitieswere implemented via specialized agencies (e.g., construction by the
Government Authority for Education Building; training by the Central Department for In-
ServiceTraining; assessmentby the NCEEE). These improvements in capacity are expected to
be retained, as these institutionswere already well resourced and operational at the time of
project initiation.

However, as mentioned earlier, the transfer of the planning and management expertise honed b:
the PPMU to the MOE has been circumscribed by certain structural limitationsoutside the
control of the project. There are no arrangementsin place to transfer the coordination,
planning, and administrationresponsibilitiesof the PPMU to the MOE. As mentioned above,
this is the result of certain structuralconstraints. First, the MOE has limited authority to assign
additional responsibilitiesto line staff and hold them accountable for outputs. Furthermore,
personnel generally earn low salaries, lack motivation, and tend to be reluctant to take on
project management responsibilitieswithout incentivesbeyond currentpay scales. Also,
governmentper diem and travel reimbursement rates for civil servants are far below the actual
cost of doing business outside Cairo. The MOE cannotprovide financial incentives (or
reimbursecosts of doing business) for staffworking in project management as this would
represent a defacto change in current pay scales for selected staff, which would be against
overall government regulations. The PPMU approach provided the government the possibility
of paying higher salaries and putting together an external team of competent technicians and
managers to implement projects.

The initiation of a permanent unit under the MOE to help plan, monitor, follow up and
coordinatethe implementationof the differentprojects in the field of educationcould be a
solutionto attract upgraded professional members and strengthen the capacity of the MOE in
this regard. The MOE, however, cannot operate with this same flexibility and incentive
structurebecause of the constraintsmentioned earlier.

In assessing this issue, it shouldbe noted that: (i) the low pay and PPMU advantages and
drawbackswere described in the SAR,though, as mentioned in Section2.1, their risks were
underestimated; (ii) the project tried to addresssustainabilitythrough MOE capacity building,
governorate and district capacitybuilding, and the decentralized school-based approach pursue(
under the ESP; (iii) the project was projected to be the first phase of a 10-15 year program,
expectingmore robust results only at the end of the overall program; and (iv) the government

- continues to allocateconsiderable resourcesto the sector, and major donor financial and
 technical support is expected to continue. (A follow-up basic education operation is in the CAS
  programnled for FY2008). The continuation of the government's program, with possible Bank
  support, could provide opportunitiesto address these possible risks to future sustainability of
  outcomes.


 3.     Assessment of Outcomes


 3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

 The project objectivesare still highly relevant for Egypt's current efforts at modernization and
 social inclusion, particularly with its current levels of poverty and unemployment. Successfid
                                                                           -  -
 integration into global markets and the development of a knowledgeeconomy,the central tenets
 of the latest CAS (No. 3210-EGdiscussed by the Board on May 20,2005), require a strong
 foundation of access to qualitybasic education,particularly by disadvantagedpopulations. One
 of the projected outcomesof the CAS is "improving quality and relevance at all levels of the
 education system." The findings of the Egypt Public Expenditure Review (PER) of 2004105
 also supports the continued importance of developing educationoutcomes. Project design was
 comprehensive, and dealt with a range of sector issues of importance today; it rightly projected
 the need for a 10-15year program. As far as implementation is concerned, the major issue
 continuesto be the structural limitations affecting the MOE's capacity as discussed in Section
 2.5. These limitations, such as restrictionsto public sectorremuneration, must be addressed at a
 government-wide level.

 3.2    Achievement ofProject Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 2):

 a) Improving access. The government's overall program showed an increase in primary school
 NER for girls of 9.1 percent (from 87.5 percent to 96.6 percent), and an increase for boys of 8.8
 percent (from 90.9 percent to 99.7 percent). At the preparatory level,there was in increase for
Igirls o 22.2 percent (from 59.5 percent to 81.7percent); and for boys an increase of 21.6percent
1(from 62.7 percent to 84.3 percent). Although the gender gap was not included as one of the
Ioutcome indicators of the project, there has been a significantimprovement in closing this gap.
 Theseincreases in enrollmenthave reduced the primary Gender Parity Index (GPI) from 93.6 in
I

 1996to 95.3 in 2005 (if A1Azhar schoolswere not included in the calculations, GPI would be
 99.1). For the preparatory level the GPI declined from 94.8to 96.4 (without A1 Azhar it would
 have declined to 99.4). Egypt should attain 100percent net primary school enrollment before
 the end of the decade.

 The project played a significant role in efforts to achieve these outcomes. The project's focus
 on construction of schoolsin under-served areas, particularly for girlsand disadvantaged
 studentswas aparticularly important contribution. A total of 229 schoolswith 2,723
*classrooms were built in underserved areas,providing for an additional 109,000students

approach. Construction was complementedby more than 1,000awareness campaigns and
workshops to create more demand, particularly for the schoolingof girls, as well as the
provision of school uniforms and stationaryfor poor students. The component also contributed
to the developmentof second-chanceeducation for childrenbeyond the official school age in
communityschools and one-classroom schoolsthrough training and workshops, contributing to
the increase in NER. Finally, the componentprovided special software for blind students.

b) Improving quality. Improvements in the quality of instruction at the primary and
preparatorylevelswere measured through the use of standardize achievement tests administered
in the 11govemoratesof project intervention. The baseline was establishedin 1997for 5"' and
8'hgraders in the areas of Arabic, math, and critical thinking. The test was conducted again in
2003/2004. For 5Ihgraders, Arabic scores increased from 52.2 percent to 58.9 percent; math
scoresfrom43.2 percent to 50.2 percent; and critical thinkingscores fiom 48.4 percent to
50.8percent. For 8thgraders, Arabic scoresincreased fiom 55.5 percent to 59.8 percent; math
scoresfrom 43.8 percent to 48.6 percent and critical thinking scores fiom 56.3 to 57.1 percent.
Arabic and math scores are significantas these are scores in govemorates where the project
intervened; there isreasonablelikelihood that the project contributed to this increase. Also, the
TIMSS data analysis showed that learning achievement in Egypt is on par with the region and
otherdeveloping counties, when GDP per capital is taken into consideration. Repetition rates
were reduced to less than 4 percent in primary education and 8.5 percent in preparatory
education. Finally, average class size at the national level is down to 41, which is about the
world averagein class size accordingto W S C O .

The government also conducted a study on quality that tends to show more mixed results in
terms of improvements. This study focused specifically on schools included in the ESP.
However, it shouldbe cautioned that the studyhas only reported tentative findings and that
fiuther follow-up measurements are planned that should render more precise results. The
references longitudinalstudy (for which results are reported in Annex 5) indicatesthat whereas
there appears to be a significant improvement in preparatory schools, there has been no effect in
the primary schools (by some measures, control schools even did better). The study was
constructed to explorewhich factors appearto have the greatest effect on achievement. Aside
fiom socio-economic status and geography (urban vs. rural), the factors that appear to
contributeto higher achievement are schoolclimate, assistanceprovided to students for their
homework and the presence of computers. One of the implicationsof this study is that quality
may be inequitablydistributed(a findingconfirmedby an education sectorpaper being
prepared by the Bank this year). These resultspoint to the need for further analysis of the
contributingfactorsto quality. However, in terms of the measurement establishedfor this
project (reported earlier), the project did exceed its target scores.

The government strategy for improving quality,to which the project contributed,consisted of
three primary inputs: (i) reducing the prevalence of multi-shift teaching; (ii) improved pre-
serviceand in-service teacher training; and (iii) equipment (particularly computers) for schools.

The project built 143schoolsfor the specificpurpose of reducing the number of double and
fi

 This translated into an additional 3,052 classrooms for approximately 122,000students. The
 project also provided for pre- and in-servicetraining for more than 500,000 teachers, with in-
 service training focusing on distance learning, as well as training of inspectors. This activity
 included modernizing regional training and videoconference centers. The pre-service training
 program, under MOHE responsibilitysince 2002 (see Section 2.2 and Section F.1), supported
 the comprehensive,institutionalreform of the 26 Faculties of Education and provided for new
 teaching methodologies and upgraded facilities (including the establishment of data resource
 centers, education technology centers, electronic libraries, multi-media study centers, and a
 wide variety of computer laboratories). It also enhanced the quality of training and introduced
 monitoring and evaluationpolicies and practices.

 As of September 2004, this component included the ESP initiative (see Section .2.2), with its
 emphasis on school-basedmanagement.

 c) Improving system efficiency. Efforts to improve the efficiency of the education systemhad
 more mixed results. On a positivenote, there have been significant improvements in equipping
 the MOE with the means of generatinginformation. All 27 governorates and the MOE now use
 the (EMIS) that has been reinforced and integrated. Data collection has been decentralized to
 schoolsand progressively integrated at the center. Furthermore, through the ESP approach, the
 stagehas been set for a more efficient decentralized, school-based management. However,
 other goals were not fully met. Most importantly, as pointed out in previous sections, MOE
program management capacity was not significantly improved and measures for improving
teacher motivation and accountabilitycould not be put in place. In addition, the data generated
by the EMIS are not being used for regular decision making at the Ministry level. As indicated
previously,this was primarilythe result of structural constraints rather than the efforts of the
project (which met its material objectives). According to the Egypt PER of 2004105,
governanceremains highly centralizedand bureaucratic, with little empowerment of, or input
from, local stakeholders. As mentioned earlier the sustainability of project outcomes may be
limited as a consequence.

This component alsoprovided for training, including overseas, of managers at MOE and its
associated agencies, as well as school managers, principals, and deputies. An assessment shows
that approximately50 percent of the managers report that they apply what they learned.
Finally, MOE and governorate staff benefited from technical assistance and training for policy
planning, its financial management system, and M&E activities.

3.3    EfJiciency (NetPresent Value/EconomicRate ofReturn, cost efectiveness, e.g.,unit rate
norms, least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate ofReturn):

The SAR did not include a cost-benefit study and no quantitative analysis was conducted at the
ICR stage. However,the results of the PER provide some of the elements to carry out a cursory
analysis of the overall costs and benefits of the government's program, to which the project has
contributed.

Benefits: As discussedearlier, all access and equity indicators increased significantly overthe
life of the project. These achievementsindicate that primary education is now serving the entire

1 Egyptian   population. The government's strategy to elicit and provide for more beneficiaries at     1
 this level of instruction has evidently been successful. The reduction of repetition and drop out
 rates at the primary level also reflect a system that makes better use of its resources to provide a
  complete cycle of education to its beneficiaries. Although much more difficult to quantify,
  there are also signs that the academic achievement of beneficiaries is on the rise, as per the
  results of different beneficiary assessmentsreferred to earlier. Most external efficiency results
  (such as employability or contribution to GDP growth) must be measured in the long term.
  However, if it is assumed that all primary school graduates have attained literacy, the youth and
  adult literacyrates will increase over time. It thus appears that the teachertraining, equipment,
  introductionof new teaching methodologies,and reduction of multi-grade classes introduced
  under the government's program have affected qualitylefficiency, though a direct causal
  relationship cannot yet be ascertainedwith the data at hand. There is some evidence that the
  introductionof computers can be linkedto student outcomes(accordingto the longitudinal
  study). The TIMSS results showthat 20 percent of mathematicsteachers and more than 40
 percent of scienceteachers reported the usefulness of computers to teaching; in addition,
 students taught by teachers who reported better computer availability have achieved a
 significantlyhigher learning level than other students. Overall, it can be inferred that the
 education system is producing better results than before project initiation.

 But at what cost? Accordingto the PER, unit costs have not fallenover the last decade. On the
 recurrent costs side, average personnel costs have increased because of (i) increased salaries,
  (ii) the reduction of student-teacherratios, and (iii) the continued high ratio of teachers to
 administrativestaff. With regards to non-salary recurrent expenditures,textbooks are expensive
 compared to other countries; maintenance is also underfinanced. On the investment side, there
 is conflictingdata with regardsto the averagecost of school construction. The government
 contendsthat its advanced needs-based strategy has reduced unit costs relativeto the past. The
 PER claimsthat costs remain high relativeto other countriesbecause constructionmethods are
 not efficient. Further analysis is required to assess this element.

 The long implementation period of 9 years instead of the projected 5 years, and the
 considerablylarger allocation that the governmentmade for basic education expansion
 introducesanother element to take into consideration for a cost-benefit analysis. Precise
 calculationsare not possible because of a lack of data. However,it appearsthat the longer
 period of implementation and the additionalgovernment resources produced a commensurate
 increase in outcomes. For example, the number of schoolsconstructedby the government
1during                                                                             -
          this period led to the program surpassingcalculations.

3.4      Justijication of Overall Outcome Rating (combiningrelevance, achievement of PDOs,
and efficiency):

IRating: 1 Moderately  Satisfactory


 The first two objectives of the government's program (to which the project has contributed)
 have been met and surpassed. The substantialquantitative achievementsin access and equity
 were combined with an impressive beginning of qualitativeachievements. However, this
 achievement is counterbalancedby a less extensiveoutcome for the third objective, particularly

 observation that central decision making is not yet based on the data produced by the EMIS.
 Furthermore,the overall risk to sustainability (essentially the result of the same factors
 discussed above) appearshigh. As a consequence of these results, the overall outcome rating is
  moderatelysatisfactory.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomesand Impacts (vany, where notpreviously covered
or to amplrfi discussionabove):


(a)      Poverty Impacts, GenderAspects, and Social Development

                                                                                            -- --
  The impact of the improvements in access and equity produc~overthe life of the project on
 poverty alleviation is difficultto ascertain. It is generally accepted in education literature that
 more and better education has a positive impact on poverty alleviation. Particularly, the growth
  of the Gender Parity Index (reported in Section 3.2), corresponding to an increase in the number
 of girls in school, is expected to have a positive social and economic impact. However, for a
 variety of reasons outside the purview of the education sector, Egypt's overall poverty level is
 back to 19.6 percent, where it was in 1995/96(Household Income and Expenditure Survey,
  2005).


)        Institutional Change/Strengthening(jarticularly withreference to impacts on longer-
term capaciv and institutional development):

  The project did strengthen the MOE's EMIS, allowing the country to participate in TIMSS and
 to provide the data base for M&E activities. It also contributedto improvingthe capacity of
  specialized agencies of the MOE in implementation: teacher training, construction, textbook
  management, and research, as well as for the Faculties of Education reforms. In addition, the
  ESP has contributed to the empowerment of parent committees(Boards of Trustees). The
  initial results of the ESP seem positive, including a recent decision to allow schools to keep the
  h d s they collect.

  However, as discussed in Section 3.2 (c), overall strategicmanagement and planning capacity
  of the MOE has not improved because of the structural constraints presented above.

 The learningresults of the project were measured by the above mentioned standardized
 achievementtests in 11 governoratesat the start of the project and in 2003104, as well as by the
 nation-widelongitudinal studies,of which the results for first phase were published in February
 2006 and the second is expected shortly. The third phase is still to be carried out. As detailed
 in Annex 5, those studiesconfirm the generally positive impact of the program activities,
 already mentioned in Section 3.2.                                 ---                       -


4.      Assessmentof Risk to Development Outcome




 The government's commitment to educationremains strong (total public spending on education
 is high by international standards): 5.9 percent of GDP and 19percent of total public spending
 in 2002/03), and universal coverage is almost within reach. In addition, there has been a
 significanteffortto reach disadvantaged areas and to reduce gender disparities. This was a
 substantial achievement, and is not likelyto change. Further quality improvementswill depend
 on continuingand expanding implementationof successful programs such as the ESP, which is
 based on a decentralized,school-basedapproach, with community participation. The MOE's
 capacity to manage these complex effortsis still circumscribedbecause of the structural
 limitations described in Section 2.5. Although it is now working on a new strategic plan
 essentially focused on the instructionalquality and decentralization, its program and strategic
 management capacity remains a key issuefor future program implementation.

 The project responded to the priorities of the government, and reflected one of the key
 objectives of the CAS. The team, in close cooperationwith EU and MOE specialists,
 succeeded in designing a relevant project, covering the first phase of a 10-15year sector policy
 and operational program. It introducedinnovations such as least-cost school mapping, reliable
 data collection and use, teacher upgrading, and decentralizationand participation. However, the
 designteam was overambitiousin its assessmentthat MOE would be able to gradually and fully
 take over the full range of PPMU activities. Its appraisal that complex policy changes, such as
 for teacher incentivesand decentralization,could occur in five years was alsonot realistic. This
 was reflected in its underestimationof the implementation risks. As a consequence, project

  (b) Qualityof Supervision (includingof fiduciary and safeguards policies):

  I Rating:  1         Moderalely Satisfcrcto~y]


   As mentioned in Section .2.2,the quality of project supervisionwas assessed by the Bank's
   Quality Assurance Group in September and November of 2004, resulting in a rating of 3
   (moderatelysatisfactory). The Quality of Supervision Assessment identified the overly
   optimistic implementationschedule as the main problem, and made a number of
   recommendations on project implementation;these were followed up by the task team.

   Apart from the implementationschedule, until the MTR inMay 2001 and February 2002, the
   realism of project performanceratings was questionable. Initially, most of the emphasis was
   put on implementingthe constructionof schools to improveaccess; the other components did
   not progress at the same speed,but this was not reflected in the ratings.

   Following its transfer to MOHE, the Faculties of Education component was supervised by the
   team responsible for the Higher Education Enhancement Project.

   The Bank's task team, in close cooperation with, and with substantial support from the EU,
   attempted to deal with the full rangeof sector policy and operational issues. Joint missions
   were carried out twice a year based on an agreed schedule&d specialist experts were provided
   by both organization (see SectionF.2 and Annex 4). Mission findings were well-documented
                                                                                -

   First, the project design had underestimated the constraintsto creating the conditions within the

   Government commitmentto the project was shown by its ongoing impressive budgetary
   support, as well as a wide variety of efforts aimed at introducing quality and efficiency

  improvements. However, the full and long-term impact of these efforts during the subsequent
  phase of the government's program will be compromised because the project did not transfer
  the strategicmanagement functionsnecessary for many of the more complex activities. MOHE

 (c) Justification of Ratingfor Overall Borrower Performance:

  The achievementof the access and equity objectives is considered to be laudable. Targets had
  been surpassed. The government's increased contribution to meeting these objectives
  transformedthe education system. In addition,the govemment,through the MOE,did provide
  reliable and sufficientbudgetary support, allowingthe PPMU to manage the project effectively
  for the production of planned outputs. However, efforts to address constraints to MOE policy
  and strategicmanagement hctions produced fewer results. Also, as a result of the slow start
  of project implementation (particularlythe sub-componentassigned to the MOHE) contributed
  to theneed to extend the project. As a consequence, overall performance is rated moderately
  satisfactorv.


6.       Lessons Learned(both project-specific and of wide general application)


   1. The long disbursementprofile indicates that different approaches to project design
       need to be adopted. Bank and govemmentmay want to consider using loan instruments
       other than standard investment projects, such as DevelopmentPolicy Lending, which is
       linked to policy changes and indicatorsrather than the management of outputs. If standard
       investmentprojects are to be used, more realistic assessmentsof the disbursement profile
       need to be incorporatedinto project design.

   2. The structuralconstraintsto the MOE's program and strategic management capacity
       need to be addressed as an explicittargetof sector development strategies. A key
       result of this ICR is that these constraintscannot be addressed through technical
       interventions alone. A carefbl assessment of program management opportunities and
       limitations, from a structuralperspective, should be undertaken to better understand how
       these can be addressed. Specificbenchmarks, linked to the design and implementation of
       the Bank's operation,could then be establishedto track these identified improvements.
       Several initiativescurrentlyunder preparation or under way could providevenues for this
       type of approach (e-g.,theestablishment of the Teacher     t cad ern^ todeal with the issue of

             teacher motivation; the operationalizationof quality assurance authority to provide a
             framework for greater accountability;and the implementation of the strategic plan, which
             in part aims to reinforce MOE leadership).

             3. Merge sector dialogue with government-widediscussions. In many cases, the impact
             of education projects is circumscribed by government-wide constraints. Education sector
             improvements are linked to progress in other government-wide reforms and initiatives,
             such as decentralization,promotion of the private sector, and civil service reform. To
             address structuralissues such as MOE7sabsorptivecapacity, teacher incentives, and
             decentralization, policy dialogue that includes the MOE, as well as a wide range of other
             government authorities and education stakeholders(e.g., Ministry of Finance, Parliament),
             should be undertaken.

         4. Experimentwith new approaches to program management in lieu of using PPMUs.
             One possibility would be to establish temporaryarrangements within the MOE to provide
             strategic management support to the minister and cabinet. The group currently developing
             the strategicplan may provide the embryo for this unit. This unit will need to benefit from
             the same advantages and flexibilityas found within a PPMU.

          5. Create the conditionsto successfully generalize promising approaches. There are
              several successfulinitiativesintroduced by the project, such as the ESP, the use of
              communityparticipation, improvements in pre-service training, and changes to the EMIS
              that have been undertaken as pilots. To build on these successes, efforts should focus on
              ways to incorporate and maintain them into standard practice.

1.Improving Access and Equity. (total costs US$1075.9 million, compared to US$448.5 million
projccted at appraisal; IDA contribution US$21.3 million, compared to projected US$17.5 million):

1.1 Construction of schools in deprived areas. To reach targeted populations in deprived socio-
economic areas, school site selection was based on a computerized school mapping system. Specific
selection criteriawere developed to ensure that schools would be built in underserved areas. A total of
229 schoolswere built under this subcomponent,providing 2,723 new classrooms with a capacityto
enroll 108,920additional students. NERs in the beneficiary governoratesreached 80 percent, and the
gender gap decreased to less than one percent in both primary and preparatoryschools.

1.2Awareness campaigns. One of the key activitiesof the project was the development of awareness
campaigns to reach out-of-school children (particularly girls) and dropouts. These awareness campaigns
were conducted in the form of workshops in thosetargeted areas for which a school site had been
identified for construction. Key to the success of the awareness campaignswas the participation of local
communities, NGOs, leaders, women associations,school officials and parents associations in the
workshops. These workshops would identify specificproblems at the local level that would hinder
children's school participation and would then propose appropriate solutions. PPMUs in different
governorates were responsible for the preparation of a national conferenceto disseminate the results of
the awareness campaigns and to develop policy options for the MOE to promote community
participation.

A total of 1,064awareness campaigns in 742 villages in the 15targeted governorates were conducted
under the project. As a result of the recommendationsfrom the awarenesscampaigns, a total of 107,000
pupils received different forms of assistance (i.e., access to school uniforms and to learning materials
and stationary)and about 25,000 drop-outs rejoined basic education.

1.3 Second chance education. Large numbers of children in Egypt are out of school, either because
they dropped out at some stageor because they never attended school. The project financed the
construction of 3,147 one-classroom schools to accommodateabout 70,000 out-of-age children in
alternativebasic education programs. More than 2,500 facilitators were trained by the project.

1.4Provision of equipment and teaching materials. About 1,285schoolsbenefited from upgrades
and new equipment for ICT, including computer labs, access to internet, educational software,
classroom furnitureand special equipment for visually impaired students.

2. Improving the quality of student performance. (total costs US$1,227.2 million, compared to
US$359.0million projected at appraisal; IDA contributionUS$46.0 million, compared to projected
US$51.6million):

2.1 Reducingovercrowding and multiple shift schools. Oneof the main reasons of poor school
performancehas been large class size and the utilization of schools in multiple shifts to accommodate
increasing enrollment. The latter resulted in fewer hours of instructionper shift. Out of the 224 schools
built under this subcomponent, 143schools aimed to reduce multiple shifts. The Ministry was able to
reduce the proportion of multi-shift schools to 70 percent. The other 81 schools were financed to reduce

 about 41 students per class. The extra 3,052 classroomscompleted for these efforts benefited about
 122,000 students.

 2.2 Improving the quality of teaching and learning. Jmproving the quality of human resources in
 basic education was a key project theme. A national training scheme was implemented, providing
 teachers, managers and staff with opportunities for continuous training, distance learning and training
 abroad. hportant training programs supported by the project include:

 2.2.1. Pre-service teacher training. Oriented towardsnewly appointedteachers, a total of about 28,000
 teachers received pedagogical, ICT and English language training. The training included three months
 of practical training in a classroom setting.After this activity became the responsibility of MOHE in
 April 2002, therewas a virtual halt in activitiesuntil the Higher Education Enhancement Project became
 operational about a year later. Subsequently,based on a detailed needs survey, the 26 Faculties of
 Education received both training and equipment support,for (a) creating a scientific environment for
 development, (b) reforming the teacherpreparation system, (c) enhancingprofessional development of
Iteaching staff and assistants through diverse training courses, (d) improvingthe infrastructure quality of
1the Faculties through technological laboratories,(e) ensuring quality performance in 19Faculties, (f)
Iadopting a self-reformapproach by the Faculties, and (g) cooperating with public schools and other
Ienhancementprojects. Despite its short implementation period, much was achieved (see Annex l), Still,
 compared to the projection at appraisal, the component was more limited; as a result, funding under the
 Credit was reduced fiom about US$25 million to US$15 million.

 2.2.2. In-service training. This activityprovided teachers with training in modem educational and
 technological methods. Main targets were teachers and school inspectorsin Math, English language,
 Arabic language and Science, both at primary and preparatory levels. In addition, the training programs
 focused on teaching strategies, evaluation of studentpeiformance, application of national standards,
 implementation of new cumcula and school management. A total of 41 training programs were
 implemented, including:

         Distance learning for effectiveteaching skills. With more than 500,000 teachers in basic
         education,the project had to face the challengeof reaching-out and providing training services to
         such a large population. Self-learningmodules were prepared to introduce teachers to modem
         teaching methods and skills. The modules included a printed manual and audio and video media.
         These modules were first piloted in five governorates and, after having benefited over 1600
         teachers, were evaluated in a workshop and then implemented at a national level. About 78,000
         teachers benefited fiom these programs.
         Technology in the classroom. About 70,000 teachers in grades 1-5received training for the
         introduction of technology in the classroom. Teams of supervisorswere also trained to cany out
         tutoring services for the beneficiaries.
         Training for Social Workers. About 35,000 social workers received training in the area of new
         trends in planning and assessment,includingstrategies to work with studentswith special needs.
         Training for teachers dealing with learning disabilities. A total of 400 trainers were trained and
         more than 20,000 teachers received training to provide studentswith learning disabilities with an
         inclusive environment.

increased by a substantial amount.

2.2.3 Effective School Program (ESP). The ESP program introduced community participation in
schools, and introduced Board of Trustees (BoT) in 294 schools out of the 300 originally targeted. As of
March 2006,134 BoTs had opened bank accounts. The ESP had developed a partnership with
"Purtnersfor Learning" (supportedby Microsoft Corporation) to assist 300 schools to develop
assessment and planning tools, and to train staff in the implementationof those tools. The program
provided grants and matching funds to schools to improve infrastructure and provide with additional
learning opportunitiesto students. The internationalNGO Save the Children participated in the program
to implement the establishment of BoTs in the schools and to mobilize community participation.

2.2.4. Capacity-BuildingFund. This activity aimed at improvingthe operational capabilities of various
government agencies, includingthe MOE, its regional training centers, the Centre for Curriculum and
instructional MaterialsDevelopment (CCIMD), the National Center for Examinations and Educational
Evaluation (NCEEE), and the National Center for Educational Research and Development (NCERD).
These institutionswere equipped with ICT and office equipment, including videoconferencing facilities.

3. Improving system efficiency. (total costs US$47.1 million, compared to US$28.0 million projected
at appraisal; IDA contributionUS$9.4 million, compared to projected US$5.9 million):

3.1 Development of a management information system(MIS). An electronic network has been
implemented by the project to connect the Computer Information and Statistics Department (CISD) in
MOE with local offices at the governorateand disdict levels. Most schools were connected to the
network which facilitated the preparationof the annual school survey. This also promoted data
compilation on pupils at the school level, which the CISD centralizes at the national level. All MOE
agencies have accessto this database, which is being used to produce education indicators for planning
and monitoring of educationoutcomes. Egypt recentlyjoined the World Education Indicators Program
organized by OECD/LJNESCO.

3.2 Training for middle level managers. A total of 660middle level managers in various groups
benefited from eight-week studytours in the United Kingdom to learn about school management
systems in the UK. The program included 11modules coveringtopics such as problem solving
strategies, communicationand leadership,management of change, education reform, strategic planning,
human resources development, management information systems, inspection and evaluation,
assessments and work plans.

 The SAR did not include a cost-benefit study and no quantitative analysis was conductedat the ICR
 stage. However,the results of the Public Expenditureprovide some of the elements to carry out a
--- analysisoftheoverallcostsandbenefitsofthegovernment'sprogram,towhichtheprojecthas
 cursory

 contributed.

,Benefits: As discussed above, all access and equity indicators increased significantlyover the life of the
 project. These achievements indicatethat primary educationis now servingthe entire Egyptian
 population.The government's strategyto elicit and provide for more beneficiariesat this level of
 instructionhas evidentlybeen successful. The reduction of repetition and drop out rates at the primary
 level also reflect a system that makes better use of itsresources to provide a complete cycleof education"
 to its beneficiaries. Although much more difficult to quantify,there are also signs that the academic
 achievementof beneficiaries is on therise, as per the results of different beneficiaries assessment
 referred to above. Most external efficiencyresults (such as employabilityor contributionto GDP
 growth)must be measured in the long term. However, if it is assumed that all primary school graduates
 have attained literacy,the youth and adult literacy rates will increase over time. It thus appears that the
 teacher training,equipment, introduction of new teachingmethodology, and reduction of multi-grade
 classes introducedunder the government's program have affected qualityIeEciency, though a direct
 causal relationship cannot yet be ascertainedwith the data at hand. There is some evidence that the
 introduction of computers can be linked to student outcomes (accordingto the longitudinal study). The
 TIMSS results show that 20 percent of mathematicsteachers andmore than 40 percent of science
 teachers reported the usefulness of computers to teaching; in addition,studentstaught by teachers who
 reported better computer availabilityhave achieved a significantlyhigher learning level than other
 students. Overall, it can be inferred that the educationsystem is producing better results than before
 project initiation.

 But at what cost? Accordingto the PER, unit costshave not fallen over the last decade. On the
 recurrent costs side, averagepersonnel costshave increased,because of increased salaries, a reduction of
 student-teacherratios, and the continuedhigh ratio of teachers to administrative staff. With regards to
 non-salaryrecurrent expenditures,textbooksare highly-priced compared to other countries; also
 maintenance is underfinanced. On the investment side, there is conflicting data with regards to the
 average costsof schoolconstruction. The government contends that its advanced needs-based strategy
 has reduced unit costs relative to the past. The PER claims that costs remain high relative to other
 countries because construction methods are not efficient. Further analysis is required to assessthis
 element.

 Thelong implementationperiod of 9 yearsinstead of the projected 5 years, and the considerably larger
 allocation that the              made for basic education expansion introducesanother elementto take
 into consideration for a cost-benefit analysis. Precise calculations are not possible because of a lack of
 data. However, it appears that the longer period of implementation and the additionalgovernment
 resources produced a commensurateincrease in outcomes. For example, the number of schools

 the control group. These findingswill require follow-up.

 The report had many other interestingobservations, which is why its executive summary is quoted
 verbatim below:
I
 Introduction

 In the longitudinalcohort study we monitor the development of pupils in primary and preparatory
 education over time and determinewhich pupil characteristics,teacherlclassroom and school factors
 have substantial impact on pupil achievement. The longitudinal study is a nation-wide study starting
 with a baseline measurement in which 1935 schools, 9675 teachers and 73842 pupils participated. Thi,
 baseline measurement study covers all governorates. The objectives of the study are:

  Provide a valid overview of quality a d output of Egypt's education system
  Assess the impact of the EducationEnhancement Program (EEP)

 We carriedout a multi-level analysis, in which we provide effectiveness scores (value added) for
 schools, this means that we take different enrolment characteristics of pupils (e.g. socio-economic
 status)into account. In this way we are able to make "fair comparisons" between schools, for example
 between experimental and control group schools or between pupil sub-groups. The focus is on
 achievementscores of five school subjects:Math, Science, Arabic, English and Social Studies.

The possibleimpact of pupil, classroom and school factors on achievement

The amount of variance in achievement situated at the student and schooVclassroon~level have been
determined first. Overall we conclude that between 33 percent (English) and 23 percent (Science) can be
situated at school/classroomlevel. Thus between one-quarterand one third of the differences between
pupil's achievement can be influenced by classroom, teacher and other school level characteristics. That
is, in comparison with international research, a high percentage. It emphasizes the extremely important
role schools can play in the learningprocess of young children in Egypt. We observe an even more
important role of the schoolsin primary education where the percentage of the school level variance is
higher than in preparatoryeducation.

Pupil achievement in experimental and control group schools
Do experimental schools differ from control group schools in their achievement, taking important
enrolment factors into account?That is one of the crucial issues in this study.
Based on the multi-level analyses, we conclude that pupils in the schools operating in the governorates
that are included in the EEP-program seem to perfom better than the pupils in the control group
schools. When splitting the sample of schools in two groups @rimary and preparatory stage schools), we
confirm this effect only in preparatory education. Thus, in preparatory education pupils in the
experimental group schools attain significant higher achievement levels compared to pupils in the
control group schools. This effect is valid for 4 out of 5 school subjects. Only in Arabic we observe no
achievement differencesbetween experimental and control group schools.

Determinants of pupil achievement
What factors do have a significantimpact on pupil achievement in Egypt? As an example we show the
impact of several factors on Math achievement. The significant factors on Math are (with few
exceptions) the same for all five school subjects. Where exceptions occur these will be mentioned.     .

1-Pupils in urban schoolsattain significantlyhigher scores in all subjectscompared to the pupils in rural
areas.

2- Socio-economicstatushas a strong impacton achievementin all subjects. This effect is even stronger
in preparatoryeducation, which implies that the disadvantages forpupils from low socio-economic
status families are more severe in the preparatory stage.

3- Pupils in the schools operating in the governoratesthat are included in the EEP-program seem to
perform better than the pupils in the control group schools (GROUP).When splitting the sample of
schoolsin two groups (primary and preparatory stage schools), we confirm this effect only in
preparatoryeducation.

4- No significantdifferenceoccurs in Math performance between boys and girls. However, in Arabic,
English and Social studieswe observe significant differences betweenboys and girls: in these subjects
girls outperform the boys. Onlyin Scienceboys perform better than girls.

5- While no effect occurs from single-sex or mixed-sex schools on Math and Science scores, we do
observe a significantpositive impact of gender-mixedschools on pupil achievement in English, Science
and Arabic.

6- Overall, we observeno significant effect ofprivate versus public schoolsin Math and Science
achievement.However, when we distinguishbetween primary and preparatory education, private
schools in the preparatory stage are attaining significantlyhigher achievement scores. Private schools
are realizinghigher achievement among their pupils than public schools, especially in the language
subjects.

7- Pupil-related factors with a significant and clearly interpretable effect on achievement are: the
intensity of parental help with school-work,and the amount of private teacher help. Pupils with parents
who invest their own time in supportingtheir childrenwith their homework and invest money in help by
private teachers,exert significant impact on their children's achievement.

School and classroom factors

8-The number of teachers receivingtraining in the context of the EEP-program, the perception of the
training (satisfaction)by the teachers, the availabilityof computers and adequate facilities in the school
all have a significantimpact on the performance of the pupils.

9-A positive schoolclimate (especiallyin primary education) exerts a positive effect on pupil's
achievement.The same applies for a school management that pays attention to the evaluation of the
activities of the schools' training unit and the teacher training activities.

10- It is remarkable that we observe no effects whatsoever on achievement of factors that are related to
education methods used in the classroom. The only exception is a significant negative effect of frontal
teaching on achievement in English.

11-Finally, we observe a negative effect on Scienceachievement from a more-than-one shift system.
This effect is strongestin preparatory education.

Conclusions

1- Between one-quarter and one-third of the differences between pupil achievement canbe influenced
by classroom, teacher and other school level characteristics.This outcome emphasizes the extremely
important role schools can play in the learning process of young children in Egypt. Also, it is important
to note that the possible impact of schools in primary education is even larger than in preparatory
education.

2- The results indicate that in preparatory educationpupils in the experimental group schools perform
significantlybetter compared to the pupils in the control group schools. This suggeststhat the approach
in the EEP-program may have been successful in preparatory education. However, also after controlling
for other factors such as socio-economic status we donot observe such an effect in primary education.

3- Future enhancementprograms need to analyze the cause for this differential effectbetween primary
and preparatory education. Future programs need even more than in the past to focus explicitly on
improving quality of and performance in primary education.

4- We have to urge for cautiousnesswith these results: only after comparing the results of the baseline
measurementwith follow-up measurements can we conclude reliably to an experimental group effect.

5- We conclude that the help of private tutoring (ofteachers) has a significant effect on pupil

Programs aimed at enablingparents in providing adequate support to their children are of pertinent
importance.                                                                                               -

6- School facilitiesare importantfor student success,especially the availability of computers, presence
and suitabilityof activity areas in the school, such as training halls and play yards.

7- Teacher training exerts a significant impact on student achievement; teacher quality remains a major
issue in schoolreform and improvement. Outcome of this study is that positive effects of teacher
training can be expected especiallywhen teachers show that they are satisfied with the training
activities. This implies that teacher training would always have to be accompanied by an independent
evaluation.

8- It is reinarkable that almost no classroom effects were found in this study. This might be due to the
fact that no observationswere made of teacher behavior in the classroom. All international studies show
that teacher quality is a crucial factor in school effectiveness. Exactly what classroom factors will have
impact on achievement and to what extent will vary locally. It is important to include classroom
observationstudies in the longitudinal research to identify the crucial factors in the Egyptian context.

9- It is remarkablethat no effect of school leadershiphas been found. This could be due to the fact that

1.Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

1.1 Project Original Objective: The objectives of the project are to enhance the MOE's ability to
achieveits major long-term goals with respect to improving: (i) coverage, particularly for girls; (ii) the
qualityof student learning; and (iii) the efficiency of the education system.

The MOE, together with IDA as administratorof the Interim Trust Fund, agreed that a broad and long-
term program approach, as opposed to a narrowly defined project with rigidly specified activities, would
be the most appropriateinstrument to achieve the government's goals in compulsory education. The
government developed a long-term StrategicFramework, which defined EEP's 13objectives and the
interventions it would pursue to achievethese goals. Core program activities would be determined each
year through an interactiveprocess and would be included in an annual work plan to be developed by a
Program Planning and Monitoring Unit (PPMU).

1.2 Revised Objective: The original objectiveswere not changed during project implementation.

1.3 Project Original Components: The original components of the project were relevant to achieving
the original objectives of the project.

ImprovingAccess. The goals of this component were to maintain the high enrollment rate for boys and
removethe gender disparities in girls' enrollment in basic education. Strategies to increaseparental
demand for girls' educationidentifiedin existingresearch would be proposed for adoption in culturally
conservative areas with low levels of girls enrollment, as well as additional measures identified through
the communitypreference survey.

Improving the Quality of Student Performance. The goals of this program area were to significantly
increase student achievementof basic skills and improve their critical thinking skills in the EEP targeted
governorates. National successwith these goals can be expected in 10to 15years as implementation of
most interventionswhich drive their achievementwould require at least two 5-year project cycles.
Therewere four specific objectivesin this component: (i) reduce wastage (repetition and dropout); (ii)
improve the quality of teaching and learning; (iii) improve the quality of the pre-service training
program; and (iv) build the capacityof implementing agencies to implement programs that focus on
improving the quality of education.

(i) reducing wastage: This would be accomplishedthrough two approaches: (i) reducing class size
(frequently as high as 60-70)and multiple shifts through school construction, to be pursued starting in
the first year of the program, and (ii) providing support to students with moderate learning difficulties.

(ii) improving the quality of teaching and learning: This wouId be achieved through five approaches
designed to tailor teaching to students' learning needs to: (i) reform in-service teacher training; (ii)
ensure effectiveuse in schools and classroomsof the government's investment in technology and
distance learning; (iii) institute student learning assessments to facilitate accountability of teachers,

principalsand others throughout the sector; (iv) introduce quality assurance systems for experienced
teachers; and (v)improve the quality of pre-service teacher training programs.

Improving System Efficiency. The goals of this component were to improvesystem efficiencythrough
improving the management of sector resources and to enable improvements in system effectiveness
through enhancingsector planning, decisionmaking and management. The PPMU worked with sector
agencies to increase capacity in these areas. A capacitybuilding hnd for training, studies, national and
foreign technical assistance, study visits and other capacity building measureswas established to
facilitatethis process. Continuous self-assessmentof capacitybuilding needs was part of the
management task of each Implementing Agency, including the PPMU itself.

1.4 Revised Components: None of the componentswere formallyrevised during project
implementation.Rather, the flexibilityinculcated in project design accommodated additional or
complementary,component-specific activities.

1.5 Quality at Entry: A UNDP grant was used for critical start-upactivities;thiswas oneof numerous
efforts by the task team to solicit donor support.

2.2 Outputs by componerzts:

Area I: ImprovingAccess and Equity

Construction in deprived areas: Enrollment rates improved in deprived areas by building new schools
within easy reach of targeted population. Site selection was based upon computerized school mapping
system, local review of enrollment rates and a process of identifying local community preferences. The
project built a total of 234 schools, accommodating 108,920pupils per year.

Awareness campaigns: Introducing concepts and developing strategies for awareness campaigrison the
importance of education was one of the fhdanlental contributions of EEP. Complementing
construction by awareness campaigns proved to be a promising approach to create more demand,
especially with respect to girls. Collaboration with NGOs was a major achievement in this process,
helping to secure sustainability and enabling the governorate departments of education (muderias)to
benefit from the experience of such organizations,especially in the context of communication with local
communities. The interventionsof community participation have been adopted as one of the five
fundamental domains of the national educationalstandards. It is also considered as one of the
characteristics of the "effective schools." In addition, the campaigns played an active role in decreasing
the numbers of the dropouts of boys and girls at both primary and preparatory education levels on the
targeted areas of the 15EEP governorates. The preliminary observations proved the success of such an
approach; however, the question of sustainabilityis still open. The vision of the MOE is to empower
underprivileged segments of the population to ensure the sustainability of community involvement
(Minister of Education meet with donors in 1999). The private sector and NGOs are expected to
continue to play active role.

Second ChanceEducatiorr: The MOE has been cooperating with interested NGOs to provide out-of-
school children with a second chance tojoin the system by developing alternate channels, such as
community schools and one-classroom schools (OCS). EEP financed the training of one-classroom and

community school facilitators implementedby the Center for Curriculum & instructional Materials
Development (CCIMD). The number of one-classroom schoolsreached 3,147, accommodating 69,170
children between 8-14 years of age (2004/2005),which contributed to an increase in GER.

Providing equipment and teaching materials: Upgrading existing schools with modem equipment was
another approachto improve the quality of education. Sixty-five schools on ten governorates received
specific equipment, 185schools were equipped with computer labs, and 1,000 schools were provided
with internet labs allowing50 studentsper day to access computers and internet connections.

PerformanceIndicators of Area I:

The figuresin Table 2 showthat universal participation is accomplished and the gender gap is closed.
However, more efforts are needed to reach the non participating slice of the school age population.

Area 11: Improving the quality of student performance

Thisprogram area aims at providing the student with appropriate exposure to a sound learning
environment to assist in acquiring active learning experiences and improve critical thinking skills. The
fundamental elements of effective schooling are considered in an integrated approach: extending the
learningtime by eliminatingmultiple shifts and reducing class density, training teachers on modem
technologies and teaching methodologies,involvingand upgrading inspectors' skills, and improving the
process of student performance evaluation.

Reduce repetition and dropout rates: Two approaches were adopted: namely, reducing class size to an
averageof 40 pupils per class; and eliminatingmultiple shifts through school construction. The project
built 143schools to assist in eliminatingmultiple shifts, while 81schools are delivered to help in
reducing class size. This exceeded the planned number of schoolsto be built. The government's overall
program produced 1,935classroomsto eliminate shifts, accommodating 77,400 pupils per year and
1,117classrooms to reduce density, accommodating44,680 pupils per year.


Another implemented intervention to retain studentswas providing adequate support to students with
moderate learning difficulties. Trainingprograms were implemented to tackle this issue through
training teachers in special skills and strategiesthat are effectivein supporting these children.

Improvingthe quality of teaching and learning: Face-to-face and distance learning approaches were
utilized to implement a national training scheme, as well as providing training abroad. The scheme

  provided an input of 36 pre-service and in-serviceprograms, targeting: school managers, teachers,
  inspectors, social workers and staff of special needs schools. The staff of the MOE Technology
  Development Center was another group of professionals serving the education system who are targeted
  by the EEP training scheme. Following is a samplecourses developed by EEP of individuallytailored
  to the professional needs of each "Target Group":

  Pre-service Teacher Training -internship program: Newly appointedteachers received training
  coursesto provide them with modern teaching and class management methodologies. Target size was
  11,000newly appointed teachers. The colleges of education implemented the first phase of the program.
. The secondphase was a teaching practice in the schools for three consecutivemonths. The third phase
  of the internshipprogram aimed at providing the teachers with the basic computer skills and a functional
  knowledge of English language.

  In-Service training: A comprehensivetrainingplan was implemented targetingteachers and inspectors
  of math, English, science, and Arabic of both primary and preparatory levels to improve: the use of
  technology, teaching strategies, evaluation of student performance, application of national standards,
  implementationof developed curricula,management of a school-based training and evaluation unit; and
  addressing mild learning disabilities. Another aspect of the professional developmentplan aimed at
  supportingthe transfer of science and math teachers to teach computersciences. Training was also
  provided to social workers and inspectors. Distance learning is one of the novel methods pioneered by
  EEP. It provides a feasible approach in dealing with such a massive communityof basic education
  teachers (more than half million)in terms of in servicetraining. This component also upgraded the staff
  of the Technology Development Center

  Effective School Project (ESP): Based on the successful interventionsof EEP, national education
  standards were established,and an MOE decreewas created to convert PTAs into more quality-focused
  Boards of Trustees (BOTs). The Effective SchoolsProgram (ESP) was also created and co-funded by
  the World Bank and European Union within EEP. The ESP began in September2004 and expected to
  end in September2006. The program aimed to assist 300 schoolsin ten governoratesto improve their
  servicesand facilitiesthrough: providing tools for self assessmentand planning; trainingstaff in self-
  assessment and planning skills;increasingcommunityparticipation in schools; and providing grants and
  matching funds. The improvementof the program continuesto be guided and measured against the
  national standards for education.

  Samplesof the ESP implementedtraining programs were selected for evaluation. The findings are
  summarizedbelow:

  TeachingMethodology: Distance Learning Program: new teachingmethods, such as role play and
  group work, were practiced and lesson plans improved.
  Thesocial workers'trainingprogram:community participation practices and activities related to
  providing assistance to unprivilegedpupils.
  Training on special education:traineesbecame more able to accept both the value and utility of
  educatingstudentswith special needs and their inclusion with the normal students in the mainstream
  education.
  Training to help teachers diagnose and remedy students with Mild Learning difficulties. Teachersbegan
  to go beyond their regular teaching skills.

Although EEP in-servicetraining has had an impact on classroompractices, there is limited documented
evidence to show the extent or the quality of the desired impact of the training and its large-scale
activities. Also, there is a need to explore common lessons learned in the process of planning and
implementing training, and to determine potentially sustainable elements of EEP training.

Capacity buildingfund: Need assessments of the NCEEE, CCIMD and NCERD were conducted to
identify and prioritize the specific needs of each agency. Modernizing the Regional Training Centers
and videoconference network with modem equipment serves the implementation needs of some EEP
training activities and at the same time built capacity in the MOE.

difference found between males and females on the performance level of the 5thand 8 grade pupils in
Arabic, mathematics, and critical thinking. This is supported by the increase of pupils' results that made
progress in the skills of everydimension and the decreased of the number of weak students. A
longitudinalstudy and results of TIMSS competition also evaluatethe impact of EEP activities on the
quality of student performance.


Area 111: Improving System Efficiency:

The goal of this program area was to improve system efficiency by improving the management of sector
resources and to enable improvementsin system effectiveness through enhancing sector planning,
decision-makingand management.

Introduce cost saving changes in school designs: A study was conductedjointly with GAEB to
optimize the design of the teaching and non teaching spaces of schoolbuildings. The impact of this
input reduced unit costs and helped increase the impact of new schools and increasing the capacity per
schoolbuilding.

Management Information System Development: The Computer Information and Statistics Department
(CISD) of MOE and its correspondingofficeswere fully upgraded with modem equipment and

software. There is now a hnctioning network connectingthe department with the statistics offices at the
districtsand governorates. Most schools are now attachedto the network. Data of the annual school
survey are delivered online in considerablenumber of cases. Data sets collected at the pupil level have
begun to populate the central database. All MOE related agencies have online access to the national
educational database and bilateral exchangesof information protocols have been developed. The
capacity of CISD was improvedto maintain and manage the upgraded system and produce sets of
educational indicators covering most of the requirementsof planning, monitoring and international
comparisons,and the availabilityof timely accurate data sets. The impact of the intervention is evident
in the increased usage of data in MOE reports and decision making. Egyptjoined the world education
indicators program organized by OECDAJNSCO, satisfyingthe data requirementsof the EFA program.

Motivation & Accountability: A comprehensivesurveywas conducted to explore the factors causing
satisfactionand dissatisfactionof those practicing the teaching profession. Recommendationswere
presented to the Minister of Education to take appropriateactions. The outcome of the activity appeared
on a program of recognition of quality teachers and parental and community involvement in school
management is officiallyencouraged. A financial incentive scheme is applied to teachers; best school
practices are recognized and awarded at the national level.

Management TrainingProgram: The program is administratedto both primary and preparatory school
managers. Although the original target of the plan was 2,000 managers, the target was exceeded with
55,000 managers, principals and deputies. The GPPMUs took the lead in administratingthe program
and the recruitment of participants. Staff of the Faculties of Education,together with experienced
administratorsin each governorate, were involved in delivering and ensuring the quality of the program.


Trainingmiddle managementlocally and abroad: The program is a product of collaborative efforts of
MOE and several agencies. The program aimed to provide highly qualified resource persons exposed to
international experienceand acquaintedwith contemporary educationaltrends. The training abroad
focuseson providingpractical exposurein the use of new pedagogy and new management methods in
classroomsand schools. The program intended to: (i) create a critical mass of reformist educational
managers willing to acceptnew ideas and that have the skills, knowledge, and commitment to support
and reinforce the new skillsthat are being transferred to inspectors and teachers through other training
activities;and (ii) develop school systemswhich promote higher order thinking skills and improve the
efficiencyof the basic education system.

EEP Management: Establishing a mechanism to run EEP was part of the preliminary interventions of
EEP itself, which had an impact on the efficiencyand effectivenessof the management and
implementationof the project. The basic education enhancement program is managed in decentralized
manner. A central PPMU and remote offices at the targeted governorates(GPPMUs)managed the
project. The PPMU produced, monitored and evaluatedlong and short-termplans in full partnership          .
with the MOE as ultimate beneficiary and associated implementing agencies such as GAEB,NCEEE
and NCERD. The staffingof the project administrationgrew to reach 49,158 at the central and local
units by year 03104. Project management began the staff down sizing process parallel to the phasing out
and completionof project activities.

Policy andplanning: The PPMU developed 5-year and annual workplans. They also assisted the
GPPMUs to do their own. Plans are based on the logical framework approach. Plans are updated with
recent statistics,and budgets are based in actual unit costs obtained fiom past experience.

Thefirzancialsystem: Timely reports and informationwere produced, aggregated by donor, category,
activity, and governorate level. The availabilityof such information to the MOE technical sections
helped to reduce the variances of planned and actual implementation expenditure. Several financial
forms were developed to facilitate and standardizethe collection and processing of financial data.

Monitoring and Evaluation of EEP: Based on the implementation~actionplans of EEP, the M&E
/EMIS /Statisticssectiondeveloped standardizedtools and procedures to collect, store, analyze, and
report information required for program monitoring and evaluation. The EMIS is computerized and
networkedwith the regional offices at the 15target governorates. Reports from GAEB, the national
investmentbank, EEP monitors and external consultants are used to monitor and evaluate the civil
works component of the program. The EMIS provides detailedtimely reports disaggregated by reason of
construction,donor, and current implementation situation at school, governorate and program levels.
The Kirkpatrickapproach is adopted to monitor training programs. Each implemented program is
subjected to Evaluation of Reaction, Learning, Behavior, and Results. The interventions of providing
equipmentare monitored and evaluated before, during and after implementation using specific tools.

On site training was arranged for MOE district offices to build capacity and promote a culture of
evaluationand accountability. All the materials and tools developed at the section are made availableto
the MOE Monitorsthrough the GPPMUs.

To evaluatethe impact of EEP, a longitudinal study was designed with the assistanceof an international
expert provided by the EU's Project CoordinationUnit. The studywas based on the national standards
and implemented nation wide with a baseline measurement for approximately 1,200schools in all
governorates. An additional 500 schools in innovative or experimental projects were also included. (e-g.
one-classroom schools,language schools, private schools) and the 300 schoolsof the ESP. The field
work phase of the study was implemented by a trained team of researchers fiom NCERD using the
designedquestionnairesand interview checklists. NCEEE designed the standards-based achievement
tests for grades 5 and 8 in Arabic, math, English, science and social studies. In March and April 2005,
two internationalexperts trained NCERD and NCEEE researchers in data analysis: scaling methods and
multi-level modeling. The final results of the analysis of 2,000 schools provided conclusions about the
factors have had significant impact on pupil achievement in Egypt.

Impactof Area 111:NCERD was contractedto assess the impact of the middle management training.
The team visited a sample of schools to collect required information by applying specific tools. The
results proved that more than 50 percent of the trained managers apply what they learned fiom the
training. Part of the training program needed to be modified to new trends adopted by the MOE, such as
communityparticipation.

2.5 Institutional developmentimpact: Building and securing institutional sustainabilityhas always been
an important concern during the course of implementing EEP. In the course of building the capacity of
the implementing agencies, needs assessments of the NCEEE and NCERD were conducted.
Modernizing the Regional Training Centers and videoconferencenetwork with modem equipment
served the implementationneeds of some EEP training activities and at the same time built capacity in
the MOE.

The project has made a positive impact on the institutional development of the MOE and its departments
as follows: (i) school constructionto reduce classroom density, eliminate shifts and serve remote areas,
especially for girls; (ii) Regional Training Centersequipped in 12governorates; CDIST became the
main coordinating body for training in the MOE; (iii) construction of the Qena and Cairo Centers and
refurnishing of other Regional Training Centers to increase training capacity; (iv) school-based training
units were established in every school in Egypt; (v) the MOE's EMIS has been automated and is being
used more effectively for decision-making;(vi) GAEBYsMIS has been improved with project financing
and the tendering process and the quality control of the construction process have been fully
computerized; (vii) the NCEEE conducts regular assessments for schools in Egypt and the agency's
performance improved after receiving TA from EEP; and (viii) PC labs provided to all school buildings
under EEP.

More importantly, the project contributed to the Bank's policy dialogue with the MOE, resulting in
major initiatives leading to: improved education quality; communitymobilization through awareness
campaigns and communityparticipation within the Effective School Program; school improvement
fimding, school-based Training and Evaluation Units; establishment of National Education Standards;
preparation of the First Strategic Plan; establishmentof an advanced and automated EMIS; e-learning;
and other interventions.

3. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

3.1 Factorsoutside the control ofgovernment or implementingagency: Fluctuationsof exchange
rates between the US Dollar and the Egyptian Pound and between the SDR and the US Dollar occurred
over the life of the project. At project appraisal in 1996,the Egyptian pound was much stronger than at
project closingin August 2006: respectively, LE3.40 to US$1 and LE 5.7 to US$l. Also, the exchange
rate between the SDR and the US Dollar resulted in a decrease of US$3.5 million of the originally
estimated funds.

Exchange rate differences during the project implementationperiod allowed for the additional
construction of schools. Additional schools provided more spaces for girls and out of school children.
More teacherswere hired and in turn trained on proper skills of teaching and utilizing technology in the
classroom.

3.2     Factorsgenerally subject to government control: Delay in Credit Effectiveness. The
government'snormal ratificationprocedures by the Parliament for foreign borrowing took almost one
year; this delayed project start-up and subsequentlyproject implementation. Grant hnds enabled the
project to move quickly into the implementationphase as follows:
    (i)     established GPPMUs by securing offices, hiring staff, and providing equipment
            and furnishings;

    (ii)    conducted soil surveys at the sites of project-financed schools.

3.3     Factors generally subject to implementing agency control: Experienced and well-qualified
personnel staffed the PPMU. Project management was generally very good and PCU managers
maintained excellent relations with Bank staff and facilitated visiting missions. In particular, project
accounts were maintained accurately and with keen oversight.

3.4     Costs andfinancing: Total project costs were estimated at LE 3.35 billion or US$835.52
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$270.12 million or about 32 percent of total
program costs. Base cost estimateswere calculated using June 1996prices.

IDA funds were disbursed against the core program activitiesof the EEP. The EU supportedthe entire
program through tranche release disbursementsagainst Guiding Criteria and Indicators agreed with the
government. The IDA Credit of SDR 51.5million, (US$75 million equivalent) financed the project
components: Access and Equity, Qualityof StudentPerformanceand System Efficiency. The EU
contributed US$125 million in co-financing. The government's expenditures for EEP were maintained
at the initial level, amountingto US$10.9billion over theproject's five-year span, of which US$635.5
million supported core activities of the EEP. IDA supportedpriority items within the core program not
funded b the government. EU finds were not earmarked for specific items and financed all remaining
items in the annual work plans, includingconsultant servicesfor the first year.

Financial Inputs to date: The EU grant was originally 100million Euros equivalent, 8 million
allocated to the PCU. The World Bank creditwas US$75 million, equivalent to 51million SDR. Due to
fluctuationsof exchangerates, the actual credit value equaled US$71.4 million, fiom which US$12.5
million were allocated to MOHE for the Faculties of Education component of EEP. Annex 1provides

4. Sustainability

4.1 Rationale for sustainability: Project sustainability is likely. Government commitmentto improving
the education system is demonstratedby a doubling in its share of funding for education in Egypt since
the 1990s. The share of educationin public expenditure increased from 10percent in 199011991to 22.6
percent in 1996/1997,and increased slightly in 2003104; this share is high by international standards. In
addition,Egypt iscommitted to the Education for All goals and is likely to achieve universalprimary
completionrate by 2015, having ensured equitable access to primary educationto both girls and boys in
2005.

Government ownershipis expected to remain strong. GAEB continues to be responsible for the school
construction program and has high capacity. In the area of improving the quality of education, the MOE
continuesto set policiesto ensure quality educationfor all and have enunciatedNational Education
Standards. The Standardsintroduce excellencein five domains: effective schools,teacher management
and communityparticipation,aswell as curriculum and student achievement. Furthermore,quality has
increased following the establishmentof the school-basedTraining and EvaluationUnits as these uni'ts
play a greater rolein training teachers and in assessing student performanceon a regular basis.

Stakeholderownership is demonstrated through NGOs, Parent Teacher Associations and Boards of
Trustees.Community leaders ensure that initiatives have started under the project activities, such as the
school improvement fund, and the Effective School Pilot Project. The NGO department of the MOE is
expected to play a key role in motivating,monitoring and building the capacityof NGOs to ensure
sustainabilityof the successfbl initiativespiloted under different projects. MOE institutional and
management effectiveness has improved to some extentthrough the project,particularlywith regard to
the in-servicetrainingprograms and the EMIS forbetter policy- and decision-making.The capacityof
the various implementingagencies of the MOE, such as GAEB, CCIMD, NCEEE, NCERD & CDIST,
both centrallyand at the governorate level, has been strengthened and further capacitybuilding is
continuing after EEP.

4.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations: Most of the project's activitieshave been integrated
into the regular work program and operations of the MOE, minimizing the need for special transition
arrangements. EEP have made inputsin the areas of access and equity, qualityof teaching and learning,
and system efficiency. An MOE CoordinatingCommitteemonitors the performance of the
implementing agencies that support the governmeut's education strategy and serves as a forum to ensure
that duplication of services is avoided and that obstaclesto implementationareremoved. It isworth
noting that GAEB has mainstreamed all EEP inputs for school construction into its ongoing work
program. The EMIS is also enhancingefficiencyof the education system through its links with GAEB,
the schoolsand the local levels. Also, CDIST has mainstreamed all EEP trainingprograms into its
ongoing work program. In-service teacher training programs are ongoing with greatly expanded
capacityat the project-supported regional trainingcenters. All Regional Traihing Centers are hlly
operational and managed by the MOE.

TheNCEEE continuesto conduct additional evaluation studies, particularly longitudinal and baseline
studiesto measure the progress of system indicators and to study the in-depth training impact. As part of
the policy dialogue, Egypt hasjoined TIMSS for the firsttime, which will help in comparing its
education qualityand student achievement in math and science with other countries, both regionally and

internationally.This may result in new reforms in curricula and examinations. Also, recommendations
have been made by ajoint BankIEuropeanCommission supervision mission that the MOE should
establish a Monitoring and EvaluationUnit within the ministry and support, as a priority, evaluation
work.

The results of the longitudinal study (in two phases) will feed into the MOE's curricular planning for the
coming years. The results of the Baseline studyhave fed into the EEP activity throughout the project
duration.
