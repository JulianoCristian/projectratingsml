The lessons learned indicate that health\n            sector reform and the supporting donor interventions need to\n            be driven by results, a clear set of objectives, and\n            performance benchmarks for service delivery institutions.\n            The focus of health sector reform needs to be on removing\n            systemic bottlenecks. Expanding coverage needs to be\n            carefully prioritized and driven by demand as well as\n            long-term resource availability. In order to create a spirit\n            of professionalism and motivation among health care staff,\n            developing an appropriate incentive system to attract,\n            maintain, and further qualify staff is crucially important.\n            While the principle of contributions is very important, it\n            should not constitute a financial barrier to accessibility.\n            Donors need to significantly co-finance recurrent costs of\n            Niger's health system so that the country has at least\n            a chance to come close to reaching the Millennium\n            Development Goals (MDGs). The Bank with the planned new\n            health sector operation plays a crucial role in this\n            context. In pursuing an approach based on Sector-wide\n            Approach (SWAp) principles, the Bank (i) would foster donor\n            alignment around the country's health sector priorities\n            with common objectives, and indicators linked to a\n            medium-term expenditure framework; and (ii) would strengthen\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) capacity in becoming a full actor\n            in the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) process. Bank\n            support would need to be delivered in an integrated manner,\n            fully aligning it with other country operations, and would\n            need to have a long-term perspective."}, "docdt": "2004-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
