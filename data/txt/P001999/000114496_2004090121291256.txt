1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:
     (a)  the term "eligible Categories" means Categories (1) through (6),
set forth in the Table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
     (b)  the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in respect
of the reasonable cost of goods, works and services required for the
Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Credit allocated
from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
     (c)  the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to
CFAF 750,000,000, to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited
into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule,
provided, however, that unless the Association shall otherwise agree, the
Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount equivalent to CFAF
375,000,000, until: (i) the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the
Credit Account allocated to Categories (1) through (6) plus the total
amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the
Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be
equal to or exceed the equivalent of $20,000,000.
2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for
eligible expenditures in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
3.   After the Association has received evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized
Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Account
shall be made as follows:
     (a)  For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Association a request or requests for a deposit or
deposits into the Special Account of an amount which do not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation.  On the basis of such
request or requests, the Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower,
Page  17
withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit into the Special Account
such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
     (b)  (i)   For replenishment of the Special Account, the Borrower
                shall furnish to the Association requests for deposits
                into the Special Account at such intervals as the
                Association shall specify; and
         (ii)   prior to, or at the time of each such request, the
                Borrower shall furnish to the Association the documents
                and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph 4 of
                this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of
                which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each
                such request, the Association shall, on behalf of the
                Borrower, withdraw from the Credit Account and deposit
                into the Special Account such amount as the Borrower
                shall have requested and as shall have been shown by
                said documents and other evidence to have been paid out
                of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Association from the Credit
Account under the eligible Categories, and in the equivalent amounts, as
shall have been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4.   For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special Account,
the Borrower shall, at such time as the Association shall reasonably
request, furnish to the Association such documents and other evidence
showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the
Association shall not be required to make further deposits into the
Special Account:
     (a)  if, at any time, the Association shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the
Credit Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
     (b)  if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Association,
within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b) (ii) of this
Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be furnished to the
Association pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the
records and Account for the Special Account;
     (c)  if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the right of
the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account pursuant to
the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or
     (d)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to
the eligible Categories for the Special Account minus the total amount
of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the Association
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to the
Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the
Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining unwith-
drawn amount of the Credit allocated to the eligible Categories shall
follow such procedures as the Association shall specify by notice
to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Association shall have been satisfied that all
such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Association shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or
in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or
(ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the Association, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Association: (A) provide
such additional evidence as the Association may request; or (B) deposit
into the Special Account (or, if the Association shall so request, refund
Page  18
to the Association) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the
portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Association shall
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association into the Special
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or
made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
     (b)  If the Association shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover
further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly
upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association such out-
standing amount.
     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Association, refund to the
Association all or any portion of the Funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
     (d)  Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Credit Account for
subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the relevant
provisions of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
