Project would attempt to reverse the\n            trend of ecological degradation within the Project area. In\n            particular the Project would implement a settlement program\n            with the dual purpose of opening up presently blocked\n            stockroutes and of increasing crop production. The Project\n            would also aim at building up a development oriented local\n            administration by helping to establish a Development\n            Corporation. Specifically, the Project would provide staff\n            for the Development Corporation; and would include a\n            settlement and crop production program, including extension\n            services, adaptive research and a pilot crop marketing\n            scheme, range management and livestock development programs,\n            including veterinary services, livestock-related adaptive\n            research, and non-formal education of livestock producers;\n            improved maintenance and further development of water\n            facilities; project monitoring and evaluation; technical\n            assistance in marketing to the Gum Arabic and Oil Seeds\n            Corporations; and a human health survey."}, "docdt": "1977-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
