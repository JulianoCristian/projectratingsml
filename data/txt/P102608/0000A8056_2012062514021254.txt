                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Punjab Education Sector Project (PESP) was approved on June 4, 2009 and became effective on June 11, 2009. The total credit amount is USD 350 million. The project is
                         scheduled to close on June 30, 2012.

                         Implementation performance of the majority of reform program activities supported by the project has been satisfactory. Disbursements under Component 1 (results based financing
                         component) of the project (accounting for 90% of total credit proceeds) were contingent on achievement of pre-specified results indicators (referred to as disbursement linked
                         indicators or DLIs) agreed with the Government of Punjab (GoPunjab). A set of ten DLIs per year were agreed with the government for three years from FY2008/09 to FY2010/11.
                         GoPunjab achieved all DLIs agreed for FY2008/09 within the agreed time frame. In FY2009/10, nine of the ten DLIs were achieved on time. Progress in implementation of the school

                         upgradation sub-program lagged behind schedule with targets not being achieved within the stipulated time frame. The floods in the first half of FY2010/11 further contributed to
                         implementation challenges that were arising due to the fiscal constraints faced by the province. IDA approved an additional financing credit equivalent to USD 50 million to fill
                         financing gaps in the sector that arose due to diversion of resources to meet the emergency needs of the province after the floods in late 2010. By the end of FY2010/11, GoPunjab
                         had achieved eight of the ten DLIs agreed for the year. Targets set for two DLIs, related to provision of basic facilities to schools and upgradation of schools, faced serious delays. By

                         April 2012, the target linked to provision of basic facilities to schools and upgradation of schools from the primary to middle levels were achieved (albeit with delays), however, the
                         target for upgradation of schools from the middle to high levels could not be achieved during project life. Funds linked to achievement of this result (SDR 5.3 million equivalent) were
                         thus canceled. Further, disbursements under the technical assistance (TA) component, were slow. There were delays by the implementing agency in executing the TA component
                         principally due to inexperience with Bank procurement guidelines and the early lack of appreciation for the need to synchronize activities supported by the TA with the activities
                         supported by the DLIs. Overall performance of the project is thus being rated as moderately satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (i) On the Government's request, unutilized funds from the Technical Assistance Component (Component 2) of the project were reallocated to the Program Financing Component
                         (Component 1);
                         (ii) One half of the amount allocated for the disbursement linked indicator (DLI) for upgradation of schools was canceled since the (sub)target for upgrading schools from the primary
                         to middle levels was not achieved within project duration.
