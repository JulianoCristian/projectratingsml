                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Performance of the Project remains moderately satisfactory with the majority of supported activities achieving set targets for FY10/11. Two of the ten key sub-programs that were also
                         Disbursement Linked Indicators, Whole School Improvement and School Upgradation, did not achieve the targets for FY10/11 that were agreed at appraisal. Progress toward
                         achievement of targets has since improved; evidence for achievement of these targets is expected by April 2012.
