                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Performance of the Project remains moderately satisfactory with the majority of supported activities achieving set targets for FY10/11. Additional Financing for the Project in the
                         amount of SDR 32.1 million was approved in March 2011 to meet the financing gap caused by diversion of resources to respond to the emergency needs of areas affected by the
                         floods in mid 2010. Two key sub-programs fell short of achieving their targets for the current year (the Whole School Improvement and the School Up-gradation programs). The
                         Implementing Agency is working with the Development Partners to agree on a revised implementation plan to meet the targets within the project period. Meanwhile, the Development
                         Partners are making payments against eight of the ten disbursement linked indicators agreed for FY10/11 that have been met successfully. For the remaining two, disbursements will
                         be made upon verification of achievement by a third party.
