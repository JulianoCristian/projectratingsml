Some lessons learned included:\n            the project designs should be sensitive to the borrowing\n            country's institutional capacity. In a low-capacity\n            context, a complex project design with a heavy reform agenda\n            may not be feasible because of the steep learning curve.\n            Despite the reasonable scope of the BSWSP, improving SVK/BVK\n            (Samarkand City VodoKanal/Bukhara City VodoKanal) operations\n            through a performance-based management contract proved\n            infeasible and lacked Borrower buy-in. The projects should\n            be restructured or amended to reflect important changes in\n            implementation. This is especially necessary when a\n            loan's binding legal and credit agreement changes\n            during project implementation, and is needed to prevent the\n            Project from being in a state of legal non-compliance. Task\n            Team Leader (TTL) transitions impact project implementation;\n            if implementation is problem-ridden, due attention should be\n            given to ensuring overlap, smooth handover, and task-team\n            continuity. Despite costs that may seem unjustified to local\n            partners, international consultants provide valuable\n            service, capacity transference, technical astuteness, and\n            better transparency, especially in the context of Low Income\n            Country Under Stress (LICUS) countries like Uzbekistan.\n            Procurement packages should be completed ahead of bidding to\n            avoid substantial variations and delays. Similarly,\n            financial management should be planned ahead of project\n            launch. With the BSWSP, compliance with both procurement and\n            fiduciary management was weak."}, "docdt": "2010-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
