1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

Uzbekistan is an upper-low-income, resource-rich country accounting for nearly half of Central Asia's
population. Until 1991, Uzbekistan's centrally-planned and state-controlled economy was largely supported
by the Soviet Union. Following independence in 1991, the Government of Uzbekistan's (GoU) home-grown,
gradualist, state-led development strategy delivered consistent, and since the mid-2000s, robust, economic
growth and gradual reforms. This approach eased the social costs of transition and reduced the economy's
vulnerability to external shocks. Uzbekistan was classified as a Low Income Country Under Stress (LICUS)
from 2003 to 2005, at the time of project initiation. It suffered from problems typical of a LICUS: a backlog of
deferred investments; limited government resources; and weak policies, institutions, and governance.

The Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply Project (BSWSP) was designed to respond to the rapidly
deteriorating water and sanitation services in Uzbekistan in the decade since independence. At independence,
there was a fairly well-developed infrastructure and centrally supported services. In the ensuing decade, the
following factors contributed to a rapid deteriorating water and sanitation services: (a) highly inefficient
operations, (b) poor service levels, (c) creeping disrepair of facilities, (d) financial shortfalls, (e) weak human
resource and institutional capacity, (f) lack of adequate information, and (g) local scarcity of water resources.
These constraints directly impacted water service delivery in Bukhara and Samarkand.

Against this backdrop, the GoU envisioned the upgrade of the water supply in Bukhara and Samarkand as a
pilot project for a new sector strategy, based on two premises: (a) full decentralization of responsibilities to the
local level for the provision of services and full cost recovery of operational, maintenance, and debt service
expenses through water and wastewater tariffs; and (b) introduction of private sector skills and resources for
utility services. Further background on project genesis is presented in Annex 10.

The project was fully consistent with the 1998 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and supported two of the
four CAS focus areas: (a) the need to remove inefficiencies in resource utilization in municipal services,
infrastructure, and social services; and (b) the need to address environmental problems. Progress on these
fronts would lead to significant cost recovery, institutional strengthening, and privatization of municipal
services. The project was also aligned with a strategic GoU objective to develop Bukhara and Samarkand into
international tourist destinations. The proposed approach was to design the simplest operation to address
critical technical and financial issues, while building capacity and preparing Bukhara City VodoKanal (BVK)
and Samarkand City VodoKanal (SVK) to attract other donors. The Loan and Credit Agreement was signed
between the GoU and the World Bank (WB) on April 12, 2002, becoming effective on January 13, 2003. The
project closed on June 30, 2010, after three years of cumulative extensions.

The pioneering ambition of the project, in the context of a recently independent former Soviet republic, cannot
be over-emphasized. Decision makers and managers at the time had limited familiarity with commercial
business management practice, and with expectations of cost recovery, asset management and customer
service in utility operations. Public-private partnerships were an alien concept in the region. Central
administration, local governments, sector agencies and utilities had thus yet to undergo a tremendous cultural
shift. One of the fundamental assumptions of BSWSP was that institutions and individuals would have the
versatility to adjust and perform under new economic and governance rules almost overnight, while embracing
and implementing radical utility turnarounds, with leadership and capacity building to be provided by a foreign
private operator.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

The PDO was to improve the safety, quality, reliability, efficiency, financial viability, and sustainability of the
Bukhara and Samarkand water supply services. The PDO was to be achieved through:

                                                         1
        Strategic rehabilitation and improved efficiency of existing facilities in critical condition;
        Institutional strengthening of BVK and SVK through a performance-based service contract (SC) (or
        management contract) with an internationally experienced water utility private operator (PO) (or the
        Operator); and
        Strengthening of BVK's and SVK's financial capacity through improved financial management and
        commercial practices.

The Project hinged on five key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess progress toward the PDOs:
    Safety and Quality: Percentage of water quality samples meeting target values of key parameters;
    Reliability: Continuity of service;
    Efficiency: Reduction in energy use per cubic meter of water, reduction in water losses, and increase in
       accounted-for water;
    Financial Viability: Annual ratio of collected revenues over the sum of operations and maintenance
       (O&M) costs and project-related expenses; and
    Sustainability: Satisfaction of population with water services, and agreement on effective institutional
       arrangement for sustainability of project achievements after completion, possibly with expanded
       private sector participation.

In addition, the progress achieved against the annual target values for such indicators would be used to
calculate the amount of annual performance incentive compensation to be earned by the PO under the SC.
Monitoring systems and data collection for the KPIs and for managing BVK and SVK operations was part of
the PO's responsibility. Independent technical and financial auditors verified the results.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The PDO was not revised, nor were the five KPIs (also comprising 14 secondary indicators) to track SC
performance. In hindsight, both the PDO and KPIs should have been revised as part of a formal project
restructuring when the SC ended in 2007 ahead of project closing. At the time, a technical restructuring was
agreed with the implementing agencies and enacted by GoU, but not submitted to the Board, by which the
number of secondary indicators was brought down to eight. As part of supervision also, the Bank and the
Client agreed to revise some KPI definitions, as well as some target values deemed too ambitious.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The final beneficiaries of the project were the residents of Samarkand and Bukhara who were connected to the
deteriorating water supply system (estimated at 260,000 and 390,000, respectively). They were to benefit from
improved utility services through rehabilitated infrastructure, reduced inefficiencies, and implementation of
long-deferred capital renewal and expansion needs. The intermediate beneficiaries were the Samarkand and
Bukhara water and wastewater utilities. The involvement of an experienced PO would ensure better
management, knowhow, and resources for water supply O&M, customer service, and financial management.
Furthermore, the policy and institutional reforms promoted under the project may have helped BVK and SVK
take initial steps toward improved self-sustainability, technical efficiency, and financial viability. In addition,
the success of this project aimed to demonstrate the great opportunity for reforms in Uzbekistan's urban water
sector.

1.5 Original Components

The PDOs, under the Specific Investment Lending (SIL), were to be achieved through four main components:

Project Component 1: Investment Fund (IF) (estimated cost: US$46.88 million at appraisal; actual cost
US$49.19 million). This component financed essential short-term expenditures (such as materials, equipment,


                                                        2
and vehicles) and a least-cost capital investment program (including associated engineering and construction
supervision services) aimed at improving the water supply system operations and services to the population by
achieving the performance improvement targets in the service contract. The PO, together with BVK and SVK
staff, were to propose the investments required to optimally restructure and rehabilitate key components of the
systems (such as sections of the water distribution networks and block distribution systems, specific
components of the treatment plants, and pumping stations), and were to implement a demand management
program, as well as new financial management, accounting, and commercial systems.

More specifically, the PO's annual plan for the use of the Investment Fund (IF) generally spanned the
following goods and works subcategories of expenditure: (a) rehabilitation of water distribution systems and
water production, treatment and pumping equipment, and structures; (b) bulk and retail water-metering
equipment; (c) technical and administrative water supply support systems; (d) O&M consumables and
administrative supplies and services; and (e) engineering and supervision services. Component 1 represented
76 percent of the appraised project costs.

Project Component 2: Service Contract (SC) (estimated cost: US$5.20 million at appraisal; actual cost
US$2.14 million). This component financed the costs related to the SC, to be compensated through a fixed-
base fee and a performance-based fee. The costs included: (a) salaries and expenses for the PO's core group of
management staff with international experience in water supply who would execute the SC; and (b) funds for a
performance-dependent bonus paid to the PO for achievement of specific targets defined in the SC. The PO
was given full responsibility for (a) managing the investment program, (b) operating the water supply system,
(c) developing and implementing the demand management program, and (d) upgrading the capacity of the
customer service (billing and collection) and financial management departments. Component 2 amounted to 8
percent of the appraised project costs.

Project Component 3: Consulting Services and Project Coordination Unit (PCU) (estimated cost:
US$1.05 million at appraisal; actual cost US$5.64 million). This component financed: (a) PCU operations
(including salaries, incremental operating expenditures, travel, training, and related expenses) with skilled staff
to facilitate project implementation, coordinate project activities between the PO, the Municipalities of
Samarkand and Bukhara, and other government agencies, in addition to supervising the PO's performance; and
(b) project-related consulting assignments on technical, legal, and financial aspects. Component 3 added up to
2 percent of the appraised project costs.

Project Component 4: Swiss-Financed Component (estimated cost: US$9 million; revised cost: US$11.23;
actual cost US$10 million). The Government of Switzerland provided a US$9 million grant for parallel
financing of two activities: (a) an investment fund for goods and services of Swiss origin, with usage to be
determined in parallel to those of the IF under Project Component 1; and (b) independent technical and
financial audit services. The auditors were to monitor the PO's performance against SC obligations and
performance indicators and to prepare financial audits of the project and of the utilities. The auditors were also
to provide complementary consulting services to support the PCU. Component 4 constituted 14 percent of the
appraised project costs.

Project Costs: At appraisal, the total project costs were US$62.33 million, to be funded by a US$20 million
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan, an SDR 15.9 million International
Development Association (IDA) credit (equivalent to US$20 million, subject to parity adjustment), US$8
million contributed by the GoU, US$5.33 million contributed by the beneficiary VKs, and a US$9 million
grant by the Swiss Cooperation.

1.6 Revised Components

The original components were not formally revised. In retrospect, Component 2 should have been scaled down
following the expiration and non renewal of the SC while project implementation was still de facto at mid-



                                                        3
course. Subsequently, the mechanism adopted to achieve the PDO in the PO's absence was not reflected in the
project components nor in the legal stipulations of the Loan and Credit Agreement.

Project Costs: At closing, the total project costs were US$63.11 million, of which US$8 million was financed
through the GoU (see Annex 1 for details).1 By project end, after parity adjustments, the SDR 15.9 million
IDA Credit equaled US$23.88 million. Moreover, the Swiss grant for equipment was increased to US$11.23
million and its closing date extended to December 5, 2010. Total disbursements amounted to US$57.75
million, not accounting for disbursements on the US$2.23 million Swiss grant extension.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Amendments to the Loan Agreement: The first amendment was made at the Borrower's request regarding the
scope of "Incremental Operating Costs of the PCU", and was enacted by WB on December 15, 2003, with
changes to the April 12, 2002, Credit and Loan Agreements. A second request for amendment of cost category
allocations was accepted by the WB on July 21, 2005. The Borrower requested a third amendment to reflect
the discontinuation of the SC over the term of project implementation, which the WB accepted on May 29,
2007. A final amendment request was satisfied on January 22, 2009 for reallocation of the savings from
Component 2 to the preparation of two new projects.

Project Extensions: The Credit Closing Date was extended twice. The Borrower's first request was made on
the recommendation of the Mid-term Review (MTR) due to delays of one-and-a-half years in hiring the PO,
which were leading to a substantial non completion of civil works and equipment procurement. On May 29,
2007, the WB accepted the request, establishing June 30, 2009, as the revised closing date. On May 6, 2009,
the WB approved a second request for extension because US$11 million remained undisbursed and critical
activities remained to be completed. Accordingly, the WB established June 30, 2010, as the Project Closing
Date, with the grace period ending on October 30, 2010.

Revision of Project Implementation Arrangements: Initially, an international private operator (PO) was hired
to implement the project as per the PDO and Component 2. At the end of the SC in early 2007, staff released
by the PO and hired as individual consultants ensured interim project implementation support, while an
Institutional Development Consultancy (IDC) was tentatively being procured 2 . As individuals, these
consultants did not always have the expertise and capacity to make complex technical decisions or train VK
staff. They were also often former VK staff, and their past subordination limited their advisory authority and
effectiveness. In early 2008, after the interrupted procurement of IDC services, individual local consultants
were hired to help implement the project. The WB agreed to this contingent approach, in the interest of time
and with the understanding that it might still achieve the Project institutional objectives. These adjustments
were formally enacted by the Client3, but not accompanied by a Board approved restructuring.

Project Budget: The project budget, based on procurement categories as stipulated in the Loan Agreement,
was revised three times.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

1
  In 2003, BVK's and SVK's contribution of US$5.33 million was omitted due to inability to pay.

  Per the Development Credit Agreement Sch. 4, Para 4: "The Borrower, together with BVK and SVK and the Bukhara
and Samarkand Regions, shall: (a) review with the Association, not later than March 31, 2005, proposals for continued
management of the water services of Bukhara and Samarkand upon completion of the Service Contract, with due
consideration to various options for public and private sector management; and (b) based on the conclusion and
recommendations of said review, take appropriate measures regarding the management of the water services upon
completion of the SC."

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation: Project preparation was in direct response to priorities expressed in the Government
Sector Strategy and reflected in the 1998 and 2002 CASs. The project focused on promoting the financial
viability of BVK/SVK, and on introducing public-private partnership approaches to rapidly upgrade water
supply utility service while preserving BVK and SVK roles as project-executing agencies. The project would
follow a two-pronged approach to improve utility operations: (a) rehabilitation of existing key infrastructure,
and (b) implementation of well-defined strategic changes in BVK/SVK financial management structures and
institutional framework. This approach provided the basis for better and more sustainable operations and for
sounder investment decisions. At the time of project preparation, PSPs were strongly advocated by the WB
and other development agencies. The PSP component was designed with the assistance of hired advisors.

Project Design: Alternative approaches were considered, including traditional technical assistance (TA), and
long-term lease or concession. Traditional TA was omitted because of its limitations in achieving rapid
implementation of cost-effective investments and institutional reforms, and in raising the efficiency and
sustainability of low-capacity utilities. The lease and concession options were rejected by GoU because of
uncertainties surrounding the physical condition of the water supply systems and the resulting risk-mitigating
cost premiums of a long-term PSP commitment. Components such as sanitation, cultural heritage, and a
traditional master plan with a focus on major system facilities were also assessed and finally rejected by the
GoU given that the water supply problems were seen as urgent, requiring project objectives focused on
accruing larger benefits from the limited financing.

Lessons learned in a previous sector project were acknowledged, including pertaining to the fact that: (a)
multiregional, multisector designs involving several international agencies are difficult to implement; (b)
activities, selection, and contracting of international consultants must be discussed with the borrowing
government well before project launch; (c) project arrangements must be not only well defined among
coordinating agencies but also efficient; (d) government officials and VK staff should be continuously
involved in project preparation and implementation from the onset irrespective of their frequent replacements;
(e) PDOs should be modest, well defined, and achievable; and (f) all counterpart financing agencies should
understand the expected disbursement profile to plan adequately. Preparation also recognized (g) the WB's
limited experience in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries; (h) the WB's global and regional
water sector experience, particularly in transition economy countries; and (i) points raised during the project
Decision Review Meeting.

The project design pioneered utility-service PSPs in Central Asia as well as in Uzbekistan. Although the
Borrower declared its commitment to the PSP approach during preparation, it later reconsidered, and did not
strongly support the introduction of the PO. In hindsight, project design should have given greater weight to
the risks associated with a LICUS, including limited institutional, managerial and operational capacity, lack of
baseline data, and the absence of any private sector experience. Other risk factors that should have been
considered include: (a) the high-security status of water supply and resources in Uzbekistan, which made
access to data problematic and subject to high-level confidentiality protocol; (b) Uzbek policies regulating the
work of foreign firms;4 and (c) the inability to develop the M&E framework baselines up-front, and obligation
to defer it to implementation.

Quality at Entry (QEA): No QEA of the project was carried out by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) for
this project. However, as part of a Quality of Supervision Assessment, QAG did rate the Quality at Entry as
Moderately Unsatisfactory (QSA7, September 11, 2006).

  The required registration and review of import contracts by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
(MOFERT) before work could commence required all foreign firms to undergo an additional procurement step, which
lengthened the process and caused cascading delays.

2.2 Implementation

The US$62.33 million BSWSP was approved by the WB Board on March 19, 2002, and came into effect only
on January 17, 2003. This delay was caused by internal audit within the line ministry and lack of project
coordination till late 2002, when GoU's decided to shift project responsibility to the Public Utilities Agency,
Uzkommunkhizmat (UzK). The Project closed on June 30, 2010, after eight years of implementation, at which
time the commitments were approximately US$63.11 million and disbursements reached US$58.79 million, or
94 percent of the approved amount.

Project implementation. From an implementation viewpoint, the project roughly comprised three main
phases: a 2-year phase for SC procurement; a 3-year phase coinciding with the SC; and 3-year final phase
without SC. Project implementation suffered substantial delays and disruptions, none so consequential as the
procurement delays, execution impediments and ultimate non-reconduction of the SC. Key events, important
to understand a complex project, its accumulated delays, and the quality of its outputs and outcomes, are
summarized below:

        Implementation was disrupted by the transfer, announced in August 2002 and effective in January
        2003, of project responsibility from the Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics (MMS) to UzK.
        After a lengthy tendering process, an SC was signed with the Ondeo-Safege consortium in December
        2002, only to be cancelled in March 2003 with the sudden withdrawal of Ondeo from the consortium,
        and the failure of Safege to meet pre-qualification requirements alone. Given that the second-ranked
        bid was substantially higher and above budget, GoU opted to retender the SC, de facto upholding
        project activities for 16 months. The new SC was awarded in February 2004 to Swedish Water
        Development/Stockholm Water Utility (Sweden) and InfraMan GmbH (Austria), who mobilized on
        July 1, 2004, 28 months after project approval.
        SC startup activities were affected by a 3-month contract review and registration process by MOFERT
        during which the PO was not paid its advance, initial and monthly invoices. The priority development
        of the Base Year Data Report (BYDR), critical to establish KPI baselines and to assess PO
        performance, was only acceptably completed in February 2005.
        A major external factor of SC disruption, fatal to PO activities for improvement of VK operations,
        intervened in May 2004. At the time, a court order imposed that 80 percent of cash collected by SVK
        and 75 percent of cash collected by BVK, be escrowed to accelerate payment of tax, energy and other
        liabilities sanctioned by an Economic Court decision in 2003. This effectively blocked VK accounts,
        and left them and the PO with insufficient resources for day-to-day operations. The VKs ceased
        paying salaries while depleting stock to sustain operations, increasingly unable to ensure basic O&M,
        let alone provide 10 percent counterpart funds to the project. A government resolution of July 2005
        improved the situation by writing off a substantial part of VKs debts and deferring payments by six
        months. A Presidential Decree in August 2006 resolved SVK's remaining issues, leading to the
        unblocking of SVK's accounts. BVK's accounts were only unblocked in February 2007. The VKs
        were also relieved of their co-financing obligations. VK operations were thus deeply impaired for
        almost two-and-a-half out of three years of PO tenure.
        Despite major project implementation delays and an already approved extension of project closing
        date, the SC was let expire at the end of its original 3-year term on June 30, 2007. Local staff released
        by the PO was temporarily hired as individual consultants, while an International Development
        Consultancy (IDC) was being procured to replace the SC. Upon cancellation of the IDC tendering
        process, decided by GoU in response to the Bank holding up the process (due to INT investigation of
        the 1st ranked consultant proposed for the contract award), the default option was retained to continue
        supporting the project through locally recruited consultants. Such contingent arrangements
        compensated for the loss of PO and of its unevenly experienced staff, during the last three years of the
        project. They were further essentially focused on infrastructure implementation, with lesser emphasis
        at capacity building and financial sustainability objectives.



                                                       6
SC performance (July 2004 to June 2007): The non-extension of the SC at the end of its original term denotes
a failure of the PSP experience as implemented under the project, brought about by the non-optimal PO
performance and by the degradation of the relationship between the parties under BSWSP's extenuating
circumstances. In terms of groundwork, the PO completed the BYDR, which verified and established the
technical, operational, and commercial (unreliable and often nonexistent) baseline information. It is
appreciated that the PO established sound investment plans for the project, which the VKs executed with
limited deviations through project closing. The SC also delivered substantial diagnostic and planning
documents, as well as upgrades in operating plans and procedures5. Operating in constant crisis conditions, the
SC has however had less lasting impacts over staff training, management capacity and financial performance
of the VKs.

The partnership between the PO and the PIU/PCU/VK did not start off optimally due to initial PO staff
turnover and delayed delivery of the Base Year Data Report (BYDR) and other agreed outputs. A year later,
based on performance monitoring indicators, the PO's performance was less than satisfactory. Frequent
international staff replacements affected SC implementation. Improvements in commercial performance were
slow, because they were impeded by a lack of information, an inability to pay creditors, and the failure by
some government entities to pay tariffs. More generally, the inability to use very limited utility revenues
impaired SC operational performance. The SC implementation continued to lag behind schedule, aggravated
by growing distrust and miscommunication between the PO and the Uzbek counterparts, and by the reported
insufficient qualifications or commitment of some international experts.

As discussed in section 1.1-Context at Appraisal - and above, the PO intervened under extremely challenging
conditions, and its partial underperformance must be assessed against "force majeure"-type situations such as
the fact that VK staff could not be paid their salaries fully and on time over a period of two-and-a-half years,
with delays of up to five months. Other factors of SC quality degradation included: (a) a prevailing
unfamiliarity with the concept of partnership with a private foreign firm in the delegation of public services,
(b) limited PCU/PIU/VK's experience and capacity to manage the PO; (c) the initial nonpayment of the PO,
due to SC registration delays; (d) limited access to data due to confidentiality and protocol associated with
water resources; and (d) exposure to interferences by external agencies (including the Samarkand Regional VK,
the Prosecutor's Office, the Ministry of Finance, and MOFERT).

Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR mission took place October 16­20, 2006. Two follow-up MTR missions
were undertaken during February 5­7, 2007, and April 23­25, 2007. Despite the fact that BSWSP was flagged
as "problem project" since early 2006 6, the MTR missions (11 days in total) were probably not long enough to
tackle the complex history, imperfect documentation, and high stakes of the two-city project. The fragmented
missions also probably did not allow sufficient participation of technical, institutional and operational
specialists to comprehensively assess all project issues and components. In hindsight, this MTR organization
may denote the fact that under BSWSP circumstances, the MTR had to troubleshoot an ever evolving project
situation, as opposed to conducting a methodical review of project performance.

  Including : Procurement guidelines, a staff training and development program, a safety deficiency correction plan, an
occupational health and safety program, operation and maintenance manuals, a facilities database, an initial condition
survey, a Network Information System plan, a Hydraulic Network Model, a financial management and customer services
information systems plan, a customer service plan, a customer service training program, a public education program,
subscription contracts, and an organization and human resources plan
6
  Per the QSA7/QAG, one of the key recommendations was that the MTR should assess the future of the project,
including the cancellation of the remaining funds if firm commitments and/or actions are not assured that will strengthen
the financial position of the utilities. If the decision is to continue with the project, a realistic assessment needs to be made
as to what can be achieved in the remaining one to three years, and the current SC is unsatisfactory both in terms of the
PO's performance and in achieving the main institutional building objectives. Revised arrangements will need to be
implemented before project completion.

                                                               7
Critical decisions at the end of the MTR determined that: (a) the PDO would remain the same, but the project
would be restructured; (b) an extension of the loan/credit date would be pursued as necessary to complete the
loan-financed works; (c) the Borrower would not extend the SC with the PO; (d) an IDC would be recruited to
support the Client in implementing the project in lieu of the PO; and (e) the closing date extension would be
considered when the project was upgraded to Satisfactory status. Conditions to be met to that effect included
(a) confirmation of lifting the block on BVK's bank accounts; (b) submittal and acceptance of revised KPIs
and targets; (c) minutes of the meeting among the Borrower, contractual parties, and the PO outlining the
agreements reached on the main points of disagreement; (d) project implementation arrangement post-SC and
terms of reference for the IDC; and (e) confirmation that a procurement/technical specialist had been hired.
The project file contains no record of project restructuring in the MTR aftermath, nor any documented
rationale for not processing the announced restructuring.

Risk Status: Project risks were considerably underestimated and focused primarily on possible failure of the
Government or the local utilities. The SC performance risk was rated Moderate but materialized repeatedly,
with high impact on all PDO dimensions; SC subsequent failure was not assessed. The financial failure of the
utilities and its consequences were not fully factored in, nor were low institutional capacity and governance
issues, especially regarding implementation by SVK/BVK.

Supervision: Project implementation spanned eight years and included 23 supervision missions, with an
average of three missions yearly, two project extensions (see Annex 11). The supervision challenge was
substantial and required a broad mix of specialized skills: An ambitious and pioneering project had indeed to
be supported in two cities, through low-capacity operators and implementing agencies, with complex issues
spanning infrastructure rehabilitation, PSP contract administration, utility capacity building and financial
management. In retrospect, supervision effectiveness might have been increased if teams had been able to
include, at critical junctures, specialists in PSP, M&E, and institutional development, and engineers or
construction specialists. Aide-Memoires could also have been structured more thoroughly around component
progress, which would have made it easier for management to gauge PDO and KPI and allocate relevant
supervision resources. Project documentation attests to highly committed supervision TTLs and teams. It is
however unclear why supervision did not implement the required restructuring, thus inducing imperfect
compliance with legal covenants. A key weakness of the Bank's supervision engagement resides in the
excessive TTL rotations (8 TTLs in 8 years), which may have led to insufficient appropriation of a most
complex project.

QAG: The project underwent two Quality of Supervision Assessments (QSA) by the Quality Assurance Group
(QAG), first in 2004 (QSA6) and again in 2006 (QSA7). The first QAG Panel assessed the project's overall
supervisory quality as Moderately Satisfactory. 7 The Panel's key concerns were: (a) the WB's direct
monitoring of the utilities' performance on the basis of a flawed baseline would not have been very helpful
pending rebidding of the service contract; (b) quality of project performance reporting was deficient in the
review period; and (c) although project implementation was delayed by more than two years, Implementation
Progress (IP) continued to be inappropriately rated as Satisfactory. According to the Panel, the main problems
encountered by the project were (a) delayed effectiveness; (b) underbidding followed by withdrawal of first
SC/PO; and (c) lack of counterpart capacity on institutional/financial issues, requiring much WB "hand-
holding." The Panel's key lesson was that "when relying exclusively on a management contract for project
implementation, it is vital to ensure that the bidding process results in a contract that is likely to be
sustained..."




7
  The QSA6/QAG point scale comprised: (a) focus on development effectiveness (2), (b) supervision of fiduciary/
safeguard aspects (3), (c) adequacy of supervision inputs and processes (2), and (d) candor and quality of project
performance ratings (4).

                                                        8
The second QAG review in 2006,8 prior to the project MTR, rated the overall quality of project supervision
Moderately Satisfactory with a rating of "3." 9 The Panel's key concerns were (a) weak government
commitments to resolve VK's financial problems, (b) the SC's continuing poor performance under stressful
operating conditions, and (c) the history of implementation difficulties in Uzbekistan. According to the Panel,
the project's main problems were (a) slow implementation since approval because of rebidding of the SC after
the first PO withdrew; (b) a new SC with a second PO just prior to the period under review; and (c) VK's weak
financial position, which threatened the sustainability of the overall project and needed to be urgently
addressed. The Panel's key systemic lesson was that the "practicality and realism of bringing about
institutional strengthening of a developing country's main utilities through a performance based management
contract needs to be re-examined. The Bank needs to adopt a more flexible approach, which balances more
effectively weaknesses in local capacity with external partnerships--of individuals or teams--that can
strengthen operating performance of the utility's business in key areas."

The Panel made these additional observations: (a) pursuing PSPs in Uzbekistan in 2000 with the goal of
improving BVK/SVK operations through a performance-based management contract proved infeasible in
terms of both limited market interest and insufficient Borrower buy-in; (b) definition and measurability of the
KPIs were missing; (c) attempts to establish a meaningful M&E system and baseline data through the private
PO contract failed, which undermined the M&E under the project; and (d) project risks were considerably
underestimated and focused primarily on possible failure of the Government or the local utilities to perform,
and not on the failure of the PO. In 2006, the project was classified as problematic.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

A monitoring framework was in place at the start of the project and the M&E, comprising mainly of the KPIs,
hinged on it. Its design, however, proved ineffective in terms of indicator availability and measurability. The
delayed onset and non-extension of the SC undermined and delayed M&E. The Borrower's own M&E
framework was largely missing, and M&E was only partially embraced by the VKs, as some indicators were
not typically documented in Uzbekistan's water sector and exceeded the VK/PIU capacity to monitor them
effectively. 10 After the SC termination, VK/PIU entrusted M&E reporting to consultants, which were not
ideally integrated in VK operations.

M&E Design: The M&E approach opted to wholly rely on the PO for its execution., and assumed it would be
possible to get an accurate picture of the utilities' situation in the first year of the SC, as well as to develop a
baseline. . That picture showed the following: (a) during project design, assessment of the utilities was weak;
(b) the reality of what was measurable and what was not among the extensive set of proposed KPIs was a big
unknown for the project; and (c) the scope of the Borrower M&E framework was limited to the KPIs. The WB,
the Client, and the project may have been better off using a rudimentary M&E framework with baselines for
the project acquired during appraisal and only requesting the PO to revised it. With the rebidding of the SC,
the new PO was not in place until July 2004, more than two years after approval to initiate measurement of
KPIs. The data were also audited by technical auditors for monitoring purposes. The QAG/QSA7 rated the
QEA of the M&E framework Moderately Unsatisfactory, and it rated the adequacy of arrangements linking
the project results framework to the Borrower's M&E Unsatisfactory.

M&E Implementation and Utilization: M&E implementation and utilization were both less than optimal for
the following reasons: (a) the baseline was not established before project initiation; (b) methodology for each
indicator was not defined and was also not clearly identified at the onset; (c) targets set at launch were too



8
  QAG/QSA7 assessment date was September 11, 2006.
9
   The QSA7/QAG point scale comprised: (a) focus on development effectiveness (3), (b) supervision of fiduciary/
safeguard aspects (3), (c) adequacy of supervision inputs and processes (2), and (d) candor and quality of ISR (3).
10
   Per the QSA6/QAG, the project KPIs were formulated in the absence of adequate financial data and, more broadly, in
the absence of detailed knowledge of the status of the utilities.

                                                         9
ambitious and lacked knowledge of the sector;11 and (d) WB supervision of the project M&E was questionable
since no specialist was part of the project team over the eight-year period of implementation, which made it
difficult to audit or monitor information received from the technical auditor and the PCU/PIU/BVK/SVK. As a
result, project M&E could not comprehensively, accurately, and effectively report on the KPI results. Based on
project documentation, it appears that WB supervision during and after the PO/SC may not have actively
engaged in designing, monitoring, or revisiting the KPIs or the Borrower's M&E framework.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Environmental Safeguards: The project was classified as a Category B based on the WB's Operational Policy
4.01 Annex C on Environmental Assessment (EA); an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was already
prepared and approved at appraisal. Environmental Safeguard monitoring was instituted as part of the SC.
Compliance with environmental safeguards was supervised twice by a Bank specialist during the eight years of
implementation, an aspect flagged under project QAG. In June 2009, the ISR rating for the Environmental
Safeguards was downgraded from Satisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory until project closing.

It was observed at the time that contractors rarely enforced mitigation measures related to environmental
management and occupational health and safety. Lapses were seen in (a) management of waste and debris; (b)
exercise of appropriate safety measures; (c) fencing/securing of construction sites; and (d) provision of
essential safety equipment for workers. EMP compliance lapses were due to (a) weak WB supervision; (b)
weak oversight capacity of the PCU/PIU to oversee environmental management aspects of the project; (c)
irregular implementation of the EMP; and (d) lack of active environmental safeguards or monitoring of its
progress. Due to Bank team's supervisory insistence, by project closing, improvements in contractor
compliance with the EMP were noted, particularly regarding the occupational health and safety of workers.

Social Safeguards: A social assessment was undertaken as part of project preparation, with its findings
contributing to project design; however, the findings were not adopted fully during implementation. Findings
from a 2007 independent social beneficiary assessment for both the BSWSP and Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Project in Uzbekistan were also not integrated or disseminated during implementation. Moreover,
the supervision of social safeguards was weak; a project specialist was on the team just three times, and only
during the last two years of the eight-year project.

To implement a social outreach program, through the VKs, the WB requested a US$1.69 million grant from
the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) for a community-based urban water supply management project.
Initiated at the end of 2005, the grant's main objective was to develop a water-loss-reduction model by
implementing pilot projects in selected low-income apartment buildings in Bukhara and Samarkand in
collaboration with Housing Owners Associations (HOAs). The project entailed replacement of internal cold
water supply piping in 46 buildings in Samarkand and 39 in Bukhara, installation of master meters in each
building, and placement of water meters in each household. It also rehabilitated hot water in-house networks,
as proposed by the Client due to savings available during procurement. The program implemented under the
grant which closed on September 9, 2008, resulted in cost savings for poor households.

Financial Management and Disbursement: The PCU/PIU Financial Management (FM) and disbursement
arrangement and capacity are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. It is noted that the Client disagrees with this
rating and its assessment. Overall, the FM arrangement (including accounting practices, reporting, external
audit, and funds flow) was deemed inadequate by WB standards. A fiduciary review was conducted at project
closing in June 2010 to facilitate final disbursement application processing and to assess weaknesses to be
addressed in future projects. The findings of the review have been shared with GoU in November 2010 and



11
  KPIs were too optimistic with target indicator values, especially without knowing the true baseline, and grossly
underestimated the time it would take to have a network information system and hydraulic modeling in place, purchased
and installed measurement devices, complete network zoning, and so forth--all necessary to have a reliable baseline.

                                                         10
are undergoing clarification and reconciliation by the implementing agencies. As such, specific findings are for
must be considered as preliminary in nature. Overall however, the emerging pattern is one of uneven fiduciary
capacity, performance and compliance. Observations point to: (a) inefficient accounting practices, low
automation of, and weak coordination between, the PIUs and the PCU; (b) delayed and irregular submission of
financial management reports, which were often found unacceptable, requiring revision and resubmission; (c)
weak internal control systems at both the PCU/PIU level; (d) weak and insufficient financial staffing of the
PCU and Bukhara PIUs; (e) an inadequate and nontransparent recruitment process; (f) frequent
underpayment/overpayment under each contract; (g) poor and nontransparent documentation of contractual
work expenditures; (h) PCU's improper execution of monitoring and verification of contract management; and
(i) inefficient reconciliation of project accounting records with Statements of Expenditures/Expenses and
summary sheets submitted to the WB, caused by reporting of expenditures which, at the time of the review,
were ineligible, and non-documentation of some eligible expenses.

Procurement: The overall rating of procurement during the project cycle is Moderately Unsatisfactory. On
the whole, procurement, compounded by weak capacity, led to substantial delays in implementation by both
the Borrower and the WB, as well to output quality issues. It is noted that the Client disagrees with this rating.

The ex-post contract review of December 2005, during the SC phase, identified the following problems: (a)
poor-quality procurement documents; (b) unclear terms of reference and technical specifications in bidding
documents; and (c) delays in processing procurement documents. These problems resulted from (a) poor
technical quality and experience of the PO staff and frequent technical staff turnover, (b) procurement
coordination by a PO specialist unfamiliar with WB operations, (c) unclear lines of responsibility for
document preparation and dissemination, (e) weak and subjective appraisals by inexperienced evaluators, and
(f) insufficient monitoring of implementation activities. This situation might have improved during
implementation, but not significantly.

After the SC conclusion, the PIU/PCU took the lead in procurement, but low capacity and staffing problems
directly affected implementation. In early 2010 an Independent Procurement Review (IPR) of Bank projects in
Uzbekistan assessed a few BSWSP contracts as part of a sample spanning several sectors of Bank intervention.
Published in March 2010, IPR findings specific to BSWSP contracts stated that: (a) procurement capacity
varied significantly among PCU/PIUs/VKs, (b) PCU/PIU/VK contract management capacity was limited, (c)
there was no feedback on previous WB post-reviews, (d) extensive and unjustified use of the Small Works
procedure deviated from the legal agreement, (e) procurement packages were improperly managed by splitting
contracts without justification, (f) evaluations were delayed due to the coexistence of tendering/selection
committees and the actual evaluation team, (g) contract effectiveness and implementation were delayed by
contract registration and price verification, (h) confidentiality/conflict of interest disclosure forms were not
signed by tendering committee members, (i) filing/availability of procurement documents was weak, and (j)
procurement plan updates and maintenance lagged. The IPR found that there was room for improvement in
procurement filing and contract management (particularly supervision of civil works).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
O&M: The BVK and SVK are exclusively mandated to provide potable water service in Bukhara and
Samarkand, respectively. Accordingly, O&M of project assets and equipment falls under their responsibility
and jurisdiction and are programmed as part of their annual budgets.

Follow-up Operation: In 2008, at GoU request, the WB began preparing a natural follow-up to BSWSP, i.e.
the Bukhara and Samarkand Sewerage Project (BSSP), which was approved by the Board on August 4, 2009.
The WB was well suited to help finance and implement the BSSP because of the experience and trust
developed between the WB and the central, regional, and municipal governments during the eight-year
implementation of the BSWSP. The BSSP built on the improved efficiency of water operations and on the
institutional strengthening carried out under the BSWSP. The BSSP will help (a) rehabilitate deteriorated
sections of the existing sewerage network, (b) expand sewerage to currently unconnected areas, and (c)
undertake selected investments to save electric energy at the wastewater treatment plants of each city. The


                                                       11
BSSP will benefit from the PCU's strengthened capacity and long experience in implementing WB-financed
projects.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

The objective of improving the safety, quality, reliability, efficiency, financial viability, and sustainability of
the water supply services in Bukhara and Samarkand may still be relevant, as noted in the 2008­11 CAS,
which identifies basic infrastructure as a potential constraint to growth. Uzbekistan has generally maintained
its infrastructure better than some neighboring states, by investing in selected basic infrastructure projects
throughout the transition period. It still faces major challenges going forward, however, given its large stock of
Soviet-era infrastructure assets. Thus, it needs immense financing to ensure that the provision and quality of
rural and urban infrastructure services support future growth objectives. Emphasizing the need to improve the
performance of utility and communal services nationwide, the CAS proposed rehabilitation and extension of
water supply, sewerage, and solid waste management systems; reduction of physical and commercial losses;
and installation of energy-efficient systems, with a focus on combining operational efficiency with financial
sustainability.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PDO was to improve the safety, quality, reliability, efficiency, financial viability, and sustainability of the
Bukhara and Samarkand water supply services. As discussed above, progress and achievement of the PDO
was not consistently captured by the M&E framework in place which was based on five main indicators (water
quality, continuity of service, energy efficiency, cost recovery; and customer satisfaction). PDO achievement
is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Overall, the project disbursed 98 percent of the loan amount and 94 percent of project financing at closing.
Project works were fully implemented and PDO 1 - strategic rehabilitation and improved efficiency of existing
facilities in critical condition - was fully accomplished--albeit with weak oversight of technical design and
quality of works and supervision. Improvements in water service safety, quality, reliability, efficiency and
sustainability are also recognized, beyond the gaps and weaknesses in the original M&E framework..
Generally consistent and positive trends have been measured for relevant indicators, through the KPIs in place
since the MTR (see Annex 9). Quantified improvements approaching or exceeding target values include: (a)
improved safety of water, as measured by the percentage of samples failing the residual chlorine test; (b)
improved reliability or continuity of water supply ­ as measured by customer surveys: (c) renewal of worn out
mains ­ as measured by length of renewed mains pipes in excess of target of 240 km; (d) installation of
approximately 70,000 meters and (e) reduction of non-revenue water, estimated to approach the targets of 30%
in Bukhara and 35% in Samarkand. Service quality improvements are also confirmed by customer surveys (see
Annex 5), which found significant trends in improved service reliability, pressure, reduced leaks, and overall
satisfaction with VK service.

On the other hand, PDO 2 - institutional strengthening of BVK and SVK through a performance-based SC
with an internationally experienced water utility PO - and PDO 3 - strengthening of BVK's and SVK's
financial capacity through improved financial management and commercial practices - were only partially
accomplished. Despite some improved trends on selected financial indicators, such as working ratio or
recovery of operating expenses, much remains to be done at the utility and at the sector level to enhance and
sustain the management and financial viability of BVK and SVK.

Key Performance Indicators: KPI performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. During the SC phase,
the PO was responsible for establishing, defining, monitoring, and collecting KPI data. Responsibility for KPI
monitoring shifted to the PIUs/PCU/VKs after SC expiration. Although the KPIs were to be audited annually

                                                        12
by independent auditors under the Swiss grant, KPIs were audited four times (three times during the SC phase,
once afterwards) during the eight years of implementation. Although no final KPI audit was undertaken at
closing, ad hoc studies and surveys for assessment of project impacts were launched in Bukhara and
Samarkand to mitigate M&E gaps.

Despite improvements during implementation, indicator reporting quality and KPI definitions remained
affected by unexplained trends and anomalies, and by residual inconsistencies between PIU consultant and
SECO auditor estimated values. Besides measurement and data harmonization flaws, Bank reporting and
monitoring of KPIs lacked diligent documentation and supervision. A prime rating factor is that
notwithstanding extensive work over eight years, KPI monitoring and indicator definitions were neither
resolved nor streamlined.

(i)     Safety and Quality: Percentage of water quality samples meeting target values of key parameters. The
indicator definition changed mid-project along with subsequent baseline changes. Significant changes in the
baseline make quality questionable. At closing, the indicator value falls/borders within the target value (see
Annex 2).

(ii)    Reliability: Continuity of service. KPIs consisted of two parts, one based on the prevalence of
uninterrupted water supply to households (24 hours), and the other on the number of service interruptions due
to pipe breaks. The baseline for the first was established during appraisal through the social assessment, but
the indicator could not be measured afterwards. The second part incorrectly used the same baseline as the first
to gauge progress; thus, progress cannot be qualified (Annex 2).

(iii)    Efficiency: Reduction in energy use per cubic meter of water; Reduction in water losses; and Increase
in accounted-for water. The four KPI sub indicators were (a) reduction of specific energy consumption--the
measure of this indicator against the baselines and target were inconclusive. The data trajectory suggests an
anomaly in definition or methodology; (b) water mains replacement--this indicator monitored pipe
rehabilitation progress, showing a positive progression toward the target value, although the baseline should
have not changed midterm and should have remained at "0" to gauge progress; (c) conversion of unregistered
connections--the target and baseline were not clear; the unit was not consistent over the term; and progress
toward target value of "substantial" and 100 percent could not be confirmed; and (d) nonrevenue water--
production meters were not operational in June 30, 2006, so baselines are inaccurate and needed revision. The
trend line anomaly was attributed to a change in reporting mode, raising questions about the level of metering
in place at project closing (Annex 2).

(iv)    Financial Viability: Annual ratio of collected revenues over the sum of O&M costs and project-
related expenses. The three KPI sub-indicators were (a) cash flow sufficient to cover production costs alone
and then with subsidies--the ratio should be more for the latter. However, an anomalous trend line and an
inverse relationship between indicators suggest a data collection or calculation problem, making this data
assessment unreliable and inconclusive; (b) the collection rate for both residential and commercial
customers--the trend line does not show a natural progression as it should, indicating flawed data collection;
and (c) completeness of customer database--this indicator was neither in the audit report nor in the latter years
of ISRs; therefore, it cannot be qualified; also the target value was "to increase considerably," making the
indicator relative (Annex 2). Beyond the KPI inconsistency, other financial indicators such as working ratio,
suggest a steady if insufficient trend of improved cost-recovery, and by extension, viability, in VK operations.

(v)      Sustainability: Consumer satisfaction with water services, and agreement on effective institutional
arrangement for post-project sustainability of achievements, possibly with expanded private sector
participation. Customer surveys at project closing point to substantially improved overall customer
satisfaction in the two cities linked to Project interventions. The follow-up Bukhara and Samarkand Sewerage
Project is ensuring consolidation of institutional strengthening and capacity gains, as well as ensuring
mitigation of the environmental management impacts of increased water supply.

Project Development Objectives (PDOs): The PDOs are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

PDO 1: Strategic rehabilitation and efficiency improvement of existing facilities in critical condition. This
PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Significant rehabilitative work occurred, including replacement of pipe
segments and rehabilitation of water intake, a water treatment plant, water reservoirs, and metering. However,
technical oversight and supervision of civil works was weak, including for the inventory of renewed household
connections.

PDO 2: Institutional strengthening of the Bukhara and Samarkand Water Utilities (Bukhara City Vodokanal
[BVK] and Samarkand City Vodokanal [SVK]) through a performance-based management contract (SC) with
an internationally experienced water utility operator (the Operator). This PDO is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory. Due to the short PO/SC tenure, this objective was partly accomplished, with improved
operational efficiency in billing and customer care. Largely, this component lagged after PO/SC termination.

PDO 3: Strengthening of BVK's and SVK's financial capacity through improved financial management and
commercial practices. This PDO is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Some gains were seen in automation of
billing, computerization of customer database, better customer responsiveness, and some cash flow
improvement. However, with weak VK capacity and the short PO term, the improvement did not fully
materialize (see Annex 2).

Project Components: Overall, considering the prevalence of physical investment components 1 and 4, the
project component performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Project Component 1: Investment Fund. This component is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Extensive
rehabilitations of civil works were complete and service quality improved, with modest impact on energy
efficiency. However, M&E was poorly managed, weak, or nonexistent in Borrower's M&E results framework,
with uncertainties affecting as far as the number of households effectively connected to the rehabilitated
networks. Beneficiary surveys were not incorporated for assessment during implementation (see Annex 2).

Project Component 2: Service Contract. This component is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. With delayed
mobilization, challenged implementation and unplanned premature expiration, the SC only partially delivered
on expected benefits under PDOs 2 and 3. Of the 31 SC-envisioned reports, the PO prepared 28, with 15
approved by the VKs and Technical Auditor. The SC is nevertheless credited for relatively successful
planning, sector assessment, BYDR, and implementation tasks under its tenure, conducive to positive PDO 1
outcomes (see Annex 2).

Project Component 3: Consulting Services and Project Coordination Unit. This component is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory. Weak implementing agency and consultant capacity led to inadequate progress
reports, problem identification, and solution. Low fiduciary and procurement compliance, and no Borrower
M&E also factor in the rating. The Louis Berger consultancy hydraulic network model was based on
simulation rather than real-time data (see Annex 2).

Project Component 4: Swiss-financed Grant Component. The output and performance of this component is
rated Satisfactory. Independently handled by the Swiss Cooperation, this component entailed procuring Swiss
goods and services to complement project activities under Component 1. This component was well managed,
with diligent Swiss-funded supervision throughout. In Bukhara, this grant financed drainage pumps, water
meters, welding units, and valves; in Samarkand it financed energy-efficiency services, water meters,
switchboards, and pumps (see Annex 2).

3.3 Efficiency

At project closing, many critical data pieces were still missing, including reliable economic data values,
willingness to pay assessments, marginal costs of water provision, assessment of consumer and tourism


                                                     14
demands, beneficiary assessments, public health benefits, environmental benefits associated with water
conservation, social benefits associated with improved water supply, energy costs associated with coping
mechanisms, etc. Accordingly, no new cost benefit economic analysis was undertaken as part of the ICR. A
comprehensive financial analysis was undertaken based on utility data to assess the efficiency of the
investments, as presented in Annex 5.

In Bukhara, the project has had a positive but insufficient impact on BVK financial performance particularly in
its working ratio which decreased from 1.25 in 2006 to 1.07 in 2009. This seems to be related to two main
factors: i) the increase in revenues from all levels of customers and ii) the completion of the debt repayments,
which substantially reduced BVK's obligations. In Samarkand too, the project has had a positive but
insufficient contribution to increase SVK performance particularly in its working ratio which decreased from
1.5 in 2006 to 1.2 in 2009. This seems to be related to two main factors: i) the increase in revenues from
residential customers and ii) the completion of the debt repayments, which substantially reduced SVK's
liability. Delays in residential meter installation affected project efficiency in both cities. Due to
inconsistencies in the financial model used at appraisal, investment rate of return analysis could not be
completed as part of the ICR effort.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Infrastructure works were fully completed. Despite the fact that service and performance improvements cannot
be accurately substantiated due to lack of baselines and reliable indicator data, a clear pattern of improved
service safety, quality, reliability, efficiency and sustainability emerges from available indicator measures and
customer surveys. The project has however only achieved limited and inconsistent capacity building and
financial viability gains, and failed the introduction of PSPs to Uzbekistan. On this basis, the overall outcome
of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. It may further be argued that, against strong odds, the primary
objective of public service provision, directly contributing to the MDGs, was achieved. In retrospect, the
Project also allowed a laborious but effective experience towards supporting the modernization of urban
service and institutions in Uzbekistan's water sector and has laid the groundwork on which new projects are
being built. In that respect, and together with its substantial SC lessons, the Project is in fact a pioneering effort
of great significance for the region.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts: Considering the nature of the project, poverty reduction might well be a spill-over effect of a
water supply project. The project might in fact have resulted in poverty reduction due to creation of
construction industry jobs, technical capacity gains, and cost savings in water bills. However, since poverty
reduction was not identified from the outset as a project impact, that outcome cannot be qualified.

Gender Aspects: Not applicable

Social Development: The successful implementation of the social outreach program under the JSDF for a
community-based urban water supply management involved (a) targeting poor neighborhoods, (b) cost savings
in water bills, (c) project implementation through community participation, (d) rehabilitation of water supply
hardware, and (e) household-level water meters.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional change/strengthening gains under the project remained limited because the PO/SC was
onboard the project for just three years; after the SC, local consultants did not take an active role in any
institutional capacity building of the VKs.


                                                         15
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
     An intended result of policy dialogue rooted in the BSWSP supervision challenges was the
        development of a "Municipal Service Sector Study", and of a financial assessment of Bukhara and
        Samarkand water utilities in late 2006/early 2007. The findings of these studies allowed to elevate the
        discussion of project issues to a more systemic policy level. A workshop was held to disseminate the
        findings on May 25, 2007, with representation from all tiers of government and utility managers from
        other cities. A "Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Note" completed in March 2010 also helped
        sustain dialogue on investment and policy reform priorities.
     Preparation for two proposed projects began during implementation to ensure ongoing sector
        engagement and country dialogue.
     There was innovation in the technology for nonmetal pipes used in this project.
     The institutional memory of the project suffered due to project TTL transitions, and supervision tasks
        and focus suffered from discontinuity. Aide-Memoire documentation was not systematically arranged
        to assess progress toward PDOs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

As supplement to M&E conducted during implementation, project impact assessment studies were conducted
at the end of the project. The studies included further documentation of project performance indicators, and
importantly, customer surveys of perceived improvements in water service. Household surveys were
conducted in project areas benefitting from water production or distribution rehabilitation investments,
as well as in control areas within the VK's service perimeter untouched by the project. A total of 175
households were thus surveyed in Samarkand and 120 in Bukhara. The main findings are summarized
here and detailed in Annex 5. Households in the project areas attest to significant improvements in
water supply service since 200512:
     Almost half the surveyed households report better service regularity in the project areas of
         Samarkand and Bukhara (as compared to 10 to 20% in control areas)
         In both cities, beneficiaries report clear improvements in water pressure: Positive opinions are 1.2 to
         1.5 more frequent that negative ones in the project areas. By comparison, the pressure situation may
         have further degraded in control areas.
         There is no clearly perceived water quality improvement or deterioration since 2005. The overall
         appreciation is neutral in the project areas, while a sense of deterioration prevails as in control areas.
         Leaking mains are deemed less frequent by 37% of households in Samarkand project areas, whereas
         they are unchanged or more frequent for 86% of the sample in control areas. In Bukhara, a reduction
         in leaks perceived in the project areas and, to a lesser extent, in the control areas.
         Finally, in both cities, overall satisfaction with water service has increased as a result of the project. In
         Samarkand, 60% of surveyed households in project areas are satisfied with service evolution since
         2005, compared to 40% in control areas. In Bukhara the contrast starker, with two-thirds of project
         area households deeming service satisfactory or significantly improved, whereas in control areas two-
         thirds of households report that the service remains unsatisfactory or that it has deteriorated.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate



12 Reported trends are statistically significant with a 5% confidence interval, when compared to control areas. However,
since impact assessment reports were only available late in the ICR process, certain anomalies or outliers in the results
could not be reconciled. Since impact assessment reports were only available late in the ICR process, certain anomalies or
outliers in the results could not be reconciled survey results for Bukhara's service regularity, pressure, leaks in the streets
and leaks in homes, do not add-up to combined frequency of 100%. Results had to be adjusted to fit a total of 100%. See
for more details in Annex .5.

                                                             16
The majority of the financed and rehabilitated infrastructure was completed. However, the Assessment of Risk
to Development Outcome is rated cautiously as Moderate, for four reasons: (a) low gains in institutional
capacity building and technical knowledge transfer due to terminated SC; (b) lack of internalization and
sustainability of M&E as a mechanism for VK service improvement; (c) weak project ownership at higher tiers
of the GoU; and (d) the use of consultants on the implementation team whose association with the project
ended with the expiration of their contracts.

The major positive impact of the BSWSP can best be observed in the rehabilitated physical infrastructure,
pipes, water treatment plant (WTP), new machinery, and equipment; automated billing system; a complaint
response center; exposure to some efficiency gains and better management practices in water utility operation;
and a follow-up sewerage project that complements and continues work done under the BSWSP.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (that is, performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank's performance during preparation is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The concept of the project
responded to an ambition to accelerate infrastructure rehabilitation and utility turnaround in a context of
weakened sector governance and capacity. The project design was however too ambitious and untested,
driven by yet unmitigated Bank confidence in the universal applicability of PSP solutions, and ill-adapted to a
LICUS country with conservative post-Soviet institutions. From a methodological standpoint, the failure to
establish a rudimentary indicator baseline before project initiation was a major design weakness which led to
some target values that proved too ambitious for the KPIs. Attributable to inadequate background sector work,
the lack of baseline was inherent to the data-poor environment in which the project had to be designed. The
M&E approach was to rely fully on the PO, which may not have been the best strategy. Also, the risk of
termination of the SC/PO was not assessed during project design. The fact that project design might have
benefited had the project team more cautiously considered client capacity and the prevailing country-level
institutional conditions and processes does not diminish the concrete signs of relative project success: (a) all
the infrastructure was laid despite uncommon contractual and institutional challenges, and (b) nearly three-
quarters of a million people are now being supplied safe and affordable water.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank's performance during implementation is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. As seen above, this
ambitious and complex project in a challenging environment operated almost continuously in crisis mode,
placing extraordinary demands on Bank supervision teams and on implementing agencies. The range and
magnitude of disruptions experienced by the project imposed a reactive and adaptative supervision style. At
any given time TTLs had to focus on "putting out the biggest fire", and work with the Client in keeping the
project, at times even the VKs, "afloat". Such pragmatic supervision focus explains the remarkable
infrastructure completion outcome. It may also explain why project restructuring was not formally processed.

Supervision teams generally responded well to the many implementation challenges (see section 2.2). The
above mentioned priority trade-offs only partly justify the uneven supervision focus on some components.
Project progress was not systematically documented because reports did not gauge progress based on the
PDOs or project components. Consequently, assessment of progress, KPIs, issues, constraints, and
implementation problems was relatively weak. Frequent changes in project TTLs led to inconsistent attention
to key issues and delayed responses to requests for "no objections." Despite two QAGs, panel
recommendations were not clearly enacted through supervision. QAG assessments also suggest that project
ratings were not realistically assessed, and project issues thus remained under the management's radar.

                                                      17
As discussed in section 2.3, M&E was weak, and since it was delegated to the PO and technical auditors, the
Bank may not have felt vested enough to supervise this aspect of the project. It should have been an area of
focus to help the VKs better understand and integrate the value of performance indicators.

The Bank team's support of the Borrower's decision not to extend the SC over the term of the project, was a
complex and possibly unavoidable decision, reached with the help of PSP experts, based on a pragmatic
assessment of SC renegotiation chances and of likely impacts on project outputs and calendar. Such decision
has unfortunately had a lasting negative impact on PSP perceptions in Uzbekistan, and potentially set back
sector modernization and rationalization. Accessorily, the Bank did not thoroughly document the reasons or
claims for failure on the part of the PO and the Borrower.

Finally, during the MTR mission, the Bank team reported the need to restructure the project. However, Bank
management did not stress or address such need in the ISRs. With subsequent TTL transitions, the opportunity
was not followed through. Similarly, when the implementation arrangement of the project changed with the
PO's departure, the PDO/components of the project should have been amended to reflect that in the
Loan/Credit Agreement. A factor in this rating is the non-compliance that ensued between the actual project
implementation provisions of Component 2 and the provisions of the legal agreement.

The project was unusually complex and difficult to supervise and finding the right project leadership (TTL)
covering all the core areas of infrastructure, PSPs, and utility management, was difficult. This problem could
have been eased by augmenting the supervision budget to incorporate expertise relating to PSP, engineering,
utility operations, M&E, safeguards, etc. The task team worked extremely hard despite highly stressed project
and dialogue conditions, and its effectiveness is recognized in the fact that GoU and the Bank engaged in the
follow-up BSSP. The country-office staff played an invaluable role in ensuring continuity and responsiveness
of supervision and of client relationship. Finally, the important day-to-day supervision support by the Bank
team in the last three months of implementation must be acknowledged for facilitating the completion of the
critical but lagging contracts for the Mulyion Reservoir in Samarkand and Shokrud WTP in Bukhara.

Overall, the rating does not do justice to the uncommon commitment and skill deployed by supervision teams,
but reflects the inconsistent quality, continuity and internal compliance of supervision as managed by the Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank is largely responsible for the very ambitious design and quality at entry weaknesses of the project.
Despite the strenuous efforts of supervision teams, the project struggled from the start. Some hurdles lay
beyond the design and scope of the project, but others warranted mitigation by the Bank during
implementation stages. In retrospect, because it was within Bank's control to design a less risky and aggressive
project approach, to ensure more consistent M&E and supervision capacity and less TTL rotations, and to
restructure the project in a timely manner, the overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The GoU's performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Although the Government supported the project
concept, it did not consistently support its implementation, and should have responded to problems more
proactively. The first delay in the project implementation resulted from the GoU's transfer of project
responsibility from MMS to UzK, which had limited prior experience in handling WB projects. Although
caused by a court decision, and thus not under the direct control or competence of GoU, the ensuing blockage
of SVK/BVK accounts during the core implementation period adversely affected the SC/PO's performance for
two-and-a-half years of the three-year SC term. The Bank could not circumvent the situation in time to benefit


                                                      18
project implementation prior to the SC. Another problem within GoU's control was the lengthy registration
and review of import contracts, which delayed work commencement by three to six months after the contract
award. All these factors are evidence of uneven ownership of the project. Both central and local governments
deserve credit for their diligent attention to approving annual, albeit ultimately insufficient, tariff increases.

(b) Implementing Agency's or Agencies' Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Implementing Agencies' performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The biggest issue faced by the
implementing agency was the requisite capacity, or lack thereof, to implement the project in response to the
PDO. The project design intended PSP to fill any capacity gap needs while phasing out capacity transference
during the project. The signatories of the SC were the VKs, while UzK and regional governors' offices of
Bukhara and Samarkand were responsible for the project implementation. The PCU (with two PIUs)
coordinated project activities between the VKs, PO and national entities (ministries and agencies) as well as
with the Bank. The SVK/BVK­PO relationship was technically productive, but contractually problematic
because of the strained operating context, mixed PO performance, and reportedly weak VK commitment to
salvage the SC. The PIU/SVK/BVK's rigid following of the business plan developed by the PO instead of
revising it in the context of the utility's changing demands was evidence of weak capacity. This was
compounded by limited ownership of the project and its PSP approach by implementing agencies, poor
oversight of works and technical design, and continuous management changes in the VKs. High staff turnover
and the lack of a dedicated M&E Specialist during implementation and post-completion proved problematic.
The implementing agencies nevertheless deserve full credit for completing the infrastructure component,
despite PO departure, including through an impressive acceleration of works achieved in the last three months.
However, the quality control of execution and supervision of works remains questionable due to an overall
weak capacity for engineering design, innovation and works oversight during implementation, and insufficient
focus was sustained on the project institutional components and objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

As discussed, initiation of the project was delayed by almost 24 months. When the PO came onboard, the
financially strapped water utilities could not provide an environment conducive to undertaking an effective
PSP operation, which took another 30 months to resolve, impeding technology and capacity transference.
Based on the GoU's and implementing agencies' performance, overall Borrower's performance is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
Lesson Learned 1: Project design should be simple in a newly reforming, low-capacity context. Project
designs should be sensitive to the borrowing country's institutional capacity. In a low-capacity context, a
complex project design with a heavy reform agenda may not be feasible because of the steep learning curve.
Despite the reasonable scope of the BSWSP, improving SVK/BVK operations through a performance-based
management contract proved infeasible and lacked Borrower buy-in.
Lesson Learned 2: Projects should be restructured or amended to reflect important changes in
implementation. This is especially necessary when a loan's binding legal and credit agreement changes during
project implementation, and is needed to prevent the Project from being in a state of legal non-compliance.
Lesson Learned 3: TTL transitions should be managed carefully in difficult projects. TTL transitions impact
project implementation; if implementation is problem-ridden, due attention should be given to ensuring
overlap, smooth handover, and task-team continuity.




                                                       19
Lesson Learned 4: International consultants provide a valuable service. Despite costs that may seem
unjustified to local partners, international consultants provide valuable service, capacity transference, technical
astuteness, and better transparency, especially in the context of LICUS countries like Uzbekistan.
Lesson Learned 5: Civil works oversight/audit obligation by the Borrower is critical and should be built into
the contractual project implementation. A supervision consultant/contractor plays an essential role in
monitoring contractor work quality, providing technical oversight, and amending design during
implementation. With the BSWSP, supervision was handled by the PO during its contract term. After the PO
left, the BSWSP undertook the major chunk of physical work during which oversight was weak.
Lesson Learned 6: Monitoring should be simple and adapted to client capacity, and M&E plans and
collection of baseline data should be in place for projects by time of appraisal. Optimal M&E and KPIs
should have been based on parameters that could be realistically measured and reported by VKs on a regular
basis, and which provided actionable information to VKs and the PCU to improve project and utility
performance. In addition, especially for complex projects like the BSWSP, it is critical to have an M&E plan
in place and collection of baseline data instituted during the design phase.
Lesson Learned 7: Readiness of fiduciary and procurement capacity is essential to overall project
implementation success. Procurement packages should be completed ahead of bidding to avoid substantial
variations and delays. Similarly, financial management should be planned ahead of project launch. With the
BSWSP, compliance with both procurement and fiduciary management was weak.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Economic Analysis
At appraisal a cost benefit economic analysis was undertaken, which, due to major data limitations, was
understood as largely speculative. A disclaimer indicated that further review of the economic analysis was
granted for better assessment of economic benefits of the project, based on diligent data collection to be
conducted by the PO. Such data gathering and economic analysis update did not however materialize
during the term of the PO nor after it. At project closing, many critical data pieces were still missing,
including reliable economic data values, willingness to pay assessments, marginal costs of water
provision, assessment of consumer and tourism demands, beneficiary assessments, public health benefits,
environmental benefits associated with water conservation, social benefits associated with improved
water supply, energy costs associated with coping mechanisms, etc. Accordingly, no new cost benefit
economic analysis was undertaken as part of the ICR effort.

Financial Efficiency
Given the inconsistencies detected in the financial model used at appraisal to calculate project investment
rate of returns (IRR), such IRR analysis was not replicated as part of the ICR effort. A financial analysis
is instead presented based on utility data to assess the efficiency of the investments.

Progress towards financial viability of BVK and SVK was at the core of sector issues addressed by the
project at appraisal. Aside from considerable technical problems, the main obstacle identified in the PAD
was to set up the financial and institutional framework that would eventually allow BVK and SVK, over a
long-term horizon, to operate as both technically and financially sound local utilities. Increasing BVK's
and SVK's water tariffs and revenue collection was the most critical challenge at the time. The main
problems facing BVK and SVK in the area of finance included: (i) tariffs that were below operating and
maintenance costs (and no adequate provision for asset renewal); (ii) low collection of service charges
which resulted in ever increasing accounts payable and receivables; (iii) minimal cash collections
particularly from the budget organizations and industrial consumers that cancel their service fees through
a complex and cumbersome clearing system that leaves the vodokanals stranded for cash; (iv) a highly
distorted tariff structure with commercial tariffs about 8-10 times higher than those for domestic
consumers; (v) inadequate short and medium-term operating and capital planning; and (vi) insufficient
and outdated information about customers that directly affects billing.

The project's strategic choice was to jointly prepare and agree with the municipal governments a feasible
financial recovery plan aimed at reducing costs associated with system inefficiencies, increasing tariffs
and collections, reducing accounts payable to BVK and SVK from Government-owned entities, reducing
non-cash forms of payment, and improving financial and accounting information and planning. The
original financial analysis included two assumptions that prove critical in the results of the financial
analysis: i) it included an inflation factor of 0% and ii) an increasing exchange rate that would increase
from 200 UZS/dollar in 2000 to 790 UZS/dollar by 2004 and constant hereinafter.

Inflation rate in Uzbekistan has averaged 16% for the period 2000-2009. By not incorporating an
inflation factor in the model, all tariff-related increases were nominal, and not real. Tariff adjustments
should be real to allow for modifications to reflect changes in input prices.

In 2004 the exchange rate was already close to 1100 UZS/dollar and by 2010 the rate is approximately
1650 UZS/dollar. The more than doubling of the exchange rate from the base case has imposed severe

financial limitations on the water operators particularly to comply with the debt service obligations (see
attached tables below).

Analysis
In order to provide an analysis of the financial efficiency, it is important to address the two VKs
separately as performance varied substantially among the two.

Samarkand Vodokanal. At the time of appraisal, tariff levels ranged from 5.4 UZS/m3 for domestic
users to 24 UZS/m3 for industry. Collection rate was 86%, close to 40% of the costs were for energy use
and revenues did not cover operation and maintenance. Energy use was to be reduced by 25% by the end
of the project and tariff levels would range from 22 UZS/m3 for domestic to 35 UZS/m3 for industry. The
current tariff level is much higher, ranging from 120 UZS/m3 for residential consumers to 131 UZS/m3
for industry. But given the very high level of inflation, these increases have been marginally positive in
real terms. Collection rates have not improved and energy costs have remained at the same levels
described at appraisal.

The project has had a marginal contribution to increase performance of Vodokanal particularly in its
working ratio which decreased from 1.5 in 2006 to 1.2 in 2009. This seems to be related to two main
factors: i) the increase in revenues from residential customers and ii) the completion of the debt
repayments, which substantially reduced SVK's liability. However, the increase in revenues from
residential customers should have taken place earlier if metering programs had not been delayed.

Bukhara Vodokanal. At the time of appraisal, tariff levels ranged from 5.75 UZS/m3 for domestic users
to 24 UZS/m3 for industry. Collection rate was 95%, close to 26% of the costs were for energy use and
revenues did not cover operation and maintenance. Energy use was to be reduced by 25% by the end of
the project and tariff levels would range from 22 UZS/m3 for domestic to 35 UZS/m3 for industry. The
current tariff level is much higher, ranging from 120 UZS/m3 for residential consumers to 480 UZS/m3
for industry. For Bukhara, tariff levels for industry has seen a considerable increase although the implicit
cross subsidy implied by an increase in only this level creates additional inefficiencies in the sector.
Collections have continued to improve and the utility has reduced energy consumption by 42%.

The project has had a marginal contribution to increase performance of BVK particularly in its working
ratio which decreased from 1.25 in 2006 to 1.07 in 2009. This seems to be related to two main factors: i)
the increase in revenues from all levels of customers and ii) the completion of the debt repayments, which
substantially reduce the BVK's obligations.

Conclusions and recommendations
 The financial performance of the VKs calls for substantial improvements and efficiencies to be
   achieved. The project fell short of its targets.
 With the current tariffs and collection rates levels, the utilities are not able to generate sufficient cash
   to cover their operating expenses and annual debt service.
 Increases in tariff levels should be contemplated in real, rather than nominal terms,
 Financial, technical and commercial efficiency activities should be mainstreamed into project design
   and carefully monitored during project implementation,
 Water metering is essential for improving financial efficiencies and such programs should be
   implemented early on, not at the near end of the project,
 Basic assumptions such as exchange rates and inflation should be carefully embedded in financial
   simulators. Future modeling exercises should include a risk analysis section to identify sensitive
   variables that have a stronger influence on the outcome of the results.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
As supplement to M&E data gathering and interpretation conducted during implementation,
specific project impact assessment studies were conducted at the end of the project in Bukhara
and Samarkand. The studies included further documentation of project performance indicators,
and importantly, an assessment of the evolution in water service quality and satisfaction since
2005 through customer surveys. The studies were conducted by Donaev Management Consulting. A
total of 175 households were surveyed in Samarkand and 120 in Bukhara, distributed in "pilot
raion" and "control raion" areas:
        The "pilot raion" areas were selected in parts of the VK service perimeter that had
        directly benefited from water production or distribution rehabilitations by the project.
        The "control raion" areas were selected inside the VK service perimeter, but outside the
        zone of direct project intervention.

In both cities, statistically significant numbers of households attested to improvements in water supply
service in project areas since 2005, as detailed in the tables and graphs below. Reported trends are
statistically significant with a 5% confidence interval, when compared to control areas. Survey results
were however received late in the ICR process and certain data anomalies could not be fully reconciled13.

       Almost half the surveyed households report better service regularity in the project areas
       of Samarkand and Bukhara (as compared to 10 to 20% in control areas)
    In both cities, beneficiaries report clear improvements in water pressure: Positive
       opinions are 1.2 to 1.5 more frequent that negative ones in the project areas. By
       comparison, the pressure situation may have further degraded in control areas.
    There is no clearly perceived water quality improvement or deterioration since 2005. The
       overall appreciation is neutral in the project areas, whereas a sense of deterioration
       prevails in control areas.
    Leaking mains are deemed less frequent by 37% of households in Samarkand project
       areas, whereas they are unchanged or more frequent for 86% of the sample in control
       areas. In Bukhara, a reduction in leaks perceived in the project areas and, to a lesser
       extent, in the control areas.
    Finally, in both cities, overall satisfaction with water service has increased as a result of
       the project. In Samarkand, 60% of surveyed households in project areas are satisfied with
       service evolution since 2005, compared to 40% in control areas. In Bukhara the contrast
       starker, with two-thirds of project area households deeming service satisfactory or
       significantly improved, whereas in control areas two-thirds of households report that the
       service remains unsatisfactory or that it has significantly deteriorated.
The surveys also convey other perceived improvements by households, including increased VKs'
maintenance responsiveness and reduced prevalence of water-borne diseases.



13
   For instance, the frequency results for Bukhara's service regularity, pressure, and leaks do not add-up to a total
frequency of 100%, and such results had to be adjusted to fit a total of 100% in bar chart representation.

Introduction

The main goal of the project was to improve safety, quality, reliability, efficiency and sustainability of water
supply in the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. Project objectives are achieved through:

        Strategic Recovery and effectively improve the existing facilities in critical conditions;
        strengthening institutions of water utilities cities of Bukhara and Samarkand (Bukhara Vodokanal
        [BVK] and Samarkand Vodokanal [SVK]);
        Strengthening the financial capacity of BVK and SVK by improving financial management and
        business practices.

The total cost of the Project is US$62.54 million, including:

        Credit of International Development Association (IDA) in the amount equivalent to US$23.71
        million (38.3%).

Project provided own funds of Bukhara RPE "Suvokova" in the amount equivalent to US$2.43 million and
Samarkand MPSE "Suvokova" in the amount equivalent to US$2.9 million. According to the letter of the
Minister of Finance of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. /07-04-2/284 of 5.07.2005 and approval of the
World Bank from 21.07.2005 the investment of own funds were excluded from the project.

Projects main goals were increasing of efficiency, improving the quality, reliability, and water-supply safety
as well as strengthening of financial situation and stability of water-supply in Bukhara and Samarkand cities:

    () Reconstruction of strategic elements and increasing of efficiency of existing water-supply systems,
        which are in critical situation;
    (b) Strengthening of managing organization structure of Bukhara RPE "Suvokova" and Samarkand
        MPSE "Suvokova" through Service-Contract signed with experienced international Operator of
        water-supply systems based on performance indicators;
    (c) Strengthening of financial situation of Bukhara RPE "Suvokova" and Samarkand MPSE "Suvokova"
        through improvement of performance of financial management and introduction of market
        mechanisms.

The implementing agency is the "Uzkommunkhizmat" Agency. The Samarkand Regional Khokimiyat and
Bukhara Regional Khokimiyat carry out the assistance in the implementation. There were established the
Project Coordination Unit under the "Uzkommunkhizmat" Agency and Project Implementation Units in
Bukhara and Samarkand cities. In order to coordinate the implementation of the Project, carry out the
strategic management and general monitoring of the performance of the Project there was established the
Coordinating Committee, which includes the representatives of Ministries and Departments of the Republic
and local government bodies.

BACKGROUND

Origin of the Project

The water and sanitation services in Uzbekistan were rapidly deteriorating and the reliability and safety of
drinking water were continuously decreasing in a downward spiral. The water supply and sanitation sector in
Uzbekistan and in particular in Bukhara and Samarkand faced several constraints:

        Inefficient operations: Potable water and wastewater treatment plants were poorly maintained and
        operated resulting in poor performance in terms of quality of output and efficiency. For example, In
        Bukhara, the main and the network pumping stations of the wastewater system were in a dramatic
        poor state of maintenance.
        Poor service levels: The excessive water losses and waste result in poor service levels to the
        population and industries. The water supply services in the two cities were poor in different
        dimensions.
        Poor state of repair of facilities: although the percentage of urban households connected to pipe
        water supply was greater than 80%, the water treatment and distribution facilities, as well as the
        wastewater collection and treatment installations were rapidly deteriorating. In both cities a good
        part of the secondary network of the wastewater system is hydraulically overloaded. The lack of
        appropriate maintenance, poor planning, the use of low quality materials and equipment, and poor
        construction quality, combined with the recent shortages of resources, are responsible for the poor
        state of repair of water supply and wastewater assets. This trend brings the water and sanitation
        systems toward lower and lower service levels that will bring parts, and eventually the totality of the
        system, to a halt.
        Unviable financial shortfalls: The water and wastewater utilities in Uzbekistan are facing reduced
        government transfers due to fiscal constraints, very low tariffs in Uzbekistan, it was about
        US$0.005/m3 in 1999), high cross-subsidies (in Bukhara and Samarkand the level of tariffs for
        nondomestic consumers was about 8 to 10 times higher than for domestic consumers), and poor
        collections. Not only revenues were insufficient to cover basic operational costs (much less
        maintenance costs), the BVK and SVK were only able to recover about 18% and 27% of their
        billings in cash respectively. The rest was either paid through a cumbersome system of invoice
        clearing and compensation with other utilities and customers' own invoices and payments, or simply
        not recovered at all leading to a total collection level of 56% and 79% of billing in Bukhara and
        Samarkand respectively. In both cities the utilities' accounts receivable represent about seven months
        of billing leaving them in a financially untenable situation. The utilities continue their operations by
        cutting maintenance expenses and not paying vodokanal staff and their suppliers, most notably
        electricity providers.
        Weak human resource and institutional capacity: Despite many of skilled technical professionals
        working in the water sector in Uzbekistan, there was an urgent need for updating and improving
        skills in modern utility management systems (including management and operations of water supply
        and sanitation systems), planning strategies, financial and commercial management, and investment
        selection. The capacity of Municipalities and anti-monopoly commissions to monitor and regulate
        the vodokanals without undue interference also needs substantial strengthening. The accounting,
        financial and operational data collection and management systems were inadequate and did not
        provide a clear picture of the problems faced by the utilities. In fact, financial reports severely
        overstate the financial performance of vodokanals.
        Water resources scarcity: Many water supply enterprises in Uzbekistan were located in basins with
        limited water resources. Although urban water supply was not the largest user of water resources, the
        competition with other sectors, mainly agriculture becomes particularly important during drought
        periods. The problem of water resources was compounded by poor management of regional water
        systems, poor allocation of water, pollution caused by agriculture and industry in some areas, and

                                                      48
        wastage in the drinking water systems, both from leakage and lack of water conservation practices.
        In addition, operational costs of some of the utilities, such as BVK, are increased by their
        dependence on water resources located at a long distance from the population they serve and
        transported through channels or large mains over hundreds of kilometers.

The Government strategy for the proposed Bukhara and Samarkand project is twofold. First, to define a new
relationship between the central and local governments based on a full decentralization of responsibilities to
the local level for the provision of services and full cost-recovery of operational, maintenance and debt
service expenses through water and wastewater tariffs. Second, to test for the first time in Uzbekistan, a new
strategy to improve water supply services by involving the private sector in the provision of these services.
This operation is designed as a first step in the implementation of this strategy, focusing on the two key areas
that need the most improvement in the vodokanals, namely the operational efficiency of the water supply
systems and the financial and commercial strategies.

As part of the Government strategy in the water supply sector, and more generally in the communal services,
the Ministry of Communal Services was restructured in December 2000 as an Agency of Communal Services
(ACS) with the main goal of commercializing the activities of city and district communal service providers.

Some of the key goals of this restructuring and the responsibilities of the new ACS include: (a) to coordinate
the reforms in the communal services sector; (b) to act as regulator and to monitor the compliance of local
authorities and commercial entities with the sector legislation; and (c) to attract foreign investments into the
sector, including the establishment of joint ventures. As part of the reform, the local governments received
the responsibility for the provision of water supply and sanitation services. The new policy calls for the
promotion of alternative contractors for such provision so as to create a competitive environment. In
addition, the policy gives a clear mandate to the local governments and service providers to improve
efficiency and focus on water demand management.

PROJECT SCOPE AND COSTS

Scope of project:

Including Sanitation Component. The limited funds under this Bank operation, directly linked to the small
borrowing capacity of the vodokanals and municipalities, require a focused operation in the most critical part
of the systems. An evaluation of the sector indicated that water supply has several components close to
collapse with potentially major negative consequences for the population. Furthermore, the expected benefits
are expected to be greater by focusing first on water supply and the expressed preference of the population is
for initial improvement in water supply services as indicated by the Social Assessment results (improving
water quality is the first priority in Bukhara and improving reliability of water supply services is the first
priority in Samarkand).

Including Cultural Heritage. The initial concept of the project included a component in cultural heritage to
restore historical monuments with support by donors in order to develop the tourism industry. As project
preparation progressed, it became clear that the water supply problems were very urgent and this area was
selected to focus the project objectives in order to have greater benefits with the limited funding available.
Separate donor programs for the cultural heritage activities were initiated.


Project Components
Project Component 1: Investment Fund. This component would finance essential short-term expenditures
(such as materials, equipment, vehicles) and a least-cost capital investment program aimed at improving the
operations of the water supply system and the services to the population by achieving the performance
improvement targets in the service contract. The Operator, together with BVK and SVK staff, will propose

                                                      49
the investments that are required to optimally re-structure and rehabilitate key components of the systems
(such as sections of the water distribution networks and block distribution systems, specific components of
the treatment plants, pumping stations), implement a demand management program, and set up financial
management, accounting and commercial systems.

Project Component 2: Service Contract. This component would finance the costs related to the service
contract. These costs include a base fee and a performance-based fee to be paid to the private Operator based
on achievement of targets defined in the contract. The Operator would be given full responsibility for
managing the investment program, operating the water supply system, and developing and implementing the
demand management program and the commercial (billing and collection) and financial management
departments.

Project Component 3: Consulting Services and Project Coordination Unit. This component would support
the Project Coordination Unit (PCU); Independent technical and financial auditors that would monitor the
Operator's performance; independent financial auditors to prepare the financial project audits; and other
consulting services.

Project Component 4: Refinancing of Project Preparation Facility (PPF).This component would refund the
PPF advance used for PCU establishment and operational expenses, necessary equipment and software for the
implementation of the financial management system, procurement assistance, training and operational travel
of PCU staff.

For the first time in Central Asian region, there has been developed and implemented a computer model of
NIS (Network Information System) in both cities, which provided the creation of a centralized database on
water pipes, water lines, nodal points, to conduct an inventory of networks and was developed by the NHM
(Network Hydraulic Modeling) to display system pressure and flow rate that allows you to quickly identify
and fix leaks.

Under the Project there was realized "Community (makhallya) based urban water supply" roject
financed by Japan Social Development Fund in the amount of US$1.69 million, aimed for assistance in
reduction of losses and decreasing of wasteful treatment to water in selected high-rise apartment buildings of
Bukhara and Samarkand cities. Repair and rehabilitation operations for replacement of house pipe line,
equipment and widgets were provided in 85 blocks of flats in Bukhara and Samarkand cities (Bukhara ­ 39,
Samarkand ­ 46).

Project Achievements for Bukhara city

Bukhara is one of the oldest cities in Central Asia and the center of Bukhara region. Population of Bukhara
city is about 300,000 people. The city's area is 39.4 km². The basic layout of the city, established by the
terrain, remained to date. The city is located in Zarafshan valley, in the bottom of the basin, on the right side
of the shore. Area is about 2.6 thousand hectares and consists of a single-story and multistory buildings: the
central part of the old city is single-storey buildings, new micro-districts in the southern and southeastern
parts with multistory decent dwellings. At present, coverage of Bukhara with centralized water supply is 98%
and with centralized sewerage--more than 50%.

The total project cost for Bukhara city was US$23.63, including funding from IBRD loan and IDA Credit--
US$19.98 and the national budget--US$3.65 million.

 For successful project implementation, international operator's services for water supply, improvement of
technical and financial performance of public utilities for water and sanitation were involved. Service
contract signed with an international operator was completed on July 1, 2007.

                                                       50
Individual consultants for technical, commercial and financial fields have been involved to ensure continuous
monitoring objectives.

       In accordance with technical consultant that helped in the continued timely implementation and
completion of the project, including:

        · Monitoring of reduction of energy consumption, water losses;
        · Ensuring quality control;
        · Monitoring of the procurement process;
        · Advising RPE "Suvokova" in the financial and commercial activities;
        · Promotion of Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the two
        cities in the area of monitoring and technical supervision of the project, as well as in the preparation
        of required reports for the World Bank and the Swiss Government.

Analysis of specific energy consumption in BVK was conducted at Shokhrud pumping stations, Zarafshan
and Kuymazar (water supply in Bukhara city), providing its own water production. The total active energy
consumption in March, 2010 made 1,607,547 kW/h.

Considering water production at its own pumping stations--2,843,061 m³ and power consumption--
1,252,766 kW/h. BVK specific consumption in March, 2010 amounted to 0.441 kW/h per m³.

In the base year (2003), and specific power consumption in the BVK was 1.104 kW/h per m³.

There is a gradual decrease of volume of specific energy consumption. For the period of 30.06.2006 decrease
in specific energy consumption in comparison with base period was 9.7%, while for the period of 01.04.2010
energy consumption decreased by 60.09%. Target indicator at the end of the project was 10%. Consequently,
significant decrease of specific energy consumption with respect to indicators in 2003 has been noted in
Bukhara.

At the time of project completion the works on the replacement of pipes are finished, and the scope of
the completed works was 114.4 km of replaced worn-out water networks, which the target indicator
exceeds 110 km by 4.4 km. This confirms the successful achievement of the target, replacement of
worn pipes.

BVK carried out the reconstruction of water treatment facilities at Shokhrud water treatment plant. Works
completed on reconstruction have been executed on time, that is June 30, 2010, and are as follows:

1) Horizontal sedimentation pools. The reconstruction of two tanks of 50,000 m³ has been performed, which
were not used because of depressurization, trays and dampers that allowed for settling and water cleaning in
volume of 100,000 m³, coming from "Kuyu Mazar" water intake;

2) Filtering station. US$1008.35 thousand was spent for the reconstruction of filtering plant with capacity of
100,000 m³ per day. Full load of filter bunkers with zeolite in the volume of 630 tons has been performed.
Filtration is carried out in a semi-automatic mode;


                                                      51
3) Electrolysis plant. Productivity of electrolysis--20 kg / d of chlorine.

The station produces a ready solution of sodium hypochlorite with a concentration of 0.6­ 08% of chlorine
(6­8 g/l). Installation cost jointly with delivery, installation supervision and commissioning--US$469,000,
manufactured by CRUNDFOS ALLDOS. Production and use of chlorine are performed automatically.

4) Civil and erection works on the fence, installation of watchtowers, burglar alarm at "Shokhrud" WTP and
"Kuyu Mazar" and "Zarafshan" water intakes have been carried out in accordance with the regulatory
requirements for the protection of objects related to clause 2.

5) In general, works done at "Shokhrud" WTP--the reconstruction of horizontal sedimentation pools,
construction of filtration plant and installation of electrolysis - allowed for water supply in full compliance
with sanitary standards.

Also the following works have been executed:

         Reconstruction of water mains from the Shokhrud WTP of distribution channel station up to the
         existing water main Karvan Bazaar, D-700 mm, 0.96 km;
         Reconstruction of 700 mm water main of "Shokhrud" WTP along Gazliyskoe road up to Carvon
         Bazaar with length of 3.84 km. 3.84 km of water networks with D 700 mm have been put into
         operation.

As of 31.08.2007, 49 new connections were registered, which were transferred from the illegal status to
status of legal connections and included in the database of consumers. 42 connections of them are
commercial customers and 7 connections--residential consumer. As of 31/10/2009, there were 61 new
connections. Illegal connections have not been revealed for the period of 01.04.2010.

Monitoring tests with regard to nonrevenue water revealed that nonrevenue water was 28.4% of production
water balance. Permissible target indicator of "nonrevenue" water losses at the end of project completion
should be 30% of production water volume. This indicator for 2007 reached 30.9%. This indicator was
29.2% in 2008. On the whole, the indicator of nonrevenue water/losses volume--30%--was achieved at
the project ending. As of June 30, 2010, the percentage of nonrevenue water was 28.4%.

Base indicator of water volume production makes up 42,273 thousand m3.

The sales of water volume supplying to customers decreased during 2005­09. Annual water sales in 2005
were 96% of annual water sales of 2003.

The gradual increase of tariffs for water and installation of water meters promoted more economical water
discharge and timely elimination of water losses in water supply networks.

Project Achievements for Samarkand

Samarkand, located in the northwestern part of Uzbekistan, in the center of Zerafshan valley on the left bank
of Zerafshan River, is the administrative, cultural and tourist center of Samarkand region and the Republic.
The modern city's population is 392,000 people, given the rural villages surrounding the city--442,109. At
the present 100% of Samarkand city population is covered by centralized water supply system.

The total project cost for the city of Samarkand was 28.03 million U.S. dollars, including funding from IBRD
loan and IDA credit--23.88 million and the Republican Budget--4.15 million U.S. dollars. In addition, there
were financed 6.25 million U.S. dollars from the Swiss Government Grant.

For the successful implementation of the project there were involved an international Operator services for
water supply, improvement of technical and financial performance of public utilities for water and sanitation.
Signed service contract with an international Operator was completed on July 1, 2007.

In order to ensure continuous monitoring objectives there have been involved individual consultants for
technical, commercial and financial areas.

In accordance with the technical consultant it helped in the continued timely implementation and completion
of the project, including:

        Monitoring the reduction of energy consumption, water losses;
        Ensuring quality control;
        Control of the procurement process;
        Advising MPSE "Suvokova" in the financial and commercial activities;
        Cooperation with Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the
        two cities in the area of monitoring and technical supervision of the project, as well as in the
        preparation of necessary reports for the World Bank and the Swiss Government.

At the time of completion of the project, the works on replacement of pipes were completed and the
volume of the completed works was 130.1 km of replaced worn-out water networks in 147 streets,
which corresponds to a target amount of 130 km. This confirms the successful achievement of the
targeted replacement of worn pipes.

Replacement of worn-out water networks in Samarkand for the period from 2005 to June 30, 2010.

Works

The 130.1 km of water networks put into operation include 26.8 km of main water pipes, including:

        9.2 km of water conduit to transport water from Chupan-Ata water intake to the city. The
        construction of this water conduit provide the improvement of water supply to the old part of the city
        and to the distribution point in Mulyon, which in its turn, supplies drinking water to the densely
        populated settlement Sattepo and central city heat-house.



                                                     54
        13.9 km of water conduit to transport water from Dagbit water intake to the city. This network
        provided the improvement of water supply to the third level pump stations Sogdiana, Mikrorayon,
        and Beruni, which supply water to densely populated settlements.
        3.7 km of water conduit were constructed in the settlements of Samarkand.

As an addition to the constructed water conduit with length of 9.2 km, there was built a reservoir with
capacity of 10,000 m3, which provided uninterruptible water supply to Sattepo settlement.

One of the successful construction projects is the reconstruction of the Tashkent water conduit with D =
1,000 mm and length of 6.75 km. Construction of the facility, besides the emergency replacement of water
conduit, provided the reallocation of the water conduit from historical area to the safer distance from the
historic--architectural ensemble of Registan and Bibikhanym mosque.

Under the project, with the purpose of improvement of the efficiency of the utilities and for energy saving,
there were also reconstructed main and local water intakes, pumping stations of third lift. In particular:

       · In Chupan-Ata water intake there were reconstructed 17 wells, replaced 7 km of cable and 3
         horizontal pumps, as well as 48 deep-well pumps. There was installed a flow meter, electronic
         electricity meter, Russian company "Interenergoinvest" installed high-voltage frequency
         converters, which currently yield savings of electric energy in up to 20%.
       · In Dagbit water intake there were reconstructed 5 wells, replaced 1.3 km of cable, 5 horizontal
         pumps and 33 deep-well pumps. There was installed a flow meter, electronic electricity meter, the
         frequency converter. Renovated a lifting hoist.
       · In Mulyon distribution point, there was renovated the building of pumping station, expanded the
         territory of the distribution point, produced improvements, replaced 4,5 km of cable and additionally
         installed 4 Swiss horizontal pumps. Installed a flow meter, electronic electricity meter and two sets
         of frequency converters.
       · In the pumping stations of the third lift, there were reconstructed power systems with the
         replacement of transformers and pumps. Renovated buildings of pumping stations, upgrading and
         installation of flow meters. Reconstruction of the fencing of "Leo Tolstoy" pumping station and
         protection of the zone of the station and chemical laboratory. In "Gormolzavod" pumping station
         there was mounted a lifting hoist.
       · In local small water intakes of Charhin, Khimiki, Farhad, Khishrau, there were reconstructed of
         power systems with the replacement of transformers and pumps. There was renovated the building of
         pumping station, upgrading and installation of flow meters. Also performed the audit of wells and
         site preparation for installation of pumping equipment procured from the funds of the Swiss Grant.

       As a result, along with upgrading the obsolete pumping and electrical equipment, there was put into
account the production of water from water intakes and the water supply from pumping stations of the third
lift. With the installation of frequency converters in the main pumping stations, there was achieved the
reduction in electricity consumption by 20%.

       · Consumers are equipped with water meters, including 47,500 units installed in private households,
         800 pcs. installed in the main water supply inlets of apartment buildings, which provided
         equipment of SVK consumers by 67% (58,388 consumers equipped from total of 87,517
         consumers in July 1, 2010)

Sanitation and Environmental assessment

An initial review of potential environmental impacts and appropriate mitigation measures indicated that the
project activities fall within the Category B as per the Bank's OP 4.01. The project is expected to bring
significant environmental and health benefits, such as improvements in public health through better quality
and availability of treated water, and improvements in the sustainability of raw water sources through
reductions in losses and wastage. Potential negative effects can be minimized through appropriate mitigation
measures, which for this project are basically normal construction and utility operation practices.

The EMP includes a description of the legal and administrative framework of the environment sector with
specific application to the project, a description of the baseline conditions, identification of main impacts,
specific mitigation measures with implementation and monitoring responsibilities and estimated budget.

The provisions in the EMP are adequate to minimize potential negative environmental impacts associated
with project activities.

The EMP will be implemented by BVK and SVK, under the management of an international utility Operator.
The provisions of the EMP and the applicable local environmental regulations will be incorporated in the
service contract to be signed between the Municipalities of Bukhara and Samarkand cities and the
international utility Operator. Having an international Operator managing the utility company ensured
compliance with these measures as well as knowledge transfer.


Lessons learned

The proposed operation in Bukhara and Samarkand is the second Bank-financed project in the water supply
sector in Uzbekistan. The project suffered numerous implementation difficulties and was in unsatisfactory
status for more than two years. The first project, designed to assist communities most severely affected by
the Aral Sea environmental disaster, is now in satisfactory status and the lessons learned during the
restructuring process have been very useful in the preparation of the proposed operation.

The key lessons learned during the implementation of "Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply" Project
include:

    1. Overly complex structure of problem solving in urban sector.
    2. The activities of international consultants must be discussed in advance with the Government and
       their selection and contracting should be done as early as possible and at least before launching
       project implementation.
    3. Project implementation arrangements must be well defined and the roles between project
       coordinators named by the Government and international consultants should be clearly identified so
       that adequate supervision can take place.

                                                     58
    4. Officials from the central and local government and vodokanal staff should be fully involved in
       project preparation and implementation.
    5. Project development objectives should be modest, well-defined, and achievable.
    6. All agencies in charge of providing counterpart financing should understand the expected profile so
       that adequate planning can be made in advance.

An important lesson to be learned from this project in the water sector include: Continuous interaction of
PCU with BVK and SVK, administrations of Bukhara and Samarkand region, Ministry of Finance,
Economics, Ministry of Foreign Economic Affairs, Cabinet of Ministers and other concerned agencies during
project preparation and implementation. This interaction continues throughout the project, with the
participation of the Bank team supervising the project. Sustainability of the project depended on a realistic
assessment and prediction of minimum financial capacity of utilities and liabilities of khokimiyats of
Bukhara and Samarkand regions to support the financial recovery plan based on a larger collection and a
commensurate increase in tariffs.

Progress on the financial position of BVK and SVK and changes in circumstances were carefully monitored
to support the efforts and initiatives to improve the viability of water utilities. Strengthening of BVK and
SVK was carried out by the project, as water utilities staff responsible for the daily activities of operational
improvement programs under management consultant who implement specific, targeted for training on the
job not only as a condition of contract for services, but also ensured the achievement of goals used to
determine the bonus payment. In addition, the Operational Manual had clear and concrete measures to
implement the project, including the responsibilities of each party. Successful preparation and
implementation of the project required a strong PCU with the support of experienced international team of
consultants with engineering and financial experience.


                   A.7.2 BORROWER's COMMENTS on DRAFT ICR (Nov 2010)

The draft Implementation Completion and Results Report was considered by Bukhara RPE "Suvokova",
Samarkand RSPE "Suvokova", Municipalities of Bukhara and Samarkand Regions and "Uzkommunkhizmat"
Agency. In joint opinion they are not agree with the "Moderate Unsatisfactory" rating. The Borrower insists
that "Moderate Satisfactory" is more corresponding.

The ICR Report laid stress on financial and institutional problems of Vodokanals. Firstly public services
sector is a part of the state social policy. The tariffs for water supplying are limited by the payment capacity
of the population and should not require that financial position of Vodokanals have to be similar as financial
position of any commercial entity. Secondly institutional issues depend on technical conditions of water
supply facilities in cities. Although majority of intakes and pumping station were rehabilitated, the most
troubling part ­ water supply networks were reconstructed for 15-20%. It is necessary 2-3 times more
investments for achievement objectives required by ICR Report. It should not be required from the Project
more than actual possible outcome.

Significant physical investments were utilized during the project implementation, water treatment facilities,
pumping stations and 244.1 km of water supply networks were reconstructed. It was done more than planned.
These achievements of the Bank Task Team and Implementing agency have to be assessed objectively.

Below are detailed comments to the text of the report:

    1.   Comment: Table B. Consolidated assessment ­ probably can lead to misunderstanding as we use the other
         scale of assessment therefore it is necessary to give interpretation of the scale of assessments before the table
         and remove all tables into the end of the report as annexes. Text evaluation of the Project and the actions of
         the Borrower and the Bank would give a clearer picture and allow evaluating the Project objectively. In the
         case of a tabular assessment there is a risk that nonobjective evaluation of the project will arise at the

                                                           59
     concerned ministries and agencies and: or use excessive violent measures to the performers or considering the
     high estimate does not give necessary attention to the new project on sanitation. We kindly ask you to revise
     the evaluations from Moderately Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory and remove the Table B into the
     end of Report, and preface the Report from the brief summary, taking into account difficult launch conditions
     and achievement of most of the indicators. The executive agency, Municipalities of Bukhara and Samarkand
     regions and Vodokanals are against publishing current assessments of the Report.

2.   Comment. Section «Data sheet» part F. Tables with PDO and IO indicators missed. There is Attachment 2 to
     Report with information about Indicators therefore delete these tables from Data sheet is proposing.

3.   Comment. Section «Data sheet» part H. There is no information about restructuring conducted during Mid
     Term Review during 2007. Part H has to be filling up.

4.   Comment: Item 1.3. Restructuring of the project was conducted during the Midterm review, secondary
     indicators were revised. The Feasibility Study of the project was adjusted. The basic objective of the Project
     such as safety, quality, reliability, efficiency, financial viability and sustainability were not be revised as
     rejection of them would make the project meaningless. Quantity indicators have been revised and method of
     their determination has been refined. The Government considered the new indicators and approved them.

5.   Please clarify: the item 1.5. Section "Component 3" The estimated cost is specified incorrectly. The total
     estimated amount under the Component 3 "PCU Incremental Operating Cost" was US$ 1.05 million. Actual
     expenditures consisted US$ 0.98 mln. (Bukhara 0.47 mln. Samarkand 0.51 mln.

6.   Please clarify: the item 1.5. Section "Project costs" co-financing was planning in the amount of US$ 13.33
     million including the Government share - US$ 8 million and own means of Vodokanals - US$ 5, 33 million.

7.   Please clarify: the item 1.7. Section "Revision of the Project Implementation Arrangements to achieve the
     PDO". After completion of the Service Contract by the letter of the World Bank dated May 29, 2007 to
     Municipalities of Bukhara and Samarkand regions and to the Heads of Vodokanals the item 2.06 about Service
     Contract was excluded from the Project Implementation Agreement. Hence on the basis of restructuring of the
     project in the legal documents necessary changes were made.

8.   Comment: the item 2.2. (i) During the first selection of the Operator negotiations with the next bidder had not
     been maintained due to the fact that the financial offer of more than US$ 7 million given that the budget was
     US$ 5.2 million. It was obvious that the excess of the budget for more than 34% will not be approved by the
     Government.

9.   PCU does not agree with the statement, that the Government decision insignificantly improved the financial
     standing of Vodokanals. The Government allocated more than UZS 10 billion UZS, that 1.56 times more of the
     revenue of both Vodokanals in 2006, Vodokanals were released from the obligations under the so-financing of
     the Project in the amount of US$ 5,33 million.

10. Amendments were introduced into the Agreements of Project Implementation in according with completion of
    the Service Contract with BVK and SVK.

11. Comment: item 2.2 (ii) Individual consultants have been former Operator staff, consequently they had an
    adequate potential for assistance in project implementation. The analysis of the Vodokanal operation showed
    that there were no abrupt negative changes in the enterprise activity. Sub-item (i)-(ii): assessment is not
    impartial and is underestimated. There were partial short-comings, but in general all planned civil works had
    been accomplished (244 km pipelines replaced out of planned 240 km).

12. Sub-item (v) As the contracts were funded from two sources (The World Bank and The Government) advance
    payment had been released by two tranches. When contract amounts substantially increased in accordance with
    addenda, the advance payment was paid additionally, as the contract conditions envisaged the 15% or 20%
    advance payment of the total contract amount. Therefore, the additional advance payments have been released
    as a result of increase of the contract amount.

13. Objection: Item 2.2 paragraph "Implementation" The implementing agency and Vodokanals disagree with the
    assessment that PCU/PIU/SVK/BVK had a low potential in management of private operator / Service Contract.
    Operator submitted almost all reports and relevant documentation. The Client ensured the permanent presence
    of Operator specialists at field. The Technical Auditor raised the availability of certain achievements under the
    performance indicators of the Service Contract. In general the Service Contract had been accomplished without
    conflicts between the Client and Operator, because there was a regular dialogue between the contract parties.
    The discussions were as a matter of work nature which mainly concerned technical issues. Exactly, the
    availability of discussions between parties proves that PCU/PIU/SVK/BVK had an understanding of what is
    required from Operator in order to achieve Project objectives and thereby the Client asserted his interests.
    Perhaps, the Service Contract itself was inconsistent with the actual circumstances, but the Operator and the
    Clients always strived for the fulfillment of it in full capacity. Consequently, PCU/PIU/SVK/BVK had an
    adequate potential in managing the private operator/ Service Contract.

14. Objection: Item 2.4 paragraph "Financial management and Disbursements": The implementing agency and
    Vodokanals absolutely disagree with such an assessment and are against the publication of this paragraph. The
    given paragraph is based on the findings of Fiduciary report, with which PCU absolutely disagrees and is
    preparing its objections. Many facts described in Fiduciary report are wrong. The Implementing agency is
    against the publication of this paragraph.

15. Objection: Item 2.4 paragraph "Procurement": PCU absolutely disagrees with such an assessment and is
    against the publication of this paragraph. For the first time the PCU is being informed on some kind of
    assessment of procurement process. The findings of independent assessment are not confirmed by facts. The
    paragraph cannot be published until the Implementing agency and Vodokanals are provided with the
    independent assessment report for preparation of objections and comments.

16. Please clarify: item 3.2 paragraph "Key Performance Indicators": The Audit of project indicators was
    conducted annually starting from 2005 (Completion of the first year of Service Contract). The last audit was
    conducted in September 2010, i.e. after the Project completion works. A special consultant was hired for the
    monitoring of indicators, which was continued after the Operator. The reports were prepared monthly.

17. Objection: item 3.2 paragraph "Project components": Assessment of project components as "moderate
    unsatisfactory" is inconsistent with the fact that components 3 and 4 are assessed as "satisfactory" and
    "moderate satisfactory".

18. Component 2: There was no premature termination of the Service Contract. Initially, the contract was signed
    for 3 years. The Operator accomplished 28 out 31 reports, which makes an overwhelming majority. It is the
    service of Operator that Components 1, 3 and 4 were assessed as satisfactory and therefore Component 2 shall
    be assessed as "moderate satisfactory" too.

19. Component 3: A special consultant was hired for the monitoring of indicators, which was continued after the
    Operator. The reports were prepared monthly. In general, component shall be assessed "moderate satisfactory".

20. Objection: item 3.4 - The justification of assessments shall be revised and extended; low assessments need
    more justifications. Connection of consumers was not the part of Project indicators, although water mains,
    street and internal area networks have been reconstructed at the progress of the Project. Distribution lines, to
    which consumers are connected, have not been reconstructed. Here, fairly satisfactory is more impartial.

21. Objection: item 5.2 (a) The Implementing agency and Vodokanals disagree with the assessment of
    effectiveness of the Government activity as "fairly unsatisfactory". Handing over of the project implementation
    on the initial stage, from the Ministry of Macroeconomics and statistics to "Uzkommunhizmat" Agency, was
    an action directed to secure Project implementation. Release of BVK/ SVK accounts blocking is not the
    competency of the Government. The blocking of account is occurred due to inability of BVK and SVK to pay
    the bills of suppliers. To solve this problem it was necessary either to increase the collection of payments for
    water, which relates to the competency of Operator or allocate a subsidy. Allocation of subsidy from the State
    budget cannot be processed quickly, the amount of allocated subsidy exceeded the Annual Sales of BVK and
    SVK in 1,5 times. The Government undertook the greater part of the credit and loan and continues to render its
    help in attracting additional investments. The financial status of Vodokanals is permanently controlled by the


                                                      61
    Government. The growth of tariffs for water services exceeds the indicators, planned in line with the project
    feasibility study. The assessment shall be revised to satisfactory.

22. Objection: item 5.2 (b) ­ Implementing agency and Vodokanals disagree with the assessment of the
    implementing agency activity. First of all, the Operator was approved by the World Bank and therefore he was
    hired. Consequently, PCU had potential to hire Operator in accordance with the Bank procedures. Secondly,
    the affirmation on the problematic character of relations with Operator is inconsistent with the statement where
    PIU/BVK/SVK carefully followed the business plan developed by the private operator. There cannot be
    problematic relations when carefully following the developed plan. The civil works supervision was conducted
    up to the mark by the following persons: Operator specialists, the relevant staff of department of Vodokanal,
    PIU supervision specialist and State Architectural-Construction Supervision Agency. All civil works planned
    by the Project have been accomplished in full capacity.

23. The monitoring has been conducted by the Consultant for assistance in institutional development. The
    assessment needs revision up to fairly satisfactory.

24. Please clarify: item 6 Lesson 10. The construction supervision has been properly conducted by the following
    persons: Operator specialists, the relevant staff of department of Vodokanal, PIU supervision specialist and
    State Architectural-Construction Supervision Agency. All civil works planned were performed in full.

25. Please clarify. Annex 1. (a) Component 3 should be renamed "Incremental Operation Costs", actual
    disbursement under that component US$ 0.98 million (Bukhara US$ 0.47 million; Samarkand US$ 0.51
    million). The budget and costs under the consulting services are included into Investment Fund. It is necessary
    to add data into the Table under actual disbursement of Component 4 Swiss Grant US$ 9.14 million. Total
    amount of financing under the column Actual disbursement will be US$ 61.62 million.

26. Please clarify. Annex 1. (b) The amount of actual disbursement of the Borrower (5.72) should be revised to
    US$ 7.9 million. The amount of actual disbursement of IBRD funds US$ 18.84 million; IDA ­ 23.88 million.
    Totally under the project was disbursed US$ 61.62.

27. Please clarify. Annex 2. Item 4 Indicator (water conduits replacement). The indicator value at June 30, 2010
    be corrected for Samarkand 114,4 km and Bukhara 130,1km.

28. Please clarify. Annex 5. Social survey of beneficiaries had been conducted and incorporated into the Project
    Impact Assessment Report, which was submitted to the World Bank.

29. Please clarify. Annex 6 Instead the notice "not undertaken" it is necessary to indicate "not required".
    Conducting of the workshop was not included into the ToR for Project Impact Assessment. The ToR was
    agreed with the World Bank.

30. Please clarify. Annex 7 It is necessary to indicate that the municipalities of Bukhara and Samarkand regions
    are Implementing agencies on a level with the "Uzkommunkhizmat" Agency.

31. Objection. Annex 7. Paragraphs of "Unviable financial shortfalls" and "Weak human resource and institutional
    capacity" it cannot be published. Finance is a very complicated and complex issue, and one paragraph does not
    give an objective picture. As regards human resources, no research has been conducted; the opinion expressed
    in the report is incorrect. During a brief visit is impossible to make an objective opinion on workers throughout
    the sector, municipalities and the anti-monopoly commissions, especially as a representative of the Bank not
    met with them.

Annex 10. Project Background
Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Background: The project was designed to respond to the rapidly deteriorating water and sanitation services in
Uzbekistan, particularly in Samarkand and Bukhara. The downward spiral of decreasing reliability and safety
of drinking water was due to identified sector constraints such as:

(i) Inefficient operations: Water systems were poorly operated and maintained resulting in poor performance
of output and efficiency, mostly related to energy efficiency due to improper design of pumping stations, use
of old equipment and low level of automation led to high levels of energy consumption, and excessive water
system leakages. Compounded by rising energy prices, energy costs in 2000 were as high as 66% of
operational and maintenance expense in Samarkand and 42% in Bukhara. The total production of water was
about 700 lpcd in Samarkand and 750 Ipcd in Bukhara, much higher than Western Europe, resulted in higher
operating costs much over the international average, and due to lack of water conversation practices, wastage
of water was rampant.

(ii) Poor service levels: The water network experienced excessive water losses which resulted in poor service
delivery to consumers, 39% for Bukhara and 48% for Samarkand.14 Moreover, in Samarkand, 30% of the
network received supply for just two periods of two hours every day, and the rest of the network suffered
from very low pressure; whereas, in Bukhara, the quality of potable water was deficient carrying very high
content of solids.

(iii) Poor state of repair of facilities: More than 80% of the urban household in Samarkand and Bukhara
were connected to piped water supply. However, amidst deteriorating capital infrastructure mainly due to
lack of appropriate maintenance, poor planning, use of low quality materials and equipment, poor
construction quality, and shortages of resources.

(iv) Unviable financial shortfalls: The utilities in Uzbekistan operated under reduced government transfer15
aimed at increasing self-reliance of local utilities, very low tariffs authorized by the local Governments,16
high cross-subsidies,17 and poor collections. Not only revenues were insufficient to cover basic operational
costs (much less maintenance costs), BVK and SVK were only able to receive about 18% and 27% of their
billings in cash,18 leading to a total collection level of 56% and 79% of billing respectively. The utilities
continued their operations by cutting maintenance expenses and not paying vodokanal staff and their
suppliers, most notably electricity providers.

(v) Weak human resource and institutional capacity: There was a dire need for updating and improving
skills in modem utility management systems (including management and operations of water supply


14
   Moreover, losses in Bukhara and Samarkand were 5.6 and 17.6 m3/km of main/day/meter of pressure, compared to
0.25 for systems in Westem Europe. In addition, losses inside apartment blocks were equally high. Measured
consumption by apartment dwellers was about 112 liters per capita per day (lpcd), but leakage in apartment blocks was
as high as an additional 100 lpcd.
15
   Due to fiscal constraints and decentralization policies in Uzbekistan.
16
   The household water tariff in Samarkand in 1999 was about US$0.014/m3 and in Bukhara US$0.005/m3.
17
   In Bukhara and Samarkand the level of tariffs for nondomestic consumers is about 8 to 10 times higher than for
domestic consumers
18
   The rest was either paid through a cumbersome system of invoice clearing and compensation with other utilities and
customers' own invoices and payments, or simply not recovered at all. In both cities the utilities' accounts receivable
represent about seven months of billing leaving them in a financially untenable situation.
                                                          66
systems), planning strategies, financial and commercial management, and investment planning. Moreover,
the capacity of Municipalities and antimonopoly commissions, that monitored and regulated the Vodokanals,
also needed substantial strengthening.

(vi) Lack of adequate information: The data collected on accounting, financial 19 and operations and
management systems were inadequate, not easily available to utility management, and not providing a clear
picture of the problems faced by the utilities; resulted in inefficiencies in operations and planning and
development of the systems.

(vii) Water resources scarcity: The problem of water resources was compounded by poor management of
regional water systems, poor allocation of water, pollution caused by agriculture and industry in some areas,
and wastage in the drinking water systems, both from leakage and lack of water conservation practices. In
addition, operational costs of some of the utilities, such as BVK, were increased by their dependence on
remote water sources transported through channels or large mains over hundreds of kilometers.

Original Components (as approved)

The project objectives, under the SIL, were achieved through four main components: (a) investment fund, (b)
service contract, (c) consulting services and project coordination, and (d) Swiss financed component.

Project Component 1: Investment Fund (estimated cost: US$46.88 million; actual cost US$49.19 million).20
This component financed essential short-term expenditures (such as materials, equipment, vehicles) and a
least-cost capital investment program (including associated engineering and construction supervision
services) aimed at improving the operations of the water supply system and the services to the population by
achieving the performance improvement targets in the service contract. The Operator, together with BVK
and SVK staff, proposed the investments required to optimally re-structure and rehabilitate key components
of the systems (such as sections of the water distribution networks and block distribution systems, specific
components of the treatment plants, pumping stations), implemented a demand management program,
financial management, accounting and commercial systems.

More specifically the Operator's annual plan for the use of IF fund generally complied with the following
categories of expenditures for goods and works:

(a) rehabilitation of water distribution systems. Includes piping and other items generally identified with a
water distribution systems, including water pipes, valves, fittings, service connection assemblies, air release
valves, blow off assemblies, taps, plumbing fittings, water meters, tools and equipment to rehabilitate the
piping network, and leak detection equipment and surveys;

(b) water production, treatment and pumping equipment and structural rehabilitation of facilities. Includes
various items of equipment generally identified with collecting, treating and distributing water from the
source to the consumers. This includes but is not limited to pumping equipment, spare parts, mechanical and
electrical parts, controls and control systems, wells and parts of well systems, wellhead protection works,
chlorination equipment, and structural rehabilitation relating to the operating equipment or related facilities.;

(c) bulk and retail water metering equipment. Includes the purchase and installation bulk meters and water
pressure gauges at outlets of production sites and distribution reservoirs, and water level measuring devices.
New or repaired retail water meters at domestic service connections (apartment buildings or blocks rather
than individual units);



19
     Financial reports severely overstated the financial performance of Vodokanals.
20
     Estimated cost included Bukhara IF for US$ 21.30 million and Samarkand IF for US$25.58 million.
                                                          67
(d) water supply technical and administrative support systems. Includes technical and administrative
equipment necessary to support the operations of the water supply system, including maintenance and
construction equipment, computer hardware and software, copy machines, office furniture, communications
equipment, other administrative equipment and structural rehabilitation required for the efficient
administration of the water supply system;

(e) operations consumables and administrative operations. Includes items used in the course of effective
operation, maintenance, and administration of the water supply system, such as treatment chemicals,
consumables for pumping and treatment equipment, maintenance supplies, and temporary labor for
emergencies and bonuses; and

(f) engineering and supervision services. Includes engineering design, construction supervision, technical and
related assessments to implement the rehabilitation activities under the Investment Fund.

This component constituted around 76% of the total project financing at appraisal.

Project Component 2: Service Contract (estimated cost: US$5.20 million; actual cost US$ 2.14 million).
This component financed the costs related to the service contract. These costs included a base fee and a
performance-based fee to be paid to the private Operator based on achievement of targets defined in the
contract, which included: (a) salaries and expenses for the Operator's core group of management staff with
international experience in the water supply sector who will implement the service contract;21 and (b) funds
for a performance-dependent bonus paid to the Operator for achievements of specific targets defined in the
service contract. 22 The Operator was given the full responsibility for managing the investment program,
operating the water supply system, and developing and implementing the demand management program and
the commercial (billing and collection) and financial management departments.

This component constituted around 8% of the total project financing at appraisal.

Project Component 3: Consulting Services and Project Coordination Unit (estimated cost: US$1.05 million;
actual cost US$5.64 million). This component financed: (a) maintenance of the PCU (including staff salaries,
incremental operating expenditures, travel, training, and related expenses) with skilled staff to facilitate
project implementation, coordinated project activities between the Operator, the Municipalities of Samarkand
and Bukhara cities and other Government agencies, in addition to supervising the Operator's performance;
(b) carried out related consulting assignments and studies of technical, legal, and financial nature during
project implementation.

This component constituted around 2% of the total project financing at appraisal.

Project Component 4: Swiss-financed component (estimated cost: US$9 million; revised cost: US$11.23;
actual cost US$10 million). The Government of Switzerland provided a US$9 million grant for parallel
financing to the World Bank-financed project. This grant provided supplemental resources for two activities.
First, it financed an investment fund (goods and services of Swiss origin) with usage to be determined in
parallel to those of the IF under Project Component 1. It also financed independent technical and financial


21
   Staff provided by the Operator included expertise in: (a) general management of water supply utilities; (b) financial
accounting and management, cost accounting and budgeting; (c) water supply, mechanical, electrical, and
environmental engineering; (d) computer systems administration and database management; (e) customer management,
public information and community relations; (f) maintenance, repair, material and inventory management; and (g)
human resources development and training.
22
   This bonus provided the incentives necessary to ensure measurable improvements in reduction of water losses,
increase of collection, and increase in water safety among other factors specifically defined in the contract. The actual
amount of the incentive fee to be paid to the Operator will be determined by the application of a performance factor to
the maximum annual incentive fee.
                                                          68
auditors that monitored the Operator's performance in relation to the service contract obligations and
achievements of performance improvement targets, and prepared the financial project and water utility
audits, as well as complementary consulting services to support the PCU.

This component constituted around 14% of the total project financing at appraisal.

Project Costs: At appraisal, the total project costs were US$62.33 million, of which US$ 13.33 million was
to be financed through the GoU (see Annex 1, for details) and US$9 million was financed through the Swiss
Grant.23 The front-end fee was financed from the proceeds of the IBRD Loan and the denomination of the
World Bank IDA Credit was in SDR, equivalent to US$20 million, subject to parity adjustment during the
project implementation term.




23
     The Borrower's share consisted of Government (US$8 million), SVK and BVK (US$5.33 million) contribution.
