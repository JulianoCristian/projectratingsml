MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVEIOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXE          PEC'ORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUB1IC OF CHINA
FOR AN ECONOMIC LAW REFORM PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendaton on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republit of China for SDR 6.9 million, ±Ue equivalent of US$10
million, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years, to help finamce aa Economic Law Reform
Project.
2.         Background. As China makes its transition to a market economy, fundament  and
corresponding changes in its legal system are also taking place. Central to a market systm is reliance
on a fair, knowable and credible legal framework that provides the 'nles of the game". Legal norms
and procedures are needed to substitute for governmental control of economic decisions and to demarcate
government's reguatory role in many areas of economic activity. In China, priority areas include:
organization of econeomc entities (company laws and revision of state, collective and private enterprise
legilation); creation of a competiive, frely-opeating market (bankruptcy law, competition and
consumer protection legislation; revision of contract laws and improvement of commercial laws; laws and
regulations governing securities regulation, issuance and trading); separtng employee befit systems
from the obligaton of enerpri  (housing and real estate laws and introduction of social welare
legislation); and s the dispute reseoluton mechans (courts, arbitration and mediation
processes) to make the legal framework reliable and enforceable.
3.         Over the past decade, China has put into place many elements of the legal framework for
economic reform, and the process has accelerated in recent years as the tempo of economic reform has
quickened. Hr lever, the enonnity of the task that remains has heightened the need to set priorties in
the legislative agenda - almost as many laws are scheduled for consideration in the 1993-98 five-year
session of the National Peoples Congress (NPC) (152) as were enacted between 1949 and 1992. The
initiation and stregthening of laws in all these areas would be facilitated - and the resulting legislation
improved - by giving China's legal reformers access to the experience of other countries, developed and
developing, those with civil law systems and common law systms, and other socialist economies in
transition.
4.         Moreover, to implement the new legal frmework requires more and better-trained lawyers,
judges, law professors, government legal officials and public prosecutors. Legal education was revived
only in 1978 after more than a decade; today, there are numerous full-time law faculties and countless
ether institutions providing legal education and trawiing. Still, of China's 70,000 lawyers, many do not
have formal legal training. Further, lawyers and judicial personnel alike need traing in the new laws
and procedures of the market economy. This, in turn, calls for stengthening legal education and
training, developing new curricula and new methodologies of teaching them, and promoting (and
ruating) the development of the legal profession.



-2-
5.         The changes under way in the legal sector. call for the development of new taining
mechanims. For example, where lawyers were once exclusively. state fimctionaries, there are now
rapidly increasing numbers of non-state law firms seving the legal.needs of Chinew and foreign
businesses and individuals. These lawyers need i-servico, focused training in new laws, in specalized
areas and inmanagin legal practie, a need that establibhed formal -degee programs are not likely to
meet. Judges faced with complex fiacial cases and armed wit little economics, finance or financal
law traning need short-term ontent-focussed courses, not reseach in juripudence. Law pr
teaching graduates destined for a hfe of client representation, rather than teaching or b, need
teaching materials and method that will teach advocacy skills and sharpen analytical capabilities. - And
legal ethics must be developed and taught to all of these legal professionals.
6.         Reltiively few donor agencies are providing China with tchni assistance in helegal
field, especiaLly in comparison with transition economies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
or Viet Nam. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is fundig a $2.1 milion project
in Legislative Drafting to Suort Economic Reform, a five year project that began in 1992. This project
is impemented by the State Council's Bureau of Legislative Affairs (BLA), and includes training in
legislaive drafting as well as provision of expertise in the preparation of 22 specffied laws. The activities
for the remining years of the project have already been defined; however, requests for future UNDP
funding in this area are under discussion and would be coordinated with any assistance provided under
the proposed Project. In addition, the Ford Foundation is assisting in specific areas (administative law,
training of judges, human rights issues); the Asia Foundation has provided assistance in training judgea
ad in environmental law training; and the Asian Development Bank is providing for technical assistance
in emvironmental law to the NPC, among other activities. Small amounts of assistance are being made
available by a few bilateral donors. There remains, however, an unfilled need for comprehensive,
sustained technical assistance in preparation of legislation and strengthening human resources to prepare
and implement it.
7.         Objectives. The Project would assist China n improving the legal fimework to support
economic reform by: (a) strengthening the preparation of economic legislation in priority areas; (b)
enhancin training methods, curricula and opportunities for law teachers, legal practitioners and legal,
judicial and other government pe.sonnel in the theory and practice of the new legal framework; and (c)
strengthening the key legal institutions responsible for legislation and the implementation of economic
laws.
8.         Descrmtion. The Project would consist of three parts: sub-projects to support preaation
of legislation; sub-projects to support legal training; and institutional support. A detailed description of
the Project and implemeation a gements is presented in the Technical Annex and summarized below.
(a)   Sub-projects under the legislative conmonent (about $5.5 million) would support the preparation
of laws (and their supplementary regulations and implemeng rues) included in the NPC five
year (1993-98) legislative agenda, which would assist in the development of a market economy
(about 54 laws are considered in this category). Each legislative sub-project would consist of a
package of assistance, designed to provide comparative legal experiences and advice on legislative
drafting in a specific field of law. Each package would include as necessary: acquisition and



-3 -
translation of materials (pardicarly foreign laws and regulations); employment of international and
local legal experts to advse on drfti  outine and detailed provisions; seminars to discuss initiWl
directions and subsequent drafts; and short, focussed study tours by drafting group members to
investigate specifi ssues arisig i the draftg proess.
(b) -Sub-projects under the ttaii  cmnenl (about $6.5 million) would provide support for key
activities which would either: (i) have a broad impact on legal and other professionals teaching,
.traiing or implementing economic laws; or (ii) where the impact is more limited, demonstate
unovativo approaches to meeting -the chngn needs of the legal profession and legal system in
the market economy. Particular focus would be given to the developmen of new forms of
tachn materials and training methods and to the development of legal information systems;
Sub-projects would be expected to assist short-term needs in practical training of legal peronnel
as well as long-term strengthning of the legal training s,,--.i, -uch as through curriculum
developmen. Training sub-projects would be exwy'4ted to addres4 TmLily in-country training
and would not be limited to training at the natio-;- zvel in 3tijipn.
(c)  The institutional support conmonent (about $1.3 million) wouid provide targeted assistce to key
legal imstitutions whose fumctions will expand and grow in importance in a market economy. The
NPC's Commission on Legislative Affairs (CLA), which reviews and revises all drafts submitted
to the NPC and is also responsible for the drafting of selected laws, would modernize its document
processing and circulation with new office equipment and technology and would upgrade its
databases of foreign laws, for reference purposes. The State Council's Bureau of Legislative
Affairs (BLA) would upgrade and eend its database of Chinese laws, State Council regulaons,
ministerial circulars and provincial legislation and regulations and funds would be provided for
various government agencies to be joined in a legal information network. Assistance to the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in re-designing the lawyers examiation system and continuing legal
education will also be provided.
9.         The total project cost is esmimated at $13.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of $10 million equivalent (75 percent of total costs). Tbe Association would finance $10
million equivalent, representing all of the foreign ex ge component. To facilitate drfting of laws
scheduled for consideration by end-1994 and early 1995, retroactive financing of up to SDR 200,000 is
proposed for expenditures made after June 27, 1994. A breakdown of project costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement methods, disbursement amounts, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
10.       Project Dm90lentation. The World Bank Department of the Ministry of Finance (MOP)
would be the overall Project Coordinaing Agency, responsible for the day-to-day project coordinating
work. Sub-projects would be prepared and impl_emed by agencies (for the legislative and institutonal
support components) and by traiinstitutions (for the tainng component). MOF would be assisted
in the substantive legal aspects of this work by a local legal consultant. For legislative sub-projects, a
Legislative Advisory Group would be constituted of senior representatives of the CIA, the NPC
Economic and Finance Committee, the BLA and the State Commission for the Reruring of the
Economic System (SCRES). MOF would convene meetings of the Legislative Advisory Group as need-



-4-
ed, but at least semi-annually. For training sub-projects, MOP would maitain a roser, agreed with
IDA, of experts in legal education and training (includig foreign expertise as needed), and would consult
with at least three eWerts in the review of each sub-project. To ensure effective implemen n, annial
work programs would be agreed in advance and a midterm review would be scheduled for end-1996.
11.    -Poject Sustainaility. The institutional support ompon will strengthen two key drafting
agencies, the CLA and BLA, both of which play an inmportant role in ensuring the consistency of
proposed legislation with exist  legislation and in enhncing the echnical drafting of the legislation.
To the extwt that legislation finally enacted reflects the comparave inputs provided under the Project,
a legal firamework better suited to the experience of market economies should result. More importantly,
the suppont for iMnvatiVe trainig mechaism would help cre  additional opportunities for tring of
the legal professionals implemet  that legal framework.
12.        Lessons Learned from Previous BanklIDA Involvement. While the-Bank Group has no
previous operations in the legal field in China, there have been six technical assistmce projects: two
Tecnical Cooperation Projects (Cr. 1412-CHA, Cr. 1664-CHA), a Plaming Support and Special Studies
Project (Cr. 1835-CHA), a Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestmnent Project (Cr. 2447-CHA),
a Financial Sector Technical Assstance Project (Cr.2423 CGA) and an Env_Inmental Technical
Assistance Project (Cr. 2522 - CHA). Among the lessons learned about Bank Group techical assistance
in China are: the need for the pre-identification of sufficient project activities to provide for a good start
on implementtion; he need to avoid excessive fiancing of buildings, hardware or unfocussed overseas
training; and the need to reach agreement on internal on-lending arrangements wel before imple on
begins. In the legal field, lessons leamed in Bank Group legal technical assistance activities elsewhere
suggest tailoring project scope to avoid overmbitious and unatainable goals, paying careful attention to
the country's own legal reform agenda, institutonal structre and capacity as well as to what is relevant
and attainable in the country context of law reform.
13.        Rioale for IDA          .   The prposed prqject complies with the Bank's Country
Assitance Strat .r China, as presented to the Board on August 3, 1993. Legal reform is an integral
part of the strategy, as a program of comprehnsve legal techical assistce to support market refom
would stengten the framework for other reform elements in the strategy, including enterprise reform,
markeiaor and private sector developmenm. Indeed, a potntia economic law reform project is
specifically identified in the strategy.
14.        Legal reform would serve to enhance the stability, predictability and transparency of
economic transactions. As legal reform is essential for the success of the economic reforms and the
development of the market economy, addressing China's current needs for legal reform would add a vital
component to Bank Group assistance to China in promoting economic reform and the development of a
maket economy. Until now, legal tecnical assistance has followed a piecemeal approach, as Bank
Group lending operations in China and economic and sector work have increasingly included support for
legal reforms in project-specific or topic-specific areas. Now the breadth of reforms, and the connectivity
of the laws and regulations required, argue for a comprehensive package of assistance for China in its
economic law reform process rather than a law-by-law approach. Moreover, strngthening the central
law-making bodies (NPC, State Council) to enhance consistency of laws is of special importance in the
Chinese system, a result which separate, sectoral projects could not achieve. The Bank Group has



developed experience in recent years m a wide range of member coun    in supportig smilar endeavors
in- legal reforms, espeially in transition economies.; TMs experince would be brought to assist Cha
in estblishing priorties in economic law reform and in implementig the proposed Project. The Bank
Group's overal support for, and familiatity with, China's economic rform program would help maiain
a strong connetion- between economic remm and legl reform activities.
15.     -          ActAg ions. The following are the main   nces obned atneotiations: (a) sub.
projects would be selected by agreement between the Borrower and IDA to meet eligibility criera; (b)
annual work plans for the Project for each calendar year would be furnished to IDA for review and
approval by October 31 of the preceding year, (c) MOP would convene a; least semi-annual meetings of
the Legislative Advisory Group to provide guidance on priorities and progress in the Borrower's
legislative affairs; (d) training sub-projects would be reviewed by at least three experts from a rostr
agreed between the Borrower and IDA; (e) Credit fumds would be made available to impleming entities
and agencies on terms and conditions satisfactoy to IDA, including the provision of funds on a grant
basis to iiqplementing entities and agencies funded frm the Govement budget; and (f) MOP would
undertake with IDA a mid-term review of the progress of and prospects for implementation by Decmber
31, 1996.
16.        Envirornmental Aspects. The Project is expaeted to nave no direct effect on the environment
(Category C).
17.        Program Obiective Categories. The economic legislation prepared with the technical
assistance provided under the Project would promote private sector developmest, as would the trinig
for lawyers under the Project.
18.        Participatory Approach. The training sub-projects are expected to incluke a mmlber of non-
governmental and quasi-governmental traming entities, which would broaden the opporties for legal
taining beyond the official sector. The legislative drfting process also provides opportuaites for
academicians and other non-government expers to offer their views, such as in symposia planned under
legislative sub-projects.
19.        Proiect Benefits. The Project would provide Chinese law-makers with a readily-available
source of funding for specilized expertise and advice in the diverse areas of law necessary for economc
law reform. It would also provide training opportunities for legal personnel that would not only benefit
the individuals trained but would be designed in a way that could be replicated for others. The Project
would have the added benefit of strengthening the mechanism for legal reforms that are essential to the
design and implemenation of Bank Group projects which themelves support selected economic reforms.
Long-term benefits would include a better legal basis for the market economy and a better-trained cadre
of personnel able to make it finction.
20.        Risks. In view of the complexity of responsibilities for law reform, there is a risk that some
of the specializded advice and training provided under the Project may not extend beyond the immdia
beneficiaries, or that some of the legislation prepared with assistance under the Project might not be
enacted or, if enacted, may not be applied. The first risk has been addessed to the extent possible in
Project design, the second risk is inherent in legal technical assistance of this type. Moreover, the Project
would be subject to the same set of risks of delayed or slow implemettion as other "umbreila" technical
assistance projects in China and elsewhere. However, the advanced preparatiou and prior agreemnt on
a number of sub-projects minimis the poten   risk of a delay in the iniial implementation of the
Project.

the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
