existing\n            aging oil palm plantings and development of new plantings in\n            selected areas; (ii) further diversify and strengthen the\n            Ivory Coast agricultural sector through investment in a crop\n            with substantial comparative advantages and good long-term\n            growth prospects; (iii) assist in maintenance of a tree\n            cover in an area where the forest cover is being depleted\n            rapidly. The project will consist of the following\n            components: (a) establishment of 11,600 ha of new\n            PALMINDUSTRIE industrial oil palm plantations and replanting\n            of about 15,000 ha of aging plantations; (b) development of\n            smallholder oil palm plantings through expansion and\n            replanting of existing areas by about 29,100 ha and new\n            planting of 6,900 ha; (c) establishment of a pilot scheme of\n            2,100 ha medium-sized private oil palm plantations; (d)\n            construction of two oil mills for PALMINDUSTRIE with\n            eventual capacities each of 40 tons FFB/hour; (e) a study of\n            effluent treatment systems and installation of an effluent\n            treatment prototype system at an existing PALMINDUSTRIE oil\n            mill and an effluent prototype digestor at Ehania; (f)\n            support of accompanying research; (g) technical assistance\n            to PALMINDUSTRIE."}, "docdt": "1985-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
