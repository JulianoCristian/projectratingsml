Development Project\n            will (i) help the Ivory Coast meet an increasing demand for\n            fats and edible oils through both replacement of existing\n            aging oil palm plantings and development of new plantings in\n            selected areas; (ii) further diversify and strengthen the\n            Ivory Coast agricultural sector through investment in a crop\n            with substantial comparative advantages and good long-term\n            growth prospects; (iii) assist in maintenance of a tree\n            cover in an area where the forest cover is being depleted\n            rapidly. The project will consist of the following\n            components: (a) establishment of 11,600 ha of new\n            PALMINDUSTRIE industrial oil palm plantations and replanting\n            of about 15,000 ha of aging plantations; (b) development of\n            smallholder oil palm plantings through expansion and\n            replanting of existing areas by about 29,100 ha and new\n            planting of 6,900 ha; (c) establishment of a pilot scheme of\n            2,100 ha medium-sized private oil palm plantations; (d)\n            construction of two oil mills for PALMINDUSTRIE with\n            eventual capacities each of 40 tons FFB/hour; (e) a study of\n            effluent treatment systems and installation of an effluent\n            treatment prototype system at an existing PALMINDUSTRIE oil\n            mill and an effluent prototype digestor at Ehania; (f)\n            support of accompanying research; (g) technical assistance\n            to PALMINDUSTRIE."}, "docdt": "1985-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
