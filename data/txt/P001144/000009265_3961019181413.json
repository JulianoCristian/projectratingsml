Oil Palm\n            Development Project for Cote d'Ivoire was\n            unsatisfactory. The project failed to achieve its\n            objectives, institutional development was negligible,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, support prices for producers during an\n            extended period of low market external prices for a\n            commodity, coupled with an over-valued currency, are\n            non-sustainable, even by the healthiest of economies and can\n            have devastating consequences for agencies responsible for\n            bearing the cost of such support. Second, the sustainability\n            of a government commercial organization is closely linked to\n            a favorable economic framework, appropriate pricing\n            policies, and the availability of strong managerial and\n            financial skills related to the size of its operations.\n            Third, technical assistance personnel in charge of\n            implementing project activities are seldom able to devote\n            time to building local capacity or be advocates of major\n            restructuring of the operation they manage. Finally, if no\n            clear distinction is made between the social and\n            profit-oriented operations through government budgets,\n            supporting social activities from profits can soon become untenable."}, "docdt": "1996-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
