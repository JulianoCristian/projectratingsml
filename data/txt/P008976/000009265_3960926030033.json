Training\n            Project supports the Government's efforts to increase\n            and improve the supply of well-trained labor for\n            manufacturing industries and to improve employment\n            opportunities (including self-employment) for people with\n            limited education and training.  The project will expand the\n            number of training places in various institutions such as\n            the Apprenticeship Training Centers and the Public Training\n            Centers and will improve the quality of Non-Formal\n            Vocational Training (NFVT) programs and enhance their\n            relevance to labor market needs through technical assistance\n            and training in a number of critical areas.  These areas\n            include instructor training, training needs assessment,\n            curriculum design, instructional materials development,\n            skill testing and certification, and entrepreneurship\n            courses.  The project further includes the establishment of\n            production revolving funds to enable the training\n            institutions to generate additional revenues through the\n            production of items for sale.  The project will make a\n            valuable contribution towards meeting critical manpower\n            shortages which constrain economic growth in manufacturing\n            industries and will also significantly increase basic skill\n            training to improve employment opportunities for\n            disadvantaged groups."}, "docdt": "1986-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
