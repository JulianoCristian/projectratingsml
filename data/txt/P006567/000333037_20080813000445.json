     for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was low, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: among the\n            main lessons reinforced from this operation is that while\n            land regularization does not resolve multiple threats and\n            challenges for indigenous people in Latin America, security\n            of land tenure is a necessary precondition if indigenous\n            people are to make their own decisions about their\n            lifestyles and possible future changes based on their\n            ability to maintain their culture via traditional\n            livelihoods and cultures. A second lesson learned is that\n            when working with diverse indigenous groups, it is critical\n            to work with and strengthen indigenous organizations,\n            respecting the culturally defined decision making mechanism\n            of each ethnic group. This helps ensure active participation\n            of organizations and communities in project implementation.\n            When working with indigenous people, project personnel need\n            to respect the processes of indigenous development, adapting\n            the project to the needs and concerns that arise from\n            communities themselves without imposing pre-established\n            packages, timing or modalities of work that are foreign to\n            the communities. A final lesson deals with future\n            operations, especially once basic land tenure issues have\n            been resolved. The next challenge in Brazil and many Latin\n            America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries involves ethno\n            development, the basic elements for which include: (i)\n            adequate protection of indigenous lands and resources; (ii)\n            sufficient and culturally appropriate basic services such as\n            health and education without creating dependencies; (iii)\n            support for indigenous organizational strengthening\n            vis-\u00e0-vis the national society; (iv) continued sustainable\n            management of natural resources in light of acculturation,\n            new needs and adoption of new technologies and possible\n            relationships to the cash economy; and (v) facilitation of\n            culturally appropriate models of development to help ensure\n            indigenous people make free informed choices about their futures."}, "docdt": "2007-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
