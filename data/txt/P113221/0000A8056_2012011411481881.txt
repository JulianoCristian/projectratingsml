                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A full supervision mission was carried out from October 24 to November 4, 2011. This ISR is being updated following the completion of the mission.

                         Project implementation continues at a slow but steady pace. Rising insecurity in the Central and South-central Zones will likely prevent CRS, the field implementing entity (FIE) that is
                         operating in those zones, from fully completing all planned activities before the grant closing date of February 17, 2012. Should this happen, performance indicators would be only
                         modestly affected.

                         Overall project ratings are being maintained at their previous levels, execpt for the PDO. CRS and COOPI have made good progress in implementing Component 2, but CTP-PAS
                         (now known as CS-REF) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) have remained slow in implementing Component 3. Of particular concern is their failure to
                         strengthen the project M&E function, despite continued intensive implementation support provided by the World Bank team.

                         The task team discussed with the government the time line for the preparation of the government's Implementation Completion Report (ICR) and reviewed the plan for the preparation
                         of the World Bank ICR. The team also explored with the government alternative strategies that could be pursued by the government to ensure that the project-supported activities can
                         be sustained following the closing of the project.
