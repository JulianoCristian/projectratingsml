                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is being updated following an interim supervision mission carried out in November 2010 and follow-up meetings held on January 20, 2011.
                         Since the MTR was carried out in July 2010, the implementation has continued at a slow by steady rate. The Field Implementation Entities (FIEs) have made visible progress in
                         executing Component 2 activities, especially in providing support to producers during the 2010 agricultural campaign and building capacity to carry out post-harvest activities.
                         Activities related to increasing livestock and horticulture production in the target areas have been initiated. Contracts have been awarded for three of the five studies to be financed
                         under Component 3. TORs for one of the two remaining studies have been approved, and those of the final study are under preparation.
