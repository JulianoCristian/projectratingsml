The negative\n            effects on the human environment are: risks associated with\n            the use of pesticides by farmers themselves; conflicts\n            relating to law and land use (cohabitation between various\n            rights, claims in each village); potential conflicts between\n            agriculture and livestock and the development of waterborne\n            disease (an increased prevalence of malaria, increased cases\n            of dysentery, an increase of schistosomiasis, ...), the risk\n            of diversion objectives of the project (changes to other\n            beneficiaries than originally envisaged because of\n            difficulties in development); risks to health and safety in\n            pesticide management (contamination by livestock watering;\n            poisoning in cases of misuse; residues on products, poor\n            management of packaging, etc..), the depletion and\n            degradation of water sources; the conflicts over land use or\n            water and possible cumulative effects of a breakdown, the\n            inequitable access rights to land or water (particularly\n            women), difficulties regarding the integration of women in\n            agricultural activities. On the biophysical environment, the\n            major potential negative impacts include: loss of vegetation\n            and reduction of biodiversity in deforestation and clearing\n            of plots; degradation due to soil salinization, soil\n            acidification, the drop in fertility due to cultivation\n            practices, soil erosion, loss or reduction of land for\n            pasture degradation of water quality (pollution of streams\n            and lakes)."}, "docdt": "2009-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
