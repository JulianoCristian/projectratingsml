Some of the lessons learned include: (1) intense\n            implementation support for emergency operations prepared\n            under OP 8.0 will often be needed immediately following\n            effectiveness to rapidly close any readiness gaps and ensure\n            successful outcomes; (2) while OP 8.0 does provide increased\n            flexibility in preparing emergency operations, for small\n            operations of this nature, Bank procedures may still be too\n            onerous; (3) outsourcing implementation to non-governmental\n            partners can be an effective strategy in fragile states; (4)\n            weak institutional capacity within key ministries hinders\n            development impact from Bank investments, but cannot be\n            adequately addressed through emergency operations; (5) The\n            GFRP Trust Fund facilitated the Bank\u0092s reengagement in\n            agriculture in CAR; (6) non-traditional partners can\n            introduce new and innovative ways of doing things."}, "docdt": "2012-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
