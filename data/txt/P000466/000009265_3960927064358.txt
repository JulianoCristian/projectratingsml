MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TEE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
FOR AN E0'"OMVI MANAGEHEXT PROJECT
1.    The following report on a proposed development Credit to the Central
African Republic for SDR 10.3 million (US$ 13.2 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms
and would help finance an Economic Management Project (EMP). The Project
would be cofinanced by the United Nations Development Programne (UNDP) through
a grant of US$2.0 million to improve technical assistance (TA) coordination
and to support the program to strengthen CAR's economic planning capacity.
2.    Back8round.   To reverse the deteriorating trends in the CAR economy,
the Government launched the first phase of its structural adjustment program
in 1986 with IDA support through SAL I. The adjustment process has been
consolidated and deepened in the second phase supported by SAL II approved in
May 1988. Bank free-standing TA projects to CAR began in 1981 with a US$ 4.0
million emergency program to help the Government revitalize the economy after
a decade of disastrous mismanagement under the Emperor Bokassa and expand
absorptive capacity for external development financing. TA I helped prepare
road rehabilitation and cotton programs, finance studies and training, and
provided a legal adviser in tone State Secretariat for Planning (SEP) and a
debt expert in the debt management agency, CAADE. In 1985, a US$ 10.0 million
TA TT project was approved to help the Government design and implement a
national economic rehabilitation program and increase administrative capacity
in key economic sectors. The project financed experts in diamond evaluation,
forestry, public administration, debt and macroeconomic management, and
parapublic sector reform.   In 1986, project activities were geared to support
definition and implementation of the SAL I program. The results of this
assistance have been positives expertise provided under the project has helped
formulate sectoral, public administration, and macroeconomic adjustment
strategies and draft significant reforms in forestry and diamond legislation,
as well in the investment code. In 1987, additional expertise was provided to
help establish and implement a three-year rolling investment planning process,
advise the High Coomission for Public Enterprises (HCPE) on sector reform, and
support the Ministry of Comerce and Industry (MCI) and the ministry of
Finance (MFPCI) in promoting private sector activity. However, there was
inadequate coordination and management of TA II, while unclear institutional
roles and overlapping tasks weakened the effectiveness of the assistance
provided. While training was an important objective, it was given
insufficient priority during implementation, though lawyers trained by the
legal expert are now negotiating loans with external donors.
3.    Determined to overcome these problems, the Government has requested IDA
assistance to implement a far-reaching program of measures to strengthen the
core ministries responsible for economic management and policy formulation,
and is adopting a radical new strategy to make more effective use of TA. The
principal element of the strategy is establishment of a Division for Technical
Assistance Coordination (DTAC) wit) n the new organizational structure of SEP,
which will be responsible for colitation and centralization of data on TA in
the country, and for coordination of TA activities, with the assistance of a
TA information system to be developed. DTAC would be responsible for



-2-
elaborating a TA policy aimed at meeting the Government's objective of
substantially reducing the need for long-term TA over time, while
strengthening its management and coordination. The Government intends to
manage allocation and deployment of TA through this unit. Other elements of
the strategy are: (i) long-term and short-term TA would be provided in an
integrated framework for developing institutional capacities; (ii) concrete
programs for training and unit development would be defined and interaction
between TA and national staff would be clearly established; (iii) TA and
national inputs would be provided and evaluated on the basis of pragmatic,
monitored work plans. This will be applied in a first phase to the
macroeconomic management strengthening component of the proposed EMP, and
subsequently applied in other areas.
4.   Project ObJectives. The IW's principal objective is to strengthen the
core ministries responsible for managing the economy and for implementing the
ongoing structural adjustment program. Through an integrated package of
assistance and training, the EMP aims to put in place organizational
structures in which tasks and resource requirements are clearly specified,
methods and procedures for carrying out these tasks are developed, codified.
and applied, and in which functional linkages among and within these
institutions are delineated and understood. ,The project also aims to help the
Government begin to address the social dimensions of adjustment, through the
UNDP-supported strengthening of the social development planning unit in SIP,
to strengthen the coordination and management of TA more generally, and, in
collaboration with the principal other donors, redirect such assistance toward
training and capacity-building In beneficiary institutions.
S.   Project Description.  The DMP, to be carried out over three and one
half years, would provide funds for high-level expertise (long- and short-
term), vehicles, computer and office equipment and minor renovation, and
training. It comprises the following components:
I     Strengthening Macroeconomic Management (US$ 9.2 million).   The DIP
focuses on strengthening management systems, developing technical procedures,
installing information systems, and training key staff. The DP would: ti) in
SEP, strengthen macroeconomic planning capacity, and strengthen sectoral
analysis, investment project analysis, and programuiag; (1i) in Finance
(MFPCI), develop and install a comprehensive financial management and
accounting system, strengthen personnel management, computerize these syst ems ,
and train key staff; (iii) in the debt agency (CAADE), improve the debt
monitoring and accounting system; (iv) in Transport/Public Works (MTAC/MTPAT),
support the joint sectoral planning cell and strengthen personnel management
and training capacity; tv) in the Ministry of Energy and Mines ( IM), continue
support to strengthening export tax receipts and evaluation zapacity in the
diamond sector; and (vi) prepare a computerization master plan aimed at
setting policy and priorities for the evolution of national information
systems, while ensuring harmonization among computer system users where
compatibility is required.
II    Civil Service Reform CUS$ 1.2 million). The EMP would: (i) continue to
support the institutions established to implement the staff reduction program:
computer equipment and operating costs for the Personnel Bank (P3); and (ii)



-3-
support longer-term management and efficiency improvement in the civil service
by providing: (a) advisory services to strengthen institutional coordination
and to review the civil service code, the wage and salary system, and to
develop a personnel training policy; (b) assistance and training to establish
personnel administrative and financial management structures, procedures, and
data processing systems.
III   Parastatal Enterprise Reform (US$ 1.2 million).  The EMP would: (i)
support reform of the legal and administrative framework affecting public
enterprises (PEs) while strengthening the institutional capacity of the HCPE
to implement the adjustment program; (ii) prepare and implement rehabilitation
plans, investment programs and tariff policy for the utility companies and
other Pgs; (iii) provide legal and accounting assistance in support of
liquidation and privatization activities; and (iv) study and implement a
management and accountancy training program.
IV    Promotion of the Private Sector CUS$ 1.4 million).  The EMP would: (i)
provide advisory services, and orientation and training services, for the
Center for Redeployment into the Private Sector (CAREP); (ii) assist in
defining the institutional framework for promoting the private sector,
including simplification of the regulatory environment, revision of the
customs code, and strengthening of the statistical data base of the MCI; (iii)
implement studies related to SME promotion, the domestic trade regime and
financial sector constraints; (iv) establish a "one-stop investment office
for prospective foreign investors; and (v) develop local training capacity in
business skills.
V     Macroeconomic, Sector, and Preinvestment Studies (USS 2.0 million)  The
EMP would finance identification, preparation and execution of Macroeconomic,
sector, pre-feasibility, and detailed engineering studies. These studies
would seek to strengthen the project pipeline for the Public Investment
Program (PIP), to improve project appraisal capacity while applying sound
evaluation methodologies, strengthen the linkages between SEP and line
ministries in investment planning, and substantially increase the portfolio of
sound projects submitted for outside financing. The EMP also provides US$0.3
million to support the Project Management Unit (PMU) in SEP.
6.    Project Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project is estimated
at US$ 16.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$ 12.6
million (762). Project costs and financing arrangements are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in the Central African Republic are presented in Schedules C and D
respectively. Staff Appraisal Report 7463-CA is being distributed separately.
7.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Strengthening the core institutions
responsible for economic management and implementation of the adjustment
program is essential for lasting improvement in performance and for sustained
economic growth. The EMP would define and implement an integrated approach to
strengthening these institutions while supporting a Government strategy to
reduce long-term TA over time, while making more effective use of TA in
meeting capacity development objectives.   The Government's program would be



-4-
supported by IDA and other key donors as part of a global and coordinated
assistance strategy. IDA involvement would also help to bring out Important
linkages in complementary elements of the adjustment and reform programs.
8.   Agreed Actions.  The Government agreed during negotiations to the
following key actions: (a) submission to IDA of a revised civil service wage
and incentive scheme by September 30, 1989; (b) organization and staffing of
the Project Management Unit (PMU) and Steering Committee (SC); tc) submission
of annual work programs for IDA approval by October 31 of each year; td)
arrangements for donor coordination of assistance programs. Conditions of
effectiveness ares (a) signature of decrees for implementing staffing plans
for MFPCI, SEP, MCI and MCS; (b) establishment and adequate staffing of the
PMU; (c) availability of UNDP cofinancing; (d) constitution of the Project
SC; (e) opening of a Project Account and initial Government deposit.
9.    Benefits and Risks.  The principal benefit of the EMP is that it would
lay the foundation for development of sustainable and efficient institutions
in charge of economic policy formulation and management. The EMP would help
the Government to implement a TA strategy aimed at substantially reducing the
volume of long-term TA over time, while improving TA coordination and
management. The EMP would define and implement an integrated approach to
strengthening the core ministries, through clearly defined tasks and end-
products and through operationally focussed training. This is expected to
contribute to improving delivery and effectiveness of TA generally, and
provide a basis for better integrating project actions into a framework
conducive to bringing about real and lasting improvements in institutional
performance. The EMP faces three important riskst ti) the relative weakness
of CAR's administrative structure; Cii) the low motivation and high degree of
mobility of civil service staff; and (iii) management and coordination
problems that have beset past TA programs. These risks are being addressed in
project design through (a) careful definition of tasks and outputs
incorporated into pragmatic monitorable work programs; (b) designation of
national teams to work with TA experts; and (c) establishment of DTAC and a
substantial strengthening of project management capacity.
10.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
