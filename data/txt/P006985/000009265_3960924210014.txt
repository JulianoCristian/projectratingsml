(LOAN 1655-DO)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the NHsao Irrigation
Project in the- Dominican Republic, for which Loan 1655-DO In the amount of
US$27.0 million was signed on February 16, 1979. The original Closing Date
was December 31, 1984, but was extended once to December 31, 1987,
following a re-appratial in Noy 1983 which set a new Closing Date for
December 31, 1986. Final disbursements were made on June 30, 1988, when
the Loan was fully disbursed.
This PCR was written by Bank staff on the basis of a report
prepared by the National Institute  of Hydraulic Resturces of the Dominican
Republic and supplemented by Information contained in the project files; no
project completion mission was undertaken.
The PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but
the project was not audited by OED  staff.    The draft PCR was sent to the
Borrower and Its agencies for co=ments in February 1989g no comments were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
NIZAO IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1655-DO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       This project was identified in  1970  by the National Institute of
Hydraulic Resources (INDRHI)  of  the  Daw'_ can  Republic.    After a pre-
feasibility study by a consulting firm in 1974 and a second study the
following year (both of them judged inadequate), a final study prepared in
1975 by a team led by INDRHI and staffed by representatives of four other
relevant national agencies served as the basis for project preparation
which was undertaken jointly by Bank and FAOtCP staff in late 1977/early
1978. Project appraisal took place in April/May 1978, and the Loan was
presented to the  Board  in  January  1979.   Project implementation lasted
eight years instead of five, during which it became necessary to re-
appraise the project (in May 1983).   After a one-year extension of the new
Closing Date to December 31, 1987, the loan of US$27 million was fully
disbursed and the account closed on June 30, 1988.
Proiect Obiectives and Content
2.       The purpose of  the  projectl/ was  to rehabilitate an irrigation
system of about 14,000 ha, improve water supply to about 4,000 ha and
extend irrigation to another 2,000 ha. In addition, a strengthening of the
extension  services was  to   lead   to   improved water  management  and
agricultural practices.
Project components included (i) concrete-lining of the two main
canals (about 126 km in length) And of about 67 km of laterals and
improvement of existing structures (flumes, drains and other control and
diversion structures); (ii) on-farm development on the more than 2,000 ha
to be added to the irrigated area; (iii) about 25 km of secondary roads;
(iv) project faci'Aties; (v) equipment for force account construction; (vi)
incremental local staff and  other  recurrent inputs; and (viii) specialist
services.
Total project costs were estimated at US$50.6 million of which
US$27.0 million (53X) were to be financed by the Bank Loan and the
remainder by the Government.   Project  implementation was expected to last
about five years.

3.       Project effectiveness was delayed  by  almost  one year.  From the
start, project implementation was hampered by a lack of counterpart funds
which in May 1983 led to a re-appraisal of the project. The project's
szope (in terms of total cost and numbers of beneficiaries) was reduced by
about one quarter. Since the Loan amount remained unchanged, the Bank's
share in project financing Increased to 71Z.
Even after this restructuring of the project, however, delays
continued, mainly because of a persistent shortage of counterpart funds.
At the Closing Date (December 31, 1987), 852 of the civil works had been
completed.
At project completion total project costs were estimated at
US$39.8 million, about 52 above the reappraisal estimate.
Several covenants in the Loan Agreement were not, or not fully,
coi.plied with. In most cases, these shortfalls came about because the
Gover.nent did not have sufficient funds to cover associated expenses. In
one case, the failure to implement a covenant is bound to have 4vr.ous
repercussions for the operation and maintenance of the system and (paz-_-al)
investment cost recovery: by 1987 no adequate raise in user charges to
offset the effects of inflation had taken place yet (PCR, para. 3.20).
During most of the project implementation period, the performance
of INDRHI, the implementing agency, was less than satisfactory. In large
part, this was due to the agency's underfunding and understaffing; frequent
management changes, lack of organizational and financial autonomy and weak
links with other agencies  in  the  project area were additional handicaps.
Since 1986, however, an improvement is taking place, and the project
appears to enjoy greater political support (PCR, para. 4.01).
The Bank generally was very supportive, as evidenced by its
willingness to reappraise the project and to increase the disbursement
percentage to compensate for the deArth of counterpart funds (PCR, para.
5.01).
Results
At appraisal it was expected that the project would lead to a more
intensive cropping pattern and to increased productivity. These hopes did
not fully materialize.  While there were shifts towards higher value crops,
these were a response to changes in the price structure of agricultural
products rather  than  induced  by  the  project.    The  fallow area still
accounts for 15% to 302 of the total area, cropping intensity has not
varied significantly since appraisal, and per-ha yields in most cases have
remAined below appraisal projections (PCR, para. 6.01 and Annex 2, Tables 2
and 3).



! vi -
The failure to bring water charges to an appropriate level means
that there are no strong incentives to move into more officient modes of
cultivation; this shortcming goes hand in hand with a lack of local water
user associations and weaknesses in the agricultural support structure,
particularly in extension (PCR, paras. 6.01-6.02).
Nevertheless, a recalculation of the economic rate of return has
yielded a higher value (15.91) than the one estimated at appraisal (14.52),
even over a shorter reference period, 20 vs. 50 years (PCR, pars. 6.05).
Sustainability
While the project has improved farmers' incomes, the expected
upgrading of the entire production system has not yet taken place. A more
realistic pricing for irrigation water would be essential for improving O&M
and coupled with an upgrading of support services and local institutional
development,  create   conditions   conducive   to  enhancing  agricultural
productivity. These aspecta are to be addressed in a follow-up project
under preparation.
Findings and Lessons
The project experience re-emphasizes:
(i) the importance of adequate institutional support and effective
local inter-agency cooperation;
(ii) the need for adequate and appropriate project staffing and for
managerial continuity;
(iii)  the  significance  of  having   a  well  thought-out  O&M  system
(including its financing) in place early on; and
(iv)  in  the  case  of   project  changes  during  implementation,  the
obligation to keep a project's scope and composition commensurate
with its original objectives or alternatively to modify the
latter.



PROJECT CGIPLETION REPORT
DOMINICA' REPUBLIC
NIZAO IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN .1655-DO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Agriculture  was  the  most  important  sector  in  the  Dominican
Republic and in 1977 it contributed about 17X to the GDP. In the some
year, exports of agricultural origin comprised about 74X of the total value
of commodity exports.   The  total  population was estimated at 5 million.
Sugar, coffee, cocoa and tobacco were the traditional agricultural exports,
amounting to  US$558.0 million  (1.5 million  tons)  in  1977.   Exports of
vegetables and fruits, fresh and processed, reached US$17.0 million in
1977. Imports of foodstuffs totalled US$85.0 million in 1976. Rice,
wheat, soybean oil, peanut oil, and corn were the main imported products.
The Government's agricultural development strategy was to generate employ-
ment; improve the nutritional levels of the population; and accelerate
agricultural production and  export  growth.    The  project supported this
strategy.
1.02     Over the past ten years,  agriculture  is still the most important
sector in the economy, accounting for about 16Z of GDP. The total popula-
tion was estimated  at  6.6 million  in  1986.    Sugar,  coffee, cocoa and
tobacco continue to be the major sources of agricultural exports, amounting
to US$359.0 million (0.7 million tons)  in  1986.   These figures represent
642 and 50X respectively of the 1977 exports of these four commodities. By
contrast, vegetable and fruit exports, fresh and processed, have been
gradually increasing over the past ten years and it is estimated that they
amounted to US$39.0 million in 1987 (2302 over the 1977 figure). Although
the country is going through sever-, economic difficulties, the Nizao
Irrigation Project will contribute to increase vegetable and fruit exports.
The Bank approved two subsequent projects, the Sugar Rehabilitation Project
(Loan 1760-DO) approved in September 1979, and the Cocoa and Coffee
Development Project (Loan 2023-DO) approved in June 1981. In addition, an
Agricultural Sector Study was issued in June 1986.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification. Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     The project was identified in early 1970 by the National Institute
of Hydraulic Resources (INDRHI). A prefeasibility study was prepared by a
consulting firm (Spanish/Dominican joint venture) in 1974. The same con-
sulting firm prepared a  second  study  in  1975  but  it did not present a
feasibility study meeting Bank standards.   The final study was prepared by
a team  led  by  INDRHI  and  consisted  of  representatives  of  the State
Secretariat for Agriculture (SEA), Dominican Agrarian Institute (lAD),
Agricultural Bank (BA), and the  Dominican  Center for Promotion of Exports
(CEDOPEX). The FAO/Bank Cooperative Program and Bank staff assisted in
project preparat$on. It was appraised by the Bank in April-May 1978.



-2 -
B. Negotiations and Board Approval
2.02     Loan negotiations  took  place  in Washington,  D.C.,  during the
period November 20-23, 1978.  The  loan was approved by the Board, without
discussion, on January 23, 1979.
C. Prolect Obiectives and Components
2.03     Obiectives.  The objectives of  the project were to increase agri-
cultural productivity and exports by: (a) rehabilitating and expanding the
Marcos A. Cabral (MAC) and Nizao-Najayo (NN) irrigation systems to cover
13,700 ha, and improving water supply to about 4,200 ha; (b) extending the
irrigation system t.o 2,330 ha of new lands; (c) settlement of landless
farmers  In  the  newly  irrigated   areas  and  on-farm  development;  and
(d) building of 24.5 km of rural secondary roads and 146.6 km of service
roads along the main canals.    The  project  was, to directly benefit 3,200
farm families.
2.04     When the project was reappraisedlI  In  May 1983, the scope of the
objectives were reduced as followss (a) the canal rehabilitation was
14m4ted to 12,200 ha; and (b) the components of irrigating new lands and of
constructing secondary roads were eliminated.    The main reason for elimi-
nating new irrigation development was the high cost of on-farm development
(mainly land clearing and leveling). The Secretariat of Public Works (SOP)
found an alternative  source  of  financing  to satisfactorily complete the
secondary roads.  The revised  project  was  to directly benefit 2,450 farm
families.
2.05     Components.  The  revised  project  includeds  (a) civil works for
rehabilitation of the irrigation system to be carried out simultaneously by
contracting firms and by Force~ Account; (b) acquisition of vehicles and
construction equipment to INDRHI for works under Force Account; and
(c) technical services of local and foreign individual consultants to
assist INDRHI in project  implementation.    The appraisal project included
components of productivity increase but in the revised project there was no
real component of productivity increase: essentially, it was expected that
the Government would provide the necessary technical support to promote
productivity increases. However, some specific agronomic studies were done
to develop appropriate technology (Annex 1).
D. Project Cost and Finsncina
2.06     At appraisal, total project cost was estimated at US$50.6 million,
of which  the  Bank was  to  finance  US$27.0 million  (53Z), covering the
foreign exchange cost.   The  Government  was  to contribute the balance of
US$23.6 million (472).
2.07     At reappraisal  (May  1983),  total  project  cost  was reduced to
US$38.0 million, of which the Bank agreed to finance US$27.0 million (712),
11 The project was reappraised based on the Government's request for the
Bank to reduce the project scope and bring total costs in line with the
limited counterpart funds available.

covering all foreign exchange costs (53Z) and additionally 381 of the local
currency costs. The Government's share was US$11.0 million (29Z).
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     Introduction.  This chapter  compares  actual performance with the
.          targets established at reappraisal, including an analysis of implementation
of the different components (civil works for rehabilitation of the irri-
gation system, acquisition of vehicles and equipment, and technical
services),  assessment   of   project   cost,  disbursements,  procurement,
reporting, auditing, and compliance with loan covenants.
A. Implementation Schedule
3.02     Effectiveness.  The loan became effective on January 16, 1980, one
year after it was approved by the Board and after four extensions of the
original effectiveness  date  of  May 16, 1979.    Extensions were required
because Government delayed the ratification of the legal documents until
September 1979, and the creation of the Regional Project Coordinating
Committee took more time than anticipated due to the difficulties of
selecting the farmers' representative.
3.03     Implementation Period.   According  to  appraisal projections, the
project was expected to be completed  by June 30, 1984 and the Closing Date
was to be December 31, 1984.    Completion was  delayed by three years due
mainly to a shortage  of  counterpart  funds.  Additionally, project Imple-
mentation was delayed in the  early  years  of the project due to organiza-
tional and managerial problems.
B. Implementation of Project Components
3.04     Civil Works.  It was  decided at appraisal that the rehabilitation
of the main canals would be best executed by contractors with experience In
maintaining water services throughout the construction period. It was felt
INDRHI was best suited to execute civil works relating to the construction
of lateral and tertiary canals which required the consent of the farmers
*          settled in the area.  The  civil works included works of canal rehabilita-
tion  made  by:  (a) contracting   firms   for  Phase A  and  Phase B;  and
(b) INDRHI's Force Account. INDRHI was to be responsible for the construc-
.          tion of offices and  houses  for  headquarters'  staff of the project area,
including the acquisition of vehicles and heavy equipment, operational
expenses, and incremental local staff needed to carry out construction
works by Force  Account  and  to  supervise  construction.   Phase A of the
Construction Program by contract covered the works of an emergency recon-
struction program that was carr:ad out in a small section (1.7 km) of the
main MAC canal after Hurricane David and Storm Frederick hit the country
and damaged the canal in August  and  September 1979.  INDRHI requested and
the Bank approved use of  project  funds.    This  need was not foreseen at
Board Presentation. Phase B covered the project rehabilitation works that
were to be contracted out.



-4-
3.05     Rehabilitation of  the  Irrigation  System  by  Contractint Firms.
Phase A started in March 1980 after INDRHI chose a private contracting firm
(a joint venture between a Spanish and a local firm) to do the work and
another local consulting firm to supervise the work (this firm had pre-
viously prepared the project construction designs but its performance was
unsatisfactory because of design errors) (para. 3.12 and Annex 1). In
retrospect, the use of the same  consulting firm for design and supervision
of works may have prevented acceptable check and balance between design and
execution of the works. As a result of INDRHI's bad experience with the
local consulting firm, Bank approval was obtained to change the legal docu-
ments from use of local consultants to use of foreign consultants (Annex
1). Construction took 38 weeks instesd of the 13 anticipated mainly due to
INDRHI's critical financial condition and delays in making monthly payments
to the contractor.  The  actual  cost  of Phase A was US$0.9 million, about
US$27,OOC  less than  estimated.    The  cost  of  the supervision was about
US$40,000 (Annex 2, Table 1).
3.06     Phase B included: (a) rehabilitation of 35.4 km of mair MAC canal;
construction of the Bani Siphon of 0.6 km and 36.8 km of service roads;
(b) rehabilitation of 11.3 km of the main NN canal and 19.0 km of secondary
NN canals; the construction of two siphons (Nizao of 0.5 km and La Cabria
of 1.1 km); and 13.0 km of service roads along the main canal; and
(c) building of the central camp.    INDRHI selected one construction firm,
out of ten pre-qualified firms, to carry out Phase B of the project. A
foreign consulting firm was selected to provide INDRHI technical assistance
to supervise construction work.    At  project closing (December 31, 1987),
approximately 852 of the works had been completed. It was originally esti-
mated that works would be carried out in 34 months. The actual time was 91
months.
3.07     Delays occurred during  the  construction  period  due mainly to a
lack of sufficient and timely counterpart funds, and also because:
(a) construction designs had to be revised and the consulting firm, con-
tracted to provide technical assistance in the supervision of construction
and in the revision of construction designs, had difficulties in producing
final designs for construction due to insufficient INDRHI counterpart staff
and their lack of experience (Annex 1); and (b) INDRHI's failure to resolve
claims presented by the contractor  for stoppage of works produced unavoid-
able delays in construction works.
3.08     The original amount of the contract for Phase B between INDRPI and
the Spanish contracting  firm was  US$24.9 million.    The actual cost was
US$27.6 million (Annex 2, Table 1).
3.09     Rehabilitation of the Irrigation System by INDRHI's Force Account.
They includeds (a) in the MAC system; 11.4 km of main canal and 49.3 km of
laterals, 18 structures, 5.1 km of drains and 17.8 km of service roads; and
(b) in the NN systems 7 km of laterals and 2.8 km of drains. The actual
cost was US$2.9 million compared with US$5.9 million when the project Was
re-appraised (Annex 2, Table 2). Works started in July 1980 at a very slow
pace and construction works  were  frequently  stopped becsuse the Project
Unit was understaffed and underfunded most of the time. Starting in 1984,



when the project W88 put under the SAP and there was equipment and person-
nel in place, works were intensified until they were finished in September
1985. INDRHI's performance under Force Account was satisfactory because it
used small sub contractors from the project area and finished the works as
anticipated.
3.10     Equipment.  The  project  provided  equipment  fors  Force Account
construction; supervision of construction; and operation and maintenance
(O&M) of the irrigation system.    Actual  total  cost of the equipmert was
approximately the same as estimated at reappraisal: US$1.16 million (Annex
2, Table 2).
3.11     Technical Services.  The  project  was  to  provide up to 250 man-
months of both local (142 man-months) and expatriate (108 man-month) con-
sultant services. Local consultant services were to be used to assist
INDRHI in the preparation of final designs, plans, specifications, tender
documents for civil works, evaluation of bids and supervision of construc-
tion. Expatriates would be used to organize the O&M of the irrigation
systems during the rehabilitation period; to develop a system of water
charges; to inspect the safety of the Valdesia and Barias dams and carry
out the study for the operation of the Valdesia dam; and train extension
agents and farmers in improved soil and water management practices. The
project was also to provide the aerial photography of the project area for
preparation of the cadastral map.
3.12     The implementatiOn of  the  technical  services  component was not
carried out as anticipated.    Some  of  the  services were contracted with
dele*ys and the consultant's recommendations came too close to project
completion to be implemented or were not implemented for lack of funds.
Two of these studies (Organization of the Ozama-Nizao Irrigation District
and Agricultural Development of the Project) have not been critically
analyzed by INDRHI and it remains to be seen if the recommendations (with
which we agree) will be carried out. Ten consulting services, for supervi-
sion of Phases A and B, aerial photography and studies, were contracted by
INDRHI including three with the Inter-American Institute of Cooperation for
Agriculture (IICA). In general terms, performance of the consulting firms
was satisfactory with one exceptions the local firm that provided technical
assistance for  supervision  of  construction works  of  Phase A performed
unsatisfactorily due to errors in its designs (para. 3.05 and Annex 1).
3.13     At  closing,  the  total  technical  services  component  cost was
US$7.2 million, almost double that estimated at reappraisal. This figure
includes about US$2.0 million of INDRHI's counterpart funds. INDRHI was
supposed  to  contribute   only   US$0.4 million  when   the  project  was
re-appraised (Annex 2, Table 2).
3.14     The higher cost of  this  component  is mainly due to: (a) longer
time required than anticipated (between two and four additional years) to
contract some services; (b) technical assistance for supervision of con-
tracted works was awarded to a foreign consulting firm not anticipated at
appraisal (para. 3.06); (c) the scope of the rural development study was
enlarged when the project was re-evaluated; and (d) foreign consulting
firms or joint ventures between foreign and local firms, not anticipated at
appraisal, were  contracted.    The  higher  costs  for  this component are



justified because of the unanticipated costs and increase in the scope of
the study undertaken.    Some  of  the  resultant recommendations are being
implemented and about 20 of INDRHI's technical staf' have been trained in
service during  project  execution  and  about  150  professionals of local
institutions have attended short training courses mainly organized by IICA.
C. Cost Estimate
3.15     The total cost  of  the  four  components  at completion was about
US$39.8 million  equivalent,  compared   to   a  re-appraisal  estimate  of
US$38.0 million (Annex 2, Table 2).  With  the reallocation of unallocated
funds in 1987, resultant actual costs by category are approximately the
same as the reappraisal plan.
D. Disbursements
3.16     Disbursements during  the  whole  implementation  period were very
slow primarily due to the lack of counterpart funds. On four occasions
(November 1980, April 1981, May 1984, and May 1987) the Bank agreed to
amend the Loan Agreement in order to increase the disbursement percentage
of local expenditures for  civil works  financed  by  the Bank frcm 53% at
appraisal to 90%. This was primarily because of the negative effect of the
devaluation of the local currency, combined vith the lag between the dates
of expenditures  and  the  dates  of  disbursements.    Also,  in  1984 the
Dominican Republic was made eligible for a Bank Special Action Program
which dramatically increased the pace of disbursements during the period
FY85-88.
E. Procurement
3.17     ICB procurement of  equipment  and  vehicles  for  the project was
carried out satisfactorily.   ICB  to  contract construction of civil works
was also carried out satisfactorily.   Other minor acquisition of goods was
done by local procedures and no problems were encountered.
F. Reporting
3.18     INDRHI was to establish  and  maintain  a system of monitoring the
progress of the project and evaluating the impact of the investment and
technical services. INDRHI was also to submit to the Bank consolidated
quarterly progress reports and a draft of the PCR. INDRHI fulfilled the
task of organizing the M&E unit in February 1987 with adequate technical
staff and electronic equipment.  The  delay  in establishing this unit was
because the previous INDRHI Executive Directors did not support the unit
both in staff and funds. In the short time that the unit has been operat-
ing, it has produced valuable statistical information that helped to
upgrade the presentation of progress  reports.    The unit also prepared an
agricultural base line survey in  the  project  area which was published in
August 1987. The unit staff has been trained and they are gradually under-
taking new and more complex tasks.   They also participated in the prepara-
tion of the project PCR. The M & E unit is expected to continue to play an
important role in the implementation of future projects. In general, proj-
ect reporting was satisfactory.



- 7 -
G. Auditing
3.19     At the end of each  fiscal  year,  INDRHI  was to send to the Bank
audits of the project and INDRRI accounts, prepared by independent
auditors, satisfactory to  the  Bank.    INDRHI  fulfilled this requirement
although with consistent delays  of  up  to  two months.   Since the first
audit, auditors have found the same deficiencies year after year: weak
accounting and financial control system and weak administrative procedures
in the  inventory  system.    In  addition,  INDRHI  did  not keep separate
accounts for the control of cash for each project. INDRHI's maintenance of
only one bank account, into which the Government disburses coumterpart
funds for a number of externally financed projects, led to the use of funds
across projects and to difficulties in reconciliation of subsidiary
accounts.
H. Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.20     The Borrower did not fully  comply with the following sections of
the Loan Agreement:
- Section 3.01(a) requiring of Dominican Agrarian Institute (IAD)
to carry out an agrarian reform program consisting of preparation of a new
cadastral map for the Project Area and selection of landless and their
settlement in the newly irrigated lands (Part F of the project): IAD did
not have the funds to carry out this work.
- Section 3.01(b) requiring the provision of sufficient and timely
counterpart funds to INDRHI:   the annual Government budgetary allocations
had other priorities;
- Section 3.02 requiring the maintenance of operation of the
Regional Project  Coordinating  Committee:    the  appo=ntment of committee
members, who had to be nominated for each institution, took more time than
anticipated, the committee members were often replaced, they did not attend
meetings, and they did not have incentives to meet;
- Section 3.04 requiring the establishment of a progressive system
of water charges to cover O&M expenditures and a proportion of the invest-
ment cost: water charges did not keep pace with O&M expenditures. The
water charges were updated in October 1986 but had not been implemented by
1987;
- Section 4.02 requiring BA to cover the farmers' incremental
credit demand of the projects    because  there was no effective technology
transfer, there were no productivity gains, and hence there was no need for
credit.
! Section 4.03 requiring SEA to furnish to the Bank, not later
than June 30 of each year, a program to provide quality control for vege-
table seeds in the project: SEA did not have funds to carry out this work.



IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01     The  performance  of  INDRHI  during  project  implementation was
unsatisfactory largely before a new administration took office in August
1986 and which has since given more support to the project. INDRHI is now
in a better position to take on the responsibility for implementing
projects.  The primary reasons for INDRHI's poor performance were:
(a) from the project's inception, INDRHI's centralized organization
has been handicapped by a weak accounting and financial control
system (para. 3.19);
(b) decision-making lacked consistency and continuity because of
frequent turnovers of INDRHI's Executive Directors (8 since 1979),
most of whom did not actively support the project because of
differing priorities of the Government and of INDRHI, which
ultimately led to lack of counterpart funds for this project;
(c) lack of organizational and financial autonomy of the Project Unit
during the early project years; and
(d) lack of coordination with other agencies in the project area
essentially because the  Regional  Coordinating  Committee did not
work (para. 3.20).
In March 1983, in an effort to improve on INDRHI's performance, the
Government created  an  Executive  Commission  (CE)  to  replace  INDRHI as
executing agency.  However, there was  duplication of effort and conflicts
arose between INDRHT and the CE such that the Government, in December 1983,
reinstated project responsibility to INDRHI.
V. Role cef the Bank
5.01     The role  played  by  the  Bank  throughout  the  execution of the
project was satisfactory.    Relations  between  the  Bank  and INDRHI were
cordial at all times, and the Bank acted supportively and flexibly in
responding to the Government's requests for Bank re-evaluation of the
project and increasing the Bank's percentage of disbursements of local
currency expenditures; reallocation of the proceeds of the loan; increase
of the project technical services; and extension of the loan closing date
to allow completion  of  the  project.    The  appraisal mission was overly
optimistic with its estimates for yields, project production, cropping
intensity, and institutional capability'capacity.
VI. Agricultural Impact
6.01     At appraisal  the  objective was  to  increase  the production of
vegetables and fruits with regular provision of irrigation. Essentially,
the basic strategy seemc to have been to improve the infrastructure and
assume productivity will follow. The adoption of more efficient irrigation
techniques and the establishment of water charges, which better reflect the
cost of irrigation, were supposed to favor a further shift towards high



value crops, such as fruits, papaya, banana, plantains and casseva at the
expense of fallow, unimproved pastures, corn, peanuts, beans aid pigeon
peas. The cropping pattern was not expected to be affected by the project
although the crop mix might be modified in response to changes in market
demand and crop prices.    At  project  completion there is, however, still
between 15% and 30% of fallow; the cropping intensity, at farm level,
remains static at the same levels as at appraisal; and the project did not
achieve the production envisaged at appraisal as shown in Annex 2, Table 3.
However, the project was successful in the promotion of higher value crops
in part due to  better  prices.    This  shift of production towards higher
*          value crops cannot  be  attributed  to  project  measures, because both the
cropping intensity and the irrigation efficiency--the main indicators of
improved irrigation water supply and management--have not changed during
project implementation. Instead, farmers have followed their own percep-
tions of price and market developments and adjusted their production
pattern accordingly, in particular as the project also did not provide
specific measures to strengthen  extension  and credit services which cow'd
have influenced project farmers' production decisions
6.02     The lack of both  local  institutional coordination and water user
associations made it almost impossible to prepare and implement annual
irrigation plans. More efficient irrigation techniques have not yet been
adopted and full recovery of water charges as established in 1982 have not
been achieved.   Moreover,  there  is  still  a  lack of sufficient support
services to agricultural production.    For  these  reasons, yields did not
increase as anticipated with the exception of rice as shown in Annex 2,
Table 4.
6.03     The analysis of the impact of  the project was based on field work
conducted by the M&E unit in 1987 (para. 3.19) and also based on prelimi-
nary information from the diagnostic-survey recently carried out in the
project area by consultants in charge of the preparation of the follow-on
project.
6.04     The financial rate of  return  (FRR)  was re-estimated for each of
the five representative farm models envisaged at appraisal and based on the
following assumptions: (a) for the before project situations it was assumed
the same cropping  pattern,  cropping  intensity  and  yields as originally
proposed at appraisal; (b) for the with project situations, the cropping
pattern, cropping intensity and yields such as they arose from field infor-
*          mation available were used; (c) farmgate prices were based on average local
prices prevailing in the project area; and (d) the FRRs were calculated
over 16 years. Based on the above, the incremental net income figures of
RD$497-4670  are  satisfactory   compared   with   appraisal  estimates  of
RD$180-5751.
6.05     The economic rate of return  (ERR) was re-estimated for the entire
project and based  on  the  following assumptions: (a) incremental benefits
were derived from the accumulated number of farm models representing each
project zone in 1986/87 prices; (b) farm labor was priced at the current
market wage; (c) the value of the foreign exchange element of costs and
benefits was adjusted to the parallel rate of US$1.00 = DR$ 6.40; (d) the
prices of commodities and imported goods and services were shadow priced at
RD$0.12 to 5.88 per kilogram for commodities; (e) all project costs were



- 10 -
included in the analysisl and (f) the ERR was calculated over 20 years.
The ERR was estimated at 15.92, which compares to 14.51 at appraisal,
although the latter was run over 50 years (Annex 2, Table 5).
VII. LESSONS LEARNED
7.01     The key lessons learned ares
(a) future agricultural projects in the Dominican Republic should give
much more attention to ensuring that provision be made for insti-
tutional support from all agencies expected to participate in
project execution, given the institutional weaknesses and bud-
getary constraints. In this project IAD and SEA were both given
project implementation responsibilities but they did not receive
project funds (para. 3.20);
(b) for effective coordination of local institutions, the Coordinating
Committee should have its objectives clearly defined, have suffi-
cient administrative, logistic and financial Government support,
and meet  regularly.    Lacking  these  requirements, the Regional
Coordinating Committee in this project did not work and hence the
coordination of local institutions became difficult to achieve
(para. 4.01);
(c) for future projects of this kind in the Dominican Republic, Bank
consideration should be given for Borrower assurance of project
managerial continuity and  the  training  of  personnel to manage,
operate and maintain the project. In this project, lack of conti-
nuity at the managerial level was detrimental to the successful
implementation of the project (para. 4.01);
(d) studies to organize the O&M of the project irrigation district and
to prepare the project agricultural development should have been
initiated in the early project years in order to be able to carry
out  the  main   recommendations   during  project  implementation
(para. 3.12);
(e) future projects of this kind in the Dominican Republic should use
INDRHI  as  the  executing   agency   provided  it  receives  full
Government financial support, hires additional highly skilled
technical personnel, and is allowed to train an adequate number of
its technical staff.   Institutional  strengthening is a long-term
process and while INDRHI was a relatively weak institution during
most of project implementation it has recently begun to show
evidence of its learning experience;
(f) when reappraisal of a project takes place it is important to
ensure those components which would facilitate reaching the
project's objectives remain or the objectives should be modified.
The reappraised project did not include specific components aimed
at promoting productivity increase. Without components of support
services such as credit, marketing, research, and extension, it
was not possible to reach a major objective of the project: to
increase agricultural productivity.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
DONINICAN REPUBLIC
NIZAO IRRIGATION PROJECT (LN. 1655-DO)
Technical Services Component
1.       INDRHI contracted  the  following  ten  technical  services during
project implementation (see also Annex 2, Table 1):
2.       Supervision of Construction of Phase A.  The same local consulting
firm that had prepared and actualized the civil work designs, specifica-
tions, and procurement documentation was contracted to provide INDRHI tech-
nical assistance to supervise construction of Phase A. The performance of
the iirm was unsatisfactory because errors were found in the designs.
INDRHI cancelled the contract before works were completed (para. 3.05).
The cost of this service was about US$40,000.
3.       Supervision of Construction of  Phase  B.    There were three con-
tracts signed by INDEHI to receive this service. The first one was with a
California consulting firm which provided technical assistance to INDRHI to
supervise construction work and revise construction designs. The perfor-
mance of the firm was satisfactory in spite of the fact that they had dif-
ficulties in producing the final designs because of insufficient INDRHI
counterpart technical staff and  their  lack  of  experience.  The need for
assistance to revise construction designs was never anticipated because
INDRHI had been sure that the local consultants hired for project work
design in 1979 would be capable to produce appropriate designs. The total
cost of this contract was US$1.1 million and it was ccWpleted in May 1984.
4.       In October 1984 INDRHI  signed  a  new  contract with a consortium
formed with the same California firm and a local consulting firm for super-
vising construction work.   The  consortium  assumed all the responsibility
for  construction  supervision.    The  total  cost  of  this  contract was
US$2.7 million and the performance of the consortium was satisfactory.
5.       When the consortium finished  its  contract  at  the end of 1987 a
third contract to supervise construction was signed by INDRHI with one
consultant that had previously worked as supervision team leader for the
consortium and for ten months  duration.    The  cost of this contract was
US$O.l million and the performance of the consultant was satisfactory.
6.       Study to Organize the O&M  of the Nizao Irrigation District.  The
same California firm formed another consortium with another local consult-
ing firm to carry out two studies for INDRHI. The first study to organize
project O&M was signed in August 1984 (three and a half years delay) and
was completed in March 1986. As a result of this study INDRHI organized a
unit to train farmers in irrigation methods using demonstration plots.
Other recommendations were related to district administration, O&M of the
irrigation systems and water  charges.    The  consortium  used thse aerial
photography (prepared by a Puerto Rican consulting firm w.'th project funds)

to update the Project Water  Users.   The consortium granted 208 man-months
and the total cost was  US$0.7 million.   INDRHI did not critically analyze
this technical service. Many of the recommendations have not been carried
out due to lack of funds and also because of the proximity of project clos-
ing. The new water charges have not been fully executed. However, the
performance of the consortium was satisfactory.
7.       Study of  the  Proiect  Agricultural  Development.    This was the
second study prepared by the same  consortium.   The contract was signed in
January 1985, with three years delay, and was completed in March 1986. The
consortium prepared a diagnostic of the local institutions in the project
area and a developmevt plan to be implemented in three years to improve
project production. Also, recommendations were given to organize farmers'
support services and training of extensionists and farmers in water, soil
use and management. The consortium provided one year of technical assis-
tance at field level and prepared a proposal to develop a specific area of
the project as a pilot program.    Some of the recommendations were carried
out in two demonstration farms but lack of funds prevented fully carrying
out the program. This study was also completed near project closing. The
consortium granted 189 mar.-months and the total cost was US$0.9 million.
INDRHI did not critically  analyze  this  service.   The performance of the
consortium was satisfactory.
8.       Aerial Photography. A contract was  signed for the aerial photo-
graphy of the project area in October 1984 (two years delay) with a foreign
consulting firm. The total cost was about US$0.1 million, was executed in
5 months and the performance of the consulting firm was satisfactory.
9.       Technical Services Granted by  IICA.   Three contracts were signed
between INDRHI and IICA: the first one to carry out studies on the opera-
tion and safety of the Valdesia and Barias dams was contracted with IICA
and Colorado State University (CSU) in April 1984 and had the support of
CDE. Studies started in August 1984, were completed in August 1986 and the
total cost was US$0.7 million.    The consultants established methodologies
to operate the dams, to optimize their use and revise the correct operation
of the control systems. One of the main issues found by the consultants
was  a  lack  of  coordination   by  INDRHI  with  the  Dominican  Electric
Corporation (CDE). Ninety-five local technicians were trained in service
and in short courses. The performance of the consultants was satisfactory.
10.      The second contract was signed  in  November 1986 and consisted of
organizing and operating a monitoring and evaluation system for the
project. Consulting services started in February 1987 and finished in
June 1988 and the total cost was about US$0.3 million. The consultants
helped to establish M&E methodologies,  to  carry out an agricultural base-
line survey in the a ea of the project and to prepare this project comple-
tion report. The performance of the consultants was satisfactory.
i          11.      The third contract was  signed  in  November 1987 and consisted of
preparing  a  follow-up  project  of  agricultural  development  for  three
priority irrigation areas which included  the irrigations systems of Nizao-
Valdesia, Azua (Yaque del Sur Project) and Alto Yaque del Norte. Studies
started in February 1988 and are expected to be completed in December 1988.
The total cost was about US$0.5 million.

a/ The reasons for the higher yield of rice are:  there are about 700 ha of
rice located in an specific area with adequate soils for rice cropping;
farmers that crop rice are small-scale farmers who traditionally have
cropped rice and they use improved seeds and modern chemical inputs
although they still use oxen team for land preparation and labor force
for harvesting.
