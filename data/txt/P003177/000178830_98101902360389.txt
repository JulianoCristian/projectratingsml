INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ZAMBIA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
FOR A SECOND DEVELOPMENT BANK OF ZAMBIA PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Development Bank of Zambia with the guarantee of the RepUblft of
Zambia for the equivalent of US$15 million for a second line of credit.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
2.        With its mineral resources and plentiful land area suitable for
crops and livestock, Zambia though landlocked, has the potential for rapid
and sustained development. Economic and social goals since independence
in 1964, have been security of transport routes to the sea, diversification
from copper dependency by greater agricultural and industrial development,
more equitable distribution of income and expanded educational and training
opportunities. Progress toward achieving these goals has been below potential
due to structural imbalances in the economy, prolonged turmoil within the
region, and since 1975 a severe economic depression. Increased educational
opportunities and construction of the TAZARA Railway through Tanzania to
Dar-es-Salaam are the main areas in which substantial progress has been
made.
3.        The economy is an open one in which the Government plays a dominant
role. Imports and exports range between 40 and 45 percent of GDP. Govern-
ment expenditures have amounted to about 35 percent of GDP in recent years,
while the Government owns a majority share of mining and most manufacturing
enterprises. Much local economic activity is dependent on expatriate tech-
nical, managerial and administrative skills. Despite high rates of savings
and investment, both of which have averaged about 30 percent of GDP since
independence, real growth has been disappointing, averaging only about 2 to
2.5 percent a year even before the onset of the economic depression in 1975.
Diversification efforts have lagged; copper mining still provides 90 percent
of foreign exchange earnings and 30 percent of gross value added. 2/ Agricul-
ture accounts for about 15 percent of current GDP, the same as at independence.
The contribution of the manufacturing sector to current GDP rose rapidly
from 7 to 17 percent through 1975 but has stagnated since then. Mean incomes
in rural areas are well below the 1979 average per capita Income of US$510 and
are estimated to be less than one-third the average earnings of urban dwell-
ers. This Imbalance has caused rural to urban migration (nearly 40 percent
of the population is urban) and unemployment in urban areas.
1/   A basic economic report on Zambia (1589b-ZA) was issued in December
1977. An updating economic mission visited in May 1979 and Its salient
findings are reflected below. The most recent economic data are
summarized in Annex I.
2/   In constant prices.  In current prices, however, the contribution of
mining has fallen to about 15 percent of GDP in recent years, due to
lower copper prices.



- 2 -
4.        Until 1975, the services and manufacturing sectors grew at 8 to 10
percent per year. Manufacturing activity provided additional job opportuni-
ties for urban dwellers but became increasingly capital intensive and dependent
on imported inputs. Much of the growth in services can be related to the
country's success in expanding education and increasing government activity;
the services sector now constitutes about 38 percent of GDP. Performance in
other sectors has generally been poor and has been characterized by either
very slow growth or stagnation.   Copper output fluctuated considerably during
the period but averaged about 700,000 metric tons between 1970 and 1978.
Output in 1979 fell drastically, however, to about 580,000 tons.
The Current Economic Crisis and the Government's Response
5.        Since 1975, Zambia has experienced an economic and financial crisis
initiated by a sharp decline in copper prices. Difficulties in transporting
goods to and from the sea during 1978 and the sharp decline in copper output
in 1979 have exacerbated the situation. By the end of 1979, these problems
caused real per capita income to fall below its level at independence and
worsened growth prospects considerably. The depression began with a 40
percent fall in copper prices in 1975. As a result foreign exchange earnings
fell 42 percent in 1975 and did not recover to their 1974 levels until late
1979. Government revenues from mining fell from US$517 million (51 percent of
total revenue) in 1974, to US$92 million in 1975 and were negligible until the
first quarter of 1980. Nominal government expenditures have increased only
slightly since 1975, while revenues obtained from non-mining sources have been
about double. Still, large deficits, averaging 13 percent of GDP, occurred
each year between 1975 and 1977, and were financed, until recently, largely by
borrowing from the central bank. The rate of inflation rose rapidly from
about 10 percent in 1975 to about 20 percent in 1977. The nominal value of
imports was held at approximately the 1974 level, but declined to about 45
percent in real terms, seriously affecting production. Even with the curtail-
ment of imports, large current account deficits occured durinR J975-1978. These were
financed by short term capital inflows and a build up of arrears on import
payments to US$625 million by the end of 1978. Reserves have also fallen and
net foreign assets, which are affected by borrowing from the IMF, are now
about a negative US$400 million.
6.        The Government's reaction to the crisis, beginning with the signing
of an IMF Standby Agreement in 1978 was decisive. The devaluation of the
kwacha by 10 percent and the opening of the southern railway route in October
1978, improved copper exports and profits. The Government controlled import
values and reduced the rate of credit expansion and deficit financing.
Wage increments have generally been suppressed and arrears on import payments
were reduced by US$175 million by the end of 1979. The effectiveness of these
measures coupled with a reduction in copper stocks and an increase in copper
prices (currently US$0.94 per pound as opposed to the average 1978 price of
US$0.63 per pound) have stabilized the economic situation. Inflation dropped
to about 11 percent In 1979 and deficits on the balance of payments and
government accounts are under control.



- 3 -
7.        The crisis has had a severe impact on growth.  Real GDP grew at only
0.3 percent per annum between 1974 and 1978. In 1979, real GDP declined
sharply with the largest declines in the mining sector (19 percent) and in
agriculture (10 percent). Drought affected agricultural production, parti-
cularly maize, and the lack of imported inputs and spares and the curtailment
of government recurrent expenditures has led to an economy-wide problem of
under utilization of capacity. Lower investment and government capital
expenditure have delayed the completion of investment projects. The manu-
facturing sector, which suffered severely in 1975 from shortages of foreign
exchange, has begun to recover but, as with the economy generally, requires
still further increases in foreign exchange before significant growth can
occur. The recent expiration of the IMF Standby Agreement has led the Govern-
ment to consider using the Fund's Extended Fund Facility, which could help to
offset the profound effects of the five year depression and the likely future
impact of oil price increments on Zambia's growth prospects.
Creditworthiness
8.        Prior to 1975 Zambia's external borrowing was small.  Indebtedness
in 1974 was US$762 million (US$162 per capita) and the debt service ratio was
less than 10 percent of exports. Since then borrowing has risen sharply, to
an estimated US$1,547 million by end 1979, and the debt service ratio has
risen to about 20 percent of exports. External payment arrears have been
reduced somewhat but still equal an estimated US$425 million. In addition,
the Government has purchased about US$400 million of foreign exchange
from the IMF. With a 23 percent share of estimated debt outstanding and
disbursed at the end of 1979, the Bank is the country's largest creditor,
just ahead of the People's Republic of China and private banks each of which
holds 22 percent of the debt.
9.        Although Zambia faces debt servicing difficulties for some time to
come, the Government is aware of the magnitude of the problem and of the
essential requirement for careful debt management. Government actions over
the past two years included tight control of imports, reductions in payments
arrears and successful compliance with the terms of the IMF Standby Agree-
ment. The Government has, thus, provided evidence of its resolve in dealing
with the debt service burden. Between now and the mid-80s service on debt
contracted up to December 1979 and on projected new capital inflows is expected
to continue to claim between 22 and 25 percent of export earnings. Thereafter,
if projected real increases In copper prices occur, the figure would fall
considerably and Zambia's creditworthiness would be enhanced accordingly.
Given the Government's determination to deal with the problem of external debt
management and the prospects of a lowering of the debt service ratio in the
medium to long term, Zambia continues to be creditworthy for further IBRD
lending.



- 4 -
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
10.       Since 1956, the Bank has made 27 loans and four credits to Zambia
totalling about US$576 million (net of cancellations). Fourteen loans and two
credits have financed power, transportation and communications projects.
Four loans for education have helped expand Zambia's secondary and higher
education system, teacher training, and commercial, agricultural and technical
education. Two program loans have helped Zambia maintain its development
program In periods of severe economic dislocation. In agriculture, the Bank
has provided five loans and one credit for industrial forest plantations,
livestock, commercial crops and integrated family farming and coffee
production. Other loans have assisted Zambia's urban development program and,
through the Development Bank of Zambia, its manufacturing, agricultural and
industrial sectors. A technical assistance credit was provided to help the
Government improve its planning and project preparation capabilities.
11.       IFC has invested about US$40 million in seven projects in Zambia
since 1972. Two investments were in shoe manufacturing, two in a package
material plant, and one each for equity in the Development Bank of Zambia,
cobalt production and textiles. Summary statements of Bank Group loans,
credits and investments and notes on the execution of ongoing projects are in
Annex II.
12.       The Bank Group expects to continue supporting government programs to
reduce dependence on copper, narrow the urban-rural income gap and develop
managerial and technical skills to accelerate development and reduce dependence
on expatriates. Lending reflects the Government's growing emphasis on directly
productive sectors, particularly agriculture-related activities. A structural
adjustment loan is under consideration, subject to government decisions on
appropriate adjustment policies and a medium-term investment program. Projects
to expand agricultural production through strengthening extension and marketing
services, and providing farm inputs and credit in the Eastern and Southern
Provinces are under preparation.
13.       While future lending will emphasize agricultural and rural develop-
ment, it also will help improve manufacturing, and physical and social infra-
structure. Projects are being prepared for constructing a mill to produce
fiber, wafer and particle board, and improving and expanding water supply in
smaller towns and villages.
14.       Implementation of Bank-assisted projects in Zambia has proceeded
reasonably well, although in recent years the sharp contraction of the economy
(para. 5) and the resulting shortages and budgetary cuts have had a deleterious
effect on the general progress of many projects. Since the signing of the IMF
Standby Agreement in 1978, budget deficits have been strictly controlled, and
the Government has had extreme difficulty meeting local cost requirements in
some Bank projects. In the telecommunications, transport, urban and education
projects, budget cuts have slowed procurement and delayed implementation.



PART III - MANUFACTURING AND FINANCE
Manufacturing
15.       Zambia's manufacturing sector accounts for about 17 percent of GDP,
in current terms, and provides about 14 percent of formal employment of
360,000. It is, however, capital intensive, highly dependent on inefficient
parastatals and has tended to require substantial foreign exchange resources
that have been greatly reduced by the prolonged slump in the value of mineral
exports.
16.       The sector grew rapidly In the decade after independence; its 10
percent yearly growth In value added was, however, based on high protective
tariffs on finished, but not intermediate, goods that led to the establishment
of industries largely based on the final processing of consumer goods. It
was, thus, particularly hard hit by Zambia's financial and economic crisis,
and value added fell 27 percent between 1974 and 1977. It has increased
somewhat In the past two years, but is still below the 1974 level.
17.       The sector is dominated by the Industrial Development Corporation
(INDECO), Ltd., a Government holding firm established in 1964 to promote
industrial diversification and Zambianization. 1/ INDECO's share of manu-
facturing output probably exceeded 60 percent in 1979. Its 31 subsidiaries
employed 24,800 workers in 1979; while their value added was almost US$11,000
per capita, INDECO industries were relatively capital-intensive at US$22,500
in net fixed assets per employee. The holding company's subsidlaries produce
all Zambia's sugar, beer, fertilizer and cement, and most grain and cotton
products and edible oils.
18.       The sector is primarily engaged in processing intermediate goods and
raw materials, and is heavily dependent on imports, requiring 35-40 percent of
the value of annual visible Imports. Food, beverages and tobacco make up
31 percent of manufactures, in current terms, and the rest consist of rubber,
chemicals, petroleum and plastic products (17 percent), and fabricated metals,
machinery and equipment, textiles, and food.
19.       Private sector firms tend to be smaller and less capital-intensive
than parastatals, but highly dependent on non-Zambian managers and concen-
trated in the Copperbelt and Lusaka provinces. The sector is led by some 300
firms of more than 50 employees each, the bulk of which provide repair
services or equipment for Zambia's mining industry. These firms were mostly
set up by expatriates, although many have now been taken over by Zambian
entrepreneurs. Another 1,500 firms, many run by Asians and employing 25 or
fewer, are largely engaged in retail trade and to a lesser extent in small
scale manufacturing. There are also about 10,000 rural retail and artisan
enterprises, generally single-family operations. Overall, the private sector
provides about 55 percent of manufacturing employment.
1/   INDECO, in turn, is owned by the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation
(ZIMCO), an apex holding company for parastatals.



- 6 -
Agro-industry and Commercial Agriculture
20.       Agriculture-based industries account for 38 percent of manufacturing
value added and a third of manufacturing employment. This subsector is also
dominated by INDECO, although the private sector is important in process-
Ing fruit, fish, grain, meat and baking. Zambia has a relatively small
modern commercial agricultural sector consisting of a number of state farms
and ranches and about 800 farmers. Most of the farmers are of European
origin, who, despite their small number account for about half of marketed
agricultural production.
21.       After a decade (1968-78) of promoting INDECO and the parastatal                    a
sector, the Government has, under the 1977 Industrial Development Act and the
1979 Third National Development Plan, begun encouraging private investment
through incentives for subsectors considered "priority" under the Plan. These
include agro-industries, leather goods, metals, fertilizers, agricultural
tools, cement, ceramics, and building materials. The incentives include
preferential import license allocations, customs duty rebates, and tax relief,
including a provision for offsetting training expenses. While these Initiatives
seem to have provided some encouragement to private entrepreneurs, as shown In
increasing demand for Investment funds from DBZ, they are vaguely worded and
administratively complex; these problems and the general slowdown In Zambia's
economy have hampered full implementation of the new policies.
Finance
22.       Zambia's financial system includes four commercial banks, six
specialized financial institutions and the Bank of Zambia, which regulates
commercial banks, establishes and administers national monetary and credit
policles, and manages Zambia's international reserves and foreign exchange
control system.
23.       The four commercial banks have 100 branches.  The state-owned Zambia
National Commercial Bank (ZNCB), established in 1969, handles most government
and parastatal commercial banking business, and has assets of more than US$400
million. The private banks, subsidiaries of British banks 1/ (Barclays,
Standard, and Grindlays) have assets of more than US$1.1 billion and deposits
of US$856 million. The commerical banks provide short-and medium-term credit,
leaving long-term lending to specialized institutions. About 60 percent of
private commercial lending is to the private sector, most of it about evenly
split between agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce, while about 80 percent
of ZNCB's lending goes to public and parastatal agencies.
24.       The specialized institutions include the Development Bank of Zambia
(para 31), the National Provident Fund, the State Insurance Corporation, the
National Building Society, the Agriculture Finance Company 2/, and the
National Savings and Credit Bank.
1/   Citibank has also recently opened a branch in Lusaka.
2/   The major source of seasonal and medium term lending to smallholders,
AFC's operations are being wound up and its assets and staff transferred
to the new Zambian Agriculture Development Bank, which is expected to
complement DBZ in lending for agriculture.



-7-
25.       Together, these institutions hold more than US$600 million in assets
and deposits that are used for lending and investment, mostly for the public
sector.  The Provident Fund has lent K 2.2 million and has agreed to lend the
development bank an additional US$3.75 million. Overall, Zambia's financial
institutions play an important role in mobilizing savings and allocating
resources.
Real and Nominal Interest Rates
26.        Inflation of 20 percent In 1977 and 16 percent in 1978 fell to 12
percent In 1979 as the austerity measures adopted under the IMF agreement
(para 6) took hold. The Government intends to continue to limit the expansion
of domestic credit. If an Extended Fund Facility (para. 7) is negotiated in
late 1980, growth could be re-established and inflation should fall to about
10 percent In 1983. Zambia's interest rate structure is also a result of the
1978 Standby Agreement. The Government has set an interest rate ceiling of 12
percent (12.5 percent for DBZ), and commercial bank lending rates range from
9.5 percent for seasonal agricultural loans to 11 percent paid by most
borrowers; on deposits they pay from 4.5 to 9 percent. Most non-bank financial
institutions charge 7-9 percent for loans.
Bank Group Experience
27.       The Bank Group's only involvement in Zambia's manufacturing sector
has been through a November 1975 Bank loan (US$15 million) to DBZ and IFC
investment of about US$40 million equivalent (para. 11). The loan to DBZ was
used to finance 40 projects - 21 in manufacturing, 15 in agriculture, and 4 in
transport, distribution, and tourism. The loan took much longer to commit
than anticipated at appraisal; DBZ approvals grew at only 6 percent a year,
rather than the 25 percent forecast, largely because of Zambia's economic
slowdown. It has now been almost entirely committed and about two-thirds
disbursed. The 40 projects financed under the Bank loan had a total invest-
ment cost of US$33 million, and created about 1,200 jobs at an average cost of
US$28,500 which compares favorably with an overall average of US$28,600 for
other development finance companies in Eastern Africa.
28.       In August 1978, after several DBZ clients found themselves unable
to import raw materials and spares because of tightened Bank of Zambia foreign
exchange allocations, the Bank agreed to allow DBZ to utilize part of the
credit line for working capital loans to enable clients to increase their
capacity utilization to 10 percent above cash break-even. About US$2 million
has been lent for this purpose.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed US$15 million loan would be onlent by DBZ for produc-
tive new and expansion projects In Zambia's industrial, agro-industrial and
agricultural sectors. The loan would provide 45 percent of DBZ' anticipated
foreign exchange requirements of US$33.4 million, and 28 percent of projected
commitments of US$53 million through March, 1982.



30.       The project was Identified by a Bank team that visited Zambia in
May 1978 and prepared by DBZ staff. Preparation was completed In August
1979, and the project was appraised In November the same year. Negotiat'Lons
were held In Washington in September 1980; the Zambian delegation was led by
Mr. L. M. Nyambe, Managing Director of DBZ. Annex III lists supplementary
project data.
The Development Bank of Zambia
31.       The Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) was established as a statutory
corporation by Act of Parliament in December 1972, and began operatlons in
January 1974. It provides medium- and long-term loans and equity financing
for projects in industry, agro-industry, engineering, transport, power,
tourism, mining and large-scale agrlculture, and is authorized to provide
technical assistance and advisory services and administer special funds. DBZ
has become the major source of term financing in Zambia and, despite the
country's economic difficulties, remalns a sound institution. Significant
Government partlcipation in its share capital has not prevented DBZ from
maintaining a large degree of autonomy In its investment and management
decisions.
32.       DBZ has an authorized share capital of US$25 million.  Thirty percent
of Its shares (Class A) are reserved for the Government and Its agencies, 20
percent (Class B) for private local and international institutions, and there
are no ownership limitations on the remaining (Class C) shares, which are
preferential, non-voting and bear interest. As of March 31, 1980, its
paid-in share capital was US$19.3 million.
33.       DBZ Is run a by a ten-member Board, including Its Managing Dlrector.
The Government appoints six Directors, including the Chairman; four members
are appointed by the Class B shareholders. 1/ The Board meets four times a
year and approves all loans and investments. The Institutlon has competent
leadership; Its Managing Dlrector, a former Managlng Director of the Zambia
National Commercial Bank who has also held a Management position in the
Bank of Zambia, joined as General Manager In 1977; and has held his present
position since mid-1978. Most managerial positions are held by Zambians.
34.       DBZ is organized Into eight departments:  planning and promotion,
industrial projects, agricultural projects, project supervision, finance,
legal, personnel, and administration. It has a staff of 95, eight managers,
29 other professionals, and 58 support staff. Two managers and seven profes-
sionals are expatriates. DBZ plans to recrult three Zambian professionals,
1/   Including a representative, In alternate years, of IFC or the African
Development Bank.



- 9 -
and seven expatriate professionals have been recruited under bilateral assist-
ance. These are a chief economist, a training coordinator, a senior agricul-
tural economist, a finance manager, a senior engineer and two senior projects
officers. The Zambian staff is quite competent, but generally inexperienced,
and one of the main tasks of the training coordinator will be to design and
implement a comprehensive training program.
35.       While DBZ staffing had been constrained by a requirement that its
salary structure conform to Zambian regulations limiting the salaries of
parastatal employees to levels well below those of competing financial sector
organizations, DBZ' Board has recently obtained Government permission to raise
its pay levels 20 to 50 percent.
36.       DBZ' operating policies, set out In the Development Bank of Zambia
Act of 1972, and In a Policy Statement adopted in 1975 (after consultation
with the Bank), are satisfactory, subject to the following amendments to the
Policy Statement which were agreed during negotiations:
(i) DBZ will not normally finance more than 75 percent of any
single project's total capital costs, including permanent
working capital; exceptions to this rule will be determined
by the particular nature and merits of a project;
(ii) in order to restrain DBZ from engaging in activities other-
wise outside the scope of its Policy Statement, DBZ would
establish criteria satisfactory to the Bank for establishing
new special funds (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04).
37.       DBZ' interest rates range from 11.5 percent for some agricultural
projects to 12.5 percent; it also charges annual commitment fees on undis-
bursed balances of three percent on foreign exchange loans and two percent for
those made in kwacha. Foreign exchange risks are passed on to sub-borrowers.
Given the Bank's inflation projections, this rate is expected to be signifi-
cantly positive and to provide DBZ with adequate margins. The real interest
rate for local currency lending Is, however, more difficult to project, given
uncertainties as to local inflation. Agreement was reached during negotia-
tions that DBZ will charge a minimum 12 percent interest on sub-loans under
the project and would review Its rates annually with a view towards keeping
them positive in real terms (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.06).
38.       While DBZ' appraisal techniques have evolved into a generally
adequate system as its staff capabilities improved, some appraisals have
lacked economic rate of return calculations, and agreement was reached at
negotiations that these calculations would in future be carried out in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank for all projects involving Investments of more
than K 200,000 (US$250,000).  (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.05).



- 10 -
39.       In its early years, DBZ concentrated more on appraisal than supervi-
sion; a separate Supervision Department was, however, created in 1978 with a
view to formalizing supervision procedures; a comprehensive supervision
plan and an in-house manual that would be implemented by February 1981 has
been drawn up in consultation with the Bank. (Draft Loan Agreement, Section
3.03). DBZ' procurement and disbursement procedures are adequate and appro-
priate (para 51).
40.       DBZ has set out its lending strategy in a statement based largely on
Zambia's Third National Development Plan. Under the statement, DBZ will
concentrate on the key sectors of agriculture and agro-industry, transport,
engineering and industry with emphasis on labor-intensive appropriate
technologies, the use of local raw materials, and linkages between mining,
manufacturing and agriculture. DBZ will also establish a special unit
to identify, appraise and monitor loans to small scale enterprises.
Past Performance
41.       DBZ has performed adequately since it began operations in 1974.  As
of March 31, 1980, it had approved 139 loans for K 57 million (US$71.2 million).
Its operations have been sound, with profits rising from K 70,000 (US$87,500),
1.0 percent of average total assets in 1975 to K 1.37 million (US$1.7 million),
or 5.5 percent in 1980. However, return on equity (7.5 percent) was low
compared to local inflation. This was due largely to DBZ' low leverage and
spread of 3 percent on the cost of its borrowings. DBZ is considering paying
its first dividend in 1981.
42.       DBZ' growth has not, however, been as rapid as forecast during
appraisal of the first project (para. 27), largely because of Zambia's economic
and financial crises, and disbursements have been slowed by delays in project
implementation. The instititon has, however, used its newly established legal
department to assure more timely co-lateral arrangements; it also requires
that clients deposit their contributions in blocked accounts and get commer-
cial bank assurances of adequate working capital. These measures have greatly
improved disbursements, which increased by 76 percent in the last half of
1979, and DBZ expects 80 percent of outstanding commitments to be disbursed by
November, 1980.
43.       A little over half of DBZ' lending has so far benefitted private
sector enterprises, with the rest being coursed to INDECO subsidiaries. In
common with most new economic activity in Zambia, DBZ' financing has been
highly concentrated along the line-of-rail in the Copperbelt, Lusaka, and
Central Provinces. 52 of its 139 loans were for new projects, the balance was
lent for expansion and modernization. Economic rates of return have ranged
from an estimated 6 percent on an INDECO project to 50 percent on several
projects, averaging a high 28 percent (27 percent for projects financed from
the first Bank credit line). DBZ' equity investments, (about US$550,000)
represent only 2 percent of its portfolio; the prospects for rapid dividends
are considered low, but the amount involved is too small to affect overall
profitability.

Prospects
44.       DBZ' pipeline of future projects is in line with Its strategy;
the 49 projects in it include 25 in manufacturing, 19 in agriculture, 2
each in tourism, and transport and a public utilities project. Their total
investment cost Is estimated at K 65 million (US$81 million), including K 29
million (US$36 million) in foreign exchange. DBZ expects to provide total
financing of K 33 million (US$41 million) of total project costs, of which K
21 million (US$26 million) or 64 percent would be foreign exchange. This implies
loan approvals rising from about US$28 million in 1980 to US$47 million in
1984, an average annual growth of 20 percent In current terms.
45.       From March 31, 1980 to March 31, 1982, when the loan is expected
to be fully committed, DBZ' requirements are estimated at K 51.9 million
(US$64.9 million), of which K 26.7 million (US$33.4 million) would be foreign
exchange. In addition to the proceeds of the proposed loan, DBZ has obtained
funding, commitments from external sources for these needs, as well as from
local sources for local currency requirements. 1/
46.       DBZ' financial performance through 1984 is expected to be satis-
factory, based on an expanding loan portfollo. Financial expenses are
expected to rise from 3.4 to 6.7 percent of average total assets as borrowing
Increases, but administrative expenses are expected to drop from 3.6 to 1.5
percent of average assets. Profits are, thus, predicted to rise from K 1.37
million (US$1.7 million) or 7.5 percent of average equity in 1980 to K 2.6
million (US$3.2 million) or 14.6 percent of average equity In 1984, given
expected improvements in disbursements and a higher debt/equity leverage.
47.       DBZ' long-term debt/equity ratio was a low 0.8:1 In 1979, and would
rise to only 2.7:1 in 1984, well below the 4:1 ratio agreed under the first
project, and to be maintained under the proposed project (Draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.06). As DBZ maintains a high security coverage (minimum 125 percent)
on loans, it has no provisions against specific doubtful debts, but does have
a general provision for losses.
Proiect Description
48.       The proposed US$15 million line of credit would be used to finance
industrial, agro-industrial, and agricultural projects, representing about
22 percent of the DFC's projected commitments through the end of Its 1982
fiscal year, and about 45 percent of its foreign exchange needs during
this period.
1/   Other foreign exchange sources include DEG (US$3.2 million), the African
Development Bank (US$10.25 million), and EIB (US$3.8 million). Local
resources would come from internal cash generation (US$11.25 million),
and loans from Zambia's National Provident Fund and State Insurance
Corporation and Barclays Bank totalling US$20.3 million.



- 12 -
49.       The proposed line of credit would carry the following terms
and conditions:
(a) Onlending Rate and Exchange Risk. DBZ would onlend at a minimum
rate of 12 percent and review Its interest structure annually
with a view towards maintalnlng real positive interest rates
(Draft Loan Agreement, Sectlon 3.06);
(b) Free Limit. The free limit under the first line of credit
to DBZ was US$250,000 (aggregate US$3 milllon). In recognition
of the quality of DBZ' appralsals, the free limit will be
ralsed to US$400,000 and the aggregate to US$5 million. This
will still permit the Bank to review about 60 percent of
projects financed by the Bank loan, which is considered adequate.
(Draft Loan Agreement, Sections 2.02(b));
(c) Amortization Schedule. The proposed loan to DBZ would
have a flexible amortization schedule conforming to the
aggregate amortization schedule of DBZ sub-loans, none
of which should, in principle, exceed of 15 years (Draft
Loan Agreement, Section 2.08);
(d) Commitment Fees. As a change from the first IBRD loan
for which DBZ had concessionary treatment, standard
commitment fees would be charged on the US$15 million
Bank loan (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 2.05).
Project Implementation
50.       Reporting Requirements.  DBZ would continue to submit quarterly
reports including financial statements, resource position, statement of
arrears and notes on sub-projects encountering serious operational difficul-
ties. DBZ will also continue to submit audited annual accounts prepared by
qualified accountants along with DBZ' annual reports (Draft Loan Agreement,
Section 4.02), and would prepare a Project Completion Report (Draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.09 (b)).
51.       Procurement.  Procurement for the sub-projects to be financed under
the loan will be in accordance with DBZ' procurement procedures which are
considered appropriate. Under these procedures DBZ' private enterprise
clients are required to obtain quotations from at least three suppliers among
whom one Is selected in consultation with DBZ. DBZ' public enterprise clients
broadly follow the Government Central Tender and Supply Board's procurement
procedures and these normally satisfy DBZ' requirements. For supplies of
goods not exceeding US$1.25 million, only local bldding, widely advertised in
the local press, is required. For procurements above US$1.25 million, however,
public enterprises normally advertise invitations to bid in the Zambian press
and among various embassies/trade missions resident In Zambia. In all cases,
a minimum of three quotations is required for each procurement. For the
INDECO group of companLes, the ultlmate supplier is selected by a centralized
procurement committee; for other public enterprises, suppliers are selected by
individual enterprises.



- 13 -
52.       Disbursements.  The proceeds of the proposed line of credit would be
disbursed on DBZ sub-loans as follows (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 2.02):
(a) 100 percent of the c.l.f. cost of goods or services imported
Into Zambia;
(b) 75 percent of the cost of locally-procured goods previously
Imported Into Zambia through normal trade channels;
(c) 60 percent of the local cost of equipment produced in
Zambia substantially from imported components or raw materials;
(d) 40 percent of the local cost of construction works included
in sub-projects.
53.       The loan is expected to be fully committed by March 31, 1982 and
to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1987.
Benefits and Risks
54.       By providing foreign exchange resources that are presently In
critically short supply in Zambia, the project will assist In maintaining and
expanding productive capacity in manufacturing, agro-industry and agriculture.
Of particular importance will be the development of agricultural and agro-
industrial firms that would support the national effort towards achieving
self-sufficiency in food production. The project will contribute to total
investments in excess of US$48 million and create about 1,800 new jobs at an
estimated average cost of about US$27,000 per job which Is lower than the
average cost per job under the first loan; this results from DBZ Increasing
activity In labor-intensive enterprises. The project wlll also strengthen DBZ
as an institution.
55.       The risks associated with the projects are mainly related to the
general economic conditions of the country. A deepening of the economic
crisis could result into a considerable slowdown of investment that could,
In turn, delay commitments and disbursements under the loan.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Development Bank of Zambia and
the Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Government of Zambia and
the Bank and Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed to the
Executive Directors.
57.       Special conditions of the loan are listed in Annex III of this report.
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C. BANK PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 900-ZA      Third Education Project:  US$33.0 million Loan of
June 6, 1973; Effectiveness Date: August 9. 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
Project is basically completed, except for certain university
components and technical assistance which have been deleted at Government's
request. Project completion mission which recently vislted Zambia, is
preparing its report. The Closing Date has been postponed to March 31, 1983
to enable borrower to utilize savings to finance construction of twelve
primary schools orlginally Included under the Lusaka Squatter Upgrading and
Sites and Services Project and a maintenance program for secondary schools.
Loan No. 919-ZA      Kafue Hydroelectric Project (Stage II):  US$115.0 million
Loan of July 16, 1973; Effectiveness Date: January 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The two 150-MW units at the Kafue Gorge power station were com-
missioned in mid-1977. Constructlon of the main dam has been completed and
the reservoir filled. The project Is expected to be completed within the
appraisal cost estimates. The Zambia Electrlcity Supply Corporatlon's (ZESCO)
financial performance has not heen satisfactory; tariffs were however Increased
20 percent for domestic users and 30 percent for Industrial users during
1979. Largely because of the economic recession affecting Zambia, ZESCO
has been experiencing a shortage of spare parts and the departure of some
expatriate staff. The closing date has recently been extended to December 31,
1982 to carry out additional civil works to control artesianal pressures.
Loan No. 1356-ZA    Fourth Education Project:  US$13.3 million Loan of
January 17, 1977; Effectiveness Date: March 8, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983.
The project is progressing satisfactorily despite difficulties in
procurement of materials. A11 contracts for the Farmer Training Centers have
been awarded and the technical assistance team provided by the Dutch Govern-
ment for the preparation of teaching programs is making very good progress.
Despite the difficult economic situation, the Government Is expected to
raise full counterpart funds in 1980 to maintain the construction program
at its present rate of implementation. Funds have not been allocated for
the survey of the constructlon industry Included In the project. The contract
for the Evelyn Hone College Hostels is expected to be completed in December
1980.
Loan No. 1057-ZA    Lusaka Squatter Upgrading and Sites and Services Project:
US$20.0 million Loan of December 6, 1974; Effectiveness
Date: April 1, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is nearing completion. In spite of serious economic
problems In the country and technical and cllmatic difficulties Impinging

ANNEX II
on the project itself, the project's primary objective of providing services
and improving living conditions in Lusaka's squatter compounds has been
achieved. The catalytic effect on the continuing development of these
communities by the residents themselves has and is being demonstrated. The
housing stock of the city has been substantially increased through the new
sites and services areas. Technical problems hindering the completion of
some of these sites have been solved and the remaining serviced plots are
expected to be allocated in the next few months. Most project works are
expected to be completed by the end of 1980 and the balance, mostly community
facilities, by March 1981. Cost recovery remains a serious problem.
However, progress In carrying out the action program agreed In November 1979
is good. This program is putting into place the administrative and legal
framework that is a prerequisite for improved collections.
Loan No. 1131-ZA    Telecommunications Project:  US$32.0 million Loan of
June 24, 1975; Effectiveness Date: December 10, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Project procurement and execution are approximately two and
one-half years behind schedule, largely because of government budgetary
constraints; and completion is expected in June 1983. An Increase in
telecommunications tariffs averaging 75 percent was approved and implemented
by Government as from August 1, 1979, and arrears and delays in billing are
being reduced. As from January 1979, Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(PTC) came under the supervisory control of Zambia Industrial and Mining
Corporation (ZIMCO). Corresponding amendments to the PTC act to provide for
this change are being worked out.
Loan No. 1210-ZA    Development Bank of Zambia:  US$15.0 million Loan of
February 18, 1976; Effectiveness Date: April 23, 1976;
Closing Date: September 30, 1981.
The loan has been almost entirely committed for a number of projects
in various industries such as chemicals, textiles, packaging, agriculture and
food processing. Disbursements now amount to about two-thirds of the loan.
Loan No. 1566-ZA   Third Highway Project:  US$22.5 million (US$11.25 million
and                 Loan and US$11.25 million Credit) of June 27, 1978;
Credit 798-ZA       Effectiveness Date:  November 26, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
Due to delays in loan and credit effectiveness, project implementation
is about one year behind schedule. Some progress has recently been achieved
in the recruitment of technical assistance personnel.
Loan No. 1424-ZA    Second Industrial Forestry Project:  US$16.8 million
Loan of May 12, 1977; Effectiveness Date: November 15,
1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
Project implementation continues to be satisfactory despite some
problems with staffing, road construction and staff housing. Industrial
Plantations Division's (IPD) incorporation, which should have been completed
by December 31, 1978, has not yet been effected. Planting targets are being
met very well.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 863-ZA   Coffee Production Project:  US$6 million Credit of
December 14, 1978; Effectiveness Date: July 26, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
Although the Estate Components of the project was faced wlth start-
up problems, good progress has been made slnce the credit became effective.
Expatriate and counterpart staffing are satisfactory and the planting and
rehabilitation program for coffee and maize are on schedule. Disbursements
are ahead of schedule. Implementation under the Smallholder component has
been slow and haphazard and lacked adequate guidance and supervision. The
plan for smallholder coffee development in Northwestern Province is still not
completed. Now that most of the national and international field staff are at
post, better coordination between staff and agencies involved in the various
project components is expected.
Credit No. 873-ZA   Technical Assistance Prolect:  US$5 million Credit of
December 21, 1978; Effectiveness Date: July 12, 1979;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1984.
The project would assist the Government with (a) foreign currency
financing for expatriate planners and project analysts for attachment to the
National Planning Commission and other ministries; (b) about 35 man-years of
consultant services for feasibility studies, design work, implementation and
other project-related activities; and (c) training of local staff, services,
equipment, vehicles, supplies and operating costs. To date one planning
expert has been hired under the Credit, another is under consideration and
several feasibility studies to be undertaken by consultants are in the advanced
stages of approval for financing under the credit.
Loan No. 1790-ZA    Third Railway Project:  US$25 million Loan and
Credit No. 973-ZA   US$15 million Credit of June 16, 1980:  Effectiveness
Date: Scheduled for December 31, 1980;
Closing Date: September 30, 1984.
The project's main components include the renewal and improvement
of about 112 kilometers of Zambia Railways track; installation of a new
centralized traffic control signalling system and extension of the railways
telecommunicatlons system; acquisition of about 10 diesel locomotives and
repair of about 4 old ones; acquisition of about 915 wagons and 2 breakdown
cranes; and technical advisory services, studies and training. The project is
co-financed by the EEC (through a Special Action credit), AfDB, Japan, OPEC
Special Fund, KfW, SIDA and ODA (UK). Loan and credit effectiveness,
originally scheduled for October 13, 1980, has been postponed to December 31,
1980 to allow more time for the Government and Zambia Railways to meet the
outstanding conditions of effectiveness, namely, execution of the Subsidary
Loan Agreement and the submission of the Legal Opinion.

D. IFC PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Zambia Bata Shoe Company Ltd. - 216-ZA - Shoes and Tannery
General import restrictions in Zambia have prevented the company
from Importing for resale all the finished footwear it required and the raw
materials It needed for Its production operations. However, the decline In
production was more than offset by Increases in the average selling price.
As expected IFC's loan was fully repaid in June 1979. Profits doubled In
the year ending December 31, 1978 to US$2.5 million giving a return on equity
of 47 percent and enabling the company to pay dividends of US$0.46 per share.
Century Packages Limited - 207-ZA - Packaging
The plant was completed in 1977 about a year later than originally
anticipated, with an Increase In project cost of US$530,000 which is equivalent
to 26 percent of total costs. The main reasons for the increased project
cost are the mid-1976 devaluation of the Kwacha, Increased costs of civil
works and Increased preproduction expenses because of the delay in project
start-up. The increased project cost has been met largely through provision
of additional financing acquired under the Project Funds Agreement.
Since operations commenced, the company has been affected seriously
by Zambian price control policies, which have undermined the market for waxed
wrappers, representing 45 percent of sales. To some extent this has been
offset by growth in the polyethylene wrapper market. Profits for 1979, the
second year of full operation, were US$129,000 (equivalent to 16.0 percent of
equity).
Development Bank of Zambia (DBZ) - 324-ZA - Development Banking
DBZ' principal objective is to provide medium- and long-term loans
and equity financing for productive enterprises in manufacturing, agriculture
and tourism. In the fall of 1977 the Government Instituted the new Investment
Act designed to offer greater incentives to private enterprise and to attract
more foreign Investment. But, owing to the current economic problems in
Zambia, DBZ' outstanding portfolio as of March 31, 1979 (US$47.4 million) was
substantially below the level anticipated in the appraisal report of October
1975 (US$98 million). However, total approvals Increased from US$13.7 million
in FY78 to US$14.6 million in FY79, or by about 6.5 percent. Profits increased
by 10 percent to US$682,000 which represents a 5.2 percent return on equity.
Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd. (NCCM) - Cobalt Production
The IFC loan of US$28 million (of which not more than US$20 million
would be for IFC's account) to NCCM for a cobalt production project was
approved on September 4, 1979. US$6.5 million has been disbursed.
