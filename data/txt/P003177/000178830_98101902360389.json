The proposed line of credit would carry the following\n            terms and conditions: (a) Onlending rate and exchange risk:\n            DBZ would onlend at a minimum rate of 12 percent and review\n            its interest structure annually with a view towards\n            maintaining real positive interest rates; (b) Free limit:\n            the free limit under the first line of credit to DBZ was\n            US$250,000 (aggregate US$3 million). In recognition of the\n            quality of DBZ' appraisals, the free limit will be\n            raised to US$400,000 and the aggregate to US$5 million. This\n            will still permit the Bank to review about 60 percent of\n            projects financed by the Bank loan, which is considered\n            adequate; (c) Amortization schedule: the proposed loan to\n            DBZ would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming\n            to the aggregate amortization schedule of DBZ sub-loans,\n            none of which should, in principle, exceed 15 years; (d)\n            Commitment fees: as a change from the first IBRD loan for\n            which DBZ had concessionary treatment, standard commitment\n            fees would be charged on the US$15 million Bank loan."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
