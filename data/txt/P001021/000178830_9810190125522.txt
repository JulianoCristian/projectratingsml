PINEAPPLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Background
i.        Guinea has asked IDA to help finance (a) measures to improve its
flagging fresh pineapple export industry and (b) studies of the country's
rice growing and livestock production sectors. The project appraised in
this report was prepared by Government and the Bank's Regional Mission to
Western Africa (RMWA), the former employing Energoprojekt (Yugoslavia) as
consultants for the irrigation engineering and economic aspects of the pro-
ject, and RMWA employing Institut Francais de Recherches Fruitieres Outre-
Mer (IFAC) as consultants for pineapple cultivation and export matters.
The project was appraised in October 1974.
ii.       Up-to-date information on agricultural production in Guinea is
difficult to obtain and in many cases probably is non-existent. However,
analyses of the last twenty years' import and export data relating to agri-
cultural commodities indicate that the agriculture sector is stagnating.
Performance in the agriculture sector reflects economic performance overall,
two results of which are severe balance of payments difficulties leading to
drastic limitations on imports. Shortages of imports and problems in allo-
cating priorities for them have been consistent and major limiting factors
to Guinea's economic development. Since Independence in 1958 it appears
that GNP increased by about 2.5% annually, somewhat less than population
growth, and thus that real per capita incomes declined slightly. In 1972
GNP was estimated at about US$450 million and per capita income at US$90.
iii.      Guinea, with a broad range of eco-climatic zones, from semi-arid
to tropical rain forest, has the potential for a well-diversified agricul-
ture, but so far this has been little exploited. The basic problem of the
rural sector appears to be the lack of real incentives for producers. This
is due to Government policies that have tended to maintain producer prices
at artificially low levels, and at the same time to restrict the availabil-
ity of consumer goods in rural areas. Farmers receive low prices and have
few consumer goods to buy with the little surplus cash they have.  However,
there is a broad range of additional secondary constraints that range from
the specific, such as poor transportation facilities, lack of foreign ex-
change for crucially needed imports and low levels of technical know-how,
to the general, such as defects in the institutions serving the sector,
especially research, extension, input supply, credit and marketing.



- ii -
iv.       The project proposed in this report would be a first step in
vitalizing the agriculture sector. Its pineapple component would demon-
strate the advantages of an integrated approach towards development of a
specific agricultural commodity over the diffused and multi-agency system
operating currently. The studies of the rice and livestock sub-sectors
should result in the preparation of carefully designed development programs
needed to permit exploitation of these two important sub-sectors, and lead
to a reduction in the cost of food imports and, in the case of livestock,
development of an as yet unexploited export asset.
v.        Guinea is unique among the countries of sub-Saharan Africa in
being the first to develop a sophisticated tropical fruit growing and ex-
porting industry. Initially the industry was based on bananas, largely
produced on expatriate-owned plantations, and by 1955 banana exports were
about 100,000 tons annually, valued at US$4 million. However, since the
1960's the banana trade has been in steady decline with producers caught
in a web of increasing costs, problems with labor, pest and disease attack,
and difficulty in obtaining the large volume and variety of imports needed
for banana production. Only about 600 tons were exported in 1973. The
decline of the banana helped the fresh pineapple exporting industry since
many growers switched to pineapples under the stimuli of favorable prices
paid by the USSR and East European countries, and the advantage of a crop
less susceptible to pests and diseases and requiring less labor. Exports
of fresh pineapples grew from 50 tons in 1957 to 7,000 tons in 1966 and
to 11,000 tons in 1972 valued at about US$2.5 million at world market
values for fresh pineapples. In 1973 exports dropped to 7,000 tons and
it appears that they were even lower in the 1974/75 crop season. The reasons
for this latter decline are many but include the inability of Government
agencies to effectively provide the package of research, extension, input
supply, and transportation services needed by growers.
The Project
Vi.       The pineapple component of the project would consist of:
a.   establishing an irrigated nucleus pineapple estate
of sufficient size to cultivate 420 ha of
pineapples annually;
b.   providing pineapple growers in the Kindia
area, all of whom are organized in coopera-
tives, with the package of support services
required to permit them to maximize their
productivity;
c.   strengthening the State fruit exporting company's
(Fruitex) road-transportation and fruit handling
capacity through the provision of new vehicles
and spare parts, the construction and equipping of
a vehicle workshop, and providing specialized
equipment to facilitate the loading of pineapples
at the Port of Conakry;



- iii -
d.   conducting trials and studies of internal and
external transport arrangements for fresh pine-
apples, including trial shipments of pineapples
to new markets, especially to Western European
countries;
e   providing internationally recruited specialists
to initially operate the nucleus plantation,
develop the irrigation system, provide services
to outgrowers, and to establish and run the
Fruitex workshop until such time as Guineans have
been trained under the project to assume these
functions;
f   providing Guineans with overseas training fellowships
in irrigation, pineapple marketing, and vehicle
maintenance; and
g   carrying out field trials with pineapples in which
recent experience gained abroad would be tested
under Guinean conditions.
A new State-owned company, Entreprise Nationale Agricole de Daboya (ENAD),
has been established to carry out parts (a) and (b) of the project. Fruitex
would be responsible for parts (c) and (d).
vii.      The project would employ the well-tested and proven system of
nucleus estate and associated outgrowers. The nucleus estate would develop
basic cultivation techniques, engage in applied research, train personnel,
serve as a demonstration to outgrowers, and generally act as the base
from which the broad range of support services needed by outgrowers would
be provided. Very importantly the nucleus estate would guarantee a basic
supply of high quality fruit for export such a basic supply being a
sine qua non for the efficient operation of any fruit exporting industry.
The pineapple nucleus estate and its associated outgrowers would be located
near the town of Kindia in the eastern part of Lower Guinea; Kindia is a
trading center of some 35,000 people and administrative headquarters of
the region.
viii.     The technical assistance component concerning the rice and live-
stock elements of the project would be handled by the Ministry of Rural
Development and consist of:
a.   employing qualified consultants to (i) make an
analysis of the rice growing prospects of Guinea,
and recommend appropriate policies for stimu-
lating rice production and (ii) following the
review of this analysis and recommendations by
Government, the preparation of a rice develop-
ment program and specific investment projects



- iv-
in rice production suitable for external, and
particularly for World Bank Group financing;
and
b.   employing qualified consultants to examine the
livestock potential of Guinea with the same
objectives as in (a) above.
Management
ix.       ENAD and Fruitex are "Entreprise Nationale", they have no Boards
of Directors but are managed by Directors, assisted by Deputy Directors and
Chief Accountants. ENAD is under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Fruitex under that of the Ministry of External Trade. The statutes of
the two enterprises permit them to undertake project responsibilities. To
carry out the project both ENAD and Fruitex would need some foreign management
assistance in the early years of prcject implementation, as well as technical
assistance from a qualified pineapple research organization. The Manager
of the nucleus estate would be recruited internationally as would be the
Estate Engineer, a Research/Extension Officer, who would be responsible
for research work on the estate and for extension work with outgrowers
and the Workshop Manager who would take over the workshop of the Fruitex Transport
Service for a period of three years. The project would provide for the train-
ing of Guinean staff to fill all the foregoing positions within the IDA
credit disbursement period. As it is essential for the success of the
project to use up-to-date technology, an agreement would be entered into
between ENAD and a qualified pineapple research institution under which
the latter would provide a broad range of technical assistance, including
advisory visits and foliar analysis services.
Costs and Financing
x.        Expected project costs are Syl 175 million (US$8.5 million) of
which the foreign exchange component would be Syl 116 million (US$5.7
million) or 66% of project costs. Base cost estimates are at late 1974
prices, and since Government has stated that it would waive any such
taxes, are free of import taxes and duties as well as of any other direct
taxes other than income taxes on project staff which would be small.
Physical contingencies of 10% have been applied to all base costs. Esti-
mated price increases amount to about 27% of base cost estimates plus
physical contingencies. An IDA credit of US$7 million on standard terms
is proposed. This would be equivalent to 82% of project costs and would
cover all foreign exchange costs, US$5.7 million, plus 45% of local cur-
rency costs, Syl 26 million. The remainder of expected project costs
would be met by outgrowers who would be required to meet 20% of incremental
on-farm costs from their own resources, Syl 3.7 million (2%); and by Gov-
ernnent, Syl 28 million (16%).
xi.       About US$400,n0o of the IDA credit and Syl 1.6 million of Govern-
ment's contribution would be used by the Ministry of Rural Development for



v 
the technical assistance component of the project. The remainders of the
IDA credit, US$6.6 million, and of the Governnent's contribution, Syl 26.4
million, would be passed on to ENAD and Fruitex. ENAD would receive that
part of the IDA credit to be applied to nucleus estate and outgrower opera-
tions as a loan for 25 years bearing interest of at least 6%, and the re-
mainder of the IDA credit and Government's own contribution as a grant.
Fruitex would receive its funds as a grant.
Procurement
xii.      All contracts over US$50,000 for the procurement of vehicles, farm
and irrigation equipment, electrical and mechanical plant, fertilizers and
other farm inputs, and packing materials (totalling about US$2.8 million)
would be through international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines. Procurement contracts for amounts of less than US$50,000 would
be through competitive bidding advertised locally. Domestically manufactured
goods would be allowed a preference of 15%, or the level of applicable import
duty, whichever is lower when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign
manufacturers. Contracts for the installation of the irrigation system, land
clearing and construction and rehabilitation of buildings (totalling about
US$1.2 million) would be individually too small and too dispersed over time
(5 years) to attract international contractors and would therefore be awarded
on tlhe basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
procedures to be agreed with IDA. Contracts with consultants (about
US$300,000) for the rice and livestock studies, and those required under the
pineapple component of the project for technical assistance, training of
Guinean staff, and investigation of new markets (totalling about US$600,000)
would be obtained under arrangements agreeable to IDA, as would be inter-
nationally recruited staff (about US$900,000). An estimated US$2.8 million would
be_expended on items such as local staff salaries, labor, personnel allowances,
operating costs of vehicles and equipment and other general expenditures that
would not lend themselves to competitive procurement.  The foregoing estimated
amounts are net of physical and price contingencies for which about US$2.5 million
is provided. The difference of US$2.6 million between the sum of the procurement
items and contingencies listed above, US$11.1 million, and total expected project
costs, US$8.5 million, represents nucleus estate operating costs (see Annex 2,
Table 2) in the IDA credit disbursement period which would be covered by self-
generated revenues, but which, for convenience, Government has indicated that it
would procure in the same way as items financed by IDA.
Financial Results
xiii.     Guinea's fiscal system is based on those employed by the centrally
planned countries.  One feature of it is that Government may, and frequently
does set prices for inputs and outputs that are not linked to economic de-
nominators. This is the position in the case of pineapples where the pro-
ducer price is very high when compared with those paid elsewhere. Another
feature of the system is that for public enterprises conventional financial



- vi -
criteria, such as a rate of return, are not considered appropriate and given
the pricing controls employed are frequently irrelevant. The latter would
be so in the case of the nucleus estate. However, through budget control
procedures involving the annual review by Governnent of detailed cost esti-
mates and production targets that have been agreed with IDA during negotia-
tions satisfactory levels of production efficiency and financial discipline
would be ensured. Outgrowers would continue to be motivated by price and
during negotiations assurances were obtained froin Government that it
would guarantee that, inter alia, producer prices would be set that would
provide an incentive for outgrowers to produce pineapples. Credit would be
provided to outgrowers at a minimum interest rae.e of 9% and outgrowers
would be required to pay for the costs of advisory and other support ser-
vices provided to them.
Benefits and Justification
xiv.      The principal direct benefits from investment in the project would
be the pineapples produced on the nucleus estate, and the increment in the
outgrower production of pineapples induced by the project. At maturity of
the project these would total about 10,200 tons annually with a gross value
of about US$3 million at world market prices. It is assumed that all pro-
ject production would be marketed in the USSR and Eastern Europe. The
economic rate of return from the combined directly productive pineapple
components, i.e. the nucleus estate and smallholder programs, is estimated,
at about 18%; at about 15% for the nucleus estate alone; and at about 38%
for the outgrower program alone.
Recommendation
xv.       Given the assurances and conditions set out in Chapter VIII the
project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$7 million.

PINEAPPLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Guinea has asked IDA to help finance (a) mea-
sures to improve its flagging fresh pineapple export industry and (b) stud-
ies of the country's key rice growing and livestock production sectors.
1.02      The project was identified by a joint Headquarters and Regional
Mission to Western Africa (RMWA) team in early 1973 following a request by
Government to finance a major irrigation scheme in the general area of the
proposed pineapple estate. Analysis showed this scheme to be impractical
but indicated that a much smaller operation involving pineapples could be
viable.  The project was prepared by Governnent and RMWA, the former employ-
ing Energoprojekt (Yugoslavia) as consultants for the irrigation engineer-
ing and economic aspects of the project, and RMWA employing Institut
Francais'de Recherches Fruitieres Outre-Mer (IFAC) as consultants for pine-
apple cultivation and export matters. The project was appraised in October
1974 by a mission comprising Messrs. Rowe and Losson (11Q), de Troyer (RMWA)
and Siebert (consultant).
1.03      The proposed operation would be the fourth by the Bank Group in
Guinea. The three earlier operations, all Bank loans, are concerned with
the enclave type Boke bauxite mining venture. The first, of US$1.7 million,
SI-GUI/1966, was an engineering loan; 557-GUI/1968 for US$64.5 million was
for construction; and 766-GUI/1971 for US$9.0 million was to increase pro-
ject production capacity. The venture became operational in October 1973
and generally is progressing satisfactorily.
Il. BACKGROUIID
2.01      General.  Guinea has a surface area of 246,000 km  and a popula-
tion of about 5 million people increasing at a rate of about 2.8% annually.
Lying between 7° and 13°N of the equator the climate is tropical.  Bordered
by Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Mali to the north, Ivory Coast to the east,
and Liberia and Sierra Leone to the south, Guinea has about 300 km of coast
line on the Atlantic Ocean to the west.
2.02      There are four main eco-climatic zones.  Lower Guinea is the humid
low-lying coastal plain and is characterized by fresh water and mangrove
swamps; it contains Conakry, the capital and principal port. Middle Guinea,



-2-
the Fouta Djalon, lies at altitudes of between 600 and 1,500 m and is impor-
tant for food crop and livestock production, it is the center of concentra-
tion of the N'dama trypanosomiasis tolerant breed of cattle; Upper Guinea
lies to the east of Fouta Djalon, is an area of lower altitude and lias a
much drier climate; the Forest Region lies to the south and south east and
is covered by wet tropical forest. Guinea has the potential for a well-
diversified agriculture, but so far this has been little exploited. Popul-
tion pressure is nowhere heavy and is Mighest in Lower Guinea, about 20/kn
and lowest in Upper Guinea, about 7/km .
2.03      At Independence in 1958 Guinea was a largely rural economy with
most people engaged in traditional small-scale agriculture and livestock pro-
duction. The traditional sector produced the country's staple foods, rice,
cassava, maize, sweet potatoes and livestock. The modern sector comprised
bauxite, iron ore and diamond mining and the plantation production of bananas.
Although employing less than 10% of the active population the modern sector
generated more than half of exports and most of public revenues.
2.04      In pursuit of socialist objectives Governnent placed heavy empha-
sis on the development of manufacturing and transport infrastructure after
Independence, and nationalized all activities in the modern sector includ-
ing commerce and trade. The performance of most of the public enterprises
then and subsequently created has been poor, and in the early sixties the
iron ore, and diamond mining industries virtually collapsed with resulting
losses in export earnings that caused severe balance of payments difficul-
ties and cut-backs in imports. Since that time shortages of, and problems
in allocating priorities for imports have remained major limiting factors
to Guinea's economic development. These and other adverse developments
have caused the share of exports in GNP to decline from 20% ta 15% since
Independence. In the same period it appears that in constant prices GINP
increased by about 2.5% annuallv, somewhat less than population growth, and
real per capita incomes declined slightly.  In 1972 GNP was estimated at
about US$450 million and per capita income at US$90.
2.05      There are no signs that the current situation of economic stagna-
tion, balance of payments difficulties, and serious foreign debt problems
will improve in the short run, although new bauxite mining projects now
coming on stream should result in an improved balance of payments position
and increased Government revenues in the longer term. It is clear, however,
that improvement of the living standards of the great bulk of the people
can only be possible through the better exploitation of Guinea's undoubtedly
rich agricultural potential, but this would require major changes in Govern-
ment policies concerning economic development. The need for such change is
illustrated by the situation in the agriculture sector that is described
below.



- 3 -
2.06      The Agriculture Sector.  Up-to-date information on agricultural pro-
duction in Guinea is difficult to obtain and in many cases probably is non-
existent. However, analysis of the last twenty years' import and export data
indicates a situation of stagnation. The value of exports of bananas, pine-
apples, coffee and palm kernels which traditionally have comprised the bulk of
Guinea's agrieultural exports fell from a peak of about US$22 million in 1960
to about only USi11 million in 1970.  Conversely the value of farm originating
imports grew over the same period, food alone from about US$6 million in 1957
to US$14 million in 1973; of this, rice, Guinea's staple food, accounted for
US$0.8 million in 1958, and US$10 million in 1972. Imports of rice are now
about 70,000 tons annually.
2.07      The basic problem of the rural sector appears to be the lack of real
incentives for producers. This is due to Government policies that tend to
maintain producer prices at artificially low levels, and at the same time
restrict the availability of consumer goods in rural areas. Consequently
farmers receive low prices and find few consumer goods to buy with such surplus
cash they may have. Government policies, possibly unwittingly, thus favor
urban dwellers and industrial workers at the expense of those in rural employ-
ment. These policies have led to the development of a "parallel" black market
in all commodities, as well as much smuggling of farm produce, such as coffee,
to neighboring countries in return for consumer goods that are then sold on
the parallel market. Prices of goods on the parallel market offer a commentary
on the value of the Syli; domestically grown commodities are about five times
as expensive as in neighboring countries and imported goods ten times. A
careful comparison of retail prices for 22 main consumer goods, ranging from
basic staple foods such as rice and sugar, to gasoline and clothing indicated
an average of 6-7 times in 1973; on this basis.a Bank economic mission estimated
a shadow rate of exchange of Syli 135-150 per US$ at that time. Taking into
account the devaluation of the dollar in terms of major European currencies
during the past two years, a shadow rate of Syli 120-125 or about six times the
official rate appears reasonable at present. This issue is discussed further
in Annex 14.
2.08      Removal of Government controls on producer prices and the provision
of more consumer goods for rural areas would remove the basic constraint on
the rural sector but it is unlikely that such action alone would result in a
revitalization of the sector. This is because the price issue masks a very
broad range of other constraints ranging from the specific such as poor trans-
portation facilities, lack of foreign exchange for crucially needed imports
and low levels of technical know-how, to the general, such as defects in the
institutions serving the sector, especially research, extension, input supply,
credit and marketing. Improving production and productivity in the rural sector
requires far-reaching change that will be a slow and onerous task due, not
least, to institutional inertia. Under these circumstances the most practical
course of action appears to be to tackle the problems of agricultural development
on a fairly narrow front initially.  For example, implementation of a program
of rice development with the clear objective of increasing production and
reducing foreign exchange outflows rather than broader programs aimed at im-

proving the overall rural situation that would involve revamping a wide range
of Governnental institutions and policies. Well-executed programs with relu
atively narrow objectives would demonstrate the value of a carefully designed
and rational approach to the problens of the sector.
2.09      The project appraised in this report would be a first step in the
direction recommended above. Its pineapple component would be a concentrated
effort at solving a specific problem and the studies of the rice and livestock
sub-sectors should result in the preparation of carefully designed development
programs needed to permit exploitation of these two important sub-sectors and
lead to a reduction in the cost of food imports and, in the case of livestock,
development of an as yet unexploited asset.  It is not possible at this time
to determine whether Government will be prepared to make the basic policy
changes concerning incentives that are needed to make any substantial invest-
ment in rice and livestock viable. However, it is possible that Government's
willingness to make the necessary changes in the pineapple sub-sector (see
Chapter V) is indicative of a preparedness to accept change in the agriculture
sector overall.
2.10      The Fruit Sub-Sector.  Guinea is unique among the countries of sub-
Saharan Africa in being the first to develop a major and sophisticated tropical
fruit 1/ growing and exporting industry. Initially the industry was based on.
bananas, largely produced on expatriate-owned plantations, and by 1955 banana
exports, principally to France, were about 100,000 tons annually and valued at
US$4 million. Technical standards of the industry were high and supported by
the French research institute, Institut Francais de Recherches Fruitieres
Outre-Mer (IFAC) whose headquarters until Independence were in Guinea, see
para 3.04. After Independence, many expatriate planters left the country and
a breakdown occurred in the organization of the industry. Additionally IFAC
withdrew its personnel and there was a switch in the banana trade away from
France to the USSR and eastern Europe. Since that time the banana trade has
been in steady decline with producers caught in a web of increasing costs,
problems with labor, pest and disease attack, and difficulty in obtaining the
large volume and variety of imports needed for banana production. Only about
600 tons were exported in 1973. The decline of the banana helped the fresh
pineapple exporting industry since many growers switched to the crop under
the stimuli of favorable prices paid by the USSR and East European countries,
see Chapter VI, and the advantage of a crop less susceptible to pests and
diseases and requiring less labor. Exports of fresh pineapples grew from 50
tons in 1957 to 7,000 tons in 1966 and to 11,000 tons in 1972 valued at about
US$2.5 million at world values for fresh pineapples. In 1973 exports dropped
to 7,000 tons and in the 1974/75 crop season appear to have been even lower.
The reasons for the latter decline include the inability of Government agencies
to effectively provide the package of research, extension, input supply, and
transportation services needed by growers. The proposed project would correct
this situation.
l/   Citrus fruit, although grown in the tropics, are not classified as
"tropical fruit".



2.11      Guinea exports some small quantities of fresh mangoes.  There are
three fruit canning plants which used about 5,000 tons of fruit, mostly pine-
apples, in 1973. Most of the production of these plants is exported.
2.12      Institutions.  Overall responsibility for the agricultural sector
rests with the Ministry of Rural Development (Ministere du Developpement Rural).
This is a "super" Ministry which controls two other ministries responsible for
subsectors within the agricultural sector. These are: the Ministry of Agri-
culture and Cooperatives (Ministere de l"Agriculture, des Brigades et des
Cooperatives de Production), hereinafter called Ministry of Agriculture; and
the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (Ministere de l'Elevage et de la Peche),
hereinafter called Ministry of Livestock. Responsibility for trade and marketing
rests with the Ministry of Trade. This is also a "super" Ministry, and the
Ministry of External Trade, which controls Fruitex, the State fruit exporting
company, comes under its responsibility.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Pineapple Component
3.01      The pineapple component of the project would consist of:
(a) establishing an irrigated nucleus pineapple estate of sufficient
size to cultivate 420 ha of pineapple annually;
(b) providing pineapple growers in the Kindia area with the package of
support services required to permit them to maximize their produc-
tivity;
(c)  strengthening Fruitex's road transportation and fruit handling capac-
ity through the provision of new vehicles and spare parts, the
construction and equipping of a vehicle workshop, and providing
specialized equipment to facilitate the loading of pineapples at the
Port of Conakry;
(d) conducting trials and studies of internal and external transport
arrangements for fresh pineapples, including trial shipments of
pineapples to new markets, especially to Western European countries.
(e) providing internationally recruited specialists to initially operate
the nucleus plantation, develop the irrigation system, provide
services to outgrowers, and to establish and run the Fruitex workshop
until such time as Guineans have been trained under the project to
assume these functions;



-6-
(f)  provide Guineans with overseas training fellowships in irrigation,
pineapple marketing, and vehicle maintenance; and
(g) carrying out field trials with pineapples in which recent experience
gained abroad would be tested under Guinean conditions.
3.02      Responsibility for the execution of the pineapple component of the
project would rest with two wholly owned State companies:
(a) Entreprise Nationale Agricole de Daboya (ENAD) which has
been established as an independent State enterprise for
purposes of the project under the Ministry of Agriculture;
and
(b) Fruitex, an existing State enterprise responsible for the
marketing and exporting of fruit.
ENAD would establish and manage the nucleus pineapple estate, provide support
services to pineapple outgrowers, and carry out field trials (parts a, b, and
g of the pineapple component of the project). Fruitex would be responsible
for the transport and marketing of pineapples produced under the project; its
transportation and fruit handling capacity would be strengthened and it would
conduct trials and studies on transport arrangements and shipments to new
markets (parts c and d of the pineapple component of the project). Both ENAD
and Fruitex would be provided with internationally recruited specialists and
training fellowships (parts e and f of the pineapple component of the project).
Nucleus Estate and Outgrower Development
3.03      The project would employ the well-tested and proven system of nucleus
estate and associated outgrowers. The nucleus estate would develop basic ctllti-
vation techniques, engage in applied research, train personnel, serve as a
demonstration to outgrowers, and generally act as the base from which the broad
range of support services needed by outgrowers would be provided. Very importantly
the nucleus estate would guarantee a basic supply of high quality fruit for export
such a basic supply being a sine qua non for the efficient operation of any fruit
exporting industry.
3.04      The Project Area  The nucleus estate would be established close to the
village of Daboya about 15 km from the town of Kindia, see Map 11444R attached
to this report. Kindia with some 35,000 people is in the eastern part of Lower
Guinea and is a traditional trading center and administrative headquarters. One
edge of the nucleus estate would border the Kindia-Conakry road, a well-constructed
bitumen surfaced road of 120 km. Kindia also is linked to Conakry by railway but
service is inadequate due to the poor condition of rolling stock. The national
agricultural research and training institute, Institut National de Recherches
Agronomiques de Foulaya (INRAF) is located about 5 km from the nucleus estate
site. INRAF occupies facilities that originally housed IFAC; apart from favor-
able growing conditions one reason for the concentration of fruit growing
activity in the Kindia area has been the location of this institute.



-7-
3.05      The altitude of the area is about 400 m.  Distinct dry and wet sea-
sons occur and rainfall averages 2,200 mm with most falling in the May through
October wet season. Temperature variations are relatively small, a maximum of
4ÇC, and the coolest weather occurs at the height of the rains in July/August.
Humidity is relatively high throughout the year. Relief is quite pronounced
and broken with numerous plateaus intersected by small streams. Some streams
are perennial in most years and could permit a very limited amount of cheap
pump irrigation. The nucleus estate site comprises one of these plateaus.
Soils generally are sandy clays. Rock and laterite outcrops are common and
continguous cultivable areas rarely extend to more than 30 ha. When com-
pletely planted the estate would comprise a series of blocks, or fields of
pineapples interspersed with areas of uncultivated land.
3.06      The long dry season makes heavy yields of pineapples impossible unless
irrigation is used when yields in excess of 60 ton/ha can be achieved by growers
using a full range of inputs. A few growers use small sprinkler irrigation
systems, but to overcome the water problem many plant in swampy areas which
require drainage in the wet season. On some swampy sites up to 50 tons/ha can
be obtained but this technique has the disadvantage that fruit quality can be
low. On the higher land water is the limiting factor, but yields of 30 tons/ha
can be achieved with the use of fertilizers and other farm inputs. Current
average yields in the Kindia area are probably about 20 tons/ha. The area's
sandy soils have a low nutrient content and require heavy fertilization if
high yields are to be obtained, see Annex 1. Pineapple cultivation in the
project area is well developed with growers using, when these are available,
fertilizers, herbicides, insecticidal treatments against mealy bugs, and
ethylene for fruiting control. Because of climatic conditions Kindia produces
a pineapple of very high quality.
3.07      The area under pineapples varies between 600 ha and 900 ha in the
Kindia area of which 200-300 ha are in production in a single year. A pine-
apple crop occupies the ground for nearly three years; the first 18 months are
the growing phase, over the next few months the crop is harvested. Thereafter
the plants are left to produce the suckers that are needed to plant the next
cycle of the crop. Consequently under current Guinean technology for each one
ha of pineapples harvested in one year three ha are occupied by pineapples.
Fruiting is controlled so that export fruit are produced in the five months,
December through April. The area produces 4,000-6,000 tons of pineapples
annually, although production has been closer to the lower figure in recent
years. About 300 growers are involved and individual holdings range between
one and four ha. The owners are constituted in one regional cooperative that
acts as inter-mediary for its members in the supply of credit and inputs and
in the sale of the crop.
3.08      Apart from some production of mangoes, for both domestic and export
markets, other agriculture in the Kindia region is restricted to a very low
standard of cultivation of the staple food crops, rice - both upland and swamp,
cassava, maize, sweet potatoes, coco yams and fonio, a low yielding small
grained and grass-like cereal. There is virtually no use of improved seed and
inputs and yields are low. Cultivation is mainly by hand.



-8
3.09      Land Tenure and Acquisition  An area of about 750 ha has been selected
for the nucleus estate; this should provide the amount of plantable land needed
for the estate in reasonably sized blocks, see para 3.05. The land is now used
for low productivity shifting cultivation. Within the 750 ha there are a number
of traditional dwellings, but the only other "fixed" assets are some very young
plantings of budded mangoes. The land, as throughout Guinea, is owned by the
State which grants rights of usage and which may cancel such rights in the public
interest, as it would do in respect of land needed for the estate. In the
latter case the Governor of Kindia would vest these in ENAD. Problems are not
anticipated since compensation would be paid for "fixed" assets and the people
affected would be those most likely to benefit from the nucleus estate in terms
of employment and the increase in economic activity. Further, actual dispossession
would take place only as the land was needed. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that usership of the estate site would be vested in ENAD.
3.10      Labor Pineapple growers in the project area are finding it increas-
ingly difficult to obtain labor at prices that make pineapple cultivation
profitable. The problem seems one of incentives; food and consumer goods are
difficult to obtain at official prices and on the parallel market are costly
and often impossible to obtain. Alternatives are to work at the mining enclaves
where, although the numbers of job are limited, rations at official prices are
part of the compensation, or to engage in farming from which family food supplies
and some cash are assured. To obtain enough workers, ENAD would have to obtain
and provide to its workers a minimum scale of rations at official prices in
line with those presently provided to salaried workers in towns. As a minimum
this probably would include 6 kg of rice monthly per member of the worker's
family and an allocation of vegetable oil. Some private growers are already
introducing such arrangements. In this report an unskilled labor cost of Syl 63
net per manday is employed, equivalent to Syl 78 including provision for foremen
and social security; this is in line with wages paid by INRAF, the major agri-
cultural employer in the area, and the mine located close to the project area.
During negotiations government indicated that they would ensure that enough
consumer goods would be available at official prices for ENAD's workers.
3.11      Nucleus Estate Development Program  Work on the estate would begin
in late 1975 with the detailed soil and topographic surveys, including aerial
photography at 1:5,000, needed to plan the detail layout of the irrigation
system. An estate development plan would then be prepared which would have
the following objectives:
1976     1977      1978      1979    1980    Total

3.12      Planting Material  The pineapple is vegetatively propagated and the
first 150 ha of the estate would have to be planted with well grown and
disease-free suckers of the Smooth Cayenne variety. Collection of such suck-
ers would commence in early 1976. With 150 ha planted the estate would be
self-supporting in planting material thereafter. The estate would select out-
growers with high quality planting material and provide these with fertilizers
to induce the development of well-grown suckers which would then be purchased
at Syl 0.6/sucker. A description of estate development and operational tech-
niques is at Annex 1. Details of estate investment requirements, e.g. hous-
ing, vehicles, plant, and equipment are at Annex 2.
3.13      Irrigation  Details of the sprinkler irrigation system that would
be installed for the nucleus estate are described in Annex 3. The water
source would be the existing Kale reservoir which with another reservoir at
Banieya on the River Bassa serves a hydroelectric power station at Donkea.
The project's irrigation water requir ments have been calculated by IFAC on
the basis of a requirement Sf 4,000 m /ha over a five-month period, and a max-
imum requirement of 1,000 m /ha/month utilized in four 7-day periods in which
the duration of irrigation would be 16 hrs/day. The system is designed to
these requirements. At maturity the estate would use less than 0.5% of the
water available in the reservoir and for which no other purpose is envisaged
so far. Main features of the sytem would be a pumping station with four ver-
tical electric pumps of 90 kw delivering 75 l/s with a lift of 116 m. The
pumps would be energized by a 6 km line from Donkea. Service from Kale would
be by a 800 m main on the surface serving a network of about 17,000 m of
buried secondaries. The secondaries would service 12 protable laterals each
equipped with 18 sprinklers operating at 2.5 atmospheres. The system would be
developed in three phases; the first phase being temporary and pumping from
the Kouloukoure River.
The phasing would be as follows:
1976              1977             1979

3.14      Outgrowers  ENAD would provide, through the management of the nucleus
estate, the following services to outgrowers: advisory services; input supply-
irrigation equipment, sprayers, tools, fertilizers, and agro-chemicals; and
packing materials. Banque Nationale de Developpement Agricole (BNDA) in
association with ENAD would provide growers with credit as necessary to meet



- 10 -
the costs of farm inputs, irrigation equipment, and packaging materials, see
Chapter V. During the five year project development period, it is expected
that some 340 ha of outgrower pineapples (about 50% of the hectarage now grown
in the Kindia area) would be brought under the project in accordance with a
program approximately as follows:
1977     1978      1979     1980
Ha planted to outgrower pine-
apples (April-December)          40        80       100      120

Of which irrigated                 2.6      7.8      15.6     26
3.15      Outgrowers with access to a perennial stream would be assisted to
install simple sprinkler irrigation systems. A typical unit would be a small
5 cv diesel-powered mobile sprinkler set serving 4 ha.
3.16      Packing and Transport  The nucleus estate would build and operate its
own packing station. Construction would start in PY 2 with a building that
would encompass packing facilities for 1,500 tons annually as well as a garage
and store. Subsequently the building would be converted by stages to handle
up to 4,500, 6,000 and 9,000 tons by building a new garage and store and
installing in the original building additional lines for inspecting, grading
and packing the fruit. The estate would use farnn tractors and trailers to
bring fruit from the field to the packing station.  Outgrowers as now would
pack their fruit at field side and transport to either cooperative centers or
stations set up for the season by the Ministry of External Trade where inspec-
tors inspect the condition and grading of the packed pineapples. Transport
from these "stations de conditionnement" and from the estate packing station
to the port would be by the Fruitex Transport service.
Improvement of Fruitex Services
3.17      Transport  In common with most other Government agencies Fruitex
suffers a chronic shortage of foreign exchange. Thus its vehicle fleet of
22 trucks, see Annex 4, is in generally poor repair with only 15 vehicles in
satisfactory condition. The Fruitex vehicle park and garages are more than
adequate in terms of space, but repair equipment is non-existent apart from
some hand tools and the buildings themselves are collapsing for want of
repair. Under the project 10 x 10-ton trucks would be purchased, 2 in PY 2,
3 in PY 3, and 5 in PY 4, together with spares for existing vehicles and
appropriate workshop equipment and the workshop and garages would be repaired.
A workshop manager would be recruited internationally to supervise the work-
shops and to train Guinean staff, and training overseas would be provided



for two Fruitex mechanics. Appointement of the workshop manager is a condition
of disbursement of the credit against equipment needed for Fruitex. Additionally,
funds would be provided under the project for a review of Fruitex's transport
organization, operating and pricing procedures including recommendations for
their improvement.
3.18      Dock Loading  Pineapple cartons are now loaded at Conakry either in
nets or by a banana conveyor. Provision is made under the project for Fruitex
to purchase additional and specialized equipment for use by ENTRAT, the State
stevedoring company. The specifications for the equipment would be approved
by IDA, and this would be a condition of disbursements of the credit for the
loading equipuent.
3.19      Marketing  To improve Fruitex's marketing operations fellowships
would be provided for four staff members to study pineapple production,
packaging, handling and marketing abroad. Additionally the product would
finance trial shipments of pineapples to West European markets and test the
shipment of pineapples in auto-refrigerated containers. As discussed in
Annex 5 a barrier to Guinea extending its markets is the lack of refrigerated
liner services such as are enjoyed by its competitors.
Pineapple Cultivation Research
3.20      Applied research on pineapple is carried out by INRAF, but Guinea
has fallen far behind its competitors in this respect.  In Annex 6 some of the
priority research needed if Guinea is to be competitive on open markets is
discussed. Of high priority is work on shortening the production cycle,
nutrition and the development of a system of foliar analysis; other key areas
are spacing, fruiting control, measures to reduce nematode infestations and
the physiological disease called yellowing. Under the project funds would be
provided to initiate, commencing in project year 2 (PY2), a program of applied
research on pineapples. The applied components of this research such as
fertilizer use would be carried out on the nucleus estate. At negotiations
assurances were obtained that prior to March 31, 1976 agreement would be
reached wîth IDA on the scope of the overall research program and of the
delineation of research responsibility between INRAF and the nucleus estate
management.
B. Technical Assistance Component for Rice and Livestock
3.21      The technical assistance component of the project would be handled
by the Ministry of Rural Development and consist of:
(a) employing qualified consultants to (i) make an analysis of
rice growing prospects in Guinea, and recommend appropriate
policies for stimulating rice production and (ii) following



- 12 -
the review of this analysis and recommendations by Govern-
ment, the preparation of a rice development program and
specific investment projects in rice production suitable
for external, and particularly for World Bank Group
financing; and
(b) employing qualified consultants to examine the livestock
potential of Guinea with the same objectives as in (a)
above.
An estimated 25 and 22 man months of consultants' time would be required on
the two operations respectively. Provision would be made under the project
to provide the consultants with all needed equipment and support services.
Work on the studies would start in the fall of 1975 and be largely completed
by the end of 1976. During negotiations assurances were obtained from Government
that the consultants employed, and the terms of their employment would be
mutually acceptable to Guinea and IDA. Terms of reference for the studies
are at Annex 7.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
Project costs
4.01      Expected project costs are SYL 175 million (US$8.5 million) of which
the foreign exchange component would be Syl 116 million (US$5.7 million) or
66%' of project costs. Project costs are detailed in Annex 2 and summarized in
the following table;

4.02      Base cost estimates are at late 1974 prices and are free of import
and other direct taxes except income taxes on local staff salaries which are
small. Governnent has stated that it would waive import taxes on goods needed
for the project and confirmation of this was obtained during negotiations.
Physical contingencies of 10% have been applied to all base costs. Estimated
price increases amount to about 27% of base cost estimates plus physical con-
tingencies and have been computed according to the following compound rates:
(a) 16% in 1975, 14% in 1976, 12% in 1977-79 and 10% thereafter for civil
works and buildings: (b) 12%, 10%, 8% and 7% respectively for the same
periods for vehicles, equipment, farm inputs, and expatriate staff and con-
sultant costs; and (c) 5% annually for all local costs.
4.03      Proposed Financing  An IDA credit of US$7 million on standard terms
is proposed. This would be equivalent to 82% of project costs and would cover
all foreign exchange costs, US$5.7 million, plus 45% of local currency costs,
Syl 26 million. The remainder of expected project costs would be met by
private pineapple growers who would be required to meet 20% of incremental
on-farm costs from their own resources, Syl 3.7 million (2%); and by Govern-
ment, Syl 28 million (16%). The proposed financing plan is summarized below:

4.04      The IDA credit would be disbursed over the fiscal period 1975/76-
1979/80 and in this period the nucleus estate development would be virtually
completed. However, additional capital expenditures of Syl 4.3 million would
be needed in 1980/81-1981/82. Government would meet these costs from its own
resources and assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
Working capital would be required by the estate in the IDA credit disbursement
period and at negotiations assurances were obtained from Government that it
would provide ENAD with such working capital.

4.05      Retroactive financing îs required for activities such as aerial
photography of the nucleus estate site, employment of key staff, employment
of consultancy services, and the purchase of fertilizers needed for sucker
production prior to project signature. It was agreed that retroactive
financing would be provided up to a maximum of US$100,000 provided that these
expenditures are not incurred earlier than June 1, 1975.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.06      All contracts over US$50,000 for the procurement of vehicles, farm
and irrigation equipment, electrical and mechanical plant, fertilizers and
other farm inputs, and packing materials (totalling about US$2.8 million) would
be through international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of 15%, or the
level of applicable import duty, whichever is lower when comparing domestic
bids with those of foreign manufacturers. Procurement contracts for amounts
of less than US$50,000 would be through competitive bidding advertised locally
in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to IDA. Contracts for the
installation of the irrigation system, land clearing and construction and re-
habilitation of buildings (totalling about US$1.2 million) would be individually
too small and too dispersed over time (5 years) to attract international con-
tractors and would therefore be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with procedures to be agreed with IDA.
Contracts with consultants (about US$300,000) for the rice and livestock
studies, and those required under the pineapple component of the project for
technical assistance, training of Guinean staff, and investigation of new
markets (totalling about US$600,000) would be obtained under arrangements
agreeable to IDA, as would be internationally recruited staff (about US$900,000).
An estimated US$2.8 million would be expended on items such as local staff
salaries, labor, personnel allowances, operating costs of vehicles and equip-
ment and other general expenditures that would not lend themselves to competi-
tive procurement. The foregoing estimated amounts are net of physical and
price contingencies for which about US$2.5 million is provided. The difference
of US$2.6 million between the sum of the procurement items and contingencies
listed above, US$11.1 million, and total expected project costs, US$8.5 mil-
lion, represents nucleus estate operating costs in the IDA credit disbursement
period which would be covered by self-generated revenues, but which, for con-
venience, Government has indicated that it would procure in the same way as
items financed by IDA. To avoid delay in the implementation of the Project,
tlhe Government requested IDA to make suitable arrangements, on financial
terms and conditions acceptable to Guinea, for the provision of pineapple
experts' services to assist ENAD in the plantation development and for the
recruitment by IDA of ENAD's and FRUITEX's expatriate staff, such experts
and expatriate staff to be made available to Guinea under Secondment Contracts.
4.07     The IDA credit would be disbursed as follows:

certified records of expenditures. For disbursements made against certified
records of expenditures, documentation would not be submitted for review as
a matter of course, but would be retained by ENAD, Fruitex and the Ministry
of Rural Development for scrutiny by Bank supervision missions. Any funds
remaining in the credit account after completion of the project should, if
deemed by IDA at that time to be warranted, be employed in similar activities
in the pineapple sub-sector. A schedule of estimated disbursements is at
Annex 8.

Consultancy Services
4.10      An estimated 47-man months are required for technical assistance in
planning the rice and livestock subsectors, and about 80-man months in
connection with pineapple research, irrigation and the marketing and trans-
port studies.
V.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
5.01      The profitable marketing of a perishable commodity such as pineapples
demands a high degree of integration of production, transport, and marketing
activities. Several Governmental agencies are now involved in producing,
transporting and exporting the crop, and in importing and distributing inputs
to producers. This has led to inefficiencies and export data indicate that
the present system is unable to sustain a healthy fresh pineapple exporting
industry.
5.02      Given the financial magnitude and the technically sophisticated
and commercial nature of the nucleus estate, it is clear that this part of
the project should be managed by an agency with a reasonable degree of autonomy.
In Guinea such autonomy is possessed by an "Entreprise Nationale".
5.03      Entreprise Nationale Agricole de Daboya (ENAD) was created by
Decree No. 200 PRG, dated May 17, 1975, for the purposes of carrying out the
nucleus estate and outgrower components of the project. The Decree enables
ENAD to participate in a wide range of agricultural production including
cereal and livestock production, but its first stage objective, however, is
the creation of an irrigated nucleus estate for the production of fresh
pineapple for export. In addition to operating the pilot estate, ENAD is
empowered to supply pineapple growers in the Kindia area with the production
inputs and other support services that they need; directly import all farm
inputs and other goods necessary for both estate and outgrower operations;
and carry out research into pineapple production. ENAD will be managed by
a Director (%.eneral Manager) who has been appointed, and who will be responsible
to the Ministry of Agriculture. In common with other Entreprises, ENAD has no
Board of Directors.
5.04      Fruitex was established in April 1971 following reorganization of
"Guinexport" the then sole Government export agency. Since its creation
Fruitex has been faced with declining supplies of fruit for export and, because
it has suffered an acute shortage of foreign exchange, has had problems in
carrying out its own limited functions. Fruitex has no Board of Directors
and is managed by a Director, assisted by a Deputy Director and a Chief
Accountant. The enterprise is under the control of the Ministry of External
Trade which itself is responsible to a "super" Ministry of Trade. Staff



- 18 -
total about 90, of whom 28 are at headquarters; the remainder are drivers,
mechanics, and warehouse clerks. Senior staff appear competent and accounts
well maintained. However, as the Entreprise's role in the industry is
largely passive, its performance can give only a partial indication of the
quality of its personnel.
Organization and Staffing
5.05      ENAD  Chart 9841 attached to this report describes the organization
of the new company. The Manager of the nucleus estate would be recruited
internationally as there are no Guineans available who have the necessary
experience and qualifications to manage such a sophisticated operation. The
Manager would have a Guinean deputy who should be able to take over respon-
sibility for the estate by the end of the credit investment period. Other
key staff would be an Estate Engineer responsible for the irrigation system
and plant and equipment, and a Research/Extension Officer who would be re-
sponsible for those aspects of the research program carried out on the estate,
and for extension work with outgrowers. These two positions would be filled
by internationally recruited staff whose deputies would be Guinean. A list
of estate staff is in the cost estimates at Annex 2. In view of the import-
ance of obtaining suitable staff assurances have been obtained during negoti-
ations that the posts of Director ENAD; Estate Manager; Deputy Estate
Manager; Estate Engineer, research/extension officer and Accountant would be
filled with persons with qualifications and experience mutually acceptable
to Government and IDA. A condition of credit effectiveness is appointment
of the Director ENAD and of the Estate Manager.
5.06      Fruitex  No organizational changes are required at this juncture
although following the study of internal and external transport arrangements
discussed in para 5.10, changes might be required. A Workshop Manager would
be recruited internationally for a period of three years. In this time
Fruitex staff would be upgraded through in-service and overseas training.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the qualifications and
experience of the Workshop Manager and his Deputy would be mutually acceptable
to the Government and IDA. A condition of disbursement of credit funds for
equipment needed by Fruitex would be the appointment of the Workshop Manager.
5.07      Since close cooperation between ENAD and Fruitex is essential for
the efficient collection and marketing of project production, assurances
have been obtained that ENAD would enter into a contract with Fruitex satis-
factory to IDA which inter alia would require Fruitex to provide for the
prompt collection, transport and marketing abroad of pineapples produced
by ENAD and its associated outgrowers.
Technical Assistance
5.08      It is essential that Guinea be in receipt of up-to-date technology
concerning the pineapple industry. without this the pineapple component of
the project would not be viable. Consequently, arrangements would be made
with a qualified pineapple research institution which would provide for:



- 19 -
-    starting August 1975, a technician for three months to
organize sucker production by smallholders and generally
to assist in initiating estate development;
-    2 x 2 week visits annually by a senior specialist;
-    4 x 2 week visits annually by other specialists;
-    a foliar analysis and fertilizer recommendation service;
and
-    extracts, articles, and scientific papers relating to
pineapple cultivation and the pineapple trade.
Technical assistance is required for a dual purpose namely to supervise and
assist in estate and outgrower development and to assist in carrying out
the research component of the project. Assurances have been obtained that
ENAD would make arrangement satisfactory to IDA for such technical assistance.
Conclusion of satisfactory arrangements would be a condition of effectiveness.
Assurances have also been obtained that INRAF would enter into arrangements
with ENAD satisfactory to the Association to assist in carrying out the research
component of the project. Arrangements for technical assistance would be made
through and with the assistance of IDA (Para. 4.06).
Financial Structure and Control
5.09      Financial Structure  An "Entreprise Nationale" has no formal capital
structure, and its "equity" is the value of its fixed assets. For example,
Fruitex has an equity stated as Syl 20 million in 1973 of which Syl 15 million
in vehicles; this appears an over-estimation. Fruitex's income stems from
sales of export fruit. Proceeds from these sales are based on prices set
by Government, see para 5.14, and are credited, in Sylis, to Fruitex's account
with Banque Guineenne du Commerce Exterieur (BGCE). Transfers are made from
BGCE to Banque Nationale de Developpement Agricole (BNDA) and this account
is the source of funds for purchasing pineapples and other fruit and for
operating expenses. Prices paid to producers by Fruitex are also set by
the Government. Any losses made by Fruitex are reimbursed by (a) Caisse de
Perequation which itself is funded by import duties on certain, and mainly,
luxury items, and (b) the Ministry of Trade's Fonds d'Intervention de Commerce
(FIC).  Any profits made by Fruitex may be retained, but such sums as are
surplus to agreed budget expenditures, see para 5.11, are paid into FIC. In
short, in the financial sense Fruitex is a self-accounting and revenue earning
Government department whose deficits are met by Government and whose surpluses
are at the call of Government. Similar types of arrangement will apply to
ENAD when it starts its operations. Balance sheets for the first two years
of Fruitex's operations are at Annex 9, together with the profit and loss
account and operating statement for fiscal year 1972/73. They show clearly
that Fruitex is not financially independent and that in the years under review
its revenues from fruit exports were inadequate to cover its expenses.



- 20-
5.10      Much could be done to improve the efficiency of Fruitex's fruit
exporting operations through better planning for the fruit sub-sector as a
whole. Proposed project activities in pineapples constitute a plan for the
medium run for one commodity and which Fruitex can use as a base for forward
planning of its transport, handling and exporting activities. Similar plans
are needed for the other fruit, importantly bananas and mangoes even though
the plan might be to phase out exports of one or another of these fruits on
the grounds of their exports being uneconomic. This planning will involve
such matters as examination of the terns of trade between Guinea and its
trading partners and providing adequate incentives to producers. In view of
the sensitivity attached to such issues the preparation of such a plan would
be best conducted by the Government. During negotiations assurances were
obtained from the Government that by June 30, 1976, it would have prepared, for
discussion with IDA, a broad plan for the fresh fruit sector covering the
period to 1980. It is proposed that during project supervision IDA should
provide assistance to the Government in the preparation of such a plan.
5.11       Budgetary Control, Funding Procedures, Accounts and Audits.  An
Entreprise is subject to strict expenditure control. The Entreprise produces
a draft budget which is submitted for consideration by the appropriate Minister,
in the case of Fruitex - External Trade and that of ENAD - Agriculture, from
whomi it passes for final approval to the Ministre de Controle d'Etat (MCE)
in the Prime Minister's Office. Disbursement controls are rigorous, thus
checks issued by Fruitex have to be endorsed by the Ministry of External Trade,
and expenditures exceeding Syl 1,000 require prior approval by MCE, the latter
takes about two days. Another important control is that concerning foreign
exchange, and for all its imports the Entreprise has to obtain licenses from
Commission Nationale des Licences.
5.12       In order to facilitate project execution it was agreed that the
following procedures be followed:
i.   the budgets for ENAD and the Transport Service of Fruitex
as approved respectively by the Ministry of Agriculture and
the Ministry of External Trade would be submitted to IDA for
comment three months before the beginning of the financial
year together with a schedule of all import licences needed
during the fiscal year;
ii.   following IDA comments on the budgets Government would
cause that on the basis of quarterly estimates prepared
by ENAD and/or Fruitex and in advance of the start of each
quarter
a.   sufficient funds would be placed in ENAD's and/or
Fruitex's account with BNDA (or drawing rights established)
to neet all local expenditures in the coming 3 month
period.



- 21 -
b.   sufficient foreign exchange would be made aavailable to
ENAD and/or Fruitex by BGCE for the coming 3 months,
and
c.   import licences scheduled for the quarter would be
issued by the Commission.
5.13      Fruitex accounts currently are satisfactorily maintained but there
is no analytical accounting. Auditing of Fruitex accounts is now carried out
by MCE on a continuing basis and appears satisfactory; again, however, the
audit seems to be restricted to a straight-forward check of expenditures and
revenues. Under the project ENAD and Fruitex's Transport Service would keep
records consistent with sound accounting practices and adequate to reflect
their operations and financial conditions and ENAD and Fruitex would employ
independent and qualified auditors to audit those records. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that:
i.   ENAD and Fruitex would appoint auditors for the above
purposes acceptable to IDA;
M.   copies of ENAD's and Fruitex's Transport Service
accounts and the auditors' reports thereon would be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end
of the fiscal year; and
iii.   the report of the auditors would be of such scope and
in such detail as the Bank may reasonably request.
Project Financing Arrangements
5.14      The Guinean fiscal system and arrangements for financing development
projects in the public sector (excluding enclave projects such as the bauxite
mining venture financed by the Bank) are based on the system employed in the
centrally planned countries of Eastern Europe. Targets are set for each enter-
prise with respect to annual production volume, revenues, production costs,
and benefit (profit) along with those for allocations of an enterprise's
earnings. Prices, of both inputs and outputs, are set and controlled by
Government. Under this system the primary responsibility of an enterprise
is to attain its targets. As all investment financing and key operational
decisions are centrally coordinated and necessary funds are provided by the
Government directly. or indirectly through Government owned agencies, the
financial viability of an enterprise cannot necessarily be judged by its
benefit. Consequently, the usual conventional financial criteria can be
applied to enterprises in Guinea, such as the proposed nucleus estate, to
only a very limited extent. For outgrowers the position is different; their
motivation clearly is financial and the cash returns from growing pineapples
must be adequate to ensure their continued interest in the crop.
5.15      Estimated cash flows for the nucleus estate and associated outgrowers
are at Annexes 10, 11 and 12. These are expressed in 1974 prices for both



- 22 -
inputs and outputs and show satisfactory returns to both the estate and out-
growers.  The flows are expressed in 1974 prices because the sales prices for
pineapples that are set by Government, see para 6.05, are not tied to the
world price for fresh pineapples, but are set at levels estimated to provide
a satisfactory incentive for the production of pineapples. Since pineapple
prices are fixed "arbitrarily" they cannot be forecast. Annexes 10, 11 and 12
show, however, that in terms of prices for inputs and outputs ruling in 1974,
pineapple production under estate or outgrowers conditions would be financially
attractive. The cash flow indicates, however, that the ruling pineapple price
(based on a fob price of Syl 9,718/ton) may be generous under circumstances
where producers can obtain and use farm inputs at 1974 prices without constraint
and thus benefit from high yields (as they would under the project), while being
barely adequate under circumstances where farm inputs are in short supply and
yields are low (as at present).
5.16      Currently the price issue has not been considered by Government, and
it would be unrealistic to expect any early conclusion on the detail of price
arrangements that would be appropriate for the project. Indeed, as estate
pineapple plantings would not be in production until late 1977, and outgrowers'
plantings not until 1978, there is no urgency for the resolution of such detail.
On the other hand, as producer prices for pineapples appear to need some
adjustment, para 5.15, the following principles of price and financing arranrge-
ments have been agreed with Government during negotiations:
i.   producer prices for pineapples would not be such as
to encourage inefficient production;
ii.   the financing arrangements would ensure an adequate
degree of financial discipline;
iii.   participating outgrowers would be required to meet
the costs of support services, including extension
services, provided to them by ENAD; and
iv.   participating outgrowers would, as and when needed,
receive loans for the development of their holdings
on terms that would properly reflect the costs of
lending, and provide for the risk of bad debts.
5.17      The above principles have been incorporated in a side letter.  At
the same time assurances have been obtained that not later than June 30, 1976,
agreement would be reached with IDA on:
i.   the formula for establishing and the actual price to
be paid to outgrowers for pineapples produced in the
1977/78 season, and the prices to be paid by outgrowers
for inputs and Fruitex services; and



- 23 -
ii.   the mechanism for subsequent revisions of pineapple and
input prices.
It has been agreed that the proceeds of the IDA credit employed by the nucleus
estate and outgrower components of the project should be onlent to ENAD as
a loan at not less than 6%, the loan to have a term of 25 years including a
grace period for interest and capital of 6 years. Signature of a subsidiary
loan agreement reflecting this between BNDA acting on behalf of Government
and ENAD would be a condition of credit effectiveness. It is proposed that
the Government's contribution to ENAD as well as Government's contribution to
and the proceeds of the IDA credit destined for Fruitex would be passed on as a
grant and incorporated as equity in the two enterprises.
5.18      Distribution of Inputs and Provision of Credit to Outgrowers
Presently Fruitex imports and distributes to pineapple growers
cardboard packaging cases. Entreprise Nationale d'Importation de Materiel
Agricole (Agrima) imports agricultural equipment for distribution to growers.
Fertilizer, seeds and pesticides are imported by the National Enterprise
ENISEP. Growers' purchases are financed by BNDA through Credit National Pour
le Commerce, l'Industrie et l'Habitat, only bank with branches throughout the
countryside and with which all growers are required to have accounts. BNDA
is a substantial undertaking, see balance sheet at Annex 13. Fruitex makes
its payments for fruit to BNDA which automatically recovers outstandings and
credits producers with the balance. Under the project ENAD would import and
distribute all the farm inputs required for its registered outgrowers. BNDA
as now, would assume the debt of individual outgrowers through crediting ENAD's
account with the value of inputs supplied and recover outstandings by direct
deductions from growers' sale proceeds. Outgrowers would also be provided
with credit for labor and rations as needed. (see para 2.10). BNDA credit
for pineapples has terms varying from 1-5 years and bears interest of 6% for
one-year loans and of 5% for those with a longer term. Given the indications
of a domestic inflation rate of 5% (see para 4.02), it was agreed during
negotiations that the minimum interest rate would be 9% and that a pro-forma
loan agreement for use between registered outgrowers and BNDA/ENAD would be
submitted to IDA for approval.
5.19      An interest rate of 9% for onlending to outgrowers and an interest
rate of at least 6% for onlending by BNDA and ENAD have been agreed. Gov-
ernment additionally has agreed to submit to IDA, not later than June 30,
1976, a study of BNDA's lending policies and procedures. This study would
in particular include a thorough assessment of BNDA's interest rate policies.
If this study concludes that an increase in interest rates applicable to
loans made to state-owned enterprises is justified, the onlending rate to
ENAD would be revised accordingly. The above agreement has been incorporated
in a side letter.



VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES, OPERATING RESLITS
NUCLEUS ESTATE AND OUTGROWERS, AND
GOVERNMENT/ENAD/FRUITEX REVENUES
6.01      Production.  It is estimated that on the nucleus estate yield/
ha/crop would rise from 35 tons/ha in Project Year (PY) 3 (1977/78), to 60
tons/ha in PY 9 (1983/84). Improvements in vield would reflect the experience
and skills acquired by project staff, better selection of planting material
and refinement of cultural teclniques, especially fertilizer use. With
research it should be possible, as in other countries, to reduce the time
land would be tied up in a single crop from three years to about two years,
see Annex 1.  However, no account is taken of this possibility in the calcula-
tion of rates of return.  For outgrowers it is estimated that yields on irri-
gated farms would reach between 50 and 55 tons/ha after about a three-year
period, and that on non-irrigated farms they would average 30 tons. In proj-
ect calculations it is assumed that project production would stabilize at
about 10,200 tons annually by PY 9, of which the estate 8,400 tons and out-
growers an increment of about 1,800 tons.  The latter figure is based on the
assumption that without the project potential project outgrowers would conti-
nue to grow pineapples and obtain average yields of about 20 tons/ha. The
latter assumption, given the recent sharp decline in production, is highly
speculative.
6.02      Not all pineapples produced would be suitable for export as
fresh fruit.  It is estimated that ultimately 8% of estate production and 10%
of smallholder production would be suitable only for canning - juice and seg-
ments, and that this would'be sold to the SIFRA cannery at Forecariah, see
para 2.11, and on the local fresh fruit market.
6.03      Markets and Prices. World pineapple production is in excess of
4 million tons, but of this only a very small proportion enters world trade
as fresh fruit. About 90,000 tons 1/ were so recorded in 1969 and probably
the figure today is closer to 140,000-150,000 tons, an insignificant amount
compared with such fruits as apples, oranges, lemons and bananas. The prin-
cipal exporters of fresh pineapples and their main markets are Brazil to
Argentina, Mexico to the U.S.A., Ivory Coast to France and Western Europe,
Taiwan to Japan, Guinea to the USSR, and the Union of South Africa to the
U.K. Smaller exporters are the Azores, Cuba, Kenya, Cameroon, the French
Antilles, Honduras and Costa Rica. More details of the world trade in pine-
apples are at Annex 5.
1;   These figures ex,lude exports from Malaysia to Singapore (30,000<30,0
tons annually in the 1960's) since these are canned in Singapore and
re-exported as canned fruit.



6.04      Ivory Coast is now the world's largest exporter of fresh pine-
apples and dominates the market in Western Europe supplying about 72% of con-
sumption in 1972 and much higher proportions In 1973 and 1974 when 43,000 and
67,000 tons respectively were exported.  Exports of 75,000 tons from the
Ivory Coast are foreseen by the authorities of that country for 1980 when
demand in Western Europe is estimated to reach 100,000 tons. A study by the
Ivory Coast's Comite de Coordination des Ventes de l'Ananas Frais de Cote
d'Ivoire (COVENAS) indicates that by 1980 traditional suppliers to Western
Europe could be providing some 97,000 tons. Given the dynamism and momentum
of the Ivory Coast industry, the capacity of the suppliers such as South
Africa to quickly expand exports and the entrance of Cuba, Honduras and
Costa Rica on the market (the efforts of the two latter being facilitated
by their existing banana trade with Europe), the scope of Guinea breaking
into the West European markets in any significant way in the short run appears
small. Consequently, while the prospection of such markets and their develop-
ment, if justified, would be carried out under the project, it is assumed
in project calculations that Guinea's pineapple exports would continue to be
to Eastern Europe and the USSR. Studies of demand in Eastern Europe and the
USSR are necessarily subjective but COVENAS estimates requirements of 20,000
tons by 1980. As the traditional and principal supplier to these markets and
given her trade linkages, it is reasonable to expect that Guinea would conti-
nue to receive priority in this market.
6.05      World export prices for pineapples, at least for deliveries to
Western Europe, have remained relatively stable in recent years, the late
1974 fob price Abidjan being around CFAF 66,000 (US$300)/ton. The Bank's
Economic Analysis and Projections Department expects prices to increase in
line with general inflation albeit with some lag. The price paid to pineapple
producers in Guinea is an artificial price as described in para 5.15). It
is based on an fob price of Syl 9,718/ton; at the official exchange rate this
is nearly double the price Guinea would receive were she exporting to Western
Europe. The price paid for processed fruit is now Syl 2,500/ton. Relation-
ships between cif, fob and farm gate prices are shown in Annex 5.
6.06      Operating Results:  Nucleus Estate.  Cash flow statements and
operating accounts for the nucleus estate are at Annex 10. In these it has
been assumed that 1974 prices for both inputs and outputs would obtain
throughout the life of the estate. At 1974 price parities the financial
rate of return from investment in the estate would be about 20%, but as
explained in para. 5.14 this is conjectural.
6.07      Operating Results:  Outgrowers.  Cash flows and operating
accounts for two outgrower type operations are at Annexes 11 and 12. As in
the case of the nucleus estate they are illustrative. They show the costs
of and results from developing new 4 ha irrigated and 4 ha rainfed holdings.
The financial data show that on the basis of 1974 cost and benefit parities
returns to outgrowers are very satisfactory. In the calculations it is
assumed that outgrowers would meet 20% of all capital and recurrent costs
from their own resources, and finance capital costs with 4 year, and replace-
ment of irrigation equipment with 6 year loans being 9% interest, and recur-



- 26 -
rent crop costs with seasonal loans at 9%. On an irrigated farm following
two initial years of deficits net cash income after debt service averages
about Syl 175,000/halannum through the seventh year when the grower's initial
loan is repaid, and some Syl 260,000 thereafter. The returns per manday em-
ployed would be about Syl 220 and 376 in these same periods compared with
the current daily labor rate of Syl 63. On the rainfed farm comparative
figures are Syl 74,000 and Syl 144,000/ha/annum and Syl 173 and 262/manday
respectively. The high returns to outgrowers reinforce the opinion expressed
in para. 5.15 that current producer prices may be over-generous under condi-
tions where outgrowers can obtain inputs without constraint.
6.08      Governnent Revenues.  The principal revenues accruing to Gov-
ernment from the productive components of the project would constitute the
benefit made by ENAD on the nucleus estate which cannot be quantified at
this time; repayment of the proceeds of the IDA credit onlent to ENAD for
the nucleus estate and outgrower components; and taxes paid by additional
Fruitex staff members as well as taxes paid by outgrowers on their increased
incomes. Other revenues such as payments by outgrowers for services would
merely offset the costs of these services. Current tax rates are a flat
5°o for any amount less than Syl 3,000/annum, and 10% on all amounts above
this level. It is important that the pricing and credit arrangements for
outgrowers, while providing for a fair return, should not be over-generous.
A meaningful cash flow for Government cannot be presented at this time.
6.09      It is not possible to forecast the results of Fruitex's tradi-
tional marketing activities, and thus the benefit to Government from these
operations.  These results will depend upon the volume of fruit that comes
forward and this will be a function of a range of factors currently out of
Fruitex's control and which cannot be predicted at this time.  liowever, the
activities of ENAD should at least sustain pineapple production and therebv
provide a base for Fruitex to plan and execute its operations more efficiently.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The principal objective of the project is to increase the pro-
duction of fresch pineapples; this would be met through the creation of the
nucleus estate and increasing the production of those outgrowers who choose
to participate in the project. As the proposed nucleus estate would not be
created without the project, and as it would in no way interfere with the
present production of pineapples by individual farmers, its production would
be strictly additional and entirely a consequence of the project. Estate
production is estimated to reach 8,400 tons annually by PY 9. It is more
difficult to assess the incremental pineapple production resulting from the
outgrower component of the project and although an estimate of 1,800 tons of
annual incremental production is suggested in para 6.01, this is highly specu-
lative. The pineapple industry is in sharp decline (see paras 2.10 and 6.01)
and, without the project, farmers' interest in pineapples could well decrease



- 27 -
even further. Any estimate of the rate at which production would decrease with-
out the project would be subject to much error. Thus, in the calculation of
the economic rate of return for the project it is assumed, as a proxy, that
the 340 ha of pineapples catered for under the outgrower component of the
project would be new plantings started from scratch and the total costs and
benefits of such an undertaking are taken into account in the calculation.
This approach probably underestimates the incremental rate of return of the
outgrower component of the project, see para. 7.04, but is the safest approach
under the circumastances.
7.02      The economic rate of return of the pineapple component of the
project is 18%. Exportable production has been valued at market prices for
fresh pineapples in Western European countries (para. 6.05); and all foreign
exchange benefits and costs have been converted to Sylis at the shadow ex-
change rate (para 2.07). The world price for pineapples has been used in the
absence of a more accurate estimate of the economic value of pineapple exports
to the USSR and other centrally planned countries. Its use implies that in
return for exports of pineapples Guinea obtains goods and services in return
that approximate to those that could be purchased on the world market with
the proceeds of sales of similar quantities of pineapples on the world market.
As there is no reason to believe that the trade agreements between Guinea and
the USSR and other countries are unfair to Guinea this appears a realistic
assumption.
7.03      A sensitivity analysis indicates that simultaneous cost increases
and benefit decreases of 10% would result in a rate of return of about 9%
indicating high sensitivity to relatively small changes in production effi-
ciency. Separate rates of return have been calculated for the nucleus estate
and the outgrower components of the project; they are 15% and 38% respectively.
These separate rates, however, have limited meaningfulness since they result
from an allocation to each component of foreign technical assistance and ma-
nagement costs that is necessarily arbitrary. Details of the rate of return
calculations and the results of sensitivity tests, including those employing
alternative shadow rates are at Annex 14.
7.04      For the sake of completeness a calculation has been made of the
possible incremental rate of return from investment in the outgrower component
of the project. In this a comparison was made of the costs and benefits in-
involved in holdings in "with" and "without" project situations, see para.
6.01. A rate of return of about 40% on încremental investments is indicated.
This supports the opinion expressed in para. 7.01 that the method used in
calculating the rate of return for the outgrower component of the project is
conservative.
7.05      In the above estimates of rates of return, account is not taken
of the costs and benefits of other pineapple activities such as improving
Fruitex's transport service, staff training, research, transportation studies,



- 28 -
and the prospection of new markets. The full cost of transporting nucleus
estate and outgrower pineapples to point of export are included in the rate
of return calculation described in para 7.01 and consequently the estate and
project outgrowers would bear their fair shares of the costs of improving
the service. Improvements in efficiency of production through research and
transportation studies would bring benefits over and above those assumed in
the rate of return calculations, as should successful market prospection.
7.06      The studies of the rice and livestock sectors are essential if
sound development of these two important industries is to proceed with subse-
quent economic and social benefits to the economy. Importantly, developments
in these sub-sectors, should they take place, would be the first permitting
the involvement of substantial numbers of rural people in well-conceived and
adequately financed development programs.
7.07      Investment in the project will not lead to improvements in the
living standards of any very significant number of people. About 800 jobs
would be created or sustained by the project. However, the project would
introduce to Guinea a number of concepts and techniques that in the longer
run should benefit significant numbers of rural people and without which
Guinea's agriculture will continue to stagnate.
7.08      Risks.  There are serious problems impeding the realization of
Guinease considerable economic potential and the risk of the pineapple com-
ponent failing to achieve all its objectives must be rated as relatively high
even though Governnent would afford a high degree of managerial and financial
autonomy to the project. Of note are problems such as a) the problem of
providing adequate incentives for labor, and b) the chronic difficulty of the
availability of foreign exchange. As Guinea will not be able to make a major
breakthrough in the West European fresh pineapple market in the short run,
project earnings will be in Sylis crdited to ENAD's account by Government and
the Enterprise will be dependent upon allocations of foreign exchange from
Government. Currently, many public entities, such as the railways and port,
suffer a crippling shortage of foreign exchange.
7.09      The justification for accepting the high risks involved in the
project is that it appears at this time to be the sole opportunity for intro-
ducing and demonstrating some of the basic organizational and development
techniques that must be adopted if progress is to be made in the rural
sector.

ANNEX 1
GUINEA
PINEAPPLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
NUCLEUS ESTATE: TECHNICAL DETAILS
A. General
1.        The pineapple is neither an annual nor a perennial plant.  In some
countries it has proved possible through research to make the pineapple al-
most an annual; however, this entails a great deal of work that so far has
not been initiated in Guinea. Under conditions in Guinea the time taken from
planting a sucker (these form at the base of the pineapple plant in its leaf
axils and constitute new pineapple plants possessing identical genetic make-
ups to their parent) to harvesting its fruit takes an average of 18 months.
To this must be added another year after harvest during which suckers on the
harvested plant grow to a stage when they themselves can be removed and used
to establish a new stand of pineapples. After removal of the suckers the old
plants are destroyed. Given the time needed to re-prepare the land for plant-
ing the overall cycle is about 3 years and any given piece of land can only
produce pineapples once every three years. Consequently, when fully develop-
ed the nucleus estate of 420 ha net is estimated to have 140 ha in production
in any one year. However, it should prove possible, within the next decade,
through research, and particularly plant selection, to reduce the production
cycle from three to two years.
2.        Initially the nucleus estate would have to buy its suckers from
existing growers. Thus the planting program and source of suckers would be
as follows:
Year 1 (1976)  40 ha, using 2 million suckers, all from existing
growers
Year 2 (1977)  60 ha, using 3 million suckers, all from existing
growers
Year 3 (1978)  90 ha, using 4.5 million suckers, of which 2.5
million from existing growers and 2 million from
the estate itself.
Year 4 (1979)  90 ha, using 4.5 million suckers all from the
estate.
Year 5 (1980)  140 ha, using 7 million suckers all from the
estate.
Land Clearing
3.        The project area has a very light tree and shrub cover.  Clearing
can be either by hand or mechanical. Currently Agrima operates an equipment
hire service; using this service clearing costs are estimated at Syl 3,600/ha
and if land levelling is carried out at the same time Syl 4,800/ha, plus an
additional Syl 500 for labor. A clearing cost of Syl 5,300 is used in the



ANNEX 1
Page 2
cost estimates. With hand labor the cost would be about 25% less. The
choice of clearing method would be left to the Estate Manager.
Land Preparation
4.        Following levelling, the land would be disk plowed (8 h/ha with 65
hp tractor, plus one day of hand labor) and given two disk harrowings (4 h/ha,
45 hp tractor, 0.5 manday). Between the two diskings a basic dressing of
500 kg/ha of rock phosphate plus 500 kg/ha of magnesium lime would be applied
(1 h/ha, 45 hp tractor). For replanting land already in pineapple, i.e. the
procedure that would be followed when the estate was mature, the first opera-
tion would be to "bush-hog" the old pineapple plants to speed up their sub-
sequent decomposition and thus reduce nematode and mealy bug populations
(6 h/ha 65 hp tractor, 1 manday). Depending on conditions the old pineapple
material would be burnt either before or after bush hogging. After some
years of cultivation a sub-soiling (8 h/ha, 65 hp tractor, 1 manday) probably
would be necessary.
Preparation of Planting Material
5.        For suckers collected from outgrowers the first step would be to
disinfect them against mealy bugs. To facilitate this the outer leaves would
be stripped away before dipping in an insecticidal solution. Stripping (33)
and dipping (15) would take an estimated 48 mandays for the 50,000 suckers
required per ha. Grading suckers would take 10 mandays per ha. Disinfection
would not be required for suckers produced on the nucleus estate as these
would be produced under a regime of mealy bug control. Harvesting the suckers
to plant one ha would require an estimated 42 mandays.
Planting
6.        Marking out the areas to be planted would be through using a hand-
drawn spiked wheel. Thereafter holing and planting (50,000 stands/ha) would
be by hand with all operations requiring a total of 60 mandays/ha.
Pest Control
7.        At this time a need for nematode control is not foreseen since
tillage operations carried out in the dry season prior to planting should be
adequate to control nematode infestations. Similarly the need for ant control
(ants are associated with mealy bugs, see below) prior to planting is not
foreseen. However a formicidal treatment (20% Dieldrin Emulsifiable Concen-
trate) would be integrated with mealy bug control sprayings.
8.        Weed Control.  Weed control would be effected by a combination of
herbicides and hand weeding. A preplanting treatment, using a herbicide of
the Karmex type, would be applied to the pineapple beds before they were
planted and be followed by a post-planting inter-bed treatment. The first
would be carried out by hand (2 mandays/ha); the second by machine (1 h/ha).
These initial treatments would be followed by 2-3 mechanical sprays during



ANNEX 1
Page 3
the life of the crop. A total of about 16 kg/ha of herbicide would be needed
per crop. Hand weeding (4-10 mandays/ha/operation) would be carried out as
needed; between 2 and 4 rounds would normally be necessary. In project esti-
mates it is assumed that 30 mandays would be employed in this way.
9.        Mealy Bug Control.  As a vector of a range of virus diseases the
mealy bug is the most serious pest of pineapples in Guinea. Control would be
effected by an average of 8 sprayings with a Diazinon type insecticide, 4-6
in the vegetative period of the crop, and 2-3 on areas from which suckers
are being harvested. Spraying would be by high volume sprayers (3,000 L/ha)
mounted on high clearance tractors. Each treatment would deliver 1 litre of
A.M./ha.
Fertiliser
10.       Exact fertiliser requirements would be determined through foliar
analysis and related fertiliser trials. However, for estimating purposes it
is assumed that in addition to the basic dressings of phosphorous and mag-
nesium the following nutrients would be required for each pineapple plant:
- N - nitrogen - 10 gms of which 8 in the vegetative period
and 2 subsequent to harvesting to induce sucker
production.
- K2O - potash - 18 gms of which 16 in the vegetative period
and 2 gms subsequent to harvesting.
11.       Nitrogen: 3 gms applied with the diazinon see above as a foliage
spray in 6 applications of 1.1 gms of urea each; 7 gms applied in the form of
sulphate of ammonia in the axils of the leaves in 3-4 applications, of which
one after harvest. Total fertiliser requirements/ha would thus be:
Urea (45% N)               : 330 kg/ha
Sulphate of Ammonia (21% N): 1,665 kg/ha
12.       Potash: All potash would be applied in the form of sulphate of
potash (48% K20) in the leaf axils and at the same time as the sulphate of
ammonia. 4.5 applications would be made of which one post harvest.
Total requirements would be sulphate of potash: 1,800 kg/ha.
Fruiting Control
13.       Fruiting would be controlled, to ensure production of the fruit in
the December-April season, through the use of an enthylene spray. The spray
would be made up of 30 kg of active powdered carbon, and 2 kg of ethylene in
6,000 1 of water/ha. The spray would be delivered in two passes by a high
clearance tractor mounted sprayer.

Preparation of Fruit for Export
14.       Reduction af the -.rown: this Involves tr.iuming the leaves of the
crown for presentational purposee, to reduce we4ght, and to faci.litate
packing - 20 mandays/ha.  Proteetion against the sun: t.o prev,ent sun scald
it is necessary to sh-ade the fruit against the -.sun.  In March-Apr.il at the
period of peak insolation this would be achieved,through pulling the longer
leaves over the fruit and tieixxg them in -this psition,.  At other.times a
very light covering of grass or s-traw on the top o.'f the fruit would be
sufficient - 31 mandays/ha.
Harvesting and packing:
15.       For exports to Eastern Europ.e and the USSiR fruit wauld be harvested
when they showed color i-n the 2ud and 3rd rows (M2 ,and M3) of the segments
that distinguish the exterior of -the pineapple. -At .this stage of ripeness
it is essential to avoid bruising -and -the estatewould be -supplied with
equipment appropriate for the  transport of fruit :rom the -field to the packing
station.  An estimated total of 1.'60 mandays/ha  is required for harvesting
and packaging.

PINEAPPLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SPECIFICATIONS OF IRRIGATION SYSTEM
Basic Data
1.        The gross area of the nucleus estate would be 720 ha of undulating
land with slopes of up to 5%; of this 420 ha net would be allocated to pine-
apple growing and irrigated in three sections of 140 ha each of which only
two will be irrigated at one time.
3
2.        Annual water requirements are estimated at 4,000 m /ha delivered in
4 applications per month of 20 mm each for the five months of the dry season
(December-April). The water source would be the Kale compensation reservoir
(see Map).
3.        A medium pressure (2.5 atmospheres) semi-portable irrigation system
would be employed equipped with sprinklers at 18 m x 18 m intervals giving a
depth of application of 12 mm/hr.
Pumping Station
4.        The pumping station would be equipped with four vertical electric.
pumps of 90 kw each discharging 75 1/s at a head of 116 m.  The pumps would
be located over a channel 2 m wide cut from the reservoir and which would
permit pumping within fluctuations of up to 6 m in the level of water in the
reservoir. Power supply would be provided by a 15 kv line (6 km) from the
Donkea power plant, and the station would be equipped with two transformers
of 630 kva 15/0.4 kv, 50 HZ. The pumps would be controlled manually by
operators in radio (walkie-talkie) communication with the estate.
The Irrigation Network
5.        The main would be an above ground 400 mm diameter steel pipe 800 m,
in length. This would be connected to a system of buried secondaries of steel
or asbestos cement, totalling 17,000 m with diameters ranging from 350-150
mm. The secondaries would be fitted with 80 valved risers to which would be
connected the portable laterals. The portable laterals would be 315 m long,
and each would be equipped with 18 sprinklers spaced at 18 m. Sixteen por-
table laterals would be employed allowing 12 to be in operation while the
remaining four were being moved.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Phasing of Construction (See Chart)
6.        Construction would be in three phases.  The first phase would be a
temporary installation to irrigate 40 ha of pineapples located in a strip
500 m x 800 m to the south of Koliagbe village and along the Kindia road,
seé Map. The water source would be the Kouloukoure River. The equipment
would comprise a mobile diesel pump (60 hp) with a discharge capacitv of
38 l/s at a head of about 80 m; the pump would serve two temporary secondaries
of 5" diameter, which in turn would feed two portable laterals. All pipes
and sprinkler equipment will be suitable for incorporation in the subsequent
two permanent phases of construction. Work would start in February 1976 and
the installation would be operated by November 1976.
7.        The second phase would involve 190 ha in the southeast of the estate
and would cover the area served by the first phase.  The plhase would include
construction of the pumping station, the power line from Donkea, the equipment
required for three pumps, installation of the main, and the secondary and
laterals needed for 190 ha, i.e. 11 of the portable lateral lines. Work would
start in February 1977 and the installation is planned to be operational by
November 1977.
8.        Construction of third phase would start in February 1979 and be
operational in November 1979.  It would involve completion of the pumping
station, extension of secondaries over the complete 420 ha and provision of
five additional portable laterals.
Irrigation Method
9.        Medium pressure sprinklers (2.5 atmospheres) would be employed and
would give an irrigation application of 12 mm/hour. A sprinkler delivering
small droplets would be employed, since the use of equipment producing large
drops, such as a water canon would tend to uproo-t and bury the young pine--
apples on the project area's light sandy s8ils.
10.       In order to achieve satisfactory pressure control in the system
each portable lateral would be equipped with a pressure regulator of the
Schlumberger or Advo-French type. In order to protect against hammer in the
svstem a 4 m3 reservoir would be incorporated in the pumping station. To
compensate for losses in the system when the pumps are not in operation a
reservoir would be built at a high point in the system which would be linked
to the system by a clapper valve and recharged through a floating valve.
Type of Pipes
11.       Currently there appears to be no major cost advantage between cast
iron and asbestos-cement pipes for the secondaries. Consequently bidders for
the supply of pipes would be permitted to quote for both types including the
côst of appropriate hammer protection for each material.

Operation and Maintenance
12.       Operation and maintenance costs have been estimated on the follow-
ing bases:
Energy               Diesel oil      -    Syl 9/litre
Electricity    -    Syl 1.2/KwH
Annual Maintenance Fixed pipes       -    0.5% of initial investment
Portable equipment - 2% of initial investments
to year 3; 3% years 4 and 5; 5% thereafter
Electrical equipment - 3% initial investments
to year 5; 5% thereafter
Vehicle operating costs - US$3,000 annually

HARVESTING, HANDLING, TRANSPORT
MARKETS AND PRICES
General
1.        The pineapple Ananas comosus is native to the tropics and cultivated
mainly between 25"N and 25°S.  There are four main commercial varieties,
Qieen, Red Spanish, Abacaxis and Smooth Cayenne.  The latter is favored for
canning, and a strain of this variety, Cayenne Lisse, is grown in Guinea for
both canning and export as fresh fruit.
2.        Fresh pineapples are of relatively minor importance in world trade
when compared with such fruits as apples, oranges, and bananas, but compared
to other tropical fruits are second only to bananas inr world trade.
Harvesting and Handling
3.        Color and the condition of the crown are the leading quality
characteristics of the pineapple.  When fully ripe the fruit should be a
deep yellow or orange cbpppry shade and have a clear, bright appearance.
The leaves of the crown should be upright and bright green in color.  When
the crown leaves are limp and turning brown at the edges the value of the
fruit is markedly reduced.  For the West European market, the most common
preference appears to be for fruit betwegn 1.1 kg and 1.3 kg.  There appears
to be no special requireme,nts for the East Eu ropean anrd USSR markets and in
Guinea the West Europ.ean specifications generally are employed.
4.        The pineapp,le is very delicate and extremely susceptible to bruising
and mechanical injury when being han4led and shipped.  Further, fruit harves-
ted when too immature color badly and tend to be acid.  Consequently the
timing of harvesting is extremely important.  In Guinea the fruits are picked
when the bottom three rounds of segments of the fruit begin to have color.
Pineapples should be harvested in the cool of the-day, and if wet should be
allowed to dry before packing. If packed wet mildew quickly develops on the
skin of the fruit.  In Guinea about 1.25 cm of stalk is left on the fruit
and the central portion of the crown is removed in order to reduce weight
and facilitate packing,.
5.        Pineapples for export are graded by size and maturity and in Guinea
are packed in fibreboard cartons with internal divisions. These are based on
the '~Secal" carton developed by IFAC. The cartons are uniform in size and
when packed weigh about 14 kg and contain either 6, 12 or 20 fruit depending
upon fruit size and weight. These cartons are an expensive element in pro-
duction costs, see Appendix.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
Transport
6.        In Guinea the cartons are now packed at field side and transported
by the grower to the so-called stations de conditionnement where their
quality and calibration (sizes) are checked by Government officials. After
clearance the cartons are loaded on to Fruitex vehicles and transhipped to
Conakry for loading onto refrigerated ships.  The optimum storage temperature
for pineapples is in the range of 7°C to 10°C. At lower temperatures the
fruit suffer chilling injuries; while at higher temperatures ripening takes
place excessively quickly. The usual storage life of a pineapple is around
2-4 weeks.
7.        The delicate nature of the pineapple poses numerous problems for
Guinea, problems that need resolution if Guinea's fresh tropical fruit industry
is to be developed much further than envisaged under the project. Basically
the problem is that given the relatively short storage life of the pineapple,
ideally pineapples should be harvested and shipped on a twice a week cycle.
The shorter the cycle the better. Ideally this might mean the departure
ex-Conakry of a refrigerated vessel every four days. As Guinea imports an
insignificant volume of regrigerated cargo, there is no return freight for
refrigerated space (this precludes even the use of individual auto-refrigera-
ted containers). Further, since the collapse of the banana industry pine-
apples effectively are the only refrigerated cargo leaving Guinea. Con-
sequently refrigerated vessels have to make special runs to Guinea on request.
As they cannot make up a cargo of both bananas and pineapples, the vessels
either have to be rather small (and thus expensive to operate) or to make
their journey only partially loaded. Presently the purchasers of Guinea's
fruit supply the refrigerated vessels and harvesting is geared to the esti-
mated time of arrival of these vessels. Delays in arrival occur and over-
ripeness from time to time is a problem.  however, the East European and USSR
purchasers appear to accept fruit of a lower quality than would be the case
on West European markets and while this state of affairs continues Guinea
suffers little. On the other hand, given this situation, it is very difficult
for Guinea to expand its exports into other markets where quality requirements
are higher. Under the project analysis would be made of the complex of
problems relating to an expansion of markets including that of ocean shipping.
8.        Internal transport to Conakry is by road in stake trucks covered by
tarpaulins. Government is interested in using the Kindia-Conakry railway for
this purpose, and has contemplated building a spur to the fruit loading wharf.
Given the present extremely poor state of the railway, both track and rolling
stock, this solution is neither technically nor economically feasible and the
fruit trade could not justify the rehabilitation and new investments required.
Markets and Prices
9.        Guinea is best located to serve the European market.  This market
for all practical purposes is in two parts, the West European and the East



ANNEX 5
Page 3
European/USSR markets.  The West European market has seen a very rapid ex-
pansion in the consumption of fresh pineappl'es over the last decade and
particularly in the period 1967-72 when consumption increased from 25,500
tons to 56,900 tons. In this market the Ivory Coast is the leading supplier
having increased its share from 8,930 tons (35% of consumption) in 1967 to
38,310 tons in 1972 (68%, or 78% if UK consumption is excluded). In 1973
consumption increasèd'still further (detail figures are ffot available) and
the Ivory Coast exported some 53,000 tons.  This rapid expansibn in con-
sumption has occurred without a decline in cif import prices, in fact the
csontrary has occurred and there has been a slow but gëneral upward trend
in prices.  Thus in-P Face, the largest West European 'consümer V(35% in 1972)
the cif import price of Ivory Coast pineapples rose from about FF 1.60/kg in
1:966 to about FF 2.i10/kg in 1974.  The same price trend has occurred in
other West European countries.
10.       It is unquestionable that over the last decade the pineapple has
made a major breakthtough in continental Western Europe, not least by very
well conceived advertising camPaigns, has been to demônnstrate that there are
ways in which a fresh pif`iapple can be eaten with little more trouble and
wastage than otherifruit.  This may appear a nmnor issue but in practice it
has been shown to be the najor sélling point.
11.       There are no Bank foreca`sts offuture fresh pineapple production
and none by agencies such 'as FAO.  A forecast made by the British Tropical
Products' Institute of a coônsumption in Western Europe of about 60,000 tons
in 1975 appears soôàéwhat on the low si'de, while a forecast of 100,000 tons
by 1980 màde by the I-ory `coast 'trade may be `oprtimistic in the light of cur-
tent recessionary pressures in Western Euürbope   d the rapid inflation in
production cos'ts that has oc-curred over the l-ast -18'-months.  As Guinea is
not likely tô participate in the Western Eu`ropean market on any significant
scale for sonme years -t'o cômee, developments in this `-arket are important only
in so far as they may indicate f-uture movemeints in the East European market,
and especially the likelihood of;-ther produce's com-peting with Guinea in
this market.
12.       Guinea is by far the major supplier to the Eastern European market
although the Ivory Coast has made 'small sales to; Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
In the past Guinea has s-upplied more than 12,000 tons to this market, but in
1973 exports were only half this level and it appears that they will tend to
fall further in future. Givén the project production estimates it would
appear unlikely that Guinea will again export 12,000 tons annually until the
early 1980's.  Fortunately, no immedia-te major competition is seen on the
Dastern market and especially the'USSR market on which, presumably, Guinea
will continue to be `favored.
13.       It would appear that some increase in cif import prices Western
Ëurope is essential if current production levels in producing countries are
to be maintained in the face of increasing costs. Already there are indi-
cations that in the Ivory Coast yields of more than 50 tons/ha are necessary

if producers are to remain in business.  This is close to production poten-
tial for the largely rain-fed Ivory Coast crop,.rand.yet Bank f.orecasts for
inflation indicate that production costs could increase by-as much as 45%
8ver the next five years.  The Bank's Economic Analysis -and Proj,ections
Department anticipates that cif prices will increase in Western Europe in
line with cost inflation, albeit with some lag.  Table .2.shows the rela-
tionship between farm.gate, fob, and cif European port prices, and Table 2
gives details of exports and imports of fresh pi-n,eapples for the major pro-
ducing and cons'uming countries.

Price of Export Cartons
1.        The price of export cartons constitutes nearly 40% of the value of
pineapple packed for export. Consequently it is essential that suitable
cartons are obtained as cheaply as possible. Currently Fruitex imports French
made cartons from Morrocco. These are very expensive, costing close to double
the price of similar cartons in the Ivory Coast where they are fabricated
locally from imported fibreboard.
2.        There are tentative plans for establishing a carton plant in Guinea,
but in project calculations it is assumed that cartons would be imported from
the cheapest source and the costs of importing cartons from the Ivory Coast
are employed. From this source the costs are estimated as follows:
Cases required to pack one ton of fresh pineapples
No        Cost per case (CFAF)            Total (CFAF)
Type A    18                 140                     2,520

3.        In packaging staples are used and to allow for this in estate
production a cost of Syl 1.6/kg exported is used. For smallholders a cost
of Syl 1.9/kg is used to allow for Fruitex costs in handling cartons.

PINEAPPLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
RESEARCH
1.        The needs for pineapple research in Guinea have been evaluated by
a senior IFAC specialist. The following notes summarise the subjects to which
he gives priority and ideally on which work should start by about Project
Year 2. Plant Nutrition: this is of the highest importance influencing not
only yield but factors such as quality, length of growing cycle, quality, and
disease resistance. Foliar diagnosis services for the nucleus estate would
be established under the project but for these to be fully effective they
would have to be supplemented and supported by a comprehensive program of
fertiliser and nutrient trials. Spacing: in obtaining fruit of optimum
size there is a direct relationship between fertiliser use and number of
plants/ha. Obviously it is desirable to grow as many plants as possible/ha
in order to obtain economies of scale. So far the optimum spacing for the
ecological conditions of the Kindia area has not been determined. Under the
project 50,000 plants would be grown/ha. Possibly this could be increased to
60,000. If this were possible the nucleus estate for example, could be
reduced by some 15% in extent with resulting savings in both fixed and
recurrent costs. Irrigation: the specifications of the estate's irrigation
system are based on the assumption that 80 mm/month of irrigation water is
required for pineapple plantings of all ages. It is almost certain that this
is an overestimation and that considerable economies in irrigation water use
could be affected as a consequence of work to determine optimum irrigation
rates. Apart from such economies it is clearly essential to determine the
inter-relationships between irrigation rates and other factors such as
fertiliser application rates and pest and disease incidence. It is also
desirable to test the application of nutrients through the irrigation system.
Rotations and length of growing cycle: during the (currently) three-year life
of a stand of pineapples there is a build up in the nematode (virus vector)
population of the soil as well as of weeds resistant to the herbicides in use.
Consequently rotating pineapples with another crop which wll not sustain the
pineapple nematode and which permit the kill control of noxious weeds that
cannot be controlled fully when the land is under pineapples is most desirable.
Selection of an appropriate crop for use in rotation with pineapples is needed.
Work is also needed in Guinea on means to reduce the growth cycle of the
pineapple, this is inter-related with the need for an appropriate rotation.
Prima facie the longer land is under pineapples and the shorter the growth
cycle of each crop the better. This must be balanced, however, against the
build up of nematodes, noxious weeds and other pests of the pineapple.
Yellowing: yellowing is a physiological disease that occurs in maturing fruit
in the March/April period. Fruit so diseased is not edible and unfortunately
cannot be identified visually. One means of controlling the disease would

appear to be to advance maturation so that most fruit is harvested before the
critical period. The use of artificial maturation agents appears to offer a
means of doing this.  Flovering control:  currently ethylene is used in the
Kindia area, but the results from use of this treatment are not as regular as
in countries with a warmer and more humid climate than Kindia.  There are
several other flowering agents that have yet to be tested at Kindia and
which might prove more effective.
2.        The above are sote of the more important elements of applied research
that could be included in the research program to be financed under the project.
It will be possible to prepare a detailed program only once satisfactorv
arrangements are made between INRAF, ENAD and an external and experienced
research agency for the planning and direction of an applied research program.

PINEAPPLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
RICE AND LIVESTOCK STUDIES
In this Annex the terms of reference of the livestock and rice sub-
sector surveys and project preparation work are described. In order to avoid
repetition the emphasis is given in Part A to the sector, policy review and
development strategy aspects of the consultants' work and in Part B to project
preparation. Equal emphasis would be given to all aspects in the consultants
review of the two sectors.
A. Terms of Reference: Survey and Policy
Review of the Livestock Subsector and
Identification and Preparation of
Investment Projects
I. OBJECTIVES
The work would be carried out in two phases.  The objectives of the
first phase would be to:
a.   carry out a detailed survey of the present status of the livestock
industry;
b.   assess its development potential;
c.   formulate a livestock development strategy for the country; and with-
in the context of this strategy;
d.   identify potential investment projects of high priority.
The objectives of the second phase would be to carry out detailed
feasibility studies of one or two priority projects and to prepare these in a
form suitable for consideration by international financing agencies.
In the first phase the consultants would, in liaison with the Minis-
try of Livestock, make the detailed survey of the present status of the live-
stock industry needed as a basis for planning. The consultants would review



ANNEX 7
Page 2
the livestock industry as a whole but with particular emphasis on cattle, and
assess the potential for production of meat, milk and other animal products.
The'review would include analysis of:
a.   present production systems including the farm organization, herd
ownership and production coefficients for the different classes of
stock (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry);
b.   present livestock population, its output of meat, milk and other
animal products, and assessment of trends;
c.   use of draft animals;
d.   availability of livestock inputs including livestock feeds (forage
production, potential crop residues, crop by-products, by-products
of agro-industrial operations, feed grains), machinery and equipment,
seeds and fertilisers;
e.   livestock services such as animal health services and animal produc-
tion research, training and extension;
f.   marketing channels and processing facilities;
g.   present and future demand for livestock and livestock products;
h.   producer prices for livestock products; and
i.   livestock taxation and Government price policies.
The survey would examine and describe the role of livestock produc-
tion and analyze the development potential for livestock in the four principal
ecoclimatic zones of Guinea, namely:
a.   Lower Guinea;
b.   Fouta Djallon
c.   Upper Guinea; and
d.   The Forest Region.
The Consultants would assist the Ministry of Livestock to draw up a
National Livestock Development Plan for consideration by Government. This
Plan would contain a number of specific projects, identified by the Consultants
and which would be described in the Plan in outline form, for which interna-
tional financing would be sought. The list of projects so identified would be
reviewed by the Government and IDA with the objective of selecting priority
projects which would be prepared in a form suitable for consideration by exter-
na! financial institutions under the second phase of the Consultants work.

The objectives of the second phase would be preparation of the de-
tailed physical, financial and organizational plans for projects agreed by the
Government and IDA to have high priority within the Livestock Development Plan
and to be suitable for international and in particular IDA financing. Project
preparation would be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the
World Bank, such as are illustrated in Part B of this Annex which deals with
the preparation of rice development projects.

ANNEX 7
Page 8
B.  Terms of Reference;  Survey and Policy Review of
the Rice Subsector and Identification and
Preparation of Investment Projects
I. OBJECTIVES
The first phase of the Consultants' work would be as for the Live-
stock Subsector in so far as the policy review and preparation of a rice devel-
opment strategy are concerned.  The following deals in detail wlth the project
identification and preparation aspects of the Consultants' work.
II. IDENTIFICATION
The Consultants would be required to identify the most promising
areas for the development of upland, inland swamp, coastal swamp and flood
plain (Niger River) rice. In each case the identification would take account
of factors such as population densities, responsiv,eness of population to de-
velopment, locality, access and general communications. The accent would be
on simple low cost methods of improving existing rice production through the
provision of farmer support services and modern inputs, the employment of low
cost land development methods and the provision of the minimum infrastructure
needed to allow reasonable access to the development areas and for the market-
ing of crops produced. Full account would be taken of existing Government
administrative boundaries and social factors such as ethnic groupings.
Raving identified areas of high potential the Consultants would rank
them by priarities for development. Criteria favoring priority ranking would
include high population density, favorable production potential, simplicity
of technical inputs required, costs per farmer affected (lower costs being
favored), and proximity to major markets. The posibilities of developing more
than one system of rice cultivation in a single area, for example the develop-
ment of inland swamp rice in conjunction with upland rice, would be paid parti-
cular attention.
The consultants would,be expected to prepare an identification report
of no more than 20 pages long, which would be presented in both French and
English. The report would:
a.   define the scope for rice development in Guinea;
b.   specify priority areas, indicating production targets and approximate
costs; and
c.   describe in relative detail (including any major limitations) three
areas worthy of priority development that would justify being sub-
jected to a feasibility study.



ANNEX 7
Page 9
The Consultants would present their report to Government and IDA who
would then agree on two areas that would be the subject of feasibility studies.
The Consultants would then proceed to prepare full preparation (feasibility)
reports on the selected development areas.
III. FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND PREPARATION REPORTS
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE 1/

tive District in Region of Guinea for use in preparing investment proposals
for rice and supporting infrastructural development in the area.
The study should include the following:
i.    assessment of the physical developments required for improving
rice production, e.g. in the case of swamp rice the infrastruc-
ture needed to permit the introduction of better water control,
and to provide for adequate drainage;
ii.    assessment of requirements in terms of improved seeds, fertil-
isers and pesticides, provision of farmer credit, improved mar-
keting and processing facilities, and seed multiplication;
iii.    enumeration of extension, credit and marketing staff required
to support the proposed farmer support services, their availa-
bility, training requirements, logistic support, i.e. housing,
vehicles and recurrent operation;
iv.    the requirements for simple farmer training services within the
proposed project area;
v.    construction of farm feeder roads essential for farm input sup-
plies and crop evacuation, and wells or boreholes for village
water supplies;
vi.    the identification of any health or social constraints which
might prevent production targets being achieved, and proposals
for the removal of such limitations;
vii.    proposals for management of the project taking full cognizance
of current Government practices and shortcomings into account;
1/ In order to formulate draft terms of reference an example using a combi-
nation of swampland/upland rice has been taken.



ANNEX 7
Page 10
viii.    the requirement for research to support the project in achiev-

PINEAPPLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Calculation of Economic Rate of Return
General
1.        The rate of return for outgrower operations has not been calculated
on incremental benefits and costs (see para. 7.01). The cost and benefit
streams represent the full investment and operating costs of developing new
irrigated and rainfed holdings and the total yields therefrom. In the calcula-
tion it is assumed that 80 ha of irrigated outgrow holdings would be established
under the project and 260 ha of rainfed holdings.
Life
2.        The life of the nucleus estate is taken as 21 years, thereby allotting
to the main investment, i.e. the irrigation system, a life of 20 years. As
the system would be fully maintained throughout its life this probably is a
somewhat conservative assumption.  Accent is not taken of any residial value
which also is a conservative assumption. For outgrowers a project life of
14 years is used; this is the life times of two irrigation sets, seven years
each. A similar duration is used for rainfed holdings.
Costs
3.        The investment and operating costs used are those appearing in
Annex 2, and further detailed in Annex 11 - Nucleus Estate, and Annexes 12
and 13 for outgrowers. A 10% physical contingency has been applied to all
costs throughout the life of the project.
4.        All labor, on the nucleus estate and outgrowers holdings, whether
hired or family labor, is costed at Syli 78/man day, see para. 3.10 of main
report.  Local labor is virtually the only local cost element in the project;
thus shadow rating of local labor could be used instead of applylng a shadow
rate of foreign exchange.  At the official exchange rate, a salary of Syli 78/
man day would amount to US$3.80 which is obviously well above the equilibrium
rate in a country with an average rural per capita revenue of $55 per year.
Based on this latter figure a more appropriate shadow rate of local labor
can be established:  Assuming that in the rural sector each adult worker has
1.5 dependent (i.e. that there are on average two working age members in a
family of five) the annual income of an adult rural worker would average
about $138 or USé57.5 per day based on 240 working days per year. Such a
shadow rate of labor would correspond to a salary of Syli 11.8 at the official
exchange rate; expressed differently the shadow rate of exchange of the Syli
would have to be Syl 135.6 = 1 US$ so as to have the shadow rate of USt57.5
coincide with the official salary level of Syli 78/man day's; this is reasonably



ANNEX 14
Page 2
close to the shadow rate of exchange of Syli 120-125 estimated on the basis
of retail price comparisons between Guinea and neighboring countries (see
para. 7 below). Thus, rather than using a shadow wage rate of US,57.5 per
day, a shadow exchange rate of Syli 122.76 per US$ has been used equivalent
to six times the official exchange rate.
Benefits
5.        The yields and prices employed are those appearing at paras 6.01
and 6.05 respectively in the main report. The price used in calculating
project benefits is the "world price"; as there is no "world price" for
pineapples, the price on the French market (the largest in Europe) is used
as a proxy.
6.        Estimating outgrower yields is difficult since on rainfed holdings,
which are assumed to comprise 78% of all outgrowers holdings, yields will
depend very much upon the location of the holding; those in wet valley bottoms
for example should produce much more heavily than the 30 tons/ha predicted;
possibly up to 45 tons/ha. At this time it is not known what proportions of
rainfed holdings would be located on "dry" slopes and "wet" planting sites,
it is assumed that all rainfed outgrowers will use only 50% of the full ferti-
liser requirement and only 50% of the weedicide requirement. It seems reason-
able to assume that growers on "dry" slopes would not benefit from and thus
not use the full level of inputs.
Exchange Rate
7.        Foreign exchange benefits and costs have been converted to Syli at
a shadow exchange rate equal to six times the official rate (see para. 2.07
of main report and para 4 of this Annex). The same rate has been used to
convert local costs (almost exclusively local salaries) into US$. Estimates
of a shadow rate of exchange are based on a comparison of retail prices in
Guinea's parallel market with those in neighboring countries. As Guinea's
official sector is entirely state-controlled, particularly foreign trade,
the notion of effective protection is not useful in these circumstances.
Thus, the shadow exchange rate is best estimated through a comparison of
local prices with those in neighboring countries. Obviously, this could not
be done on the basis of prices in the official market, which is not in
equilibrium as demonstrated by the application of a comprehensive system
of rationing and price controls and in addition covers only a small portion
of the total economy outside mining and public administration. A comparison
of free market retail prices of 22 products including basic foodstuffs like
rice, sugar, vegetables and meat, as well as products like gasoline, soap
and textiles, led the 1973 Bank economic mission to Guinea to estimate the
shadow rate of exchange of the Syli at 135-150 per US$ or six to seven times
the official rate. Taking into account the devaluation of the dollar in
terms of major European currencies during the past two years, a shadow rate
of Syli 120-125 or about six timbs the official rate appears reasonable at
present. This compares well with a rate of Syli 135.6 derived at by comparing
estimated shadow wage rates (expressed in US$) with actual rates expressed in
Sylis (para. 4 above).

Sharing of ForeiRn Mâna§ement and Technical Assistance
Costs Between Nucleus Estate and OutRrcrwers
8.        The costs of the expatriate estate manager, and the technical
assistance employed by the nucleus estate, see Anaex 2, Table 2, have been
prorated as they occur on-a hectarage basis between the nucleus estate and
the outgrower program.
Sensitivity Analysis
9.        The rate of return.for the overall project.is 23%.  Sensitivity
tests show that the rate would fall to 15% if'benefits fell by 10% and costs
increased by 10% simultaneeusîy.. A decline inbenefits of 25X would bring
the rate down to 11%. Additional results are-shov ,below:

rate of return would be âaout Syli 4Û.927 per- US$ or twice the. officiai rate.
There can be little,doubt.,that the present equilibrium rate of foreign exchange
in Guinea is at least that much.
