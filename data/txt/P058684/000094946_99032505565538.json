The project is a follow-up to the first phase project,\n            and will continue to improve infrastructure services.\n            Nevertheless, the strategy will be redefined to target\n            marginal and poor communities, thus, poverty alleviation and\n            human resource development becomes the overall sector\n            objective, with emphasis on poor areas identification,\n            focusing on labor-intensive micro-projects, which will not\n            only preserve capital assets, but increase and promote local\n            job opportunities. Significant portions of project\n            activities are expected to take place in refugee camps, to\n            be implemented with no prejudice against the refugees's\n            inalienable rights. The components of the project include:\n            1) Local government units will identify and implement\n            infrastructure micro-projects. Mostly local contractors,\n            suppliers and laborers will perform work improvements in\n            infrastructure. 2) Technical assistance will be provided to\n            local governments to ensure high quality and responsiveness\n            in micro-project implementation. Technical assistance will\n            also be provided for project management, and to local\n            contractors. 3) Supplemental operating costs will be\n            provided for project execution and management."}, "docdt": "1999-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
