ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            As a Learning and Innovation Loan, the project was intended\n            to help develop and test organizational arrangements,\n            planning and implementation processes, and capacity building\n            programs focused on enabling local institutions to identify,\n            plan, implement, monitor and manage local development\n            activities, with the intention to extend the application of\n            these, once proven effective, under a larger-scale follow-on\n            project. To this end, the lessons learned were discussed\n            extensively in workshops at the village, provincial and\n            national level, documented in project publications and\n            widely disseminated. To inform future design, other lessons\n            warranting  consideration regard the following: Benefits and\n            drawbacks of the LIL instrument, constraints to sustained\n            participation; the several constraints to sustained\n            participation; the forbearance of the  .existing members of\n            the Village Development Committee (VDC) who to their credit,\n            continued their community work in the face of the lack of\n            other volunteers; the difficulties of VDC participation; and\n            the overall funding that constraints, like literacy, limit\n            returns to continued participation ;and the dearth of local\n            contributions in some impoverished communities and the need\n            for flexibility."}, "docdt": "2005-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
