reduction is the central\n            objective within the strategic context, and specific goals\n            of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) are supported by\n            the Northeast Village Development Project, such as rural\n            development and natural resource management enhancement,\n            human resources and poverty reduction improvement, and,\n            institutional capacity strengthening. The two main\n            components of the project consist of: 1) participatory\n            planning and investment, which will include those investment\n            activities based on, and supported by, the development of\n            participatory planning systems. Beginning at the village\n            level, with the creation of the Village Development\n            Committees (VDC), different local government levels will\n            progressively be reached, in a process defined as the Local\n            Development Process (LDP). Through this process the project\n            will finance the costs of participatory rural appraisals,\n            selected on the basis set by the implementation guide\n            criteria. Furthermore, the LDP will assist VDCs in\n            determining the community's development priorities;\n            and, 2) institutional strengthening and project management,\n            i.e., the project will provide resources, both at the\n            provincial and district/commune/village levels, to carry out\n            the establishment of an information systems management;\n            conduct participatory evaluation studies of project\n            performance and impact; review subproject design and\n            construction supervision; and, provide training as needed."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
