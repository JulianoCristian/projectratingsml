Consequently, health hazards arise,\n            resulting from poor quality of drinking water, and low\n            levels of hygiene, and sanitation. This Environmental Action\n            Plan recognizes the need for coordination with other\n            projects in the area, but suggests the project should lead\n            in soil, and water management issues, and offers mitigating\n            measures for: 1) mining ground-water on irrigation, and\n            water supply, emphasizing the need to transfer water\n            management responsibilities to the new wadi institutions,\n            and to train extension workers, and farmers on water\n            management for irrigation. Systemic ground-water monitoring,\n            and testing should be undertaken, to be revised further on;\n            2) soil erosion, and sedimentation, to be assessed through a\n            rigid soil survey, and, a watershed study, to review, and\n            formulate watershed management strategies; 3) sand dune, and\n            river bank protection, to be selectively supported through\n            mechanical, and vegetative control. Sanitation, and potable\n            water issues will be addressed through different Bank operations."}, "docdt": "2000-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
