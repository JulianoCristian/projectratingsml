The\n            project components are: 1) To support the rehabilitation,\n            improvement, and protection of spate irrigation\n            infrastructure, namely Tuban and Zabid schemes,\n            topographical surveys, with detailed design, and hydraulic\n            models testing will be implemented, with supervision on\n            improvements of irrigation systems at the canal level,\n            including wadi levels. This include construction of flood\n            protection, and road rehabilitation works. 2) To enhance\n            irrigation, and environment management, a participatory\n            irrigation management approach will be established, that is,\n            through water users associations (WUA), and a scheme water\n            users federation, with joint management mechanisms, should\n            provide institutional support. Operation and maintenance\n            equipment will be provided, to be leased by the WUAs, and,\n            supported by groundwater, and hydraulic monitoring. 3) An\n            intensive agriculture demonstration program will provide\n            improved agricultural practices, through extension services\n            in technology transfer. 4) Institutional strengthening, and\n            capacity building will support the relevant institutions in\n            the irrigation sector, including legal framework support."}, "docdt": "2000-08-09T00:00:00Z"}
