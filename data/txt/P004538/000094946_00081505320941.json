Valuable lessons are drawn form the project.\n            The need for a focused project design is addressed, in light\n            of the complexity of this project, which was conducive to\n            many implementation delays. Furthermore, it is emphasized,\n            that a Performance Management Framework, be included in\n            future project design, to provide an early, and continuous\n            assessment, of not only the input assessment of the project,\n            but on the outcomes of education quality improvements, and,\n            on the relevance of vocational training as well. Above all,\n            it should include evaluations to measure the effect of\n            investments in capacity building, improved training\n            facilities, and better-trained staff, in addition to the\n            cost effectiveness of public sector training. Implementation\n            procedures should be clearly defined, so as to be fully\n            understood and accepted by local authorities, early on at\n            project preparation; likewise, project management staff\n            should be fully trained at the early stages, to properly\n            apply administrative, and financial management procedures,\n            and thus avoid the capacity building failure experimented in\n            those areas, resulting from weak supervision missions."}, "docdt": "2000-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
