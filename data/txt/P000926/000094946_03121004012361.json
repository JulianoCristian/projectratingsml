environmental impact of a proposed 300-MW,\n            with the potential to upgrade to 600-MW, combined-cycle\n            thermal generating plant to be located 15 km northeast of\n            Sekondi-Takoradi, near the village of Aboadze. This\n            environmental assessment addresses the requirements of the\n            Afican Development Bank and also those of the World Bank as\n            a Category \"A\" project. In general, the analysis\n            indicates that the plant will have modest, but mitigable,\n            environmental impacts. The key potential issues include: 1)\n            the effect of the cooling water on marine life and the\n            consequent effects on the thriving fishing industry of\n            Aboadze and neighboring villages; 2) the effects that the\n            loss of site land will have on nearby families who currently\n            practice predominantly subsistence level agriculture on that\n            site; 3) air quality impacts; and 4) potential spillage\n            and/or leakages of oil."}, "docdt": "2003-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
