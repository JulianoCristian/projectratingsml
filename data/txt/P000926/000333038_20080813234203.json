was\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory;\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: when technologies in the\n            energy sector are new to a country, the length of the\n            Operations and Maintenance (0&M) contract should extend\n            at least up until the first major scheduled overhaul of\n            power plant to ensure that the entire project cycle is\n            covered. This ensures better and sustained transfer of\n            knowledge of power plant management. Furthermore, instead of\n            as assigning individual contracts for sub-tasks of\n            constructing power plant, a single contract such as an\n            Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract can\n            ensure better performance of overall plant operation. The\n            use of the Quality Based Selection (QBS) method could have\n            contributed to ensuring a tighter and higher quality\n            supervision of the contractors for the power plants, and\n            enabled reduction in the significant errors that were made\n            during construction, which in turn led to the delays\n            in-completing the construction of the power plant optimal performance."}, "docdt": "2007-09-07T00:00:00Z"}
