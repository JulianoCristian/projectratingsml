POTL involved erecting pylons approximately every 300\n            meters along the route. This work required access roads,\n            where these did not already exist, as well as staging areas\n            to erect the pylons and string the wire. The Volta River\n            Authority (VRA) subscribes as a matter of policy and\n            practice to the following resettlement objectives: To\n            conceive of and execute resettlement activities in a\n            socially responsible manner as sustainable development\n            programs, providing sufficient resources to enable persons\n            displaced by the project to share in project benefits. To\n            consider involuntary resettlement as an integral part of\n            project design, and deal with resettlement issues from the\n            earliest stages of project preparation. To void land\n            acquisition and involuntary resettlement wherever feasible,\n            and to minimize land acquisition and involuntary\n            resettlement wherever such is unavoidable. To consult with\n            project-affected persons (PAPs) in a meaningful manner, and\n            to provide opportunity for their participation in the\n            planning and execution of resettlement programs. To assist\n            PAPs in proportion to impact, recognizing the special needs\n            of vulnerable populations. To compensate PAPs fully and\n            fairly for all assets lost permanently or temporarily, which\n            means timely payment of full replacement value prior to\n            construction. To ensure that all PAPs who lose residences or\n            business are provided acceptable alternative accommodations\n            before demolition of the structure and construction of the\n            infrastructure. To ensure that PAPs who lose\n            income-generating resources are assisted in their efforts to\n            improve their livelihoods and standards of living or at\n            least restore them."}, "docdt": "2003-12-02T00:00:00Z"}
