is\n            Component 2, which establishes community-based mechanisms\n            for biodiversity conservation and sustainable resources use,\n            and supports civil works to improve protected area\n            facilities and management. Mitigating measures are outlined\n            as follows: Dust from transporting and handling construction\n            works will be minimized by water and other means such as\n            enclosure of construction sites. To reduce noise,\n            construction will be restricted during certain hours. All\n            debris, construction, and wood waste will be stored within\n            the work site. Wood waste will be stored separately and\n            arranged for recycling. Open burning and illegal dumping\n            will not be permitted. Proper sites for earth/clay and sand\n            dispersal will be determined and prior approval from\n            relevant authority for disposal obtained. Stockpiling\n            construction debris on-site will be avoided and waste\n            disposed regularly at an authorized dumping ground. Debris\n            chutes will transfer debris efficiently from higher floors\n            to the ground floor to prevent nuisance. New campsites\n            selection will be based on a criteria that will minimize\n            impacts on fauna and flora. New trail design will consider a\n            set of criteria including slope, drainage, susceptibility to\n            soil erosion, and traffic management. Identifying suitable\n            sites and using garbage receptacles will prevent degradation\n            of site conditions."}, "docdt": "2002-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
