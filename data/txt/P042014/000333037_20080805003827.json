follows: outcomes\n            were highly satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: to achieve a balance among types of small\n            grant activities, it is recommended that each type of\n            activity is funded through different windows.\n            Income-generating projects were in higher demand than\n            education and capacity-building projects; however, the need\n            for capacity-building remained at the end of the project. A\n            better balance might have been achieved through dedicated\n            funds for capacity building rather than having a single\n            window for education, capacity building, and income\n            generation projects. The Conservation and Rural\n            Revitalization Grants (CRRG) Program proactively encouraged\n            local people to prepare project applications and the Program\n            fostered entrepreneurial pursuits. Project proposals that\n            were not selected in the first round were given additional\n            support to improve on their ideas and proposals, with the\n            result that more than half were accepted in the second\n            round. All applications were retained in a database for\n            consideration in case additional funding became available.\n            Unfinanced project proposals from Primorsko-Goranska County\n            were retained and later included in the project pipeline for\n            the European Union (EU) regional operational programs. Such\n            lists and databases not only provide ideas for further\n            development but also incentives for more proactive local\n            rural development."}, "docdt": "2008-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
