biodiversity conservation, and protection of the Karst\n            environment. To this end, the project components will: 1)\n            build the national capacity for biodiversity conservation,\n            by strengthening the environmental, and biodiversity legal,\n            and regulatory framework regarding sectoral strategies. The\n            component will finance training; the preparation of\n            protected area management, and planning guidelines based on\n            market analysis and a financing strategy; and as well,\n            feasibility studies for other eligible protected areas,\n            comprising a biodiversity analysis, assessment of water\n            management issues for expansion of species under legal\n            protection. Furthermore, biodiversity inventory, mapping,\n            and monitoring will be financed through consultant services,\n            and necessary equipment; 2) establish community-based\n            mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, and sustainable\n            resource uses, through capacity building and activities for\n            protected area management. This entails the promotion of\n            nature-based tourism, increased public awareness, and,\n            improved management and services for protected area\n            management and biodiversity conservation. Additionally, a\n            rural revitalization program will link conservation goals,\n            and, a regional cooperation program for the Karst ecosystem\n            conservation will be financed; and, 3) finance project\n            management, and monitoring, which includes donor\n            cooperation, and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2002-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
