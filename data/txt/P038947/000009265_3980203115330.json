It will support reform efforts and\n            finance investments designed to: a) stimulate private sector\n            financing and execution of research and development; b)\n            increase and improve the stock of S&T human capital; and\n            c) supply support services required to increase the\n            efficiency of public and private investments in S&T\n            activities.  The project has three components.  First, the\n            technology development component will stimulate\n            R&D&E (research, development, and nonroutine\n            engineering) activities in the private sector, focusing on\n            innovations by small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs).\n            Second, the S&T research component will increase and\n            improve the stock of high-level human capital, focusing on\n            investments on scientific research and graduate training\n            under improved procedures and policies.  Third, the sectoral\n            support activities will improve efficiency and quality\n            throughout the S&T system.  This will support portfolio\n            protection of intellectual property rights, and provision of\n            metrology, standards, testing, and quality (MSTQ) services."}, "docdt": "1997-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
