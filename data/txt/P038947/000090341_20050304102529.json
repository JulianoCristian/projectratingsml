The lessons learned indicate that\n            Public-private partnerships in the Technology Development\n            Component proved to be a highly effective mechanism to\n            benefit the Brazilian Science and Technology (S&T)\n            market. Private funding and partnership commitment secured\n            technology transfer in most cases. Competitive funding in\n            both the Technology Development and the Science and\n            Technology Research Components was an important factor in\n            the level of commitment and the quality of output generated.\n            Complexity in project design is exacerbated during times of\n            crisis, and may de facto create blocks of consolidation\n            around critical core functions and programs. In order for\n            Brazil to become fully competitive with other advanced\n            countries in terms of science, technology and innovation, it\n            would be necessary to further improve the Ministry of\n            Science and Technology (MCT's) capacity for policy\n            formulation.
