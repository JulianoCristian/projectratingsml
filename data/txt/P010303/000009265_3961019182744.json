The project achieved some of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            negligible, sustainability is unlikely, and the performance\n            of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, it is\n            recommended that more effective institutional arrangements\n            for project implementation and monitoring are established.\n            Second, there is a need to ensure that continuous monitoring\n            and feedback influences project attributes in order to adapt\n            to changing ground conditions. Finally, it is important to\n            build sufficient capacity in traditional institutions early\n            on to enable their meaningful participation in formulating\n            and appraising the project."}, "docdt": "1995-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
