The structural works associated with the first phase\n            of this program of bank stabilization are known as the\n            Priority Works. The EIA has been undertaken to ascertain\n            what are the likely, significant environmental changes as a\n            result of the implementation of the Priority Works and, if\n            these changes are negative, what mitigating measures should\n            be taken to lessen their impact both during construction and\n            thereafter. These package of measures is sometimes referred\n            to as an Environmental Management Plan (EMP)."}, "docdt": "1992-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
