A further\n            objective is to assist the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) in\n            developing permanent institutions for improved water sector\n            planning, preserving the institutional capacity developed\n            under the Flood Action Plan (FAP) and making\n            multi-disciplinary planning part of Bangladesh's normal\n            water sector planning processes. The project's\n            components are: 1) rehabilitation and construction of\n            river-bank protection works at two sites on the Brahmaputra\n            River's west bank; 2) land acquisition and a program of\n            resettlement for people displaced by project works; 3)\n            technical assistance for implementation supervision and\n            maintenance of works constructed under the project; 4)\n            establishment and initial funding of a specialized\n            operations and maintenance (O&M) Unit in the Bangladesh\n            Water Development Board (BWDB) to maintain the riverbank\n            protection works constructed under the project, and\n            procurement of vehicles and equipment for the O&M Unit;\n            5) institution building technical assistance to Water\n            Resources Planning Organization (WARPO) to integrate the FAP\n            within the framework of national water planning, produce a\n            national water management plan and a portfolio of investment\n            projects for the medium and long-term, and upgrade\n            integrated water sector planning capability; and 6)\n            institutional capacity building technical assistance to BWDB\n            to improve the operation of the new regional accounting\n            centers, and provision of equipment and transport to improve\n            project supervision capability in the field and internal communications."}, "docdt": "1995-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
