Among the general lessons, it is\n            conveyed that the use of Independent Panel of Experts\n            (IPOEs) is effective, provided both the implementing\n            agencies (IAs), and the IPOEs clearly understand the\n            intended terms of reference, and the IAs adequately manage\n            the panel's outputs. This reinforces, that in order to\n            ensure cost-effectiveness, and maximize the benefit of\n            technical assistance (TA), a proactive management of the\n            consultants' assignment by the contracting project\n            agency, must be enforced. Furthermore, payment terms of TA\n            contracts should be linked, as possible, to measurable\n            contract outputs, rather than relying on time-based\n            payments, to reduce potential cost overruns, and/or delayed\n            outputs. As well, international competitive bidding\n            procedures are highly advantageous, when undertaking civil\n            works in difficult physical situations, such as riverbank\n            protection, particularly when contract management operates\n            in an independent professional manner, unconstrained by\n            outside interests. Specific lessons address the need to\n            strengthen the procurement management capacity of the\n            Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), to avoid\n            fragmentation of works, by developing a core of\n            professionals within the implementing agency to supervise\n            procurement matters, including as well, built-in periodic\n            procurement audits for future designs. BWDB financial\n            management should in addition, be strengthened through\n            institutional arrangements to build capacity, assessed in\n            the context of BWDB's institutional reform program."}, "docdt": "2002-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
