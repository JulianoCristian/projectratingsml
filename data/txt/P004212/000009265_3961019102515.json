The project will support\n            about 30 ODS phase-out subprojects to be implemented by ODS\n            consuming enterprises during the next three years and to be\n            funded under this umbrella project. It will cover major ODS\n            use sectors in Malaysia including refrigeration,\n            air-conditioning, foams, aerosols, solvents, and halon. The\n            first three already approved subprojects will result in the\n            phase-out of about 339 metric tons of Ozone Depleting\n            Potential (ODP) annually. The project is expected to be\n            completed by December 31, 1998."}, "docdt": "1995-08-11T00:00:00Z"}
