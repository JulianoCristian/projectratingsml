                         The project will assist the Government in meeting its obligations to phase out use of Ozone Depleting Substances within its territory through implementation of
                         the National CFC Phaseout Plan(NCFCP). It is an integral part of an international activities which have been undertaken since 1987 to reverse the damage to the
                         Ozone layer.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project assisted the Government of Malaysia to meet its obligations to phase-out consumption of ozone depleting substances (ODS). Since the effectiveness of the Grant
                         Agreement, both investment sub-project and institutional development components were implemented to facilitate the phase-out of ODS. The conversion of manufacturing process to

                         project were also completed. The project could assist Malaysia to phase-out total consumption of CFCs, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride by 3,010 ODP tons from the
                         baseline level of 3,896 ODP tons in 1993 (the remaining consumption was phased out through assistance from other implementing agencies e.g. UNDP). As a result, there has
                         been no import of CFCs, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride since 2010. In addition to ODS reduction, the project assisted the Government of Malaysia to establish
                         regulatory frameworks that supported ODS phase-out activities throughout 15 years implementation of the project. Moreover, Malaysia continues its commitment to sustainable ODS
                         phase-out through training program to build capacity of concerned government officers and private sector professionals.
