1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Programmatic Private and Financial Sector Development Policy Loans (PFDPLs) to the
Republic of Serbia were a series of two operations during the period 2009-2010, totaling EUR
105.7 million (US$150 equivalent) of World Bank funding. The PFDPL series was designed to
support the Government of Serbia (GoS) structural reform program through improvements in the
business environment, continued reform in the enterprise sector and public utilities and building
a more efficient and stable financial sector. The PFDPL series was originally envisaged to
include three operations, however, the plan for a Third PFDPL was changed to allow for the use
of a Policy Based Guarantee in the amount of EUR 300 million, upon request from the
Government of Serbia. As a policy based guarantee is not a Development Policy Loan (DPL)
option under current Bank policies, the PFDPL series had to be terminated after PFDPL 2, and
PFDPL 3 was transformed into a stand-alone Policy Based Guarantee operation, with the same
policy matrix as the originally envisaged PFDPL 3.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Serbia began its transition to a market economy late and under difficult circumstances. The
1990s was a lost decade for Serbia. Its economy was devastated by regional conflicts,
international sanctions, and trade shocks following the break-up of the former Yugoslavia in
1991. These effects were compounded by delayed transition and poor economic management. By
2000 recorded GDP had fallen to below one-half of its 1989 level, while other central and
eastern European countries had made significant progress on the transition path.

In January 2001, the new Government launched an ambitious reform program for a rapid
transition to a more market oriented economy, normalization of relations with foreign creditors,
and integration with regional, EU and world markets. Fiscal balance was achieved in 2004, as
structural reforms began to have impact and expenditure commitments were reduced, and a
surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP was achieved in 2005.

The Serbian economy grew rapidly during the first decade of the century and until 2008, fuelled
by capital inflows, exports and domestic demand, and supported by the economic reforms
mentioned above. GDP growth averaged 5.4 percent per year during 2001-08, with exports
growing at an average annual rate of around 30 percent, albeit from a low base. Output rose in
real terms by nearly 50 percent between 2000 and 2008, as the corporate sector started to post
profits and the banking sector restructured. About 80 percent of growth was attributed to non-
tradable sectors (financial, telecoms, retail).

Strong economic growth was, however, accompanied by a widening external current account
deficit, rapid credit growth, increasing private sector debt and non-performing loans in the period
immediately preceding the financial crisis. Imports grew faster than exports and the trade deficit
reached 22.8 percent of GDP in 2008. The external current account deficit increased from 8.7
percent in 2005 to 18.3 percent in 2008, driven by a widening private sector savings-investment
imbalance (about 90 percent of the deficit in 2008). The contraction of global demand and



                                                1
spending largely impacted the real sector and the competitive position of private sector
companies.

The economy also faced the remnants of the previous systems in the forms of cumbersome,
business-unfriendly regulations with legislation not compatible with the European Union, slow
public administration and large number of “socially-owned” enterprises in the portfolio of the
Privatization Agency (PA).

The business regulatory environment, a key factor for sustainable and stable private sector
growth and job creation, needed improvement to facilitate firm entry and growth and
approximation to the business regulations of the European Union. The Government started a
comprehensive reform program in business entry, adoption of key elements of business
legislation, enhancement of access to finance and introduction of Regulatory Impact Assessment
(RIA) in the legislative process. The new Government in 2008-2009 demonstrated commitment
to deepen the reforms and further enhance the business climate in the country, by streamlining
the business registration procedures, improving the legal framework for corporate governance,
commencing the implementation of a comprehensive regulatory review called “regulatory
guillotine”, institutionalizing RIA and strengthening its role, simplifying the process of issuance
of construction permits and strengthening the framework for enforcement of contracts.

For the remaining socially owned enterprises (SOEs), the GoS developed a program to
strengthen financial discipline, as instrumental for facilitating the restructuring, privatization
and/or bankruptcy of remaining of SOEs.

In the energy sector, for integration into the regional and pan-European oil, power and gas
markets and ensuring energy security, the Government introduced sector reforms including
modernization of the energy infrastructure, restructuring, cost-effective tariffs and private sector
participation.

In the financial sector, substantial reforms were undertaken to deal with the state ownership in
the banking and insurance sectors, develop the capital markets, improve the legal framework for
supervision and introduce measures to insure stability in the sector during and following the
financial crisis.

The banking sector faced the global financial crisis in a healthy situation, with high liquidity and
capital buffers due to conservative policies by National Bank of Serbia (NBS). However, the
magnitude of the international crisis revealed some challenges. A fast withdrawal of over 15% of
deposits by depositors took place amid false media reports and rumors in late 2008. The GoS
adopted then a set of measures for crisis preparedness. The measures aimed at maintaining
consumer confidence and stability in the banking sector and included the launching of a financial
sector support program (FSSP) under the auspices of the “Vienna initiative (with 10 foreign
banks and their home supervisors) and with support from the IMF”. In addition, a comprehensive
program for restructuring and consolidation of state-owned banks, strengthening of the insurance
supervision and development of capital markets legal framework (Securities Law and Law on
Business Entities).

The economy picked up in 2010, despite the fact that it was severely hit by the global crisis.
Strong exports and the adoption of timely and appropriate measures were key in re-establishing
macroeconomic stability.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of Programmatic Private and Financial DPL series is to support the Government of
Serbia reform actions in three policy areas: (i) enhancing business environment to encourage
new business and attract foreign direct investments (FDI); (ii) strengthening financial discipline
by enhancing hard budget constraints in the enterprise sector through continued reform of SOEs
and restructuring of public utilities; and (iii) building a more efficient and stable financial sector
through continuing the divestment of state ownership in the banking and insurance sectors,
strengthening prudential supervision of banking and encouraging development of the capital
markets.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

There were no revisions of the PDOs.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The objective of the PFDPL series was supposed to be achieved through supporting reforms
carried out by the GoS in three pillars of policy areas under the three consequent operations:

Pillar I: Enhancing business environment
     Further simplification of business entry through implementation of a single agency
        approach to business registration;
     Improving the legal framework for strengthening corporate governance and facilitating
        business entry and operations;
     Streamlining regulations of business operations and reducing business compliance costs;
     Improving legal and institutional framework for competition;
     Improving effectiveness of contract enforcement.

Pillar II: Strengthening financial discipline
     Improving financial discipline in the socially-owned enterprise (SOE) sector;
     Privatization, restructuring and bankruptcy of socially-owned enterprises;
     Continuing reforms in the energy sector.

Pillar III: Building a more efficient and stable financial sector
     Privatization and divestment of state-owned banks (SOB) and financial assets (non-
        performing loans (NPLs), insurance companies, equities, etc.);
     Enhancing crisis preparedness and market confidence;
     Strengthening insurance sector regulation and resolution regime;
     Enhancing prudential supervision of the banking sector; and
     Strengthening capital markets regulatory and supervisory regime.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

N/A

1.6 Other significant changes

The PFDPL series was initially envisaged to consist of a series of three regular development
policy loans to support the structural reform agenda of the Government of Serbia. However, as
the international crisis hit Serbia, it was necessary to adjust the scope and refocus the design of
the operations to include measures aimed at maintaining stability in the banking sector.
Furthermore, on request from the GoS, the PFDPL series was terminated after the completion of
the Second PFDPL operation, whereas the planned Third PFDPL in the series was transformed
into a [stand-alone] Private and Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee (PFSPBG) in the
amount of up to 300 million EUR (not exceeding an equivalent of 400 million USD). The
cancelation of the third PFDPL was deemed consistent with the overall support to the original
objectives of the PFDPL. The PFSPBG followed up on the implementation of the reforms
supported by the PFDPL1 and PFDPL2. Use of the policy based guarantee allowed Serbia to
benefit from access to the international capital markets at lower costs and longer maturities,
driven by the need to match the country’s debt portfolio management and reduced funding costs.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Government Priorities and Commitment: The GoS put private sector development at the
center of its strategy to promote growth and income convergence of European level. To increase
the private sector contribution to growth, the GoS implemented a series of policy measures to
increase productivity and investment, upgrading the physical infrastructure and its quality,
improving the business environment, privatizing non-private enterprises, and promoting financial
sector policies and FDI promotion. In fact, the core of GoS’s growth agenda was composed of
improvements in the business environment, financial discipline/divestment of non-private
enterprises and financial sector development. Although, by the second PFDPL, emphasis was
placed on the financial sector in order to reduce macroeconomic/financial risks and prepare the
country to better cope with a global financial crisis.

The Government has expressed commitment to deepen the reforms in the following areas which
the PFDPL (1 and 2) supported:

Further enhance the business climate in the country, by streamlining the business registration
procedures, improving the legal framework for corporate governance, implementing a
comprehensive regulatory review called “regulatory guillotine”, by simplifying the process of
issuance of construction permits and strengthening the framework for enforcement of contracts;
In relation to the remaining socially owned enterprises (SOEs), the GoS facilitated the
restructuring, privatization and/or bankruptcy of remaining of SOEs, by enacting amendments to
the Privatization Law, continuing with the privatization/resolution of SoEs and enacting the new
Law on Bankruptcy
Further, in response to the global financial crisis, the Government adopted a set of measures
aimed at strengthening crisis preparedness by maintaining consumer confidence and stability in
the banking sector and by launching a financial sector support program (FSSP) under the
auspices of the “Vienna initiative” (with 10 foreign banks and their home supervisors) and with
support from the IMF. In addition, a comprehensive program for restructuring and consolidation
of state-owned banks, strengthening of the insurance supervision and development of capital
markets legal framework (Securities Law and the Company Law).

EU Accession: A major factor affecting implementation was Serbia’s desire to accede to the EU.
Around such desire, major forces seemed to have coalesced. EU accession has come to be
perceived as the key driver of Serbia’s economic reforms, and to some extent as a source of
stability in a region with a history of political instability. The objective of EU accession was
particularly influential in the number of Laws which were developed with the PFDPL support as
well as of other laws and by-laws, which complied with EU requirements. In April 2008 the
Government Serbia signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) and in December
2009, submitted its application for EU membership. In February 2010, the Interim Agreement on
Trade and Trade-related issues between Serbia and the EU (part of the SAA) entered into force.
The importance of EU accession in the commitment of Serbia to the key reforms supported by
the PFDPL (and other World Bank operations) could not be underestimated.

History of successful cooperation in policy reforms with the World Bank: The reforms
supported by the PFDPL series built upon (and continued) previous budget support policy

                                               6
operations financed by the World Bank which the GoS implemented with a good degree of
success since the early 2000s. The operations included the Programmatic Private and Financial
Development Policy Credit (PPFDPC-1) and a successful series of two consecutive Private and
Financial Sector Adjustment Credits (PFSACs). The PFSAC-I focused on initial reform
measures in five areas: (i) banking sector reform, (ii) reform of socially owned enterprises; (iii)
bank asset and enterprise workouts; and (iv) financial sector regulatory and supervisory
framework. The PFDPL is, to a large extent, a continuation of the PFSAC. The Serbian
institutions designing and implementing the reforms developed a fluid and constructive
cooperation with the World Bank teams.

Global financial crisis: The global financial crisis severely affected Serbia and impacted also
the focus of the PFDPL program. First, the pace of SOE privatization slowed down considerably
due to lack of interested FDI. Moreover a number of already signed privatization contracts had to
be cancelled due to lack of investments by the buyers. As a result, the PFDPL program with
respect to SOEs focused more on the introduction of a new, more efficient bankruptcy
framework for all companies, including SOEs. Secondly the program supported by the PFDPL
had also to be modified to take into account the impact of the global crisis on the banking sector.
This meant that the financial sector pillar had to include a new focus on bank diagnostics, crisis
preparedness and bank resolution.

Collaboration and coordination with the IMF and Other Donors: Reforms in Serbia were
supported by the World Bank and other key international development partners in a collaborated
and coordinated approach. The Bank maintained close working relations with the IMF and other
donors (such as EAR, SIDA, USAID, DFID) assisting the GoS for the purposes of harmonizing
policy reforms, seeking synergies among the respective operations and avoiding overlaps. The
international support has been substantial and required intensive coordination.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

At the Government level, the Ministry of Finance was responsible for the overall implementation
of the proposed operation and for reporting process and coordinating actions among other
concerned ministries and agencies. At the same time, the Bank has been monitoring actions and
reviewing progress of the implementation of the proposed operation, as well as the subsequent
actions of the GoS program by using [the short term] reform benchmarks and the overall
program outcomes outlined in the Policy Matrix. The results achieved by the development policy
loan series was documented in the respective appraisals, aide memoires, Government and EU
progress reports and from intensive communications/interviews with the key counterparts. A
good set of indicators and benchmarks was initially developed to monitor the achievement of
results. The (only) ISR so far produced did not include existing information on progress as all
outcome targets were established for the end of year 2010. This lack of formal reporting seemed
associated with the fast turn of events, particularly the acceleration of the Second PFDPLs on
request from the Government in the context of global financial crisis (within a period of six
months from the delivery to the Board of the First PFDPL).
2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

On request by the Government of Serbia, in the aftermath of the global economic crisis, the
PFDPL series (1-2) was followed by a Private and Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee,

                                                7
instead of a Third PFDPL as originally planned. The PFPBG advanced the reforms in the
business environment, enterprise sector and financial sector envisioned by the PFDPL series,
while helping the Government of Serbia to borrow at more favorable terms from the international
capital markets.

A World Bank Trust Fund funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)
supported the regulatory reform process. Going forward, a World Bank’s Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) grant will support the creation of a permanent government body in
charge of regulatory reform and regulatory impact assessment. A second IDF grant is assisting
the GoS with pilot incorporation of Serbian Post (which owns Postal Bank and Telekom), a
process which should enhance corporate governance. Under the Capital Markets Development
technical assistance, assistance has been provided to the Public Debt Management Authority
(PDMA) to identify key issues in the area of government securities market development, provide
support in initiating their resolution, and strengthen the PDMA’s technical capacity. Finally
assistance in upgrading the crisis framework for the financial sector, and in particular on
strengthening the DIA and bank resolution framework, has been provided under the regional
World Bank funded Western Balkans Facility. As we can see, the PFDPL is clearly inserted in a
longer term strategy to contribute to Serbia’s reforms.

The GoS remains committed to completing the substantial reform program implemented thus far
in private and financial sector areas. While, the GoS has made considerable progress in the
business environment, privatization/restructuring/bankruptcy of non-private enterprises, and in
financial sector development, the reform agenda has not yet been completed. In the short term,
the GoS is committed to advancing the businesses environment reforms into further improving
construction permits and completing the implementation of the regulations of business activities
recommendation. As far as privatization and restructuring is concerned, the GoS plans to proceed
with the incorporation of Railways and Post, two large state owned enterprises, and with the
privatization of Telekom. Finally regarding the financial sector, the GoS plans to divest its
minority stakes in banks and privatize the last state owned insurance company, Dunav. On the
regulatory front, the NBS is planning implementation of Basel 2 by the end of 2011.

The current four-year Country Partnership Strategy covers the period FY08-FY11, so that Serbia
and the World Bank will soon reassess priorities and cooperation for the next CPS period.
However, it is certain that support to the EU agenda and deepening of the reforms will be the
essence of the Strategy.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the PFDPL were consistent with major challenges for the economy and
reflected in the first priority area of the Serbia Country Partnership Strategy 2008-2011:
“Dynamic Private Sector Led Growth to Ensure Incomes Converge with Europe.” The PFDPL
series addressed a set of objectives outlined under this priority area: (i) further improving the
business environment, particularly cumbersome licensing and permit arrangements; (ii)
strengthening the financial sector intermediation; (iii) completing divestiture of socially-owned

                                               8
enterprises; (iv) strengthening enforcement of bankruptcy and other mechanisms to ensure the
assets of insolvent socially-owned enterprises unable to be sold can be freed up for productive
use; (v) continuing the process o f privatizing and restructuring of large state-owned enterprises;
and (vi) strengthening the competitiveness of the enterprise sector.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The OVERALL PFDPL PROGRAM OBJECTIVES were to:

      Improve the business environment so as to facilitate start-ups and stimulate new
       investments, thus economic growth and job creation;
      Minimize fiscal outlays through substantially reducing direct and indirect subsidies,
       complete the privatization of socially-owned enterprises, and further restructure state
       enterprises and public utilities; and,
      Improve efficiency, governance and divestiture of the government’s holdings in the
       banking and insurance sectors, strengthen crisis preparedness and sector resilience, and
       improve the regulatory and supervisory regimes so as to reduce vulnerabilities.

Key reforms supported by PFDPL 1 and 2:

PFDPL 1:
   Establishment of a one-stop shop for business registration, e-registration and introduction
     of a unique business registration number.
   Adoption of a GoS strategy on implementation of a comprehensive review of regulations
     of business activities.
   Enactment of amendments to the Privatization Law that set a time limit for the completion
     of the process.
   Continuation of privatization of SOEs (as a result some 300 socially owned enterprises
     were sold).
   Capitalization of the DIF.
   Privatization of DDOR.

PFDPL2:
   Adoption of the Law on Protection of Competition, Law on Bankruptcy, Law on State
     Aid.
   Sale of residual shares held in the Privatization Registry.
   Diagnostic assessment of all the banks in the system.
   Adoption by the NBS of a liquidity framework.
   Strategy of consolidation of state owned banks.
   Adoption of Law on Mandatory Traffic Insurance (related to motor third party liability).

All core and non-core benchmarks under PFDPL 1 and PFDPL 2 were implemented and the
expected outcomes of the program have been largely accomplished, particularly in Pillar I
(Enhancing Business Environment) and Pillar III (Building a More Efficient and Stable Financial
System). While several reforms in Pillar II (Strengthening Financial Discipline of SOEs) were
implemented, some expected outcomes particularly in the energy sector and related to
                                                9
privatization of state –owned enterprises have not been achieved partly due to longer-term
processes and because of the market conditions during and following the global economic crisis.

Summing up, 27 Outcomes indicators had been identified, out of which:

             17 expected outcomes were Achieved, or 63% of the total number of outcomes.
             5 were Not Achieved, or 18 %.
             3 were Partially Achieved, or 11 % .
             For 2 objectives, the information was insufficient to form a judgment.

It should be stressed that the outcome indicators were designed for a series of three development
policy loans, but the third loan was cancelled due to the GoS desire to avail of a policy based
guarantee instead.

The status of the individual expected outcomes is as follows:

Pillar I: Enhance Business Environment

Policy area 1.1. Further simplification of the business entry through implementation of single
agency approach for business registration.

Outcome: Reduction of the business registration time from 23 days in 2006 to 5 days in
2010. Status: Achieved and exceeded.

The GoS transformed the SBRA into a one-stop-shop for business registration. The one-stop-
shop system for registering a company has been in place since May 2009. The number of steps to
register a business was reduced from 11 to 8. It now takes on average 5 instead of 23 days to
register a business. According to the EU Progress Report 2010 for Serbia, the number of
registered companies stood at 113,000 in May 2010, up from 106,000 in April 2009.
Approximately 225,000 entrepreneurs were registered with the Serbian Business Registry
Agency, i.e. around 5,000 more than a year earlier. The Agency has also further extended the
number of registers, including the Registry for Financial Statements. A single form is now used
to register new workers to the Pension Fund or the Health Fund. This reform represents a
considerable reduction in business compliance costs resulting in annual savings of approximately
EUR 15 million, calculated according to the standard cost model.

Outcome: Unique business identification number is introduced and assigned to all
businesses in 2010. Status: Achieved.

Phase 2 of the one-stop shop reforms, introduced a unique business identification number for all
purposes. The SBRA implemented this reform by (i) establishing cooperation with all relevant
institutions; (ii) commissioning feasibility study and technical needs assessment for establishing
interconnection of all relevant public databases; and (iii) commencing unification of registration
procedures for entrepreneurs on a pilot basis.

Policy area 1.2: Improving legal framework for strengthening corporate governance and
facilitating business operations

                                                        12
Outcome: Enhanced legal framework for improvement of corporate governance and
attraction of foreign and domestic investments. Status: Achieved.

To strengthen corporate governance and facilitate business operation, a new Law on Business
Entities was approved by the Parliament. The new law, in compliance with new EU directives,
includes provisions to: (i) harmonize presently conflicting provisions of the Law on Business
Entities and the Law on Securities Market; (ii) regulate entrepreneurs (at the same time the
existing Law on Private Entrepreneurs will be abolished); (iii) regulate existing business
associations (i.e. Association of Banks), which have been omitted in the existing Law on
Business Entities; (iv) regulate the establishment, operations and closure of branch offices of
foreign legal entities, and (v) define the duties and responsibilities of management and improve
corporate governance by allowing the option of choosing between one- or two-tier corporate
governance system for Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) and JSCs. Reforms under (ii) alone
should lead to a reduction in administrative costs for businesses estimated in approximately EUR
6 million per year.

Outcome: The Doing Business Investor Protection Index increased from 5.3 in 2007 to
exceed the OECD average of 6.0 in 2010. This outcome has not been achieved yet, however
good progress has been made in that direction.

The Strength of Investor Protection Index, as measures by Doing Business, has remained 5.3
throughout the reform period until 2010. It is not clear whether the type of reforms which were
implemented largely driven by the EU agenda were related to the range of the measurement of
the strength of investor protection index. This complex index is the average of the extent of
disclosure index, the extent of director liability index and the ease of shareholder suits index, as
measured by the Doing Business. The new Law on Business Entities was adopted on May 24th
2011. It includes improvements in the area of investor protection and corporate governance in
line with the EU directives, which should help with achieving the outcome by the end of 2011.

Policy Area 1.3: Streamlining regulations of business activities and reducing business
compliance costs.

Outcome: Priorities for the regulatory reform established, mechanisms for their
implementation defined, transparency of the legislative process increased. Status: Achieved.

The GoS introduced a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirement in the legislative process in
2004 to improve the quality of new regulations. The implementation of the RIA will ensure that
new regulations (i.e. the legislative flow) are based on a clear rationale and adequate analysis of
costs and benefits. To reduce compliance costs of existing business regulations (legislative
stock), a comprehensive regulatory review was completed in accordance with the Government
Strategy adopted under the PFDPL1. The regulatory review was initiated in early 2009 and
consisted of four phases: inventory, analysis, recommendations, and implementation. As a result
of the inventory, 2,000 laws and regulations were identified as impacting economic activity. The
Council for Regulatory Reform also formed ten working groups chaired by a representative of the
private sector to further analyze the 2,000 laws and regulations and recommend simplification

                                                13
actions. It is estimated that the measures already adopted at recommendations of the review
resulted in annual cost savings to businesses of around EUR 50.8 million. The work on
regulatory amendments continues. If all recommendations of the review are adopted, the savings
for the business are estimated at EUR 200 million.

Outcome: Reduced regulatory compliance costs of business measured by BEEPs (9.6% of
management time in 2005), ICS and other enterprise surveys. Status: No information
available for the relevant period.

Information on the savings measured by management time is not available for the relevant period.
The latest BEEPS was conducted in 2008. BEEPS 2008 indicates that 12% of management time
in all firms was spent in dealing with public officials or public services, an increase from 10% in
2005. However, impact in monetary terms was assessed using standard cost model as EUR 50.8
million and is expected to reach EUR 200 mil once all recommendations of the legal review are
implemented.

Policy area 1.4: Simplify the process of obtaining construction permits.

Outcome: Procedures for obtaining planning and construction permits simplified, related
compliance costs reduced: duration decreased from 204 days in 2006 by at least 25% in
2010, and compliance cost reduced from 3,300 (% of income per capita) in 2006 by at least
50% in 2010. Status: Partially achieved.

In July 2009 Serbia adopted a new Law on Spatial Planning and Construction. This Law
formally reduced the time and costs associated with obtaining construction permits by setting
deadlines for municipalities to prepare and adopt urban plans and general regulation plans and by
eliminating certain redundant steps in the process. However, the legal amendments have not
translated into better results in Doing Business. Serbia dropped by two places in 2010 as
compared to the position in 2009. Furthermore, according to Doing Business 2011 (measuring
indicators as of June 1, 2010), now it takes longer (279 days as opposed to 205 days in 2005) to
obtain a construction permit, despite the reduction of one step in the process. There has been a
significant improvement in the reduction of the cost of obtaining a construction permit from
4,209 percent of income per capita in 2005 to 1,821 percent in 2010. The EU Progress Report
2010 for Serbia also notes that the process of obtaining construction permits remains to be a long
and difficult for businesses. One reason for this may be the fact that the reforms are not yet
effectively implemented at the local level.

Policy Area 1.5: Improving legal and institutional framework for competition.

Outcome: Improved competition framework creating level playing field for business and
conducive for foreign investments. Status: Achieved.

This was a legal-institutional outcome. In the summer of 2009, the GoS enacted a new Law on
Protection of Competition which overcame the deficiencies of the previous Law of 2005. In
addition, GoS adopted eight new regulations required to implement the new Law on Protection of
Competition. These regulations had been originally included in PFDPL 3. The new Law on

                                               14
Protection of Competition addressed all major business concerns, removed the disincentives to
foreign direct investment, strengthened the independences of the Commission for Protection of
Competition and is fully in line with EU standards.

Policy Area 6: Improving effectiveness of contracts enforcement.

Outcome: Improved enforcement of contracts: duration of enforcement procedures
reduced from 635 days in 2008 to approximate to the regional average of 425 days. Status:
Not achieved (as of June 2010).

Enforcement mechanisms remain a stumbling block for business operations. According to the
Doing Business 2011 indicators on enforcing contracts, Serbia ranks 94th in the world, with 635
days necessary for enforcement. Therefore, there is no indication of improvement. To speed up
enforcement processes, a new Law on Enforcement and Security was recently adopted by the
Parliament. The new Law will enhance the enforcement of court decisions as well as enforcement
based on authentic documents, such as contracts and invoices. To this end, the Law introduced
the concept of professional enforcement officers (i.e. private bailiffs) licensed and supervised by
the Ministry of Justice. On the basis of the new legislation, it is expected that Serbia will improve
its ranking in enforcing contracts in Doing Business 2012 (to be issued in the fall of 2011).

Pillar II: Strengthening Financial Discipline

Policy area 2.1: Improving financial discipline in the SOE sector.

Outcome: Substantial reduction in the direct and indirect MOE subsidies to the SOE sector
over the duration of the program. Status: Not achieved.
Most non-private enterprises benefit from both direct and indirect subsidies. Despite
restructuring and privatization, the direct subsidies in the period 2008-2010 remained at the same
level, around 0.8 percent of GDP. FY10 direct subsidies to the sector amounted to approximately
EUR 241.1 million (0.8 percent of GDP), compared to EUR 287.4 million (0.86 percent of GDP
in 2008). Under the PFDPLs series, the subsidies were measured in Serbian Dinars. Initial
decrease was observed in 2009 compared to 2008, in absolute terms as well as in % of GDP.
However, the global economic crisis caused the need for introduction of additional subsidies to
all enterprises, including SOEs. Moreover the GDP contracted, thus leading to an increase in the
ration.

The indirect subsidies are in the form of non-payment or partial payment of taxes; arrears to
state-owned utilities (e.g. EPS), arrears on pension, social security, and unemployment
contributions. No data is available on indirect subsidies, but based on a 2004 assessment of sixty
socially-owned enterprises, they are estimated to be more than three times the size of direct
subsidies. Consequently, this is an area that would demand additional work in the future,
particularly as the impact of the global crisis subsides.

Policy area 2.2: Privatization, Restructuring and Bankruptcy of Socially- Owned and State-
Owned Enterprises.



                                                15
Outcome: Increase in private sector share: in GDP from 55% (end 2005) to above 60% by
the end of the program in 2010 (EBRD data), and in employment from 58% (end 2005) to
65% by the end of the program in 2010 (IMF data). Status: Partially achieved.

According to EBRD Transition Report 2010, the private sector share in GDP was estimated at
60% in mid 2010, whereas the share of private sector in formal employment was estimated at
56%1. Progress in selling socially owned companies was limited, while the number of revoked
privatization deals increased. Finalization of the process of privatization and/or liquidation of
socially and state-owned enterprises remains one of the key priorities of the European
partnership for Serbia.

Amendments to the Privatization Law were enacted setting end-December 2008 as the deadline
for launching privatization of SOEs. As of September 2007 the Privatization Agency (i) offered
for sale over 40 SOEs and sold over 15 through its tender program; (ii) offered for sale through
auctions more than 350 socially-owned enterprises, and sold over 40% of them; offered for sale 7
SOEs from the list of companies under restructuring and sold over 4 of the companies of this list.

By the end of 2009, the total number of companies privatized through tenders and auctions, since
the start of the process in 2002, had risen to over 2,300. However, the least attractive companies
remained unsold. Privatization of the socially owned companies in 2009 slowed down due to the
global crisis. This affected some of the larger companies which were in restructuring. As for
smaller SOEs, bankruptcy procedures became a priority in the context of the crisis. A new
Bankruptcy Law with a number of advanced provisions in line with the EU directives was
adopted. Process of bankruptcy of some 9,500 entities with blocked accounts for over three years
was completed and they were erased from the business register. At the same time, however, the
number of annulled privatizations— due to non-compliance with the contracted obligations —
rose to almost one quarter of the firms initially scheduled for privatization.

Policy areas 2.3: Energy sector reform

Outcome: Increase in private investments in power generation assets (In 2007: no private
investments in energy sector). Status: Not achieved, but positive conditions created.

The conditions for entry of private investors (for steam power plants Kolubara B and Nikola
Tesla (TENT B3) were created and a tender for strategic partners was launched by the
Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS, electric power company of Serbia) and GoS. However, the
evaluation and selection process is still ongoing due to extension of deadlines on request from the
investors. Total value of the project is estimated at over 2 billion Euro.

Serbia). The private sector share excludes informal employment and employment in the socially-owned enterprise
sector.


                                                      16
Outcome: Full competition in petroleum products or Government commitment made to a
date for full competition. Status: Achieved.

The government formally removed the barriers for import of oil derivatives, thus liberalizing the
market. Only one particular type of fuel of lower quality still enjoys excise tax that is lower than
on any other fuel, The Government has committed to the European Commission to resolve the
issue in May 2011.

Outcome: Power and gas tariffs have increased from covering about 80percent of costs in
2006 to 100 percent in 2010. Status: Not achieved.

Further efforts are needed for market opening in power and gas which would go together with a
consistent (market oriented) pricing policy. Despite 2 tariff adjustments in 2010 and 2011, tariffs
are still under cost recovery levels.

Outcome: EPS and Serbiagas have improved financially and are on a path to eliminating
fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits. Status: Insufficient information.

The available information is not sufficient to assess this outcome.

Outcome: EPS is operationally more efficient and has been restructured to facilitate
private sector participation in the power sector. Status: Achieved.

The EU Progress Report 2010 notes that EPS, Serbia’s electricity transmission system operator,
has, to a large extent, become financially sustainable. While EPS remains in state ownership it
has launched a tender for private sector investor partner in two new power plants.

Pillar III: Building a more efficient and stable financial sector

Policy area 3.1: Strengthening crisis preparedness, including development of liquidity
framework, capital adequacy assessment, bank resolution framework enhancement, and
Deposit Insurance payout functions strengthening.

Outcome: CAR of the banking system is maintained at the level of at least 12% and the
required recapitalizations are conducted using transparent criteria allowing the use of
public funds only where there is no private sector alternative (no special rights given to
minority shareholders). Status: Achieved.

The Serbian banking sector is well-capitalized, with average capital adequacy ratio of 20.1
percent. At the end of 2010, only 6 out of total of 33 banks had a capital adequacy ratio under 15
percent. To ensure that the system was well capitalized to withstand the shock of the crisis, a
bank diagnostic and triage exercise was implemented. In December 2009, the NBS completed the
stress testing for the entire banking sector (i.e., 34 banks). As a result, Metals Banka was
recapitalized by the Province of Vojvodina, while Komercijalna Banka, a state owned bank with
EBRD minority ownership, raised more equity from existing and new shareholders, including the



                                                17
IFC. Further, Credy Bank was recapitalized by Nova KBM from Slovenia. The NBS repeats the
stress testing exercise every six months.

Outcome: Legal and implementation framework for crisis preparedness fully operational
and banking sector resilience to shocks strengthened. Status: Achieved.

As a response to the global financial crisis, GoS adopted a set of measures aimed at maintaining
consumer confidence and stability in the banking sector. In particular, by amending relevant laws
(Law on Deposit Insurance, Law on Deposit Insurance Agency, Law on Bankruptcy and
Liquidation of Banks and Insurance Companies) and adopting specific decisions the GoS has: (i)
increased the level of insured deposits from EUR 3,000 to EUR 50,000 per deposit and extended
the coverage to small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurs; (ii) empowered the Deposit
Insurance Agency (DIA) to purchase the shares of any bank endangering financial stability, at the
request of GoS and NBS; (iii) ensured that, in case of a bank liquidation, the depositors are
treated as priority creditors and are to be compensated from the liquidation proceed; and (iv)
signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the NBS and DIA committing to increased
coordination and sharing of information and creating a financial stability committee. Finally, the
NBS has also adopted a Decision on Temporary Measures for preserving Financial Stability in
the Republic of Serbia specifying prudential rules to limit the effect of the crisis on the banking
sector.

Outcome: Increased efficiency of bank resolution system. Status: Achieved.

The existing bank resolution framework was overhauled in order to deal with problem banks in a
more effective and less costly manner. The previous bank resolution framework included only
liquidation and bankruptcy as resolution tools. Under the new framework, purchase and
assumption and bridge bank on a closed bank basis have been added, as well as financial
assistance for these tools on a least cost basis. Finally, to ensure that the DIA has access to
emergency funding for bank resolution/payout, the implicit government guarantee included in the
existing DIA and the Law on Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) has been made explicit with the
approval of 2011 budget law. RSD 110 million (approximately EUR 1 million) have been
allocated to cover the commitment fee for a EUR 100 million stand-by credit line from
commercial banks to the DIA for contingency purposes. By doing so the implicit GoS’s
guarantee to the DIA was made explicit.

Outcome: Deposit insurance scheme that fulfills the following conditions: (i) fast payout
and (ii) availability of extra funding if needed. Status: Achieved.

The deposit insurance fund has been strengthened. The fund increased in size to around EUR 140
million at Q3 2010 as a result of an initial capitalization by the GoS and raising of premium. In
line with best practices, the DIF current size is adequate to cover the failure of a mid-size bank.
The capacity of the fund to deal with large payouts has been strengthened by developing payout
procedures, introducing a payout software, adopting a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on
information sharing between the DIA and the NBS. Amendments to the legal framework to
specifically provide for extraordinary funding and equate the depositors of banks in liquidation
with those of banks in bankruptcy have also been approved.

                                               18
Policy area 3.2: Restructuring and divestment of state-owned banks and financial assets.

Outcome: Banks with majority RoS ownership fully capitalized (CAR 12%). Status:
Achieved.

To ensure that the banking sector is well capitalized a bank diagnostic and a triage exercise is
regularly conducted for the entire banking sector in Serbia. So far three banks have been
recapitalized.

Outcome: The Government of Serbia’s ownership stake in the banking sector and its
holdings in financial assets has been reduced from 24% in 2005 to 15% by 2010. Status:
Achieved.

The GoS has continued the divestment program for state owned banks. To consolidate the state-
owned banking sector and reduce likely capital injections, the GoS adopted a strategy in May
2009, which called for the reduction of majority state owned banks from four to two over the next
two years. Of the four majority state owned banks, Credy Banka was sold to a foreign group,
Postanska and Privedna Pancevo were merged, and Srpska Banka will remain as is. As a result
the number of majority state owned banks has decreased from 4 to 2.

Policy area 3.3: Strengthening insurance sector regulation and resolution regime.

Outcome: A new motor third party liability (MTPL) regime has been introduced to resolve
existing legitimate claimants and put new MTPL regime on fiscally secure basis going
forward. Status: Achieved.

The regulatory framework in the insurance sector has also been enhanced. The Law on
Mandatory Traffic Insurance which introduced the MTPL insurance, satisfactory to the Bank,
was enacted. Prior to this, the motor third party liability segment, the main class of non-life
insurance business, was not sufficiently regulated.

Outcome: Resolution of failed insurers complies with EU insurer wind up requirements as
featured in new law amendments. Status: Achieved.

Run-off MTPL liabilities of bankrupt insurers were assessed and an action plan to fund the
liabilities was developed.

Outcome: Decrease of the state share in insurance sector - from 67% in insurance premium
written in 2006 to 35% in 2010. Status: Achieved.

In Serbia, the insurance market was dominated by state owned insurers DDOR and Dunav. After
privatization of DDOR under the PFDPL 1, by 2010, Dunav accounted for 28 percent of the
market that is below the 35% targeted. Dunav is considered to introduce market distortions in
view or its effective power. The GoS is committed to commencing privatization of Dunav.



                                               19
Policy area 3.4: Strengthening capital markets regulatory and supervisory regime.

Outcome: Adequate regulatory framework facilitates more rapid capital market
development. Status: Achieved.

The Parliament has adopted a new Law on Securities Market, which was harmonized with the
Law on Business Entities and aligned with relevant EU Directives.

Outcome: Reference point/benchmark for issuance of municipal, corporate and
infrastructure bonds provided. Status: Not achieved.

No municipal or infrastructure bonds have been issued. To promote capital market development,
and under the PFSPBG, the GoS has gradually extended the maturities of T-bills from 3 months
to up to 2 years. To increase domestic savings mobilization, the GoS is committed to developing
capital markets. The establishment of a yield curve is essential in this respect.


==================================================================
3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The objectives of this operation have been highly relevant to the strategic priorities of the
country. Priority actions were well selected and contributed to the operation’s outcomes. All
prior actions for PFDPL1 and PFDPL2 were completed. This operation assisted Serbia to cope
with the global crisis, while supporting longer term measures to strengthen the financial sector
and improve the business environment. Areas where least progress was achieved pertain to the
privatization and/or improvement in the financial situation of SOEs. Slower progress in this area
has to be attributed to impact of the global economic crisis, which led to the cancellation of many
privatization contracts already awarded and no response to new tenders organized after the crisis
struck. As a result the PFDPL2 placed a bigger emphasis in the adoption of a legal framework
that would facilitate the bankruptcy of companies, including SOEs.

The results of the PFDPL, summarized above, suggest that a great deal of the expected outcomes
had been achieved (63% of the outcomes, concentrated in measures to improve the financial
sector and, to a lesser extent, business environment). If Pillar III is given a weight of 50% in the
rating, business environment a 30% and SOE reforms 20%, the PFDPL achieved about 70% of
the intended outcomes. In almost all aspects of this operation, the country has moved in the right
direction notwithstanding that the cancellation of the PFDPL3 and the global crisis meant that the
achievement of expected outcomes may have to wait in some cases, particularly in relation to
SOEs.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development



                                                20
There were no measured poverty impacts specifically related to this operation. Poverty and
unemployment have increased in Serbia since the onset of the crisis. There had been a significant
poverty reduction between 2006 and 2008 when the share of households in poverty declined
from 8.8 to 6.1 percent (equivalent to more than 230,000 people being lifted out of poverty). In
2009 the poverty rate rose again to 6.9 percent. Similarly, according to labor force survey data,
the unemployment rate which had decreased to 14.9 percent as of April 2008, reached 18.8
percent in October 2009 and it as estimated to exceed 19 percent recently. There are no recent
data on poverty but until higher growth rates are achieved, let’s say over 5 percent per year,
poverty and unemployment are likely to increase.

A thorough impact assessment of enterprise reforms was done by the World Bank PREM team;
this clearly showed that the proposed privatization and bankruptcy measures did not affect
employees negatively, but rather ensured their fair payment from the bankruptcy proceeds.

The GoS provides social assistance, including cash benefits and services, to poor households, in
addition to special purpose social programs. The main social assistance benefits are: (i) material
Support to Families (MOP in its Serbian acronym) for families whose income is lower than the
guaranteed “social security level”, and (ii) child allowances - cash transfers to poor households
with children, including the families of redundant workers. Targeting under the programs is being
strengthened by policies supported by Pillar 3 of the parallel PEDPL series.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The PFDPL introduced some changes in the institutional framework and strengthened a number
of existing institutions. Given the long-term nature of institution building, the full institutional
benefits of the PFDPL reforms are expected in the medium to longer-term.

Among the key institutions strengthened by the PFDPL, the following could be highlighted:

Serbian Business Registers Agency (SBRA) - one-stop shop for business and employment
registration, e-registration and coordination with social insurance funds. SBRA hosts more than
20 type of business registries, in total. Ministry of Economy and Regional Development—
regulatory review and regulatory impact assessment functions established
National Bank of Serbia and Ministry of Finance – crisis preparedness framework and
development of bank resolution system

Deposit Insurance Fund – payout functions strengthened.

Serbian institutions developed a large body of new legislation in compliance with the European
Union which has improved the business environment and functioning of the financial system.
This has been associated with the streamlining and elimination of redundant, inefficient
regulations.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts




                                                21
The global economic crisis negatively impacted the process of privatization of the socially
owned enterprises and the search for strategic private partners in the energy sector, as discussed
earlier in the analysis of the outcome status. Therefore, the program with respect to SOEs was
shifted to the introduction of more efficient regimes for bankruptcy and contract enforcement.
Moreover, to support the banking sector at a time of stress, new emphasis on crisis preparedness
was added.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Modest

Reforms already introduced, as well as those that must be introduced in the near future, have
been widely accepted in Serbia. In fact, there is a strong commitment to reforms as a path to
access the EU. Such commitment seems to percolate the whole political and societal spectrum.
Risks to the sustainability of reforms are therefore modest, particularly now that some economic
growth is taking place. The donor community continues to support this process. The degree of
coordination among donors is substantive and contributes to ameliorate risks. Several ongoing
projects complement the PFDPL and contribute to its sustainability. These include an
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant for capacity building of newly established RIA Unit
of the Government of Serbia, IDF grant for public enterprises corporatization. New IMF program
is being negotiated and expected to be in place shortly.

The main risks which have been identified relate to the macroeconomic situation in Serbia.

Macroeconomic risks remain substantial. Serbia went into the financial crisis with a high
(balance of payments) current account deficit, aggravated by rapid foreign currency credit growth
and large cross-border borrowing of domestic enterprises. Specific risks include:
     The global economic outlook remains uncertain. Furthermore, potential fallout from
       weaknesses and risks in eurozone economies could have a significant impact on Serbia;
       Greece in particular has been the second largest investor in Serbia since the beginning of
       the transition. A New IMF program is being negotiated.
     Serbia faces considerable balance of payments financing needs over the next few years.
       Risks are mitigated by Serbia’s pursuit of a robust agenda of policy reform, and by the
       size of the multilateral support package.
     Vulnerabilities of the banking sector remain in the context of substantially reduced
       profitability and stable but high NPLs (17.1 percent2). Key mitigating factor is the very
       high capitalization and liquidity of the system. As of March 2011, the aggregate CAR was
       20.4 percent and the banking system’s liquid assets covered 36.9 percent of short term
       liabilities. An increase in the rate of NPLs could pose a risk to the solvency of the system.

    Status as of end March 2011, quoted by NBS.


                                                  22
Mitigation of overall risks is ensured by GoS’s long term commitment to reforms. Serbia has
a good record of continuous reforms and commitment to EU accession. Such a record creates
solid environment for cooperation and confidence with the donor community and allows
stakeholders to focus more intensively on results.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank followed good practices in building the program on the findings of AAA activities and
lessons learned in other transition economies. Moreover complimentary grants and investment
operations supported the implementation of the PFDPL program. Finally donor coordination was
ensured throughout. The result was a program design that was consistent with the national
development strategy and focused on EU accession priorities, bes practices in crisis preparedness
and on sound business environment.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Ratings: Satisfactory

The Bank devised an effective approach to work with counterparts and with other donors in their
respective pillars of the reform program. The Bank cooperated closely and effectively with the
MOF, which was the coordinator of activities on the client’s side, maintained close cooperation
with the MOERD and NBS . Supervision was also enhanced by the continuity of the Bank team,
particularly the task manager who did not change throughout almost the entire PFDPL series. The
Bank Team collaborated effectively with the EC, SIDA and USAID and effectively used the
SIDA Trust Fund.

The Bank assisted through a number of challenging reforms with persistence and delivering high
level support in all policy areas, particularly in the areas of business regulatory environment
(Pillar I) and the financial sector (Pillar III). By all indications, the counterparts in the
Government of Serbia were very satisfied with the technical support and systematic approach to
reforms provided by the Bank Team. The Bank provided regular reports on the progress towards
achieving reforms benchmarks. The system of outcome indicators was developed in accordance
with the requirements that existed at the time of the series design and was focused on final
outcome indicators that were supposed to be achieved via three DPL loans by the end of the
2010. The on-going monitoring was based on a set of reform benchmarks (not only the core ones)
which served as intermediary results indicators.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The overall performance is rated Satisfactory since the Bank performance in Ensuring Quality at
Entry and the most relevant aspects of supervision were satisfactory.

                                               23
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

The Government developed the institutional and regulatory framework in place to improve the
public sector governance, the business regulatory environment and the financial sector stability.
The readiness and openness for reforms was evident all the time and the cooperation with the
Bank Team was very strong. They completed all prior actions and met most of the non-core
benchmarks, readily shared information with the Bank team and continue to implement reforms.
Serbia has been very proactive. For example in making sure that the financial sector was given
strong emphasis in view of the crisis circumstances and by requesting the replacement of the
PFDPL3 for a new guarantee operation to enhance financial leverage of the Bank resources. The
Government showed strong commitment to the consultation process (i.e. consultation with
stakeholders on important legislative amendments, now a mandatory requirement, broad
involvement of business community in the regulatory review process).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

In general the implementing agencies performed well. Most agencies followed through on the
program reforms and handled well the challenge of preparing substantial amounts of new
legislation. The Ministry of Economy and Regional Development performed well in leading
work on privatization and bankruptcy, preparation and implementation of the regulatory
guillotine, reviewing a substantial amount of legislation, and establishing new practices such as
the regulatory impact assessment. Both the PFDPL and the EU accession agenda played a critical
role in driving the pace of the reforms. In implementing agreed upon measures, the
professionalism and dedication of the Government Team proved to be determinant factors.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

The performance of the Government and implementing agencies were both satisfactory,
therefore the overall rating is satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Three important lessons were learned during the implementation of this operation:

             It is important to maintain flexibility of the DPL series to adapt to current
              realities/priorities and to respond to economic crisis by focusing on the
              important sectors. As the operation was implemented and the global crisis
              enfolded, it was necessary to enhance the focus on the strengthening the financial

                                               24
              sector and business environment to be able to withstand the shocks of the crisis.
              This adjustment was in response to the unexpected economic realities and it proved
              to be effective.

             Good coordination with other partners acquires increased importance in time
              of crisis. The cooperation among international agencies (i.e. WB, IMF) and with
              other donors, in particular the EU, was decisive since large amounts of assistance
              have been necessary. This cooperation was underscored by the central role played
              by the Government of Serbia through the Ministry of Finance.

             The program supported by the PFDPL series has also benefitted from Bank
              engagement in banking sector restructuring in Serbia and Bank’s previous
              experience in financial crises. The Bank work and experience in the financial
              sector was of particular importance. It allowed adapting quickly acquired tools to
              the country’s reality. In the PFDPL, the financial sector pillar addressed
              banking/financial issues by supporting aspects of crisis management in which the
              Bank has traditionally had a comparative advantage.
