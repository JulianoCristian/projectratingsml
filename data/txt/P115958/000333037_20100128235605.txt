Operation        The proposed Second Programmatic Private and Financial Development
Type             Policy Loan (PFDPL2) is the second in a series of three programmatic
                 Development Policy Loans (DPLs) designed to support a multi-year program
                 of assistance to the Republic of Serbia to address key institution building and
                 reform challenges in both private and financial sectors.

                 The full IBRD loan is expected to be withdrawn in a single tranche of an
                 amount of EUR 70.8 million (US$ 100 million equivalent)
                 The objective of the PFDPL2 will be achieved through supporting reforms
Main Policy
                 carried out by the Government of Serbia (GoS), which are summarized in
Areas
                 three pillars:

                 Pillar I: Enhancing business environment:
                      Further simplification of business entry through implementation of a
                         single agency approach to business registration;
                      Improving the legal framework for strengthening corporate
                         governance and facilitating business operations;
                      Streamlining regulations of business operations and reducing business
                         compliance costs;
                      Simplifying the process of obtaining construction permits;
                      Improving legal and institutional framework for competition; and
                      Strengthening the legal framework for enforcement of contracts.

                 Pillar II: Strengthening financial discipline:
                      Improving financial discipline in the socially-owned enterprise (SOE)
                         sector;
                      Introducing regulatory framework for state aid allocation;
                                               i
                       Privatization, restructuring, bankruptcy and forced liquidation of
                       socially-owned enterprises;
                       Continuing reforms in the energy sector.

                Pillar III: Building a more efficient and stable financial sector
                     Enhancing Crisis Preparedness, including development of liquidity
                        framework, capital adequacy assessment, bank resolution framework
                        enhancement, and deposit insurance payout functions strengthening;
                     Restructuring and divestment of state-owned banks and financial
                        assets;
                     Strengthening insurance sector regulation and resolution regime;
                     Strengthening capital markets regulatory and supervisory regime.
                Reduced regulatory compliance costs of business measured by BEEPs (9.6%
Key Outcome
                of management time in 2005), ICS and other enterprise surveys.
Indicators
                Unique business identification number is introduced and assigned to all
                businesses by end 2010.

                Increase of private sector share in GDP from 55% (end 2005) to above 60%
                by the end of the program in 2010, increase in private sector share in
                employment from 58% (end 2005) to 65% by the end of the program in 2010.
                CAR of the banking system is maintained at the level of at least 12% and the
                required recapitalizations are conducted using transparent criteria allowing
                the use of public funds only where there is no private sector alternative (no
                special rights given to minority shareholders).

                Legal and implementation framework for crisis preparedness fully operational
                and banking sector resilience to shocks strengthened;

                Government of Serbia's ownership stake in the banking sector and its
                holdings in financial assets reduced from 24% in 2005 to 15% 2010; state
                share in insurance sector decreased from 63.4% in insurance premium written
                in 2006 to 35% in 2010.
Project         The objective of the second PFDPL is to support the reform actions in three
Development     policy areas: (i) enhancing business enabling environment to encourage new
Objective and   private sector investments; (ii) strengthening financial discipline by enforcing
Contribution    hard budget constraints and continued reform of enterprise sector and public
to CPS          utilities; and (iii) building a more efficient and stable financial sector through
                continued restructuring of state holdings in banking and insurance sectors,
                enhancing crisis preparedness, and encouraging development of the capital
                markets.

                The proposed PFDPL2 will contribute to realization of economic growth
                related goals, as outlined in the first priority area of the Country Partnership
                Strategy (CPS): "Dynamic Private Sector Led Growth to Ensure Incomes
                Converge with Europe." The envisaged reform program would be consistent
                with the GoS' aspiration for eventual membership in the European Union
                (EU).

                                              ii
Risks and      The proposed DPL series has substantial risks. Serbia went into the financial
Risk           crisis with a high current account deficit, aggravated by rapid foreign
Mitigation     currency credit growth and large cross-border borrowing of domestic
               enterprises. An ongoing IMF program hinges on ambitious fiscal adjustment
               targets and requires very significant external financial support and private
               sector debt rollover. Specific risks include:
                      The global economic outlook, while improved, remains uncertain.
                      Economic risks are somewhat mitigated by the multilateral support
                      package including from the IMF enhanced stand-by arrangement of
                      EUR 3 billion, developed in close cooperation with the proposed
                      DPL.
                      Despite external adjustment, Serbia faces considerable balance of
                      payments financing needs over the next few years. Risks are
                      somewhat mitigated by Serbia's pursuit of a robust agenda of policy
                      reform, and as above, also by the size of the multilateral support
                      package.
                      Potential vulnerabilities of the banking sector remain in the context of
                      a global financial crisis. A series of GoS measures aimed at improving
                      liquidity, enhancing deposit insurance scheme, and reaching
                      agreement with the biggest banks to maintain their exposure serve as
                      mitigating factors for addressing these vulnerabilities. In addition, the
                      NBS has sufficient reserves to meet urgent liquidity pressures and
                      Serbian authorities have also demonstrated readiness to respond
                      promptly and adequately to the challenges posed by the crisis.
                      Political risks, while moderate, remain. The speed of program
                      implementation could be slowed down by the existence of a broad-
                      based coalition Government; although at the same time the coalition
                      Government helps to ensure sustainability of the reform effort. The
                      programmatic design with a series of three DPLs is intended to leave
                      some flexibility as to the pace, scope and content of reform program.
                      Risks are also mitigated by the economic crisis which has highlighted
                      the necessity and urgency of reform.

   INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
                   PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
PROPOSED SECOND PRIVATE AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                     TO REPUBLIC OF SERBIA



                                         I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The global financial crisis has had a significant impact on the economies in ECA region.
While Serbia did not suffer the immediate consequences at the beginning of the crisis, the
spillover effects are visible now in form of a sharp decline in economic activity. This program
document presents the second in the series of three Programmatic Private and Financial
Development Policy Loans (PFDPLs) to the Republic of Serbia to support the Government's
structural reform program and mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis. The proposed
operation is in the amount of EUR 70.8 million (US$ 100 million equivalent).

2.      The objective of the Second PFDPL is to support the reform actions in three policy areas:
(i) enhancing business enabling environment to encourage new private sector investments; (ii)
strengthening financial discipline by enforcing hard budget constraints and continued reform of
enterprise sector and public utilities; and (iii) building a more efficient and stable financial sector
through continued restructuring of state holdings in banking and insurance sectors, enhancing
crisis preparedness, and encouraging development of the capital markets. Additionally, the
reforms supported under PFDPL2 are supposed to increase the Government of Serbia
(Government or GoS) capacity in weathering the current global economic crisis.

3.      The proposed PFDPL stream is fully in line with the goals of the World Bank Group's
assistance to the GoS as outlined in the FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and recent
draft CPS Progress Report according to which one of the key priorities includes encouraging
dynamic private sector led growth to ensure incomes convergence with European levels. The
Second PFDPL is designed to support the Government in advancing its financial and private
sector related reforms, building on the previous achievements, most recently under the PFDPL1,
as well as on the reforms initiated under the earlier Bank-supported operations in the period from
2002-2006, such as the three prior private and financial sector adjustment credits (PFSAC-I,
PFSAC-II and PPFDPC-I), and the structural adjustment credits (SAC and SAC-II). The
proposed operation will also be complemented by another DPL series aimed at supporting
Serbia's Public Expenditure Management.

4.      While the proposed operation is not an anti-crisis one and was initially designed as a
regular development policy loan supporting structural reform agenda of the GoS, its design and
scope were adjusted in light of the unfolding global crisis and refocused on providing support to
strengthen Serbia's banking sector and augment contingency planning and crisis preparedness
framework. To this end, the PFDPL2 supports a number of precautionary measures aimed at
enhancing crisis preparedness, including adoption of liquidity framework, assessment of capital
adequacy, enhancement of bank resolution framework, and strengthening of deposit insurance
payout functions. It is expected that the upcoming PFDPL3 would further contribute to


                                                  2
strengthening Serbia's banking sector by providing support to implementation of the
recommendations of the planned FSAP update.


                                      II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

POLITICAL CONTEXT

5.      Last year brought some degree of political stability although the on-going international
economic crisis is bringing new challenges. In 2008 there were both presidential and
parliamentary elections which resulted in pro-EU political parties gaining a majority and holding
the presidency. Serbia signed and ratified a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with
the EU, which is a significant step towards gaining candidacy status and eventual full
membership. In addition, and ahead of ratification of the SAA by EU member states, Serbia
decided to implement the part of the agreement related to liberalization of trade. The relatively
broad coalition that forms the current Government has over the past year handled a number of
serious political issues (including the arrest of some of the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indictees) and economic challenges (including the impact of the
international financial crisis).

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Pre-crisis

6.      The economy grew strongly until 2008, fuelled by both exports and domestic demand,
and on the back of significant economic changes since 2000. Real growth of gross domestic
product (GDP) averaged 6.2 percent in 2007 and 2008. Growth was fueled by high demand
linked to a significant credit boom and increases in real wages. Output has risen in real terms by
nearly 50 percent since 2000, as the corporate sector started to post profits and the banking
sector was restructured. The positive supply response also appears to reflect increases in
productivity and output of recently privatized and de novo firms, as evidenced by the particularly
rapid rates of output growth in precisely those sectors which have recently undergone extensive
privatization (e.g., steel, cement, retail trade, rubber, tobacco, dairy, sugar and banking) or
attracted foreign investors.

7.      But strong economic growth was accompanied by a widening current account deficit and
increasing private sector debt. Although exports grew rapidly, domestic demand grew even faster
which resulted in very high import levels and consequently a trade deficit reaching about 22
percent of GDP. The current account deficit reached 17.1 percent of GDP in 2008, up from 8.7
percent in 2005. Most of the increase in the current account deficit (CAD) was due to the
increase in the private sector's share in the savings-investment balance; indeed, the private sector
accounted for 90 percent of the current account deficit in 2008. In 2008, FDI reached an
estimated 5.4 percent of GDP and the outflow of portfolio investment (mainly in the last quarter)
was equal to 0.3 percent of GDP. A surge in bank and enterprise borrowing from abroad led to a
large surplus in the capital account, boosting gross international reserves through the first quarter
of 2008, when reserves reached US$15 billion (or 9 months of imports). Later in the year,


                                                 3
reserves declined somewhat and at the end of the year were USD 11.5 billion (or 7.4 months of
import).

8.      Rapid credit growth in the banking sector (primarily in FX-indexed loans) and increased
cross-border borrowing of domestic enterprises was a key factor in the overheating of the
economy. While deposits grew, lending outpaced the growth in deposits with the loan to deposit
ratio increasing from 99 percent at the end of 2007 to 125 percent at the end of 2008. In addition,
since 2007 Serbian enterprises owed more to parent banks than to local banks (by 20 percent)
and that increased further to a 43 percent higher stock of debt to foreign than to local banks at
the end of 2008.

9.      Domestic overheating and external imbalances were not sufficiently counterbalanced by
fiscal policies between 2005 and 2008. The fiscal balance of the consolidated government sector


                                                   4
moved from a surplus in 2005 of 0.8 percent of GDP to a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2007 -
and then further to a 2.5 percent deficit in 2008. While expenditures decreased in the last couple
of years comparing to the peak in 2006, revenues are also lower. The drop in fiscal revenues
from 2005 to 2008 (from 42.9 percent of GDP to 40.9 percent) is primarily due to lower
collection of VAT, excises and personal income tax revenues - especially in the final quarter of
2008. Capital revenues also decreased sharply. Serbia's social insurance funds covering health,
pensions and unemployment, which have run deficits of over 5 percent of GDP since 2007, were
key factors in the deteriorating fiscal performance of the consolidated general government.
Shortfalls in these funds were covered by transfers from the central government, with the largest
transfer for pensions (5 percent of GDP in 2008).

10.    Economic growth helped to reduce poverty. Poverty in Serbia fell from 12.7 percent of
the population in 2004 to 6.3 percent in 2008, which translates to over 400,000 people rising
above the poverty line.1 Increases in salaries, pensions, and social transfers, the main income
sources for poor households, drove this reduction. These improvements, however, are not even
throughout Serbia: poverty is markedly higher in rural areas--home to about two thirds of all
poor Serbians--and among vulnerable groups, particularly refugees and internally displaced
people. Poverty is also strongly correlated with the education level of the head of household.

Crisis Impact and Economic Developments in 2009

11.     Economic activity fell sharply in the final quarter of 2008 and in 2009, due to
plummeting activity in the tradables sector. Growth in the last quarter of 2008 declined to 2.8
percent (y-o-y) as compared to an average growth rate of 6.5 percent in the previous three
quarters. Preliminary estimates for the first half of 2009 suggest a decline in real GDP of about 4
percent, comparing to the same period of 2008. Industrial output was about 17.5 percent lower in
the first half of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. More recent industrial production
and trade indicators suggest that output is stabilizing in the second half of 2009, indicating a full-
year real GDP contraction of about -4 percent.

12.     Inflation pressures are receding somewhat, albeit from a high level. Serbia entered the
crisis period with relatively high inflation at above 10 percent (in the last quarter of 2008). CPI
inflation declined to 8 percent in August, down from 8.5 percent in July, mainly on account of
decelerating food and utility prices. The CPI is well inside the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) 6-
10 percent target band. Alongside, the NBS has continued its policy of gradual easing, reducing
its policy rate to 12 percent in July, down from17¾ percent in January. The impact on inflation
of a 20 percent depreciation of the dinar against the euro in late 2008 was limited, supporting the
adjustment of the external accounts.

13.    The current account deficit is forecast to decline to 9.0 percent in 2009, down from 17.1
percent in 2008. The collapse in external trade, with imports (particularly of intermediate and

forthcoming). Source: Staff calculations using 2008 HBS data and Serbia Poverty Update (2007) for the 2004
estimates. Since 2003 Serbia has moved to using HBS as the source of poverty monitoring. However, the country
has also carried out three years of LSMS: 2002, 2003 and 2007, and the poverty estimates using this series show a
similar trend in poverty reduction - that poverty declined from 13.6 to 6.6 percent between 2002 and 2007.

capital goods) falling particularly steeply, has triggered a correction of the external account
deficit in the first half of 2009. Exports in the second quarter of 2009 were lower by 32 percent
while imports continued to decline even more and were down 41 percent compared to the same
quarter of 2008. External adjustment has also been assisted by unusually strong unrecorded
remittances, and more recently, some recovery in exports. Capital inflows have turned positive
again since February 2009 and the dinar exchange rate has been roughly stable in 2009, after a
twenty percent depreciation in late 2008.

14.     The banking system has weathered the external shocks so far, and foreign banks have
maintained their exposure to Serbia. The large share of FX or FX-indexed loans in the portfolios
of Serbian banks is a cause of concern (about 75 percent of all loans) and NPLs are increasing
(increase from 4.7 as of beginning of the year to 7.3 percent of the total stock of loans by the end
of July). However, the risks have been tempered somewhat by the banking system's large share
of liquid assets (24.7 percent as of July 2009) and capital buffers (Capital Adequacy Ratio of
21.2 percent as of June). Foreign banks are proving key to maintaining financial sustainability,
and are maintaining their exposure to Serbia.

15.      The original 2009 budget approved in late 2008 was followed by a supplementary
budget approved in May 2009 to rein in the rising fiscal imbalances that followed the effects of
the crisis on tax revenues. This involved a massive fiscal adjustment equivalent to more than 3
percent of GDP (EUR 1.1 billion). Key measures are summarized in Box 1 below and include
wage cuts for higher wage staff and a nominal freeze in the wages of all other public employees
(a nominal pension freeze had already been implemented earlier in the year), a freeze of new
hiring in the public sector, a 15 percent cut in transfers to local governments, and sharp
reductions in the discretionary budget of all budget users. The revised budget ensured protection
of social spending and envisages an increase in the allocation for unemployment benefits. Other
than some delays in the transfers of dividends and other non-tax revenues and complications
with enforcing the wage freeze in some public enterprises and local governments, recent budget
data seem to confirm that these measures have generally been well implemented and are

     Box 1: Serbian Government Measures of Fiscal Adjustment in May 2009 Supplementary Budget

 Measures on the expenditure side are intended to save RSD 74 billion (2.5 percent of GDP). These include:
  Cutting discretionary expenditures on goods and services, subsidies, capital and net lending of all budget
    users across all levels of government (RSD 60 billion)
  Wages freeze in the administration at all levels of government (RSD 13 billion). In addition public
    employees with wages over RSD 40,000 per month will have their nominal wages cut by 10 percent; those
    with wages over RSD 100,000, by 15 percent (of the amount over RSD 40,000.) This measure should bring
    in an additional RSD 1-2 billion.

 Measures on the revenue side are intended to raise an additional RSD 25 billion (0.9 percent of GDP). These
 include:
  The transfer of all net profits of public enterprises to the budget (RSD 5 billion)
  Increase of excises for fuel (RSD 4 billion)
  Increase in non-wage personal income tax (RSD 5 billion)
  Temporary tax on use of mobile phones (RSD 3 billion)
  Strengthening tax administration (RSD 7 billion)

containing spending under the Republican budget.

16.     As has happened in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, public revenues
suffered significantly from the impact of the crisis; in Serbia's case the decline also reflects the
implementation of the Interim trade Agreement with the EU which eliminated most of the import
duties on the goods coming from the EU. As a result, VAT revenues were 10 percent lower in
the first half of the year comparing to the same period of 2008 and customs revenues were 26
percent lower than in the same period last year. The original fiscal target for 2009 was a deficit
target of 3 percent of GDP. By the summer however, and given the outturn for the first half of
the year, this deficit target proved out of reach. The target for the consolidated general
government deficit was missed by 0.9 percent of GDP, it is worth noting that this reflects solely
the effect of the decline in economic activity in government revenues. In fact, the spending
execution remained in line with the IMF-supported program, there was no significant arrears
accumulation, and the indicative ceiling on recurrent spending (of the Serbian Republican
Budget, in billions of dinars) was met. More recent revenue data indicate an improvement. As of
early October 2009, revenues are 0.2 percent higher in nominal terms than they were for the
same time last year.

17.     The growth slowdown is expected to lead to higher poverty rates. Between 2004 and
2008, the fraction of the poor below the poverty line declined by half. However, with economic
growth projected to contract by 4 percent in 2009 from 6 percent growth rate in 2008, the
fraction of the poor is expected to increase. Simulations based on data from the most recent
household budget survey (HBS 2008) shows that even a 5 percent decrease in the incomes of
those above the poverty line will increase poverty by 1.4 percentage points, roughly 90,000 more
people. Three transmission channels of the crisis are likely to be the main sources of income
declines. First, with industrial production and exports falling sharply in late 2008 and early 2009,
some workers will lose their jobs. Second, as the crisis continues the inflow of remittances from
the EU might fall due to the recession in those countries, even if at least in the first 6 months of
2009 they have risen by 6 percent compared to the same period in 2008. Finally, since there is a
large fraction of the population in the informal economy, the decline in aggregate demand will
depress these group's incomes through second round effects. Reduced access to credit because of
the global credit crunch is further impacting consumption.

18.     The IMF is providing substantial support to Serbia through an augmented standby
arrangement (SBA). The IMF had approved a 15-month stand-by arrangement for SDR 350.8
million on January 16, 2009. It was a precautionary program amounting to 75 percent of Serbia's
quota. In the following months, the continued deterioration of the macroeconomic environment
led the authorities to seek a strengthened economic program that could be supported by an
extension and augmentation of the stand-by arrangement. On May 15, 2009, the IMF approved
an augmented arrangement for some SDR 2.6 billion (around 3 billion, or 10 percent of GDP).
The program period was extended to 27 months and the arrangement was no longer considered
precautionary. The core of the program is a large and balanced fiscal adjustment package to
contain the 2009 deficit to sustainable levels. Measures include cuts in recurrent expenditure and
nominal freezes--although with protection of social spending--and mostly temporary revenue
increases. A second component is that foreign banks have been asked to provide voluntary




                                                 7
assurances to broadly maintain their commitment to Serbia and keep their subsidiaries well
capitalized.

19.     The second and third reviews of the program are expected to be concluded at the staff
level in early November. In August 2009, the IMF and the Authorities agreed to revise targets
for 2009 and to postpone the completion of the second review, combining it with the third
review. These reviews are expected to be concluded at the staff level in early November; and to
be discussed at the IMF Board in December 2009.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

20.    The Bank is satisfied with the adequacy of Serbia's macroeconomic policy framework.

21.     Serbia is targeting a fiscal deficit of about 4 percent of GDP in 2010, with gradually
declining deficits afterwards. Further fiscal measures of about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and
medium-term expenditure reforms will be critical in bringing down public spending levels over
the medium term, although the savings that such measures can produce in 2010 are limited.
Significant fiscal adjustment can be expected only in the outer years, once the lags and upfront
costs associated with expenditure restructuring have been overcome.

22.   The Government has already committed to a significant set of expenditure rationalization
measures in 2010, which amount to estimated savings of 0.75 percent of GDP in 2010.
Measures include:

           a) Extension of the 2009 pension and civil service nominal wage freezes. Serbia was
              one of the first countries in ECA to respond to the crisis by freezing wages of
              civil servants (and reducing those of the highest paid, see Box 1). This measure
              will remain in place for 2010 as well, in a macroeconomic environment where
              inflation has been in the 6-7 percent range. In addition, Serbia was one of the few
              ECA countries to introduce a nominal pension freeze, which has also been
              extended to 2010 (this measure was recognized by the PER as one of the most
              important measures, both from a policy and from a fiscal savings perspective).

           b) Nominal freezes and cuts for almost all items of the current expenditures. In
              particular, these will be applied to a large portion of spending on goods and
              services, subsidies (with a cut in the subsidy to the railroad company), and
              untargeted transfers to households and lower levels of government; targeted social
              spending on family and child allowances would remain protected.

           c) Public sector rationalization. The Government adopted the Law on Defining the
              Maximum Number of Public Sector Employees in October 2009, which lays the
              legal basis for the authorities to significantly reduce the size of the public
              administration as per 1 January 2010. Preliminary estimates suggest that there
              will be a cut of up to 14,000 employees leading to savings equivalent to 0.2-0.3
              percent of GDP in 2010 (after severance costs; savings will be higher in
              subsequent years).



                                               8
23.    Options for further savings to reach the targeted fiscal adjustment are being discussed in
the context of the finalization of the 2010 budget(to be approved by Cabinet by November 1, and
by Parliament in the course of December 2009). These include:

             d) Frontloading Pension Reform. A new draft pension law is planned to be ready for
                submission to Parliament in December, supported by a proposed PE DPL2, with
                key measures including raising the retirement age for women; tightening early
                retirement limits combined with actuarially fair penalties; and reducing the extra
                service credit for women. In addition, any changes in the existing system of
                pension indexation--after its temporary suspension in the context of nominal
                freezes of public wages and pensions in 2009-10--will be designed to
                substantially reduce over the medium term the financial transfers needed from the
                budget to finance the pension fund. Savings would be limited in 2010, but the
                reform would nonetheless be significant in reaffirming a sustainable medium-term
                trajectory of the fiscal deficit path.

             e) Rationalizing Capital Spending in 2010. Although high quality public investment
                spending, in particular on infrastructure, is critical for Serbia's growth and
                development over the medium term, there is some room to rationalize the
                proposed plans for capital spending in 2010, in particular of spending under the
                National Investment Program. According to initial estimates for the 2010 budget,
                capital expenditures were forecast to increase to 3.8 percent of GDP next year,
                which appears ambitious given 2.9 percent in 2009. The Bank has indicated
                support of a downward revision of capital spending by 0.3 percent of GDP.

             f) Accelerating the Rationalization of Social Service Provision. This includes
                provider payment reform in health and changes in resource allocation
                mechanisms to schools­areas where potential fiscal savings are largest as per
                recently completed Bank analytical work.

24.     The fiscal deficit is projected to decline to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2012. Revenues are
forecast to decline reflecting durably lower VAT collections (as consumption is projected to fall
relative to GDP) and lower customs revenue (in part reflecting the Stabilization and Association
Agreement (SAA) with the EU). Nevertheless, revenue performance should be boosted by
further efforts to improve the tax administration as well as possible initiatives to strengthen
public enterprise oversight to better control expenditures and reduce subsidies. Under the
structural reforms supported by the program, improvements on the public expenditure side are
expected over the medium term, thus leading to declining fiscal deficits in spite of the declining
revenue to GDP ratio going forward.

25.     Serbia's GDP is projected to pick up starting in 2010 (1.5 percent), having declined by 4
percent in 2009. Growth of about 3-5 percent is expected in 2011-2012. The return to robust and
more balanced growth over the medium term is predicated on a turnaround in global growth, but
also on structural reforms to make the economy more competitive and more export oriented.
Private consumption is projected to gradually decline from the pre-crisis levels of about 78
percent of GDP to about 73 percent by 2012. This reduction in the share of private sector
consumption in GDP would lead to higher domestic savings consequently reducing the size of
the current account deficit over the medium term. Following a significant drop in 2009, private
sector investments are forecast to increase in 2010 and grow robustly throughout the projection
period, therefore contributing to GDP real growth by about 1.4 percentage point each year
throughout the projections period. The exchange rate is projected to depreciate only gradually in
nominal terms thus leading to appreciation of the real effective exchange rate, on the back of the
significant nominal depreciation of the dinar against euro in the last quarter of 2008.

Note: Out of total projected disbursement of USD 5.3 and 6.1 billion in 2009 and 2010, respectively; IFIs are
expected to disburse USD 1.6 and 2 billion. These amounts exclude IMF which is projected to disburse this year
USD 3 and in 2010 USD 1.2 billion.

26.    Significant external adjustment is forecast. The current account deficit is projected to fall
from 17.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 7.2 percent by the end of 2012. As with other
countries in the region, there has already been a marked reversal in the private sector imbalances,
with the current account deficit expected to decline by 8 percentage points of GDP. This
adjustment process has been driven in the near term by a sharp import decline arising from the
drop in domestic demand, and over the medium term by renewed export growth and increased
worker remittances. Capital inflows are expected to cover about 47 percent of the current
account deficit between 2009 and 2012, though a significantly smaller share in 2009 and 2010.
After a significant decline of official foreign currency reserves in the second half of 2008, these
are projected to increase over the projections period. Despite external adjustment, Serbia faces
considerable balance of payments financing needs over the next 18 months. As estimated by the
IMF, Serbia's gross financing needs amount to EUR 8.26 billion in 2009 and EUR 8.95 billion in
2010. These high financing requirements come primarily due to the fact that Serbia needs to
amortize external debt of EUR 4.8 billion in calendar years 2009 and 2010. The remaining gap is
envisaged to be closed by IMF financing which for this year amounts to 7 percent of GDP, and
by Bank and EC assistance.

27.     Public and external debt is forecast to remain sustainable, and debt ratios would start
declining by 2011. Public debt is projected to increase in 2009 and 2010, peaking at 32.6
percent, and is forecast to gradually decline afterwards. The increase in public debt will stem
from increased borrowing from both domestic sources and from international financial
organizations in 2009 and 2010. As in other countries in the region, total external debt is
projected to rise over the next two years, peaking at about 80.1 percent of GDP at the end of
2011, before gradually declining in the outer years. Most of the increase in external debt is due
to increased public sector borrowing from abroad including from the IMF. (The IMF's SBA
accounts for about 10 percent of 2009 GDP, although it does not add to public debt as it is not


                                                       11
being used to finance larger fiscal deficits but to increase FX reserves). In addition, significant
disbursement from IFIs for the implementation of several major infrastructure projects, including
highway Corridor 10, is expected. The stock of private sector external debt will also increase
over the projections period, but at a much slower rate than in previous years, from 45 percent of
GDP at the end of 2008 to a projected 50.7 percent of GDP at the end of 2012. Strong policies
and structural reforms supported under the program would lead to a resumption of growth and
improved public and external balances, underpinning the declining path of public and external
debt in the outer years.

28.     The external debt service financing requirement will be high over the upcoming period.
Due to the relatively short maturity of private external debt and decreases in the denominator,
debt service as shares of GDP and exports is expected to rise significantly. Serbia will thus need
to spend annually on average about 15 percent of its projected GDP to amortize its external debt
in the period 2009-2012; the ratio of short-term external debt (on a remaining maturity basis) to
FX reserves is 20 percent as of August 2009 (down from nearly 30 percent as of end-2008).
Securing funds to cover this high financing requirement will be a priority for policymakers. The
authorities have launched a Financial Sector Support Program (FSSP), in which large private
sector creditors--notably the foreign parent banks of the major banks--have been encouraged to
maintain their exposures to Serbia, and they have responded favorably so far. IBRD debt as a
share of external debt will decline to about 5.6 percent in 2012 (from 7.2 percent at the end of
2008). Debt service to the IBRD will represent on average about 1.7 percent of total debt service
during 2009-2012.

29.    Standardized public debt stress tests show that Serbia's debt is particularly exposed to
exchange rate and growth shocks. A 30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate would
increase the public debt-to-GDP ratio by 10 percentage points by 2012, given that 90 percent of
the debt is denominated in foreign currency (comprising mainly debt for frozen currency deposit
and debt to multilaterals and Paris Club of creditors). Also, assuming standard "combined
shock" test (half a standard-deviation shocks to growth and the primary fiscal balance), the
public debt stock would increase by 3 percentage points of GDP, by the end of projections
period. Similarly, external debt sustainability primarily depends on the exchange rate shocks.
Further real depreciation of 30 percent (on top of real depreciation of nearly 19 percent from the
period October 2008-January 2009) would increase share of external in debt by over 30
percentage points. So called "combined shock" i.e. permanent 1/2 standard deviation shocks
applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance, would increase the share of
external debt in GDP by 6 percentage point but still not endangering the sustainability of the
external debt.

30.     The outlook is subject to significant uncertainties. The main uncertainty on the external
side is a slower than expected recovery in the EU which will continue to suppress demand for
exports and capital inflows. On the domestic front, both political and implementation risks
emanate from the resolve and capability of the Government to prepare and implement short and
medium-term public expenditure reforms. At this juncture it is particularly critical to move
beyond immediate cuts in spending (i.e. reduction of the public sector employment, cuts in
discretionary expenditures etc) and to also move forward on structural reforms that will bring
savings over the medium term, and supporting this will be the focus of the proposed DPL series.
Although debt levels are forecast to start to decline in 2011, the risks associated with such debt
levels remain high, however, not least because of an uneven record of structural reforms in the
past.

RECENT BANKING SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS

31.     Since the reforms of the early 2000, the majority of the banking system has been
privatized and major foreign banking groups (primarily European) have entered and consolidated
the market. The banking sector consisted of 34 banks at the end of 2008, with 20 majority
foreign owned and comprising 75 percent of total banking sector assets. The State retains
majority and minority ownership in 4 and 5 banks respectively, amounting to 16 percent of total
assets. The remaining banks that comprise 9 percent of total assets are locally owned. Only one,
privately owned domestic bank (Metals Bank) was under temporary administration, but it has
just recently been recapitalized and is now in majority ownership of the Province of Vojvodina.

32.     The rapid consolidation and entry of foreign banks has helped to drive significant growth
in the Serbian banking system in recent years, with growth in total assets exceeding 50 percent
annually in 2005 and 2006 and 30 percent in 2007, and assets/GDP increasing from 45.8 percent
in 2005 to 65.7 percent in 2008 (Table II.1). The growth in total assets declined somewhat in
2008, but was still robust at 13.6 percent. Much of this increase in assets has been driven by the
rapid credit growth to both enterprises and households. Total annual credit growth has exceeded


                                                  13
48 percent in 2007 and 24 percent in 2008, with significant growth in both the household and
enterprise sector. Annual credit growth in the household sector has exceeded 30 percent in 2008.
Key asset indicators for the banking sector are listed in Table II.1 below.

33.     Unlike other countries in the region, much of the growth in funding for the banking
sector in Serbia has been driven by deposit growth rather than foreign financing by parent banks.
As shown in Chart 1 below, foreign financing accounts for less than 9 percent of the sources of
funds in the banking sector, and comprises mostly long-term funds. During the current global
financial crisis, this liability structure decreases the risk, as a reversal in parent support could
create instability in the banking sector.

34.     The banking system entered into the current period of global instability in a healthy
situation as a result of the NBS's recent policy actions, which led to large capital and liquidity
buffers for the banking system. Capital adequacy ratios have declined from 27.9 percent at the
end of 2007 to 21.9 percent at the end of 2008, and further down to 20.8 percent as of end-March
2009, but have remained well above the prescribed minimum (12 percent). Liquidity is also
relatively high, with liquid assets totaling 28.6 percent as of end March 2009. Actions by the
NBS that have led to this relatively stable situation include high reserve requirements on foreign
borrowing and domestic foreign currency deposits and a restrictive monetary policy, which
induced commercial banks to include a sizable portion of their assets in highly liquid securities
refinanceable with the central bank (repo securities). Table II.2 below provides key financial
soundness indicators for the banking system.

35.    Inaccurate media reports generated a mini-deposit run in October 2008 and
approximately 16 percent of the total amount of deposits left the system in October and
November 2008. A prompt and well managed public information campaign led by the NBS
management has stabilized the system. Deposit withdrawals have stopped, and although there
has been a slight reversal the bulk of the deposits that have left the system have not returned.
During the first six months of 2009, the consumer foreign currency deposits have increased by
EUR 264 million.

36.     The biggest potential risk to the banking system emanates from a slowdown in the
corporate sector and large arrears of GoS to the latter. The slowdown in growth and exports has
led to a substantial increase in NPLs from the corporate sector (Table II.2 above). This trend is
likely to continue as the corporate sector faces further pressure in the future. According to most
recent data from the NBS' Supervision departments the NPLs have reached 8.14 percent as of
April 2009. Further increasing the risks to the corporate sector are arrears of GoS and/or state
owned enterprises in the range of hundreds of millions of Euros to suppliers/enterprises for past
services. The Government is attempting to borrow from banks to repay the past arrears that it
has to the corporate sector. Most recently, the GoS has provided guarantees to Public Enterprise
Roads of Serbia to borrow EUR 175 million to start settling arrears to its suppliers.

37.     Significant increase in the blockages of corporate debtors' accounts in recent months is a
sign of increasing nervousness in the banking sector. Serbia has a well developed promissory
note/bills of exchange system, whereby if a borrower has several creditors with promissory notes
and has delayed payments on any one of them, any of the creditors involved can put a block on


                                               15
all the debtor's bank accounts until his own debt has been paid off. Since December 2008 the
number of blocked corporate accounts has doubled.

38.     Some local and foreign banks, dependent on short-term deposits and with no parent
support, have been using the very effective promissory system to minimize their losses. The
very efficient promissory note system gives an advantage to first movers, and certain banks have
been utilizing the system to reduce their exposure. As a result even smaller banks can create the
potential for a systemic crisis and prevent any bilateral or multilateral debt rescheduling
arrangements to be executed


                             III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

39.     The PFDPL2 is designed to support concrete Government led reforms structured in three
pillars. Pillar I of the proposed PFDPL2 operation aims to enhance business environment; Pillar
II is designed to further strengthen financial discipline; and Pillar III will encourage further
financial sector strengthening and crisis preparedness.

Pillar I ­ Enhancing Business Environment

40.     Under Pillar I, the GoS considers improvement of business environment a key factor for
ensuring sustainable private sector growth and job creation. To that end, in the last few years it
has embarked on a series of successful reforms aimed at enhancing the business climate. In
implementing the reforms the Government has closely coordinated its plans and actions with the
representatives of the private sector, such as the Foreign Investors Council, and it has conducted
intensive stakeholder consultations in order to address the ongoing business concerns and
stimulate further investments.

41.     Some recent notable successes include implementation of a comprehensive reform of
business entry that led to the transfer of business registration from judicial to purely
administrative process managed by the Serbian Business Registers Agency (SBRA), adoption of
key elements of commercial legislation, enhancement of access to finance by adopting Secured
Transactions Law, Leasing Law and Mortgage Law, establishing Pledge and Leasing registries
and Credit Information Bureau, coordination of Government reform efforts through the
Regulatory Reform Council, and introduction of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) in
Serbian legislative process. However, political developments between 2006 ­ mid 2008,
including Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence in early 2008, and two Parliamentary
elections a year from each other delayed the implementation of the planned business
environment reforms.

42.    The current Government reinvigorated the reform efforts and has demonstrated
commitment to pursue unfinished reform agenda in improving the business climate. Priority
areas that have been agreed upon include: (i) further streamlining of business registration
procedures with an aim of creating a one-stop shop for business registration and introducing a
single identification number; (ii) improving legal framework for strengthening corporate
governance and facilitating business operations by introducing amendments to the Company
Law; (iii) simplifying regulations of business activities and reducing business compliance costs


                                               16
through the implementation of a comprehensive regulatory review, the so-called "regulatory
guillotine"; (iv) simplifying the process for obtaining construction permits by adopting a new
Law on Spatial Planning and Construction; (v) improving legal and institutional framework for
competition; and (vi) strengthening the legal framework for enforcement of contracts.

Pillar II ­ Strengthening Financial Discipline

43.      The GoS is committed to strengthening financial discipline, which is instrumental for
facilitating the restructuring, privatization, and/or bankruptcy of remaining socially-owned
enterprises. The Government succeeded in meeting the legally mandated December 2008
deadline for commencing the privatization process of all SOEs remaining in the Privatization
Agency's portfolio. All eligible companies were offered and are in different stages of
privatization. Building on the achievements of PFDPL1 the GoS will further its strategy of (i)
containing the direct and indirect subsidies to the enterprise sector; (ii) introducing framework
for provision of state aid; and (iii) accelerating resolution of the remaining socially owned
enterprises by adopting amendments to the bankruptcy framework and pursuing the option of
forced liquidation.

44.      In pursing permanent energy sector reforms, Serbia has committed to integrate its energy
sector into the regional and pan-European oil, power and natural gas markets and is seeking to
enhance energy security through foreign investments in transit pipelines for natural gas across
Serbia. The Government recognizes the need for continued rehabilitation and modernization of
its energy infrastructure, and sees further restructuring and private sector participation as tools to
achieve cost-efficient improvements in the sector. In parallel, GoS is focusing on energy
efficiency in the supply chain as well as on energy consumption, and movement towards cost-
reflective tariffs is one of the elements in the strategy. Furthermore, the Government wants to
support renewable energy sources and environmentally acceptable technologies for energy
utilization.

Pillar III ­ Building a More Efficient and Stable Financial Sector

45.      Strengthening crisis preparedness ­ banking sector. As a response to the global financial
crisis, GoS has adopted a set of measures aimed at maintaining consumer confidence and
stability in the banking sector. To increase confidence in the system, the Government increased
deposit insurance coverage from EUR 3,000 to EUR 50,000 per depositor per bank and
shortened the payout period to three days. It also expanded coverage to include small and
medium legal entities and entrepreneurs. As a result, 99 percent of the depositors are covered.
The Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) has also been empowered to purchase the shares of any
bank endangering financial stability, at the request of GoS and NBS. Moreover, amendments
introduced in the Law on Liquidation and Bankruptcy of Banks and Insurance Companies now
equate the depositors of the banks in bankruptcy and of the banks in liquidation. Finally, a
detailed crisis preparedness plan as envisaged under the tripartite Memorandum of
Understanding (tripartite MoU 2008) has been signed by the NBS, GoS and DIA in December
2008 committing to increased coordination and sharing of information and creating a financial
stability committee. In the meantime the MoU has been improved with specific measures to be
undertaken for the purposes of preserving financial stability in Serbia.



                                                 17
46.      Under the auspices of the "Vienna initiative," and with the support of the IMF, the
Government launched a financial sector support program (FSSP) that is voluntary and open to all
banks and involves a mix of commitments and incentives. The FSSP was launched in Vienna in
March 2009 with 10 foreign banks and their home supervisors. Since then it has been extended
to all remaining banks operating in Serbia. To date, 27 banks operating in Serbia have signed up
for the program. The program requires the majority shareholders to: (i) obtain specific
commitments from parent bank groups to keep their exposure vis-à-vis Serbia at end-2008 level
throughout 2009­10, subject to a review at end-2009 (only for foreign shareholders); (ii) to keep
their subsidiaries sufficiently capitalized; and (iii) have their subsidiaries participate in a
diagnostic study involving stress tests based on IMF methodology and a downside scenario to be
agreed upon between the authorities and the banks. The NBS expects to complete diagnostic
studies for all banks by end-2009. Exposures would be monitored on a monthly basis with
quarterly reconciliation of data with home supervisors. Subsidiaries and local banks
participating in the program would be asked to facilitate voluntary conversion of FX and FX-
linked loans into local currency loans, and facilitate loan restructuring under a pre-agreed
framework, which requires the extension of remaining loan maturity by at least 12 months or 20
percent with reduced monthly payments, or any other restructuring lowering monthly payments
by at least 20 percent.

47.      As part of the commitment to the conditions of the program, the participating banks are
to be granted access to two new liquidity facilities to be established by the NBS. These liquidity
facilities include: (i) an extended dinar liquidity facility and (ii) a foreign exchange swap facility.
The first aims to help banks with loan restructuring and will involve provision of dinar loans
with maturities of up to a year, under a broad range of collateral and with a non-penalty interest
rate. The FX swap facility will offer each bank a swap line out of a designated pool of funds of
up to EUR 1 billion. Swaps will be offered with a two-week maturity and an implicit rollover
guarantee. The NBS has amended regulations related to risk management and has drafted
regulations related to special measures supporting financial stability, approval of short-term
dinar loans to banks, and FX swap trading between the NBS and commercial banks.

48.     To reduce the impact of the credit crunch the GoS has introduced two programs. Under
the first program GoS subsidizes interest rates for RSD loans to enterprises and individuals
borrowing from participating banks. Under the second initiative, the Development Fund co-
finances up to 30 percent investment loans to enterprises with participating banks. Participating
enterprises have to commit to maintaining the same number of employees. The Development
Fund is in charge of monitoring employment levels and of providing the subsidy/financing. GoS
has set aside RSD 3 billion for the first initiative (RSD 1 billion for consumer lending, RSD 1
billion for enterprises engaged in export, and RSD 1 billion for other enterprises) and RSD 5
billion for the second initiative.

49.     Restructuring and consolidation of state-owned banks. With the aim to consolidate state
ownership in banks the DIA has prepared and the Government has approved the strategy
outlining detailed action plans for the four majority-owned state banks. The strategy proposes
the merger of three of the four state owned banks. The strategy includes a detailed time schedule
of activities including the formation of work groups in all three banks, in order to propose the
most rational manner of performing the statutory change of the proposed merger. In this regard,


                                                  18
the GoS has made a decision to merge Srpska Banka and Privredna Banka Pancevo into
Postanska Stedionica. Further, the feasibility of the merger has been confirmed by an
independent auditor. The fourth bank, namely Credy Bank, will be merged with the other three
banks failing any interest in the market for capital increase.

50.     Insurance. Insurance supervision has also been improved thanks to a complete
revamping of the legal framework, including the introduction of a licensing requirement for
insurance agents, and the enhancement of the quality of supervision and of enforcement. As a
result, there has been substantial consolidation in the sector - over the 2001-2008 period, the
number of companies has shrunk from 40 to 24, while new players have entered the market.
State ownership in the sector has been substantially reduced to approximately 30 percent of the
market. Finally, the work on Motor Third Party Liability Law (MTPL) has been finalized and it
has been adopted in the Parliament.

51.     Capital Markets. The Government has started a comprehensive review of the key
relevant legislation for capital markets development, namely the Securities Law and the
Company Law. Amendments to the Securities Law, that have already been passed, will take
care of immediate problems until the full review is completed. Ultimately the review of the
Securities and Company laws as well as the future review of the Takeover Law must ensure their
harmonization and bring them in line with international standards. Further, the Government is
committed to the establishment of a long term government bond market and it has set up a
working group to study the legal and institutional framework for a bond market including
corporate, municipal, and government bonds. The review of the Securities Law recognizes the
potential of the Belgrade Stock Exchange as a mechanism not only for secondary market trading,
where existing shareholders both private and institutional buy and sell, but also as a place where
primary fund raising by means of IPOs of state owned enterprises can be carried out as well.
Finally, the Government will improve the institutional arrangements for capital markets by
providing the Securities and Exchange Commission with better funding, clarifying its
responsibilities and ensuring its impartiality and independence.


                IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINK TO CPS

52.     The FY08-FY11 CPS for Serbia, approved by the Board in December 2007, envisaged a
series of three consecutive PFDPLs over this period. Given the global financial crisis, and
associated budget support needs, the GoS has requested acceleration of preparation of the second
and third development policy loans. The objectives of the PFDPL series remain consistent with
key objectives and expected outcomes under the first priority area of the Serbia CPS: "Dynamic
Private Sector Led Growth to Ensure Incomes Converge with Europe." The proposed PFDPL2
would continue addressing a set of objectives outlined under this priority area, such as further
improving the business environment, particularly cumbersome licensing and permit
arrangements, strengthening the financial sector intermediation, supporting privatization of
socially-owned enterprises, strengthening enforcement of bankruptcy mechanisms, continuing
the process of reforming and/or privatizing large state-owned enterprises, and overall improving


                                               19
the competitiveness of the enterprise sector. According to draft CPS Progress Report, during the
first 15 months of the CPS the GoS has continued to embrace the strategy outlined in the CPS.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

53.     The success of reforms in Serbia over the first eight years of transition was substantially
stimulated by the effective collaboration and coordination between the Bank and other key
donors. The Bank maintains close working relations with the IMF and other donors assisting the
GoS for the purposes of harmonizing policy recommendations and seeking synergies among the
respective operations. The IMF has been primarily focused on the short-term impacts of the
reforms on macroeconomic stability while the Bank has focused on the medium-term impacts of
structural reforms. The Bank also maintains very good relations and keeps ongoing policy
dialogue with various bodies of the EU, both in its headquarters in Brussels and in Belgrade.

54.    The IMF and Serbia have successfully completed one Stand-by and a three-year
Extended Arrangement since 2001. The final review under the Extended Arrangement was
completed on February 07, 2006 after two extensions. Following the successful completion of
the Extended Arrangement, the IMF has maintained regular Article IV consultations with
Serbian authorities, the last one completed in February 2008. In 2006 the Serbian authorities
decided to use part of their privatization revenues to prepay major creditors, including the IMF.
By the first quarter of 2007, the outstanding debt to IMF was completely cleared.

55.    Given the abrupt change in global financial environment and in order to safeguard
macroeconomic and financial stability, Serbian authorities have agreed on a new stand-by
arrangement with the IMF worth EUR 3 billion over the next two years, which was approved on
May 15, 2009. This arrangement serves as a strong signal that Serbia can preserve
macroeconomic and financial stability. The proposed PFDPL2 is closely coordinated, and in fact
supports, the implementation of the IMF program on financial sector issues ­ FSSP. To monitor
and further evaluate the banking sector resilience in case of deterioration of external conditions
and domestic demand, an FSAP update for Serbia has taken place in the fall 2009.

56.    To support the implementation of the FSSP the World Bank has been closely
coordinating with the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of Swiss Confederation and
KfW to strengthen the Deposit Insurance Agency and enhance the value of state participation in
banks and socially owned capital in insurance companies through institution building, capital
increase and pre-privatization restructuring. The EBRD is also supporting the implementation of
the FSSP by increasing equity in two state owned banks, namely Komercijalna and Cacanska.
Also, IFC is considering equity investment in Komercijalna Bank.

57.    Overall, the Bank has maintained a robust dialogue with the donor community in Serbia
in order to avoid duplication of efforts and leverage support for the GoS' reforms. Specifically,
the practice of holding regular monthly donor coordination meetings, focusing on private and
financial sector development issues, was established early on in the reform process. Currently,
the meetings take place in the World Bank office in Belgrade and are chaired by the Country
Manager. The Bank is an active participant in macro-level donor coordination mechanisms led
by the GoS, and also coordinates efforts on specific thematic fields directly with other donors.


                                                20
This included in particular USAID and KfW on commercial legislation reform, the European
Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) and USAID on enterprise sector reform and improving
bankruptcy and enforcement regime, the U.S. Treasury, and USAID on its long-standing support
to the NBS Supervisory reform initiative. More recently, the collaboration between the Bank
and SIDA also includes supporting the Serbian Business Registry, development of regulatory
reform strategy and commencement of a comprehensive regulatory review process, as well as
regulatory impact assessment.

58.    The Bank's coordination and cooperation with the European Union, Serbia's most
important current development partner, is increasing and deepening since practically all World
Bank assistance is aimed at helping Serbia in the process of convergence with the European
Union. Most recently the Bank started close coordination with the EU regarding pledged budget
support to be achieved through conversion of Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)
funds to budgetary support.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

59.      The proposed PFDPL2 program directly builds on the recently approved PFDPL1 and
follows closely the Programmatic Private and Financial Development Policy Credit (PPFDPC-1)
and a successful series of two consecutive Private and Financial Sector Adjustment Credits
(PFSAC1 and PFSAC2). The latter projects supported the GoS' program of regulatory,
institutional, and structural reforms seeking to significantly accelerate private sector growth
through: (i) improving the business enabling environment by means of reforms of enterprise
entry, operation and exit; (ii) strengthening the financial system by improving regulatory and
supervisory framework; (iii) privatizing and/or liquidating majority state-owned banks; and (iv)
privatizing and restructuring socially-owned enterprises that crowd out private sector growth and
incur significant fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs.

60.     Under the PPFDPC-1 closed in March 2006, the GoS has successfully completed core
policy actions in: (i) strengthening the fiscal discipline in enterprise, energy and transport
sectors, and attracting foreign investment; and (ii) building a more efficient and stable financial
sector and improving access to finance. To strengthen the fiscal discipline, the GoS reduced
subsidies and continued with divestiture of SOEs through privatization and bankruptcy; and
pursued reforms in the energy and railway sector. The GoS activities aimed at building more
efficient and stable financial sector focused on continued privatization and divestment of state-
owned banks and financial assets; strengthening insurance sector regulation and resolution
regime; and improving access to finance through the adoption of a mortgage law.

61.      Implementation of the reform agenda under the development lending programs benefited
considerably from and was facilitated through two grants, the Private Sector Development
Technical Assistance (PSD TA) and Financial Sector Development Technical Assistance (FSD
TA), followed by the recently completed Privatization and Restructuring of Banks and
Enterprises Technical Assistance Credit. These operations provided technical assistance and
institutional capacity building for (i) privatization and bankruptcy of SOEs; (ii) implementation
of a comprehensive banking and insurance sector restructuring strategy targeted at creating a



                                                21
more viable financial sector; and (iii) improvement of the business environment for business
entry and sustainable operations.

62.    In addition to the private and financial sector reform dimensions outlined in the above
mentioned operations, the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) program has also laid a
foundation for the implementation of the envisaged PFDPL program. In particular, the SAC-II
focused on: (i) improving the business climate; (ii) institutional development and improving
performance within the energy sector; (iii) strengthening social protection; and (iv) improving
public administration. The planned PEDPL operation to support the Public Expenditure
Management will provide assistance to the GoS in wider public financial management issues.

63.     The ongoing Bor Regional Development Project, which includes supporting the
Government in the asset resolution of copper mining and smelting complex RTB Bor, pursues
objectives that are cross-reinforcing with those of PFDPLs, as RTB Bor was one of the largest
recipients of GoS subsidies to the SOE sector.

LESSONS LEARNED

64.     The PFDPL program builds upon the experience accumulated during the preparation and
implementation of the previous private and financial sector operations. This experience has
demonstrated that an integrated approach is needed to reform the financial and enterprise sectors
in parallel. Under the earlier programs, financial sector reform aimed to boost financial
intermediation, encourage domestic savings and generate much needed liquidity to support real
sector expansion. Concurrently, the continued privatization of SOEs and the adoption of early
measures to strengthen the business climate drew in increased foreign investments.

65.      A key lesson from other transition experiences and from the first eight years of transition
in Serbia is the need for sequencing: the initial steps should be the immediate goals of price
liberalization and fiscal stability, followed by structural reforms in industrial enterprises and
banks and, only then, in the third stage, pursue reforms in utilities, non-banking institutions and
capital markets. Moreover, due to the political economy of post-conflict Serbia, it was important
to start enterprise privatization with sellable companies ­ or "early wins" ­ and only later move
onto restructuring of the politically sensitive large loss-makers. In parallel, from the start of the
reforms, long-term efforts should be undertaken which are aimed at creating a robust, transparent
regulatory and institutional framework for utilities, financial markets and the business
environment. In the case of utilities, privatization should be preceded by unbundling and
commercialization on the basis of an appropriate market structure. Moreover, the negative
experience of some transition countries forewarns that the proper preparation is required to
attract interest from international reputable strategic investors.

66.     Reform implementation is heavily dependent upon an effective champion who takes the
early `ownership' of the reforms sought. Equally, it is important that the domestic reform
champions are well advised as to the positions assumed and actions taken. For example, the
willingness of key counterparts at NBS and MOF to take key decisions, inter alia, to
significantly reign in regulatory forbearance, take additional robust measures to further
strengthen the bank and insurance regulatory regimes, withdraw licenses of banks and insurers


                                                 22
and offer a number of state-owned banks and assets for sale has enabled the financial sector
reform agenda to be substantially advanced. Similarly, the effective management of the
enterprise privatization process by MOE and Privatization Agency (PA) facilitated progress in
the reforms of the socially-owned sector.

67.    The ability to provide extensive technical assistance on a timely basis has been crucial for
achieving objectives of development policy operations. As well, the early provision of
substantial grant funding and the effective coordination by the Bank of support from bi-lateral
donors (notably EU, DFID, PHRD and USAID) proved critical for developing institutional
capacity at the DIA, PA and NBS to implement early high impact measures.

68.     Finally, it is important to note that Serbia differs from most other transition economies in
two ways. First, its system of socialism, based on worker management and the concept of
"social capital," did not entail classic central planning; and secondly, due to the break-up of the
former Yugoslavia and the resulting conflict and sanctions, Serbia was relatively late in
embarking on the journey to a full-fledged market economy. These factors meant that the
fundamental transitional task of reforming banks and enterprises had to be adjusted to these
different initial conditions and to take lessons of experience into consideration: auctions replaced
voucher privatization, so typical for many other transition economies, the four largest state-
owned banks were closed and lastly, the approach to restructuring of utilities and of the largest
loss-makers has been more gradual than that of the early reformers.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

69.    The PFDPL program heavily relies on findings of the extensive economic sector work
undertaken by the Bank. The policy recommendations integrated into the relevant components
of the program are stemming from a number of key documents presented to the GoS in 2004-
2009. They include the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA); the Private Sector Note (PSN);
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) report and its ongoing update, the Integrated
Public Finance Management Assessment (IPFMA), Serbia Economic Memorandum (SEM), the
Labor Market Assessment, the IMF Report on Crisis Preparedness Framework, and the recent
Public Expenditure Review. Finally, the draft CPS Progress Report was prepared in 2009 to
gauge the progress achieved so far.

70.      According to an empirical analysis conducted under the ICA and the PSN in 2004,
private firms were found to be more productive than the socially-owned ones. Further,
according to an EU sponsored study from 2005, companies privatized under the 2001 Law have
generally improved their financial performance and have invested in modernizing their
production process in comparison to companies privatized to employees under the pre-reform
1997 Law, although originally the latter were, on average, of better quality companies than the
firms privatized after 2001. Moreover, the ICA demonstrated that new private firms in Serbia
are unambiguously more productive, more profitable, and growing more rapidly than the
socially-owned ones. Although the new private firms are better performers, their scope for
growth and the possibility of entry by new entrepreneurs are severely limited by the improving,
but still deficient business environment.



                                                23
71.    The PRSP rightly emphasized that improvements in the business environment are key
preconditions for sustainable private sector-led growth. The strategy for Serbia acknowledges
the need for streamlining the registration process, reducing administrative barriers to business
operation, improving corporate governance, and establishing a modern bankruptcy regime.
Similarly, comprehensive reform of the financial sector represents an important cornerstone of
Governments' growth strategy. The National Program for Integration with the EU further
endorsed this agenda and defined the steps necessary for convergence.

72.     In addition, the results of Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys
(BEEPS), as well as the Doing Business indicators were analyzed to help identify main areas of
concern for private sector development. These datasets not only provide valuable insight in the
regulatory environment and administrative practices in Serbia, but also allow for benchmarking
against other countries in the region and the world, a further measure to identify where Serbia
might be underperforming in comparison with other countries. Several regulatory reform areas
that are targeted within the scope of this operation have been identified in the ICA and other
studies as priorities for private sector development and increased investment.

73.     An IMF paper on Crisis Preparedness Framework (November 2008) acknowledges
existence of basic elements of financial safety net in Serbia (i.e. deposit insurance scheme, bank
resolution framework, etc.) but also states that the applicable rules and procedures need further
clarification. Further, the report calls for enhanced coordination of GoS and NBS to improve
crisis preparedness, increased funding of deposit insurance scheme, improvement of DIA's
operational framework to ensure cost effective bank resolution, better cooperation with parent
banks, and supervisors to support lender of last resort (LOLR) operations.

74.     The Financial Sector Note (FSN) demonstrates that Serbia's financial sector remains
insufficiently developed by regional benchmarks, and the existing level of financial
intermediation cannot fully address the needs of economic growth. Narrowing the efficiency
gaps between the weaker Serbian banks, and the leading CEE and EU banks began only in 2005
as a result of local acquisitions by foreign banks. In this context, further development of non-
bank financial institutions (NBFI), such as insurance companies, microfinance institutions, and
capital markets, is particularly important as they may offer the potential of a broad array of
intermediary services and instruments currently unavailable from most banks.

75.     The government statistical reports as well as Bank's vulnerability assessments indicate
major slowdown in economic activity. The industrial production has decreased by 16.9 percent
in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same period last year, and the GDP is projected to
record a negative growth this year. As the economic crisis is unfolding in the real sector,
including declining FDI and remittances, the previously resilient financial sector is coming under
pressure of steadily increasing NPLs.

76.     According to the recently completed Public Expenditure Review the Serbian Government
allocates a large portion of its GDP (around 4 percent of GDP in 2008) and of public expenditure
(around 9 percent of general government spending) for direct and indirect subsidies.2 In 2008

2
 Subsidy is defined as a government action that lowers the cost of production, raises the price received by
producers or lowers the price paid by consumers.


                                                         24
alone, an average subsidy per employee in the country was equal to average monthly net wage
(from December 2008), thus each employed in the country has allocated one-monthly salary for
employees in subsidized sectors. Finally, the new announcements of various subsidy-programs
to support declining economy during 2009 will likely lead to upward revisions.


       V. THE PROPOSED SECOND PROGRAMMATIC PRIVATE AND FINANCIAL
                          DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

77.     The PFDPL2 is the second of three development policy lending operations in the private
and financial sector stream envisaged under the FY08-11 CPS. It is designed to build on the
achievements of the previous operation by further improving the business environment,
strengthening financial discipline in the enterprise and energy sectors, and developing a stable
financial sector capable of weathering shocks by implementing a well targeted set of structural
reforms in all three pillars. The PFDPL2 will particularly focus on financial sector development
and support a number of precautionary measures aimed at enhancing crisis preparedness.

78.     The business environment (or first) pillar aims to: (i) further simplify regulatory
requirements and compliance costs for business entry and operations; (ii) enhance the legal
framework for strengthening corporate governance, (iii) strengthen institutional capacity and
regulations for ensuring competition, and (iv) improve the legal framework for contract
enforcement. The financial discipline (or second) pillar will support: (i) further reduction of
direct and indirect subsidies to socially-owned enterprises and development of a regulatory
framework for state aid allocation; (ii) privatization, restructuring, bankruptcy and forced
liquidation of socially-owned enterprises; and (iii) continuation of reforms in the energy sector.
The financial sector (or third) pillar is to support: (i) strengthening crisis preparedness capacity,
including adoption of liquidity framework, capital adequacy assessment, bank resolution
framework enhancement, and deposit insurance payout functions strengthening; (ii) continued
restructuring and preparation for eventual divestment of the government's remaining holdings in
the banking and insurance industries; and (iii) progress in the development of the capital
markets.

79.    A summary of agreed PFDPL2 actions are included in the Policy Matrix and the initial
and newly agreed prior actions are featured in Box 1 below. The overall program outcomes
envisaged through this CPS period are featured in the last column of the Policy Matrix.

80.     The proposed changes to the prior actions reflect economic developments under PFDPL1
and address the priorities of corporate restructuring and banking sector strengthening in the
context of global economic crisis. The proposed changes can be summarized as follows: (i)
shifting priority from the approval of a Company Law, the work on which is still underway, to
the accelerated preparation and approval of new Bankruptcy Law, which is of critical importance
at this time of crisis; specifically, it is crucial to encourage enterprises to use new bankruptcy
procedures as an opportunity for reorganization while there is still a possibility to achieve high
level of assets recovery and settle with creditors, as well as to increase efficiency of bankruptcy

mechanism in order to ensure swift release of bankrupt companies' assets back into productive
use; (ii) removing the Law on Public Property from the list of prior actions as its successful
implementation requires harmonization and synchronization with the reform measures related to
restitution and restructuring of municipal enterprises; (iii) introducing approval of the Law on
State Aid as a prior action as it establishes much needed legislative framework for state aid
allocation; and finally, (iv) introducing two additional prior actions pertaining to the banking
sector strengthening and crisis preparedness enhancement: launch of a diagnostic process of
capital adequacy and adoption of a transparent liquidity framework.

POLICY AREAS

PILLAR I ­ Enhancing Business Environment

81.     The improvement of the business environment is anchored in several Government
programs and is central to ensuring sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation. The
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Serbia identified job creation as one of the main avenues
for poverty reduction. The privatization program and measures to strengthen fiscal discipline
implemented in the last few years and supported by a number of World Bank operations have
increased productivity and freed scarce government resources. However, future economic
growth will depend on the emergence of a more dynamic private sector and its sustainable
development, and a more conducive business environment is vital. Serbia has already made
substantial progress in this respect, but the pace of the reform slowed in the period of political
instability and change of Government. The current Government fully embraced the remaining
priorities of business environment reform agenda, as reflected in the new draft National Program
for Integration with EU, and a number of reform initiatives got new impetus. In the course of
global economic downturn, it is critical to lay solid foundation for economic recovery and
strengthening enterprise competitiveness by improving environment for business to establish and
grow.

82.     The proposed PFDPL2 operation will build on the earlier achievements and progress in
the implementation of the business environment reform agenda, focusing in particular on: (i)
further simplification of business entry through implementation of a single agency approach to
business registration; (ii) developing legal framework for strengthening corporate governance
and improving conditions for business operations; (iii) conducting comprehensive regulatory
review to streamline regulations of business operations and reduce business compliance costs;
(iv) simplifying the process of obtaining construction permits; (v) improving legal and




                                               27
institutional framework for competition;      and (vi) strengthening the legal framework for
enforcement of contracts.

Policy Area 1.1: Further simplification of the business entry through the implementation of
single agency approach for business registration

83.     Over the past five years the GoS has recorded substantial progress toward
implementation of the comprehensive business registration reforms and institutional
strengthening of the Serbian Business Registers Agency (SBRA). The reforms in this area
commenced in 2004 when the authority for registering companies was transferred to the SBRA
from trade courts and local administrative bodies. Previously, registering a company took 51
days, a minimum of US$ 5,000 of founding capital, and the registration cost of US$ 202. After
the initial reform, total administrative procedures for registering a company were reduced to 23
days, the minimum capital requirement to EUR 500 and registration costs to US$ 60.

84.     Equally, the institutional capacity of the SBRA and its efficiency increased dramatically.
In addition to the business registration, the Agency also maintains registries of leasing deals,
pledges, bankruptcies and liquidations. SBRA administers a complete electronic database on
business entities and entrepreneurs, serving as a basis for the electronic exchange of relevant
data between all state institutions. In the course of 2008, 11,248 new companies were registered
(compared to 6,329 in 2004) and 43,475 new entrepreneurs. At the same time the SBRA has
also been clearing its books from inactive companies, and as a result has deleted 3,068
companies and 34,572 entrepreneurs in 2008. During the first four months of 2009, this trend
has continued, with registration of nearly 4,000 new companies and almost 14,000 new
entrepreneurs, and deleting of over 1,000 and 12,000 inactive companies and entrepreneurs
respectively.

85.     Since beginning of reforms in this area the GoS has sought to transform the SBRA into a
one-stop-shop (OSS) for all procedures related to starting a business, including issuance of the
tax number. As part of the reform agenda supported under the PFDPL1, the GoS has adopted the
Principles for consolidating business registration procedures related to issuance of tax, pension,
and social security identification numbers in the SBRA. This was followed by amendments to
the Law on Tax Procedure and Administration empowering the SBRA to issue the tax
identification number. This reform was a decisive step towards establishing a one-stop shop for
business registration within the SBRA, which became operational on May 1, 2009, reducing the
number of days necessary for registering a business from 23 to 5.

86.    In the final phase, the reform efforts will be focused on the introduction of a single
business identification number that will be used for all purposes, as well as on eliminating
minimum capital requirements for business registration. Additional goals will include
consolidating mandatory business reporting and empowering the SBRA as a one-stop-shop for
businesses to submit their annual financial statements. Currently the procedure requires
submission to three different authorities: SBRA, NBS' Solvency Center, and Tax Authority.

87.    Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2: the Bank agreed with MoERD and MoF that the
following measures will be taken under the timeframe of the current project:



                                               28
         Amendments to the relevant laws and regulations are drafted and approved by the GoS,
         and in case of laws submitted to the Parliament for adoption, and one-stop shop for
         business registration becomes fully operational.

88.      Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

         Introduction of single identification number is completed.

Policy Area 1.2: Improving the legal framework for strengthening corporate governance and
facilitating business operations

89.     The GoS is committed to advance the reform measures aimed at making the existing legal
framework more conducive for improvement of corporate governance and facilitation of
business entry and operations. The agreed reform program includes amendments to several key
areas of the Company Law of 2004 (the Law on Business Entities). In the course of its practical
implementation certain problems with its application and the areas that required additional
regulation were identified.

90.     Several key areas will require substantial improvements. First of all, the Entrepreneurs
Law still remains in force. It has not been harmonized with the Law on Business Entities and
imposes burdensome registration requirements and other excessive regulations of entrepreneurial
activities. Unification of all provisions regulating the establishment and operation of
entrepreneurs and companies, including explicit elimination of all unnecessary requirements and
thereby annulling and replacing the Law on Entrepreneurs entirely are required. Second, the
Law on Business Entities allows for the establishment of branch offices of foreign legal entities,
but several important issues related to their foundation, operation and ceasing the activities are
not regulated. Third, the legal form of business association has been omitted in the existing
Law, and therefore new business associations cannot be established, while the legal status of
already registered ones is unclear. Fourth, regulation of complex forms of business organization
and operation (concern, holding, group of companies) is not adequate. In addition, status
changes (mergers, divisions) regulations lack consistency and clarity.

91.      The Ministry of Economy and Regional Development established expert working groups
that have been drafting amendments to the Company Law covering inter alia the following areas:
(i) enhanced corporate governance provisions, (ii) detailed regulation of new forms of operation;
(iii) clear and consistent regulation of status changes; (iv) explicit elimination of all unnecessary
requirements for the establishment and operation of entrepreneurs and companies, and sunset
provisions for the Entrepreneurs Law. The first draft of the amended Law was submitted for
review of foreign advisers funded by the EBRD. Once review is completed, the Law will be
subject to broad public consultations. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has prepared
amendments to the Law on Securities to address some immediate concerns raised by industry
representatives, and full coordination in drafting amendments to these laws was ensured.

92.    Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2: the Bank agreed with the MOERD that the
following measures will be taken under the timeframe of the current operation:




                                                 29
         Amendments to the Company Law, including those substituting for the Law on
         Entrepreneurs are drafted and submitted for public consultations.

93.      Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

         Amendments to the Company Law, including those substituting for the Law on
         Entrepreneurs, are approved by the GoS and submitted to Parliament for adoption.

Policy Area 1.3: Streamlining Regulations of Business Activities and Reducing Business
Compliance Costs

94.     By introducing a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirement into the legislative
process, the GoS took measures to ensure that the introduction of future regulatory regimes is
based on a clear rationale and proper analysis of costs and benefits, and includes appropriate
consultation with affected stakeholders. The proper implementation of the RIA will help ensure
the quality of new regulations - the legislative flow - which has a particular importance in the
context of legislation harmonization with the EU requirements. To support capacity building in
this area the Council for Regulatory Reform with the support of the Bank and Swedish
International Development Agency is implementing RIA project.

95.     However, it is impossible to create a secure and transparent legal environment without
dealing with the existing stock of legislation. In order to tackle this issue, the MoERD proposed
to conduct a comprehensive regulatory review of existing regulations known as a "regulatory
guillotine", a technique that can speed up the process of reviewing, eliminating, and streamlining
unnecessary or outdated regulations. Under the auspices of PFDPL1 the GoS has formally
initiated the reforms in this area by adopting a strategy for the implementation of a
comprehensive review of regulations governing business activities. This document has defined
the approach to the "guillotine" implementation, its scope and required resources; it also helped
to build consensus regarding reform within the Government and gain support of other key
stakeholders. The proposed reform would contribute to dramatic simplification of the regulation
of business activities and decrease in the regulatory compliance costs.

96.      In February 2009 the Government started a comprehensive regulatory review of existing
regulations, which will be implemented in four main phases: inventory, analysis,
recommendations and implementation. With the support of a SIDA grant, tailored software has
been developed and the IT system has been put in place allowing relevant government
institutions to submit the inventory of their regulations, while the government team
administering the "guillotine" process (the Regulatory Review Unit) is coordinating this effort.
The first major milestone ­ inventory phase ­ was successfully reached on March 31, 2009 with
the compilation of the final list of around 7,000 national regulations; some 2,000 of which have
been identified as impacting economic activity and will advance to the analysis and review
phase.

97.     In the analysis phase, which will take place between March 31 and September 1, 2009
the regulatory bodies will have the obligation to justify the need to retain the analyzed
legislation. This means that the burden of proof will be transferred to the regulatory bodies. It is
expected that in this phase the most important contribution to the reform will come from the


                                                30
business community. In this regard, the Government is launching a media campaign calling for
all interested parties to propose amendments and/or cancellation of laws and regulations in the
review phase by July 15, 2009. The identified regulations have been divided across 10 areas,
each of which will be chaired by a coordinator chosen depending on the topics covered (i.e.
Association of Banks, Foreign Investors Council, Association of managers, etc.). The
Government will then review all the proposals and finalize the analysis stage by September 1,
2009. All the comments and proposals will be publicly available through the website of the
Comprehensive Regulatory Review reform.

98.     The recommendation phase will include specific recommendations to the Government,
and it will be completed by December 31, 2009. Based on the information gathered during the
analysis phase, the Regulatory Review Unit will produce recommendations containing a list of
regulations, which should be abolished and a list of regulations, which should be amended, along
with specific amendments. The recommendations will be submitted for Government's adoption.

99.     Finally, it is expected that the execution of the "regulatory guillotine" will commence on
January 1, 2010. The Government is expected to implement the recommendations related to
regulations within its competence in one government session, while the recommendations related
to specific laws will be submitted to the Parliament for approval.

100. Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2: the Bank has agreed with the Serbian authorities
that the following reform measures will be taken under the timeframe of the PFDPL2:

       Comprehensive review of regulations of business activities ("regulatory guillotine") is
       underway

101.   Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

       Comprehensive review of regulations of business activities ("regulatory guillotine")
       completed, the results reflected in legislative/regulatory amendments

Policy Area 1.4: Simplifying the process of obtaining construction permits

102. Procedures related to obtaining construction permits and the associated costs remain one
of the most burdensome constraints for business development, and the Government of Serbia has
recognized that serious reforms in this area have been long overdue. In fact, according to the
Doing Business 2009 report, Serbia is near the bottom of the global list when it comes to dealing
with construction permits, and is ranked 171st (out of 181 economies). In order to tackle this
issue the GoS has prepared and approved a new draft Law on Spatial Planning and Construction,
which will introduce significant reforms in this area.

103. The new law will introduce several novel solutions, which should significantly reduce
time and costs associated with obtaining construction permits and will overall contribute to
private sector development. Specifically, in the areas where urban plans are still nonexistent the
current Republic and Regional urban plans will be applied and will provide the basis for
obtaining location permits. Further, the Law will set a deadline of 18 months (from the date of
the law) for each municipality (without one) to prepare and adopt a municipal Urban Plan: two


                                               31
years for a General Regulation Plan, and three years for all other general regulation plans. These
plans will in turn help in obtaining so-called "location information" specifying the possibilities
and criteria for construction in the particular location. The next step would include obtaining the
location permit. This eliminates two redundant steps in the process (namely conceptual design
and construction approval, which used to take between 3-6 months) and leads directly to the
development of main design and issuing of construction permit. The Law will also allow for
transfer of construction permits, as well as design modifications, which previously required
starting the whole process anew. Additionally, the time required for forming the construction
parcel (merging and splitting) will be significantly reduced. Further, the legalization procedure
will be simplified as well, allowing for resolution of illegal settlements.

104. The Law will specify two types of construction land, namely city construction land and
that beyond its boundaries, and for the first time since 1958 it will be possible to
purchase/acquire city construction land, but only in cases where there are no pending restitution
issues. In some case this will be achieved by conversion of the right to use into ownership, a
process for which the companies will have to pay a premium charge to be determined by the Tax
Authority. Finally, the Law will introduce provisions allowing for changes in the title of leasing
contracts and allow private investors to equip the construction land with adequate infrastructure
themselves (as opposed to paying the city for those works) and in exchange paying lower fees.
Overall, it is expected that the new Law will be a major step towards more efficient process of
obtaining construction permits. Finally, the GoS is urged to carefully design the implementation
phase and ensure utmost transparency.

105.   Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2:

       The new Law on Spatial Planning and Construction is drafted and submitted for public
       consultations.

106.   Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

       The new Law on Spatial Planning and Construction is approved by GoS and submitted to
       Parliament for adoption.

Policy Area 1.5: Improving Legal and Institutional Framework for Competition

107. The GoS has taken some important steps to protect consumers and strengthen the
competitive environment by adopting a new Competition Law in 2005. However, the
implementation of this Law has proven problematic. More than three years into implementation
all local counterparts have agreed that this Law has several important deficiencies, including: (i)
the lengthy period of time required for a merger, which contradicts the privatization law takeover
procedures; (ii) unclear delineation of responsibilities among the Competition Commission, the
Privatization Agency and the NBS; (iii) the very low thresholds for concentration of capital
notifications ­ requiring almost every merger/sale/ tender to undergo scrutiny by the
Commission; (iv) weak institutional arrangements; and (v) lack of clarity with respect to the
basis for notification fees and applicable fines leads to prohibitively high compliance costs.




                                                32
108. Initially, the GoS intended to address the described priorities by amending the existing
law.    However, in the meantime, and with the assistance of European Agency for
Reconstruction/European Commission, it has opted for the more ambitious approach of drafting
a brand new law. The Ministry of Trade and Services has led the work on producing a new law,
which would address all major business concerns, strengthen the independence of the
Commission for Protection of Competition, and be fully in line with EU standards, thus ensuring
effective implementation of the legislative provisions. The Law will be followed by a set of
regulations ensuring full implementation, namely defining and specifying: criteria defining
relevant market; requests for individual exemption; categories and special conditions for block-
exemptions; the Statute of the Commission for Protection of Competition; Commission's tariffs;
form and content of the official identification; criteria for measurement of the amounts of fines,
and the payment timeframe; conditions for provision of protective measures; notification of
concentration; and conditions for relief from pecuniary fines under measures for protection of
competition. Finally, further capacity building of the Commission for Protection of Competition
remains a part of a medium term reform objective as well.

109.    The Bank team has reviewed the proposed draft, which it found largely acceptable, and
submitted some minor comments for GoS consideration. The proposed draft Law was adopted
in the Parliament.

110.   Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2:

       The Borrower has submitted to its Parliament for adoption the draft competition
       law satisfactory to the Bank

111.   Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

       Regulations and by-laws required for Competition Law implementation are drafted and
       approved by the GoS.

Policy area 1.6: Improving Effectiveness of Contracts Enforcement

112. According to Doing Business 2009 indicators on enforcing contracts Serbia ranks 96th in
the world, and is at the bottom of regional list of economies in this regard, with 635 days
necessary for enforcement. Also, studies commissioned by a USAID-funded Bankruptcy and
Enforcement Strengthening Project (BES) show that 73 percent of companies surveyed in Serbia
"never or rarely" use the court for enforcement due to system failure, that the recovery rate for
judgments in commercial courts is less than 5 percent, and that the average age of a commercial
enforcement case is more than 500 days. Further, the European Court of Human Rights has
ruled nine times against Serbia over the past three years over human rights violations resulting
from the inability to enforce court judgments in Serbia.

113. In order to tackle these problems, the Ministry of Justice decided to implement reforms
aimed at significantly improving the enforcement process in Serbia. In this regard, draft
amendments to the Enforcement Law were produced and they include inter alia a novel solution
­ introduction of professional enforcement officers (i.e. private bailiffs). This measure has
already been implemented successfully in the region, most notably in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and


                                               33
Hungary, and the MoJ is fully behind this concept. The proposed system provides for MoJ's
close and direct supervision and licensing of professional enforcement officers to ensure
transparent and lawful execution. The public consultations and promotion of the draft have been
initiated, but further consultations are necessary in order to build a wider consensus and support
for implementation of this novel approach. The Ministry has also appointed additional members
to the working group in charge of preparing amendments to Enforcement Law, which are
expected to fine tune and harmonize the draft with the Constitution and existing legal
framework. It is expected that the amendments will be submitted for Government approval in
fall 2009.

       Amendments to Enforcement Law are drafted and submitted to public consultations.

       Amendments to Enforcement Law are approved by the Government and submitted to
       Parliament for approval.

PILLAR II - Strengthening Financial Discipline

116. Under PFDPL1, the GoS took important steps towards strengthening of financial
discipline in enterprise sector. The proposed operation will build upon and expand the PFDPL1
agenda in this crucial area, focusing on: (i) further reduction of direct and indirect subsidies to
enterprise sector and regulation of subsidy policy through the new Law on State Aid; (ii) support
for restructuring, privatization and, where applicable, bankruptcy and/or forced liquidation of
socially-owned enterprises; (iii) continuation of the unbundling and restructuring of public
utilities.

Policy Area 2.1: Improving Financial Discipline in the Socially-Owned Enterprise (SOE)
Sector

117. Diagnostic. The GoS continues to provide financial support to the enterprise sector.
Some socially-owned enterprises still awaiting privatization continue to benefit from both direct
and indirect subsidies, extended by the state and state-controlled entities. The direct subsidy in
form of soft loans is administered by the Ministry of Economy. The indirect subsidy can take
many forms: non-payment or partial payment of taxes; arrears to state-owned utilities such as
EPS; arrears to public funds on pension, social security, and unemployment contributions.
While it is difficult to measure indirect subsidies with any precision, a crude analysis of the
financial statements of sixty SOEs undergoing restructuring process suggested that in 2004 they
amounted to nearly EUR 200 million, thus dwarfing the direct subsidy extended to these SOEs
over the same period (EUR 53.9 million).

118. Subsidies are in general used for a number of different purposes such as addressing
market failures and achieving economies of scale in production. However, in Serbia they are to
a large extent used for keeping the loss-making socially-owned companies afloat. Support to
state- and socially-owned enterprises, which are supposed to be privatized constituted about 16


                                                34
percent of total consolidated general government subsidies in 2008, once the indirect subsidies
are included. This figure excludes subsidies from local governments to their respective utility
companies, as their statistics are not publicly available. Nearly half of this amount consisted of
soft loans provided by the Development Fund (of which only some 10 percent is being repaid)
and payments by the Transition and Solidarity Fund, which finance severance in connection with
the pre-privatization staff restructuring.

119. It is important to note that both the direct and indirect subsidies among socially-owned
enterprises are concentrated in just a handful of SOEs. Two of the largest remaining SOEs at the
time - car maker Zastava Group and mining complex RTB Bor - absorbed more than a quarter of
the total subsidy envelope over the past several years, with roughly half of this figure coming in
the form of direct support from the MOERD. In 2008, Zastava received about 40 percent of the
direct subsidies administered by MOERD. In the case of RTB Bor, which receives far less in
terms of direct subsidies (a soft loan of RSD 39 million), accumulated debt to state and private
institutions amounted to a record EUR 670 million (or 1.9 percent of GDP) in 2008, with a debt
to state amounting to EUR 180 million (or 0.5 percent of GDP). In September 2008, the
Government had signed a deal on a strategic partnership between Zastava and Italian car maker
FIAT, which should improve the existing situation in the longer term. At the same time, the GoS
is currently actively searching for a strategic partner for RTB Bor.

120. Given the current relative level of subsidies is four and a half times higher than the
average for EU27, which allocates 0.9 percent of GDP for state aid, there is room for saving at
least two percentage points of GDP. In addition, the overall level of state aid in the EU27 shows
a declining trend since 2001, which is to likely to continue after the temporary hikes related to
global economic crisis mitigation policies.

121. The structure of state aid in Serbia points to a strong reliance on sectoral subsidies, which
according to the EU rules as well as from the economic point of view are considered distortive
and negative.      They are distorting market competition and reducing the country's
competitiveness over the long run, by spending public resources on unviable companies. Serbia
allocated more than three-quarters of the state aid on sectoral aid in 2008, while horizontal aid,
which primarily tends to address market failures, received less than ten percent of overall aid. In
comparison, the in the EU27 only 30 percent of the overall aid went to specific sectors, while
horizontal aid constituted the most important source of enterprise assistance.

122. Government Actions. Serbia has just introduced a legislative framework for state aid and
it is working on establishing an operationally independent state aid authority and a system of ex-
ante control of state aid as per the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU3.
Further, the work on establishment of state aid recipients is underway. The Ministry of Finance
has drafted the Law on State Aid with the intention to harmonize with the EU state aid rules and
the Law was adopted in the Parliament. However, there is still room for improvement in regard
to institutional setup and ensuring transparency in allocation of aid.

123. The GoS is aware of the subsidies' pernicious effect, and is committed to strengthening
the financial discipline in the SOE sector. The level of direct enterprise subsidies has fallen in

relative terms over the last several years, mainly due to the success of privatization efforts.
Privatization has advanced in 2008, with 18 of the 20 largest SOEs offered for sale, nine of
which were sold and one liquidated through bankruptcy. Altogether around 240 companies were
sold through different privatization models. However, the indirect forms of pre-privatization
related subsidies have grown. Recent agreements to sell the state petroleum company (NIS) and
the automobile company (Zastava) are expected to reduce subsidies over the medium term, as the
terms of their sale require substantial state assistance in the near term. Further, under the
framework of previous bank sponsored operations (PPFDPC-1 and PFDPL1) the aforementioned
direct subsidies administered by MOERD have been steadily declining over the years, along with
the progress of the privatization process. However, as in the case of other countries, the global
crisis has forced the Government to slightly increase the planned allocation in order to mitigate
the social risks posed by potential failure of some of the recipient socially-owned enterprises.

124. Initially, in the 2008 budget the Government had planned to decrease the direct subsidy
administered by MOERD to RSD 3.1 billion (compared to RSD 5 billion in 2005), but due to the
crisis and associated budget revision the GoS ended 2008 with an actual disbursement of RSD
3.9 billion. By the same token, the initially adopted budget for 2009 had specified a further
reduction in this amount to RSD 2.95 billion, but in the recent budget revision the proposed
amount has increased to RSD 3.55 billion for 2009, remaining below the actual allocation in
2008. The principal reason for this was the increased demand for funds, as the privatization
contracts for some of the previously resolved large enterprises have been cancelled largely due to
investors' inability to meet contractual investment obligations (i.e. Azotara Pancevo, Letex,
Magnohrom, etc.). At the same time, in the revised 2009 budget the GoS has proposed a
reduction in the direct subsidy to state-owned PEU Resavica, bringing the total amount for 2009
to RSD 1.37 billion, down from RSD 1.97 billion in 2008. The new Law on State Aid should
address the issue of subsidies in a systemic way, and bring it in line with EU regulations. While
the Law has some deficiencies, overall this is a positive reform signal as it will provide a legal
framework for regulation of state aid.

125. Bank's Assessment/Recommendation. The existence of subsidies not only contributes
substantially to the fiscal deficit, it also represents a significant obstacle to restructuring and
resolution through the sale or bankruptcy of the loss-making SOEs. The direct and indirect
support provided by the state allows the management and employees of poorly performing
enterprises to postpone the painful restructuring, thereby preventing release of non-core assets to
higher productivity users. At the same time, the entry and market access of private firms are
crowded-out by un-restructured SOEs that continue to function in a soft budget environment.

126. Accumulation of arrears from SOEs undermines the solvency of public institutions, such
as the pension fund and the national health-service. In the case of public utilities such as EPS,
the unpaid liabilities result in higher cost of services and deprive the companies of financial
resources for much-needed modernization.

127. It is thus crucial for the resolution of the remaining SOEs that the GoS systemically
addresses the financial discipline problem by closing off sources of direct and indirect subsidies.
In this respect, the continuation of public sector reform should help reduce the supply of
subsidies. However, both regional and global experiences provide ample evidence that the soft



                                                36
budget problem will persist for as long as there exists the demand for state support in the form of
loss-making, inefficient SOEs. It is thus imperative that the GoS accelerates the resolution of
these enterprises through privatization or bankruptcy.

128. The Serbian Government currently subsidizes almost all the sectors of economy without
clear rationale. It is difficult to explain why retail trade, community development, construction
and tourism companies are selected for state support given no evidence of market failure exists
in these sectors. The evaluation, approval and recovery of state aid should be meritocratic,
unbiased, technical and non-politicized. The proposed draft Law on State Aid emphasizes the
need to avoid conflict of interest between the same providers and authorization bodies for the
state aid, but the appropriate institutional setup has not been finalized. The Commission for
State Aid Control should be set up as an independent, parliament-established body vested with
public powers, with professionals chosen through open, public competition with open-ended
term contracts. It would also require appropriate staffing for technical and administrative
support. Given the overlapping mandate with the Commission for the Protection of Competition,
these two institutions should ideally be merged under the above-mentioned conditions, utilizing
already existing expertise.

129. Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2: Based on the above analysis and the discussions
with the MOF, MOERD, and PA counterparts, the Bank has agreed with GoS on the following
measures:

       Reduction in the direct MOERD subsidy to SOE sector in the 2009 budgets to RSD 3.5
       billion from RSD 3.9 billion (actual) in 2008 budget;

       The Borrower has submitted to its Parliament for adoption the draft law on state
       aid satisfactory to the Bank

130.   Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

       Registry of recipients of state aid is established within the SBRA and fully
       operational

Policy Area 2.2: Privatization, Restructuring, and Bankruptcy of Socially-Owned and State-
Owned Enterprises

131. Diagnostic. At the core of Serbia's enterprise sector reform strategy over the past seven
years has been the ambitious program of privatizing socially-owned enterprises. The principles
of the approach are laid out in the Privatization Law of June 2001, which incorporated
international best practice and lessons learned from other transition economies. The principle
lesson drawn from experience of other transition countries was that privatizations that put core,
dominant investors in charge of the firms worked better than those that passed ownership to
diffused, inexperienced groups of workers or citizens. The law thus stipulated three methods of
privatization: (i) tenders of large enterprises, offering to a strategic investor at least 70 percent of
the shares; (ii) auctions of medium-sized enterprises; and (iii) restructuring and subsequent
tenders and/or auctions of large loss-making enterprises and/or parts thereof. The selected



                                                  37
privatization model was aimed to overcome the problems, which arose from the voucher-
privatization model implemented in many other transition countries in Eastern Europe. It was
more conducive to improving corporate governance and real sector efficiency, attracting foreign
capital and technology, and ultimately fueling Serbia's economic growth.

132. Government Actions. Between 2001 and 2009, the Privatization Agency, supported by
the Bank at both policy and technical level, achieved significant progress in implementing the
Government's privatization program. Overall, since the beginning of privatization in 2002 and
as of end-April 2009 Serbia has privatized over 2,500 companies, ensuring improved corporate
governance and significantly eliminating the demand for subsidies and securing nearly EUR 2.9
billion in privatization revenues. Further, during the same period the new owners have pledged
nearly EUR 1.4 billion in investment plans, and over EUR 276 million in social programs, thus
contributing both to future economic growth and social cohesion. Notwithstanding the difficult
political environment, the overall scope, pace and transaction quality of these privatizations
compared favorably to similar stages of reform in other transition economies.

133. Supported by the first PFDPL operation the GoS has introduced changes to the regulatory
framework setting a clear deadline for launching the privatization of all socially-owned
enterprises, and regulated and executed the process of distributing free shares. Further, it has
continued with mandatory privatization of socially-owned enterprises, offering at least 350
enterprises through auctions, seven from the restructuring, while the state-owned creditors have
petitioned for bankruptcy of at least 22 companies.

134. Despite the deteriorating market conditions in 2009, the PA has continued with its legally
mandated activities. The progressive trend is continuing as reflected in the following table
exhibiting results from the period immediately following the previous operation (PFDPL1), and
supported under the current project (PFDPL2):

135. The PA is completing the mandated privatization program. As of end June 2009, nearly
400 enterprises remained on the books of the PA's Auction Center (281 socially- and 106 state-
owned)4 and 51 enterprises in the Tender Center pipeline.

136. Bankruptcy and Forced Liquidation of SOEs. In parallel with privatization activities the
PA has been identifying SOEs, which would be subject to bankruptcy. During the observed
period 58 qualifying companies were sent to bankruptcy. In addition, the recent amendments to
the Privatization Law provide for the option of a "forced liquidation", which would be applied in
cases where: (i) announcement of public tender/auction has not been published; (ii) the company
(capital/assets) was not sold even after the third attempt; and (iii) if the entity subject to
privatization failed to submit its financial report to the business registration agency for two years
in a row. After assessing its portfolio the PA has so far identified 332 companies to undergo
forced liquidation, and this process is currently underway in 33 companies. Having an effective
bankruptcy instrument is a prerequisite for successful enterprise restructuring.                 The
implementation of the current bankruptcy law started on February 1, 2005 and the Privatization
Agency Bankruptcy Unit (PABU) has been established to act as the bankruptcy administrator of
insolvent socially- and state-owned enterprises. As of July 2009, 383 bankruptcy administrators
have been trained to apply the law and have received licenses. Since 2005, the PABU was
assigned 524 cases ­ of which approximately 53 percent were initiated under the current law -
and so far it has resolved 260 cases. In 2008 alone, the PABU was assigned 44 new cases, of
which approximately 25 percent were initiated by state creditors.

137. The current Bankruptcy Law, adopted in 2004, represents a significant step forward
compared to the previous version. The conceptual framework of the present law works
reasonably well, but given the number of insolvent or liquidity constrained companies (currently
over 20,000 with blocked accounts) in practice there have been relatively few cases initiated
(150-200 per year). Further, the bankruptcy process is more costly and lengthier than in other
comparable countries. Two key problems leading to the unsatisfactory performance of the
current bankruptcy framework include low recovery rates and delays in proceedings. Low
recovery rates are attributed to the late initiation of cases due to lack of incentive for both
debtors and creditors, while numerous other factors contribute to delays in proceedings, such as:
unclear legal remedies, creditors' passivity, inefficient court rulings and enforcement,
inconsistent application of the law, and ineffective regulation of bankruptcy administrators. In
order to improve the existing framework and to accelerate the bankruptcy process the GoS has
decided to prepare a new Bankruptcy Law.

138. The newly proposed Bankruptcy Law introduces changes aimed at addressing the
abovementioned shortcomings. Some of the most important changes include tightening of
efficiency and process timelines and new rules for pre-packaged plans. In addition, the proposed
draft also improves the current bankruptcy framework, particularly in regards to the addition of
the set-off provisions, the improvements to the reorganization process, and the avoidance of pre-
bankruptcy transactions. Furthermore, it clarifies issues with respect to licensing, appointment,
removal, and disciplining of bankruptcy administrators. The proposed changes were developed

  Approximately 210 companies are under unresolved or disputed status and cannot be offered for sale at this time.
Further, certain companies that were offered by the end of December are in different stages of privatization, and
therefore still remain in the PA portfolio.


                                                        39
on the basis of analyses and data from local and foreign experts, the Bankruptcy Supervision
Agency (BSA), courts, and NBS. The amendments also benefited from consultation with
stakeholders (i.e. administrators, judges, etc.) and leading international organizations. The GoS
has approved the new draft Law and submitted it to Parliament for adoption.

139. In order to ensure smooth implementation, the new Law will be followed by additional
initiatives such as the amendments to the Law on the Bankruptcy Supervision Agency (drafted
and to be submitted to GOS), the revision of National Standards for Administering the Bankrupt
Estate, as well as the revision of the Code of Ethics, which is being developed by the BSA with
the technical assistance of the USAID and EBRD. Further, in order to strengthen the capacity of
the BSA the work on the development of the bankruptcy administrators' electronic reporting
system and the Bankruptcy Administration Portal is currently underway. While the former will
be used to track bankruptcy administrators' case activities the latter will be utilized as a public
information portal to promote best practices and advertise bankruptcy sales.

140. Distribution of Shares to the Public. In 2007 the Government introduced the Law on
Citizens' Rights to Gratis Shares and Cash Benefits in the Privatization Process (hereinafter Law
on Gratis Shares) specifying that 15 percent of the shares of the companies sold in tender
procedures and held by the Privatization Register would be sold in an open and transparent
manner by competitive bidding, and that the proceeds would be distributed in cash to eligible
citizens. MoERD has established adequate procedures for the sale of shares, and the process was
executed accordingly. By the end of 2008, the Share Fund had sold shares of 39 companies from
the privatization register, realizing total revenue of more than EUR 87.3 million, while 61
packages of shares remained unsold and GoS has yet to determine the procedure for their
resolution, taking into consideration current market conditions.

141. Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises. The corporatization and eventual privatization
of public utilities is a major challenge facing the Government in next several years. The GoS has
recently sold 51 percent of the state oil company (NIS) to Russian Gazprom, and has also
formally initiated privatization of several other state owned companies, namely underground
coal mining enterprise PEU Resavica, national airline company JAT Airways, and most recently
pharmaceutical producer Galenika. While privatization of PEU Resavica is stalled, the tender
for JAT Airways was announced but no bids were received, and the GOS has recently hired
privatization advisors for Galenika. The Government has also announced that it would initiate
minority/majority privatization of other state-owned companies. However, the ongoing global
economic crisis may delay the implementation of these plans.

142. Privatization of Municipal Enterprises.            Following the implementation of the
privatization of socially owned enterprises the GoS has decided to commence the work on
reforming municipal enterprises as well. Currently, Serbia has more than 600 such enterprises
operating across over 160 municipalities in various sectors. In order to tackle this issue the GoS
has formed a working group composed of relevant stakeholders and led by MoERD to prepare an
adequate Strategy to identify and address all outstanding issues and propose a way forward. The
World Bank has provided support to the GoS by contracting a consultant to assist with this
exercise. It is expected that the Strategy will be drafted and adopted by the GoS by the end of
2009.



                                                40
143. Bank Assessment/Recommendation. Notwithstanding impressive overall progress to date,
the following issues remain to be addressed by the GoS: (i) completing privatization, forced
liquidation, and bankruptcy of SOEs remaining in the PA's portfolio; (ii) improve the regulatory
framework for bankruptcy; and (iii) develop the Strategy for Municipal Enterprises.

144.   Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2:

       The GoS has established working group for developing Strategy for privatization and
       restructuring of municipal enterprises

       The Borrower's Government has approved the draft bankruptcy law, satisfactory to
       the Bank, for submission to the Borrower's Parliament

       Amendments to the Law on Bankruptcy Supervision Agency are approved by the GoS
       and submitted to Parliament for adoption

       Starting on September 1, 2008, bankruptcy proceedings will be initiated for: (i) at least
       [25] qualifying SOEs from PA's Auction Center; and (ii) at least [2] qualifying SOEs
       from PA's Tender Center

       The Borrower has conducted the sale of shares of socially-owned enterprises in its
       Privatization Register in accordance with procedures established by the Borrower's
       Ministry of Economy and Regional Development and satisfactory to the Bank

145.   Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

       Strategy for privatization and restructuring of municipal enterprises is drafted and
       approved by GoS.

       All socially owned companies in the PA portfolio qualified for forced liquidation will be
       subject to this process by December 31, 2009.

Policy Area 2.3: Energy Sector Reform

146. The energy industry of Serbia, in its broad sense, represents a comprehensive energy
industry mix consisting of power generation (coal and hydro), oil and natural gas industry, coal
mines and decentralized systems of district heating companies and industrial energy. The state-
owned company Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) is in charge of virtually all power generation and
distribution. Elektromreza Srbije is the power transmission system and market operator
company. Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), a recently sold oil company, controls domestic
production of oil and gas, two refineries in Pancevo (4.8 million tons output per year) and Novi
Sad (1.8 million tons), and petroleum products distribution systems including gasoline stations
(largest operator in the Serbian market). Public enterprise Transnafta undertakes oil and oil
derivatives transportation and distribution, and public enterprise Srbijagas is the major natural
gas transmission, distribution, storage and trading company in Serbia.



                                               41
147. Serbian oil and gas reserves and production are small; coal reserves and production are
substantial (38 million tons in 2008). Domestic power production largely meets domestic
demand for the time being (35,032 GWh produced in 2008 plus net imports of 616 GWh) and
gas is imported from Russia (8 percent of gas production is domestically produced). An import
ban for petroleum products, expiring at the end of 2010, gives market protection to the two
refineries.

148. Over the past few years, the Serbian energy sector has seen a considerable amount of
investments, partially donor funded, and has in the case of electricity made progress in
improving the supply system to a level that allowed reconnection to the European Interconnected
Power Network (UCTE) in 2004. In 2005, Serbia joined the EU-supported Energy Community
of Southeast Europe. The power and gas sectors have recently been structured in compliance
with EU's internal market regulations, i.e. transmission functions have been separated from
production, distribution, and sales activities. An Energy Agency (regulator) was established in
2005.

149. The Serbian Government gives considerable weight to energy security. Therefore, in
January 2008 an intergovernmental energy agreement was entered into with the Russian
Federation. The agreement provides for the building of a natural gas transit pipeline (South
Stream) with a capacity of at least 10 billion cubic meters annually for Russian natural gas across
Serbia. The agreement further involved the sale of a majority of shares (51 percent) in NIS to
Gazpromneft, a majority state-owned Russian oil and gas company. Furthermore, Russian
financial support to complete construction of the Banatski Dvor underground gas storage in
Serbia is part of the agreement. Natural gas is currently available to Serbia only through a
Hungarian pipeline connection that due to capacity constraints hinders the expansion of the
Serbian gas distribution network and is a driver behind gas storage investments.

150. Serbia is facing looming electricity deficits domestically and in the region. Increasing
domestic power demand may soon lead to a power deficit that has been estimated to grow to
around 800 MW of missing capacity by 2012, although the recent economic crisis may delay the
widening of the supply deficit. Thus, one of the major and costly challenges facing the Serbian
energy sector is the replacement of retiring power generation units and the addition of new
generation capacity. In agreement with the Bank under the previous PFDPL1 operation, the
Government of Serbia has decided on a strategy in which the private sector would take majority
control of and manage major power generation assets to be built during the coming 5-7 years.
Hence, on January 20, 2009, EPS invited strategic investors to express interest in joint
development of new power generation capacity in Kolubara B (2x350 MW) and TENT B3 (new
block of 700 MW). More than twenty firms showed interest in investing in each of the plants,
and five international companies have been shortlisted for bidding on the plants in separate
bidding processes. The Government expects to have the strategic investor(s) selected by end-
2009 or early 2010. The Bank considers this an important step in the direction of creating a
more competitive market environment in Serbia's power sector and the region. The Regional
Power Generation Investment Study5 that was undertaken by the World Bank shows that
investments in Kolubara B and TENT B3 are among the most cost-efficient new generation

5
    The study was prepared in 2004 and updated in January 2007.

projects in South East Europe. Their scale (combined 1,400 MW) makes them suitable to serve
Serbia as well as the greater regional market.

151. NIS refineries in Pancevo and Novi Sad will remain uncompetitive until major
investments in their modernization are undertaken. The Government keeps the refineries in
operation through market protection in the form of a temporary import ban on petroleum
products. The Government has agreed under this PFDPL that the lifting of this ban and the
introduction of full, open competition in petroleum products shall take place no later than
December 31, 2010. The new owner of NIS has initiated large investments in the Pancevo
refinery to increase plant efficiency and product quality.

152. End-user tariffs for electricity have been raised significantly over the last several years
and are currently covering about 90 percent of operating costs (causing delayed maintenance)
but not yet generating sufficient revenues for EPS to undertake significant investment
interventions. The payment collections amount to about 90 percent for households and near 100
percent for larger consumers. Gas tariffs exceeded costs mid 2009; however, tariffs were kept
unchanged to help Serbiagas recuperate economic losses last winter caused by the Russian-
Ukrainian gas supply crisis. The Government recognizes the substantial financial requirements
to maintain the gas and power systems, to undertake environmental investments, and to expand
supply capacities. It has therefore agreed, in the context of this PFDPL program, to implement
gradual tariff adjustments to reach cost-recovering tariffs for electricity and natural gas in 20106.

153. The current world economic crisis, inflation expectations, and social concerns have
caused the Government to postpone this year's price increase of 8-10 percent.

154. The Government and the management of EPS recognize that the power utility will have
to enhance its operational efficiency and undertake some further restructuring in order to utilize
its resources in the best possible way and to prepare for the competitive pressures in generation
and marketing that are emerging in the Energy Community of South East Europe. A major
efficiency/restructuring study has been undertaken for EPS by international consultants (Arthur
D. Little). Guided by such expertise, the Government plans to adopt a strategy and time-bound
action plan to restructure and improve operational efficiency of EPS, also with the facilitation of
private sector participation in the power sector in mind. However, the firming up of this plan
may not take place before 2010, in part due to management changes in EPS. Pollution from the
consumption of low quality petroleum products is considered a serious problem in Serbia.
However, as the import ban for petroleum products is lifted at the end of 2010, the Government
plans to require petroleum products to meet EU-based quality standards. New legislation (May
2009) has vested the Ministry of Mining and Energy with the task of preparing and implement
regulation for EU-compliant petroleum quality standards.

155.    Actions to be taken under the PFDPL-2:

        By issuing requests for Expression of Interest, the Government has initiated the process
        of developing two new major power generation units with private sector majority control

6
 Although Serbia has established a regulatory agency for energy, the Serbian Energy Law provides the Government
with the authority to approve adjustments to electricity and gas tariffs.


                                                      43
       The Government has developed a time-bound action plan for introducing EU-based
       petroleum product quality standards.

156.   Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

       Financial closure is achieved for at least one new thermal power plant;

       The Government has adopted EU-based petroleum product quality standards to be made
       effective from January 1, 2011;

       Tariffs for electricity and gas have been increased to cost recovery level;

       The Government has adopted a strategy and time-bound action plan, guided by
       international expertise, to restructure and improve operational efficiency of EPS among
       other to facilitate private sector participation in the power sector.


PILLAR III - Building a More Efficient and Stable Financial Sector

157. Over the past eight months GoS and NBS have put in place a full-fledged crisis
management framework. As an immediate response to the October/November 2008 deposit
withdrawal, GoS announced a series of measures aimed at enhancing market confidence. Over
the following months and under the auspices of the Vienna initiative, GoS has completed the
design of the crisis management framework by: (i) announcing the liquidity framework, (ii)
designing a diagnostic process, and (iii) developing a recapitalization or resolution program. To
ensure that the DIA is prepared in the event large scale payouts are required, GoS has also
committed to strengthening the Fund. Finally to promote restructuring amongst state owned
banks and consolidation in the system, GoS has committed to merging three or four majority
state owned banks.

Policy Area 3.1: Strengthening crisis preparedness, including development of liquidity
framework, capital adequacy assessment, bank resolution framework enhancement, and
deposit insurance payout functions strengthening

158. Liquidity Framework. The NBS announced transparent LOLR rules and other liquidity
facilities. As announced in the NBS regulation on Conditions for Approval of Loans for
Maintaining Liquidity of Banks (Official Gazette 96/2008), solvent but illiquid banks with
adequate collateral can access the LOLR facility at 150% of repo for up to 12 months. Further,
as an incentive for banks that participate in the FSSP, banks will be granted access to two new
NBS liquidity facilities: (i) an extended dinar liquidity facility (max 1 year, repo interest plus
1.5% and accepted collateral includes GoS or NBS security or a pool of mortgage loans) to help
banks with loan restructuring, and (ii) a foreign exchange swap facility with a two week maturity
and an implicit roll over guarantee. The NBS Monetary Committee regulates these liquidity
facilities. Finally, the 2009 supplemental budget provides a guarantee of RSD 40 billion to the
NBS for financing liquidity of banks.


                                                44
159. Bank Diagnostic Stress Tests and Potential Recapitalization. In June the NBS has started
the diagnostic process for the entire banking sector, which will be completed in December 2009.
In particular, the diagnostic will be completed by the end of September 2009 for the 12 largest
banks and the four majority state owned banks. The remaining 18 banks will undergo the
diagnostic by the end of 2009. The diagnostic is structured in two phases. In the first phase, the
NBS will undertake an on-site inspection of all banks focusing on the performance of the loan
portfolio as of end March. In the second phase, the NBS will perform stress testing on the
adjusted statements with the assistance of the IMF.

160. Problem Bank Resolution. The GoS is introducing the necessary changes in the legal
framework in this area in order to increase the number of resolution tools available, and to
empower the DIA as the executing agency for any transaction that requires public resources. In
this regard, two types of legislative proposals are being prepared. The first is a brand new anti-
crisis law providing for an additional legal authority to the MoF, NBS and DIA in the event of a
systemic banking crisis. The second one includes a series of proposed amendments to the Law
on Banks, Law on DIA, and Law on Bankruptcy and Liquidation of Banks and Insurance
Companies in order to improve the bank resolution framework.

161. The proposed legal framework introduces an array of tools for use in resolutions. These
include open and closed bank purchase and assumption transactions, bridge banks, and a range
of financial assistance to acquirers subject to a cost test. In addition, the proposals include
explicit steps for official receivers to recapitalize undercapitalized banks, a moratorium on the
payment of liabilities by banks subject to official receivership, limitations on the ability of courts
to suspend or block resolutions, and increased protections from civil litigation for employees of
NBS, MoF, and DIA.

162. Strengthening Deposit Insurance Payout Functions. The increase in deposit insurance
coverage and shortening of the payout period need to be accompanied by the development of a
detailed payout procedure, investments in adequate software, and the implementation of the
NBS-DIA MoU on exchange of information, all of which are necessary for fast deposit payout.
The DIA needs to develop internal policies on payout processes and a software that covers the
three phases of deposit payout (transfer of data from bankrupted bank, processing of the data at
DIA, and reimbursement process and recording reimbursements at DIA). Finally, the existing
2006 DIA-NBS bilateral memorandum (MoU), that suggests that the DIA should receive regular
information on inspections of banks, inaccurate reports provided to DIA (if such inaccuracy was
discovered during on-site inspection by NBS), measures imposed on banks as result of on-site
inspections and other relevant information, needs to be implemented with better exchange of
information between the DIA and the NBS. This is important for the DIA to be able to assess
the risk profile of banks, and better prepare for the payout. The urgency of addressing this issue
has been increased since the latest legal amendments that require the DIA to start payout within
three days. The improved MOU was signed on July 21, 2009.

163. In case of deteriorating financial sector conditions and insufficient funding, Deposit
Insurance Agency can impose extraordinary premiums in line with the Law on DIA. In case the
resources were to be insufficient even after the collection of such premiums, the Agency could




                                                 45
borrow additional funds. Both levy of extraordinary premium and loans, which are fully
guaranteed by the GoS as per DIA Law, require Management Board approval.

164. Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2: to complete the crisis preparedness framework,
the Bank and Serbian authorities agreed on the following actions:

       The Borrower has commenced a diagnostic assessment of the banking sector,
       satisfactory to the Bank, including the approval of: (a) a methodology for such
       assessment; and (b) a decision process which takes into account banks' capital,
       earnings and liquidity;

       The Borrower has adopted a liquidity framework for the banking sector,
       satisfactory to the Bank, including the approval of: (a) rules regulating lender of last
       resort and other liquidity instruments; and (b) legal authority for the Borrower to
       guarantee lender of last resort financing from the National Bank of Serbia to
       solvent banks;

       Law on Banking Sector Stability and Amendments to Laws on Banks, Bankruptcy and
       Liquidation of Banks and Insurance Companies, and DIA are drafted and approved by
       GoS for submission to Parliament with the following provisions: (i) Legal authority for
       DIA to engage in transfers of assets and liabilities prior to license revocation and
       recapitalization of banks in each case with financial assistance subject to a cost test; (ii)
       In a systemic crisis, broad powers for the DIA to engage in such transactions as agent for
       GoS and to provide financial assistance without limitation by the cost test; (iii) Legal
       authority for bridge banks to be used for bank resolutions; (iv) Legal authority for the
       NBS to impose a moratorium on all payments by banks other than deposits and to
       suspend all litigation against the bank; (v) Additional grounds for appointment by NBS
       of official receivers (temporary administrators) and license revocation by NBS; (vi)
       Legal authority for the GoS to extend a line of credit to DIA; (vii) Legal authority for the
       GoS to provide a blanket guarantee of bank liabilities in a systemic crisis; (viii) Statutory
       protections for DIA and MoF employees against civil lawsuits;

       Strengthening Deposit Insurance Payout functions: (i) DIA to develop and Managing
       Board to approve: (a) Satisfactory procedure for payout of insured deposits; (b) Rules on
       collection of extraordinary premiums; (c) Rules on DIA loans to liquidated banks; and
       (d) Rules for DIA to borrow if funds are insufficient for payout; and (ii) NBS and DIA to
       amend and implement the 2006 DIA-NBS MoU to include a timeframe within which the
       information should be exchanged.

165.   Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

       Satisfactory implementation of the diagnostic process and recapitalization/resolution
       proceeds as planned;




                                                46
         The diagnostic process for the largest 12 banks plus 4 majority state-owned banks
         in accordance with the methodology adopted under PFDPL2 completed and the
         recapitalization to at least CAR 12% is underway, if necessary7;

         Law on Banking Sector Stability and amendments to Laws on Banks, Bankruptcy
         and Liquidation of Banks and Insurance Companies, and Deposit Insurance Agency
         are enacted by Parliament and their respective implementation launched;

         Development and roll out of software for payout to depositors;

         Amended DIA-NBS MoU is implemented

Policy Area 3.2: Restructuring and divestment of state-owned banks and financial assets

166. To consolidate state ownership and reduce likely government capital injection, GoS has
adopted a strategy that requires a merger of three of the majority owned banks. Based on the
strategy adopted in May 2009, three of the four banks would be merged upon confirmation by an
audit firm of the economic rationale of the merger. In the meantime the independent audit firm
has confirmed the viability of the merger. The actual merger of the Srpska and Privredna
Pancevo banks into Postanska Stedionica would commence in early July 2009. As far as Credy
Bank is concerned, the GoS is in negotiations with a strategic partner interested in
recapitalization. If this deal does not materialize, Credy bank would also be merged with three
other state-owned banks.

167.     Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2:

         The Borrower has adopted a strategy, in form and substance satisfactory to the
         Bank, for the privatization and restructuring of banks with Borrower ownership,
         including a decision and timeline providing for the merger of Borrower majority-
         owned banks or other alternatives satisfactory to the Bank;

168.     Proposed actions for the PFDPL3:

         Banks with majority RoS ownership merged and restructuring implemented
         according to the Strategy adopted under the PFDPL2.

Policy Area 3.3: Strengthening the insurance sector regulation and resolution regime

169. The Government and NBS have been effective to date in moving the insurance sector
reform agenda forward. Significant and substantive transformation and growth marked the
Serbian insurance sector in 2008. As of the third quarter of 2008 the total premium was 40.1
billion dinars (EUR 524 million), recording a 16.6 percent increase compared to the same period
previous year. The share of life and non-life insurance in the total premium was 10.9 percent
and 89.1 percent respectively, while MTPL insurance comprised the largest share of the total

7
  The triggers for PFDPL3 for the banking sector can be changed and adjusted based on the results of stress testing and FSAP
findings and recommendations.


                                                              47
premium ­ 29.9 percent. During the course of 2008, the number of market participants increased
by 4, bringing the total number to 24 insurance providers operating in Serbia. In 2008, the
insurance sector's total revenues increased by 25.2 percent, total assets by 20.1 percent, and net
profit rose by 48.9 percent, with 15 insurers reporting profits and 9 ending the year in red.
Currently, 17 out of 24 insurers are foreign owned. With the completion of sale of DDOR
insurance company to Fondiaria (Italy), Dunav will remain the only government-owned
company in the market, accounting for slightly less than 30 percent of the insurance premium
written. At the same time, the quality of the insurers' balance-sheets has seen considerable
improvement. Further, the quality of insurance supervision has improved as evidenced by the
introduction of licensing requirements for insurance agents (128 institutional licenses were
revoked and 186 new issued), the launch of a comprehensive regulatory framework (20 by-laws
were issued), improved market transparency and commencement of pro-active on-site and off-
site market supervision.

170. The matters still outstanding tend to involve multiple constituencies and will require a
degree of negotiation to finalize. The Government's key achievements have been the
privatization of DDOR, closure and liquidation of more than a dozen insolvent insurance
companies, significant achievements of the turn-around work in Dunav, including the completion
of an independent actuarial review of its liabilities, introduction of centralized IT systems for
cash and claim management and reorganization of its business operations along functional lines,
improved quality of insurance regulations and insurance supervision.

171. All regulations required under the new Insurance Law have now been produced and
amendments passed to enable the privatization of the socially owned insurers. In addition, a law
dealing with bank and insurer bankruptcy and liquidation has come into force in 2005. Finally,
the new Motor Third Party Liability Law (MTPL) has just been adopted in the Parliament.

172. The other key area to be addressed is the mode of funding of the MTPL Guarantee Fund,
which does not have the internal financial capacity to cover claims from all insolvent companies.
Since its creation in 1997, the Fund fully resolved over 15,000 claims, with a total cost of about
RSD 535 million, including RSD 223 million of claims paid by the Fund during the last 2 years
to policy-holders of bankrupt insurers.

173. In the case of run-off liabilities of bankrupt insurance companies, the Fund does not have
the financial capacity to fully meet the pending claims. As of March 24, 2009, there was about
EUR 23 million worth of claims already awarded by the courts (which have not been reported to
the DIA), which together with the existing and already accepted unpaid claims comes to over
EUR 41 million. Unpaid claims undermine the confidence of the Serbian population in
insurance and have held back the development of the local insurance market. With about 25,000
of Serbian policy-holders still waiting for several years to get their claims resolved, the issue of
unfunded Guarantee Fund liabilities on such a scale remains a serious problem.

174. The MoF has initially made a budgetary provision to contribute around EUR 12.5 million
to the fund in the FY2009. Together with EUR 1.4 million from the privatization proceeds of the
DDOR these budgetary allocations should have been sufficient to cover at least 40 percent of the
outstanding claims from the insolvent companies. However, during the revision of the FY2009
budget, the provision of EUR 12.5 million was removed from the budget.


                                                48
175. To resolve the issue of unfunded liabilities the Government may consider the following
policy options: (i) a budgetary commitment toward the Guarantee Fund in the 2010 budget; (ii)
special temporary premium surcharge on each MTPL policy sold in Serbia (in excess of regular
annual premium increases), the proceeds of which would be directed to the Guarantee Fund to
cover the costs of outstanding claims; and (iii) a discount mechanism of settling claims of
bankrupt insurers for those policy-holders that would like to receive a payment on a priority
basis.

176. The other major challenge is the extent of work required to maintain the competitiveness
of Dunav prior to its privatization or at minimum, a sale of sizeable stake to a strategic investor.
Actions taken to date by management have been successful so far in maintaining the company's
market share and improving its profitability and solvency. To a large extent, these noticeable
improvements in the financial performance of the company have been the result of a newly
installed IT system that enable it to centralize cash and claims management and restructure its
operations along functional lines.

177. Aside from the adoption of a new MTPL Law and privatization (or a partial sale to a
strategic investor) of the last remaining socially owned insurer, the key outstanding matter
relates to the liberalization of the reinsurance segment of the market, which can be facilitated by
selling an equity stake in Dunav Re to a strategic investor; and through divestiture of other
Dunav's non-core assets, such as life and pension businesses, as well as the hotel and the stock-
broking operation.

178.   Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2:

       The Borrower has submitted to its Parliament for adoption the draft motor third
       party liability law satisfactory to the Bank

179.   Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

       The GOS has adopted a clear provision on the introduction of a mandatory temporary
       premium surcharge on all MTPL policies to fund the remaining MTPL liabilities of
       bankrupt insurers

       Divestiture of Dunav Re through a sale of an equity stake to a strategic investor has been
       initiated

       Divestiture of Dunav's non-core assets has been initiated



Policy Area 3.4: Developing Capital Markets

180. Further developing the capital markets in Serbia will require an increase in the
instruments available (both equity and debt) and changes to the supporting legal and regulatory
framework.


                                                49
181. Development of the bond market through the creation of the government securities
market. The development of the local currency debt securities market would also increase the
number of liquid investments in the capital markets and would provide alternative sources of
financing for the Government, corporations and municipalities. A key priority of local currency
bond market development is to gradually extend the maturities of government securities in order
to establish benchmarks that will enable the development of the municipal, corporate, and
infrastructure bond market. One of the key hurdles to the development of the government bond
market is a lack of sufficient coordination between the MoF's debt market development policy
and NBS's liquidity management policy, although recently they have started some promising co-
operation. The NBS currently utilizes two-week repos to limit foreign currency inflows since
other traditional monetary policy tools are not available due to the prevalence of Euros in the
economy. Even though the NBS is issuing for a specific and different purpose from the Ministry
of Finance, from the perspective of a bank as potential investor the NBS bills offer high yields
and greater liquidity, which is forcing the Ministry of Finance to offer higher rates of interest
than might otherwise be necessary. It is probable that the greater success of recent T-Bill
auctions is a result of a reduction in the NBS repo rate.

182. The GoS has made progress in debt management and domestic debt market development.
In addition to existing shorter term local currency bills of 90 day duration, the Treasury has
recently introduced 6-month instruments, and has committed to develop plans for increasing the
maturity of government securities issues towards 12 months. In 2005, the Treasury Sector was
merged with the Public Payment Agency to form a separate agency under the MOF. A new
Public Debt Law was enacted in July 2005, allowing the MoF to: (i) issue domestic government
securities in dinars to refinance frozen foreign savings (FFS); (ii) issue securities longer than one
year; and (iii) possibly restructure the pension deficit with marketable government securities.
The Treasury has also developed an IT based public debt management system that will be further
strengthened with support of the European Agency for Reconstruction.

183. Going forward, the Government will need to issue securities with longer maturities and
develop an overall strategy for debt management and an overall strategy for the development of
the municipal and corporate bond market.

184. Improvements in the legal and regulatory framework. A number of legal reforms are
required (e.g., securities law, law on takeovers, and company law). All three have some
provisions that limit capital market activity, and also have many instances in which they are
contradictory. The GoS is making significant progress in enhancing the legal framework. The
Law on Investment Funds was adopted by Parliament in 2006 and detailed implementation
regulations have been issued. The GoS has made short term amendments to the Securities Law,
and a longer term review is almost completed. The main improvements to be put in place will be
made in the areas of: (i) improving prospectus for fuller disclosure; (ii) shifting the issuance
regulation to disclosure system; (ii) clarifying and extending legal authority of the Securities
Commission; (iii) re-defining connected person of insider trading, (iv) facilitating private
placement; and (v) simplifying the IPO procedure. The one area of legal reform that continues to
require revision is the Takeover Law, which should be designed to make the takeover process
more efficient and more transparent. This would provide investors greater decision making
power in deciding whether or not to accept a takeover bid. Given the large number of


                                                 50
interconnected legal reforms required, it is critical that the Government examine the entire set of
legal changes under development to ensure that they are harmonized and that contradictions
between them are eliminated. In addition, with Serbia potentially becoming an EU candidate
country in the future, there is a need to think through the overall legal framework to ensure that it
is harmonized with the EU single market in financial services.

185. Further development of equity instruments through the promotion of public offerings.
Issuance of IPOs could significantly increase the market capitalization of the Belgrade Stock
Exchange and greatly increase the liquidity within the system, but has significant risks if not
done properly. The Government has discussed issuing IPOs for a number of state owned
enterprises, but current market conditions have precluded this from occurring. Public offerings
of government shares could also serve as a benchmark for future equity financing of the local
firms as well as create a demonstration effect for the local individual investors and bring in both
local and foreign institutional investors attracted by better quality companies with greater
liquidity. Although current market conditions may limit the potential of doing this in the short-
term, the Government should prepare plans for when current market conditions become more
favorable.

186. Actions to be taken under the PFDPL2: Based on the discussions with MoF, the
following benchmark for the proposed PFDPL operation were agreed upon:

          A strategy and action plan for extending the maturity of T-Bill issues has been prepared

          A joint working group between MOF and MoERD to undertake comprehensive review
          and harmonization of Securities and Company Laws is established

187.      Proposed actions for PFDPL3:

          Range of longer maturity T-Bills issued to establish beginnings of a benchmark yield
          curve;

          The new Securities law is approved by GoS and submitted to Parliament for adoption;

          The Working Groups on state securities and municipal bonds submit to MoF strategic
          proposals for the establishment of the market for medium/long term state securities,
          corporate, and municipal bonds


                               VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

188. The reforms proposed under this operation are not expected to cause negative poverty
and social impacts. While the fraction of the poor below the poverty line declined by half
between 2004 and 2008, the growth slowdown associated with economic crisis is expected to
increase the poverty rates. In fact, according to the data from the most recent household budget



                                                 51
survey (HBS 2008) even a 5 percent decrease in the incomes of those above the poverty line will
increase poverty by 1.4 percentage points, or roughly 90,000 more people. Since the proposed
PFDPL2 has a strong anti-crisis focus and is supporting specific precautionary measures it
should help mitigate the impact of the crisis. This operation is expected to be complemented by
a PEDPL whose entire Pillar III -- "Strengthening social assistance and protecting the most
vulnerable"-- focuses on reforms that should complement the anti-poverty and social impacts of
this operation.

189. The proposed reforms in the financial sector will increase minimum limits of deposit
guarantees, ensure stability and efficiency of deposit insurance mechanism and payout function,
thus increasing the safety of populations' savings. The proposed program for supporting the
stability of banking sector will improve its resilience and maintain the necessary access to
finance. Further, reform measures under the business environment pillar are all targeted at
decreasing business compliance costs, creating better conditions for businesses entry and
sustainable growth, facilitating FDI flows, and ultimately job creation.

190. While raising the electricity tariffs to cost recovery level is critical for sustainability of
energy sector, the Government is attentive to the social impacts of increases in electricity tariffs
and has installed a lifeline tariff system where the first block of electricity consumption is less
expensive than the next. In addition, the power utility EPS is providing price discounts to poor,
eligible households that are registered with the utility. As a consequence of the ongoing
financial crisis, the Government has decided to withhold tariff increases in 2009.

191. When it comes to the reforms supporting financial discipline, all major privatizations
have been completed and the impact of remaining privatization activities on real job losses will
be minimal and only transitory, as the "jobs" in many socially owned enterprises constitute
"phantom" employment, and do not pay regular salaries and/or contributions. Further, a lot of
remaining enterprises in PA portfolio are maintaining low employment levels. For example, 73
enterprises that have been subject to bankruptcy and/or forced liquidation between September
2008 and April 2009 employed only 1,701 workers. At the same time, the employees working in
companies, which will be subject to forced liquidation ­ and where in some cases they were not
receiving regular salaries - will be compensated from liquidation proceeds. Further, the
improved bankruptcy mechanism will ensure release of the tied assets back to productive use,
thus improving chances for new employment. Additionally, the people who eventually end up
losing their jobs will benefit from the existing government social programs. Finally, it is
important to note that while privatization often leads to net job losses over the near term, in the
long run it contributes to job sustainability and growth.

192. Since the reforms began in 2001, job losses have been large, as Serbia has embarked on a
program of restructuring and privatization. At the same time, job creation in the private sector
has been slow, despite fairly strong economic growth in recent years. However, according to the
labor force survey data the unemployment rate has been decreasing, from 21.8 percent in 2005 to
18.8 percent in 2007 (aged 15-64) and further to 14.7 percent as of October 2008, though the rate
is nearly double the EU-27 average. Due to the economic crisis the unemployment level has
again slightly increased to 15.6 percent as of April 2009, but has remained below the 2005 level.




                                                52
The reforms supported by PFDPLs are expected in the medium term to lead to job creation and a
more efficient allocation of labor.

193. To mitigate the welfare and employment impact of the ongoing and expected SOE
reforms, the GoS introduced the Social Program8 in 2002. In July 2005, the Social Program was
revised, changing the benefit formula for extended severance payments, and offering three
(lump-sum) options for redundant workers: (i) remuneration amounting to 10 average gross
wages in the Republic in the industry sector for employees with more than 10 years of insurance
record; (ii) remuneration amounting to Euro 100 per year of service in Dinar equivalent; and (iii)
severance pay according to the Labor Law.

194. Since its inception, the Social Program has provided support to around 172,600
redundant workers (2002-2007) through this mechanism. However, only a portion of all the
redundant workers are supported by the Social Program while others receive regular severance
according to the Labor code. In 2002-2004, mostly big SOEs dominated among the recipients of
its funds. Starting 2005, the list of enterprises approved for funds includes also a number of
state-owned utilities. During 2007, 214 enterprises and 22,700 redundant workers benefited
from the Social Program.9 The average redundancy payment in Serbia equals to about US$
2,100, which is far more generous compensation package than the registered unemployed with
insurance record can claim. The benefits offered though the Social Program in Serbia are in line
with many other countries in the region: the Czech Republic spends about US$ 2000, Hungary
US$ 2500 and Poland US$ 370010 per redundant worker for severance payments and additional
training benefits.

195. In 2004-2006, tracer surveys of workers made redundant from 2002-2003 were
conducted in Pancevo, Kraljevo, Nis and Lazarevac, and they provided important insights into
the Government Social Program. The workers with longer tenure, and respectively older
workers dominated among the displaced workers. By their job profile, most displaced workers
were blue collar workers with narrowly specialized skills. This made their redeployment a more
challenging tasks. Most redundant workers had very low salaries prior to dismissal, and 81
percent of them earned less than Euro 100 per months (in 2003, average net salaries in the
country were around Euro170, and in 2002, around Euro150). This indicates that many of them
may not have been fully employed prior to dismissal or were on administrative leave.

196. As for the current labor market status, the largest number of displaced workers who were
surveyed in 2006 and who were beneficiaries of the Social Program, remained unemployed (64
percent); 5 percent have remained out of the labor market, whereas 31 percent found new
employment; 18 percent out of those who found new employment are now working in the private
sector, five percent in the public sector, whereas another five percent developed their own
business and three percent of the redundant workers are involved in casual jobs.

  Officially, the Program for Resolving Redundancy in the Process of Rationalization Restructuring and Preparation
for Privatization
9
   It is estimated that around one fifth of workers in enterprises included into the Government Social Program are
made redundant and benefit from the program.
10
    It is limited to a few coal mining sector enterprises only.


                                                       53
197. The GoS is committed to using the Social Program as an instrument to reduce the level of
excess employment in large SOEs in preparation for their privatization. Therefore, it is
important that the Transition Fund (TF) continues to receive adequate resources, while recurrent
subsidies to SOE sector are reduced. In reflection of these needs, the Government has secured
RSD 4.71 billion in 2009 budget. In addition, the Government intends to clear up the arrears in
cash payments for severance from the Transition Fund accumulated over the past years. The TF
represents a budgetary item, which was set up as a temporary vehicle to assist the redundant
workers during the privatization process to finance their salaries, contributions/taxes, retraining
and/or severance payments, thus facilitating the enterprise sector reforms. As privatization is
progressing the Transition Fund resources will be gradually decreasing, and after the
privatization process is over (in the next few years) this Fund will be no longer needed.

198. In addition to the Social Program described above the GoS provides social assistance,
including cash benefits and services, to poor households. The main social assistance benefits
are: (i) Material Support to Families whose income is lower than the guaranteed "social security
level", and (ii) child allowances - cash transfers to poor households with children, including the
families of redundant workers.

199. The workers, who are not included into the Government Social Program, are entitled to
an unemployment benefit. The duration of benefit payment varies from three months, if the
insurer has been insured for the period of 1 to 5 years, to 24 months if the insurer is older than 55
years and has been insured for the period longer than 25 years. The benefit size is 50-60 percent
(depending on the duration) of the average earnings in the month before employment contract
was terminated. All redundant workers and employees are entitled to active labor market
programs, such as training and retraining programs, self-employment assistance, counseling and
training for business start-ups, reassignment to other jobs, etc.

200. The Bank is providing two types of assistance to the Government to mitigate the social
impact of redundancies resulting from corporate restructuring, privatization and bankruptcies: (i)
general budget support through the programmatic loan series in order to reduce the short-term
fiscal pressures generated by severance payments, and (ii) technical advice and funding offered
through various ongoing and planned investment operations. In particular, the Employment
Promotion Project (EPP; 2003-2006) supported the GoS in designing and the implementing
enterprise-based labor redeployment programs, provided through Worker Transition Centers,
which act as a resource center providing information on workers' redeployment options and
options related to the Government's Social Program, and assist in implementation of enterprise
social plans. As part of the EPP project, 13 such pilot Transition Centers were launched in
enterprises undergoing privatization, which provided counseling services and training to over
18,000 workers. The Bor Regional Development Project would support social mitigation
measures aimed at redundant workers, and creation of new sources of diversified growth and
employment in one of Serbia's poorest regions.

201. Building on our fruitful policy dialogue in this area (through SACs 1 and 2 and SOSAC),
in 2006 the Bank conducted a labor market study and a study on social protection system in
Serbia that informed the policy and procedural advice provided to the GoS.




                                                 54
202. Given that the Serbia country program includes operations explicitly dealing with
mitigation of social consequences of reforms (PEDPL), PFDPL2 will not include conditionality
directly influencing labor legislation and social policy. In the longer term, however, PFDPLs
will assist the Government to reduce poverty through creating the necessary conditions for
sustainable economic growth. First, strengthened fiscal discipline and divestiture of state and
socially-owned assets will improve resource allocation. Second, reform measures directed at
improving the business climate will create the basis for investments needed for medium-term
growth and employment creation, and thus for more sustained poverty reduction. Third, policy
efforts aimed at strengthening financial sector and enhancing crisis preparedness will increase
the resilience of the Serbian economy to potential adverse shocks.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

203. The MOF will be responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed operation
and for reporting process and coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and
agencies. The Bank will monitor actions and review progress of the implementation of the
proposed operation, as well as the subsequent actions of the GoS program by using the short
term and the overall program outcomes outlined in the Policy Matrix.

204. At the same time, the overall status of the GoS program will be monitored during
supervision to determine whether the specific conditions of the proposed operation have
changed. In addition, supervision missions will not only allow the Bank to continue the policy
dialogue with the institutions involved in the implementation of the reform program, but will
also ensure synergies with other donors to avoid conflicting advice to the Government in the
policy and technical areas involved in the reforms.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

205. This fiduciary information section and the set of fiduciary measures included below for
the operation are based on the findings and recommendations of the Public Financial
Management Assessment (PFMA) and more recent assessments by the IMF Fiscal Affairs
Department in December 2008 and IMF Staff Reports published in 2008 and 2009.
Disbursement and auditing arrangements have been determined based on the prevailing fiduciary
environment.

206. Public financial management (PFM) system: The 2007 PFMA concluded that despite the
improved public disclosure of basic fiscal and budget execution data, the lack of transparency
and operating checks and balances in public finance still appear to be an overarching problem in
Serbia. This is reflected in the relative poor performance on several PFM performance
indicators. Significant steps have been taken towards strengthening PFM, such as modernization
of the central treasury system, the establishment of arrangements for internal audit across central
Government and the establishment of the State Audit Institution Council in September 2007.
While these efforts are encouraging, the IMF concluded in its December 2008 report that much
remains to be done to strengthen transparency and accountability in PFM in Serbia. Strong
Government leadership of the ongoing reforms will be required to bring Serbia at par with other
EU-aspiring countries in the region.


                                                55
207. The independent assessments of public financial management performance suggest that
the fiduciary risks associated with the PFM system in Serbia are high. The IMF concluded that
important areas of budget coverage, preparation and execution, accounting and fiscal reporting,
internal controls, external audit and debt and cash management require improvement although
several key areas of the PFM system work well.

208. Mitigating fiduciary risks will require strong and sustained commitment towards
transparency and accountability in budget management. The Government has taken steps to
strengthen budget execution and reporting arrangements and is developing improved
arrangements for public internal financial control and audit as part of its pre-accession program.
The European Commission is providing considerable support to strengthen financial
management systems and internal audit and control arrangements amongst other PFM reform
initiatives. This assistance has resulted in substantial improvement in the quality and timeliness
of financial information and provided the foundation for effective internal control.
Establishment of the State Audit Institution's Council and provision of separate budget
allocations in 2008 and 2009 were positive steps, but not sufficient to provide an effective
external audit function to date.

209. The corrective actions taken by the National Bank of Serbia to safeguard funds in the
foreign exchange account are deemed adequate. An updated IMF Safeguards Assessment,
conducted in March 2009, found that the NBS's safeguards framework had been considerably
strengthened and the quality of financial statements and internal audit had improved markedly
since the initial assessment in 2001. Key recommendations include strengthening external
oversight of NBS operations and amending the NBS law to increase operational and financial
independence

210. The operation has a major focus on further actions required to attain acceptable fiduciary
arrangements through strengthening of the management of financial risks and liabilities. There
is a separate DPL program under development, which will contain a major focus on public
expenditure management, financial accountability and public financial control reforms.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

211.   Disbursement and auditing arrangements reflect the high risk.

212. Borrower and Loan Amount: The Borrower is the Republic of Serbia. This operation is a
single-tranche loan. The loan proceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon the
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of Serbia.

213. Disbursement: The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for
development policy loans. Upon approval of the loan and notification by the Bank of the
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement between the Bank and Republic of Serbia, the Borrower
will submit a withdrawal application to the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD). The IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan into a foreign currency
deposit account designated by the Borrower to be held at the NBS. This account will be managed
by and subject to control of the MOF. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the



                                               56
Loan into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in local currency to the Single Treasury
Account also kept in NBS and that is available to finance budgeted expenditures. The Closing
Date is December 31, 2010.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

214. The major pillars of the PFDPL series have been assessed for likely significant effects on
the environment, forests and natural resources under the requirements of the World Bank's OP
8.60. The principal concerns in the sectors supported under PFDPL series arise from the
handling of environmental liabilities (e.g. water, air and waste emissions) from past and current
operations caused by socially-owned enterprises (SOEs) being privatized or allowed to go
bankrupt. The screening also noted that one possible impact from electricity tariff increases
could be an increase in uncontrolled wood cutting. Discussion of these issues immediately
follows a review of the institutional and legal framework for environmental management below.
However, it should be noted at the outset that all the government decisions in the energy sector
under the PFDPL series act to reduce pollution: stricter EU-based petroleum standards will have
a major positive impact on air pollution; new and modern coal-fueled power plants to replace old
capacity will likewise significantly reduce pollutant emissions (although capacity expansion will
not); and higher energy tariffs have a dampening impact on demand and therefore on emissions
as well. A major cost component underlying coming increases in electricity tariffs will be EPS'
announced future investments in environmental protection projects, estimated to more than EUR
1 billion by 2015. Thus, there is a direct link between higher electricity tariffs and resources
made available for improving the environment.

215. The environmental legal framework for environmental management in Serbia has
undergone significant reform along the lines of the EU acquis. However, enforcement and
implementation still need substantial strengthening. Four key environmental laws were adopted
in recent years: Law on Environmental Protection, Law on Environmental Impact Assessment,
Law on Strategic Environmental Assessment, and Law on Integrated Pollution Prevention and
Control. Furthermore, a new law on waste management has been drafted. Serbia has also signed
the South Eastern European Energy Community Treaty, which subjects it to key pieces of the
acquis, notably the Large Combustion Plants Directive. This directive places restrictions on
local pollution emissions (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter). Serbia has also
recently ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The Government of Serbia has also introduced the use of
pollution charges for S02, NOx and particulate matter, which also apply to thermal power plants.
Environmental oversight in Serbia is shared among the Ministry of Environment and Spatial
Planning (MoESP), the Autonomous Provinces of Vojvodina and municipalities. The mandate
of the nascent Serbian Environmental Protection Agency is limited to data collection and
reporting. Recent years have also witnessed delegation of environmental oversight functions,
such as some of EIA and permitting, to local government agencies. However, variation of
capacity in local government agencies and lack of secondary legislation related to the new laws
lead to delays and variations in the interpretation and application of laws. Such delays and
inconsistencies are detrimental to the business climate and warrant inclusion in the regulatory
review.




                                                57
216. Environmental liabilities of SOEs/public enterprises. Thermal power plants (TPPs)
remain key polluters, which continue to be significant emitters of SO2, while recent investment
at one of the TPPs has reduced particulate matter emissions to admissible levels. Air pollution
leads to substantial damages to public health, agricultural products and ecosystems. Uninsulated
ash dumps also contribute to air and water pollution. In accordance with the Serbian
environmental regulations, an environmental audit (EA) will be carried out and action plans to
control and remediate damages will be developed for those SOEs/public enterprises deemed to
have significant environmental impact. The combination of EAs and action plans will not only
ensure remediation of environmental damage, but also help attract serious international investors
and possibly lead to higher bids as the new owner's risk of facing unexpected environmental
liabilities is reduced.

217. Ongoing air pollution from TPPs is as much a matter of financial capability of the
national electric power utility EPS as it is of enforcement. The increase of electricity tariffs,
which is supported under this loan, will allow EPS to obtain larger revenues part of which it can
use to install abatement technology. The newly instituted pollution charges will provide an
added incentive.

218. Since the privatization process began in the early 2000s, Serbia has made significant
progress in integrating environmental concerns in the privatization process. Recognizing that
strategic investors will be reluctant to invest or will heavily discount their offer prices if there are
significant unassigned environmental liabilities in 2003, the Government amended the Law on
Privatization to state that liability for environmental damage caused by a socially or state-owned
enterprise up to the date of privatization rests with the state. During the privatization attempts of
the Copper Mining and Smelting Complex of Bor, one of Serbia's foremost environmental hot
spots, this legal clarification has played an important role in determining financial
responsibilities for cleaning up "historical pollution" and mitigating "current pollution"
associated with the enterprise's ongoing operations. The Government will use World Bank
support for cleaning up historical pollution at this site under the Bor Regional Development
Project. The operation was made possible by cooperation between the MoESP and the
Privatization Agency. The only outstanding issue relates to the adoption of a bylaw defining the
scope of state's environmental liabilities.

219. Similar past environmental damage and liability issues arise with SOEs that are too
unviable to be privatized and will be allowed to go bankrupt. According to the "Polluter Pays"
principle, which is firmly established in the Environment Law enacted in 2004, liability for such
damage lies with the state. It is recommended that GoS prepare a clear action plan on how to
deal with such liabilities.

CONSULTATIONS

220. The Rulebook of Government of Serbia11 requires that all legislative changes which
significantly change existing system and ways of operations (as assessed by the relevant Council
of the Serbian Parliament) need to go through public consultations. Only following the public

11
     Articles 41 and 42


                                                  58
discussion and/or further inter-ministerial harmonization process the proposed drafts become
official proposals which are then submitted for the Parliament's consideration. Further, the
practice has been that all new laws are in fact subject to public hearings where relevant
stakeholders, including private sector representatives and NGOs, are able to provide their
comments to offered solutions. This is also the case with legislative reforms supported by this
series of PFDPLs, such as Bankruptcy and Competition Laws respectively. Finally, the bank
team working on this Operation chairs the donors' meetings on the issues of the reform of
private sector development.

221. Further, the Government is currently implementing a comprehensive regulatory review
the main objective of which is to reduce regulatory compliance costs for business and to
eliminate obsolete and excessive regulations that have harmful effects on the economy and
business development. Implementation of the regulatory review is to a large extent a private
sector driven process as it depends on the support and feedback from stakeholders both in the
private sector and the wider public. Through the envisaged activities of the regulatory review
process all stakeholders will have an opportunity to review and comment on regulations included
in the reform. Specifically, to ensure transparency and the accessibility, this process enables
private sector and general public to follow up on the state administration's assessment of each
particular regulation and to provide their own input online. Furthermore, to ensure that the
consultation with business community is carried out swiftly and efficiently, each business related
regulation is reviewed by representatives of business membership organizations through their
participation in more than 30 thematic working groups.

222. With respect to regulations that explicitly or implicitly deal with environmental issues
several checks will be in place. First, the Inter-ministerial Regulatory Review Unit will check all
such regulations and screen them for potential impact on the environment. Second, the Ministry
in charge of environmental protection will review all proposals and decide if they are acceptable.
Finally, all proposals will have to comply with recently passed package of environmental laws.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

223. There are substantial macroeconomic risks. Given the unfolding economic crisis,
significant uncertainties remain related to economic prospects in Serbia and other countries in
Southeast Europe. The risk of further shocks relating to the global economic environment that
could affect the economy negatively remains and include a prolonged recession in the EU and a
lower demand for exports than currently envisaged as well as lower private sector debt roll-over.
Although solvency indicators do not point to significant risks of unsustainable debt, liquidity
indicators give reason for policy makers to be cautious. Debt amortization is expected to rise
very significantly over the next few years. Moreover, the sustainability of Serbia's external debt
is also affected by exchange rate depreciation and real growth of the economy.

224. Serbia is taking determined actions to mitigate these risks, including pursuing a robust
agenda of policy reform, maintaining a strong commitment to EU integration, and seeking a
coordinated package of international financial support. Foreign banks in Serbia have also
provided voluntary assurances to broadly maintain their commitment to Serbia and keep their
subsidiaries well-capitalized; so far exposures of foreign banks to Serbia have indeed been


                                                59
maintained. The Bank and the IMF will closely monitor the performance under the government's
macroeconomic program. Moreover, the potential of resources coming through EC macro
support operations dependent on continued adherence to the Bank-Fund program targets
improves success likelihood.

225. The current capacity of some public sector institutions to implement an ambitious reform
agenda, while much improved over the past few years, remains relatively weak. Relatively weak
institutional capacity including for fiduciary management raises concerns including on internal
controls. Improving the public expenditure management system is supported by the PEDPL, but
institutional change comes slowly. The other potential risk may include delays in the
Parliamentary approval of a package of laws.

226. Political risks, while moderate, remain. The speed of program implementation could be
slowed down by the existence of a broad-based coalition Government; although at the same time
the coalition Government helps to ensure sustainability of the reform effort. The programmatic
design with a series of three PFDPLs is intended to leave some flexibility as to the pace, scope
and content of reform program. Risks are also mitigated by the economic crisis which has
highlighted the necessity and urgency of reform.

                                                 THE WORLD BANK

                                                  September 14, 2009

This note provides the IMF staff's assessment of Serbia's recent macroeconomic developments, revised
outlook, and policies. The assessment is based mainly on information gathered by an IMF mission that
visited Belgrade during August 24­September 2 to conduct the second review under the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA).13

Recent Developments and Outlook

1.       Immediate financial tensions have eased; the banking system seems to have weathered the
adverse spillovers from the global financial crisis. In line with their commitments under the National
Bank of Serbia's (NBS) Financial Sector Support Program, foreign banks have largely rolled over their
external exposures vis-à-vis Serbia. At the same time, the large current account deficit has been shrinking
fast, reducing external financing requirements. Reflecting these developments, since the end of February
the NBS has not intervened in the foreign exchange (FX) market. Meanwhile, as elsewhere in the region,
sovereign spreads have narrowed substantially. Bank liquidity has improved as households have begun to
return FX deposits to banks. Nevertheless, overall credit growth is subdued, notwithstanding government
efforts to support lending through subsidies and guarantees. Moreover, nonperforming loans have risen fast
to 9.7 percent in June 2009, compared to 4.3 percent in September 2008.

2.    The output slump is projected to bottom out in 2009, with stronger-than-projected external
adjustment, while relatively high inflation is receding only slowly:

            Real GDP is now expected to fall by 4 percent in 2009, compared with a 2 percent decline in the
            first program review. The Statistical Office estimates that real GDP declined by 4¼ percent
            during the first half of 2009 (y-o-y), and the full-year forecast assumes that the slump will level
            out during the second half of 2009.

            With the economy's overall spending shrinking faster than income, the external current account
            deficit is projected at 9 percent of GDP in 2009, down from about 17 percent of GDP in 2008.
            Capital inflows have remained low but stable over the last few months; as a consequence,
            external financing pressures are abating.

            CPI inflation declined to 8.5 percent in July, well inside the NBS's 6­10 percent target band.
            Alongside, the NBS has continued its policy of gradual easing, reducing its policy rate to
            12 percent in July, down from17¾ percent in January. Nevertheless, sharp regulated price
            increases, in part reflecting cuts in subsidies to utility providers, have added to inflation
            pressures, while the slump in activity has had so far only a muted impact on high entrenched
            inflation expectations.

13
  The first review under the SBA was completed on May 15, 2009; the package of documents is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/country/SRB/index.htm.
                                                            76
3.      A modest economic recovery is expected in 2010, and the economy is assumed to rebalance
gradually over the medium term. Real GDP is projected to grow by 1½ percent next year, with economic
activity anticipated to regain strength only toward end-2010; external adjustment is projected to slow to a
more gradual pace in 2010. The return to robust and more balanced growth over the medium term is
predicated on a turnaround in global growth, but also on structural reforms leading to significant
improvements in the business climate. Inflation is expected to decline further to more moderate levels,
supported by prudent monetary and fiscal policies, particularly continued wage restraint in the public
sector. While the high external debt level is projected to moderate over the medium term, the external debt
sustainability analysis continues to point to significant risks.

Program Implementation

4.       Performance under the program has been broadly on track, with the notable exception of the
fiscal area. All end-June 2009 performance criteria, apart from the ceiling on the general government
deficit, were met. In particular, the fiscal deficit for the first half of 2009 exceeded the ceiling by 1 percent
of annual GDP, both because of revenue shortfalls owing to a weaker-than-expected economy, and, but to a
lesser extent, only partial implementation of agreed fiscal measures. Most actions in the structural reform
area were implemented as planned. Moreover, preliminary results of a diagnostic study of the twelve largest
banks suggest that the banking system would remain adequately capitalized and liquid under a downside
scenario for 2009­10.

Policy Requirements

5.      The shift of the Serbian economy from boom to bust, triggered by the global financial crisis,
has unmasked a vulnerable fiscal position. Revenues during the boom were boosted by unsustainable
growth heavily tilted toward the production of nontradables and high demand for imports, as reflected by
high external current account deficits.14 In the short term, allowing the temporary effects of automatic fiscal
stabilizers to increase fiscal deficits is justified given the severe economic contraction and the much faster-
than-projected external adjustment, as long as noninflationary sources of budget financing are available. At
the same time, fiscal sustainability in the medium term will need to be restored through front-loaded
reforms of recurrent spending, particularly in public administration, and the pension, health, and education
systems, with the World Bank playing a key advisory role in these reform areas.

6.      Consequently, developing a sound and credible fiscal strategy is the key policy challenge.
Reforms will need to be calibrated to provide compensating savings for a declining tax-GDP ratio over the
medium term, higher interest payments, and increased capital spending to improve Serbia's deteriorated
public infrastructure. However, many of the spending reforms will take years to yield sizeable spending
reductions, thus requiring a credible political commitment to reforms and their steadfast implementation.

7.    It was agreed to not conclude discussions for the second review under the SBA to give the
authorities more time to firm up political consensus on credible spending reforms. For 2009, there was
agreement that raising the fiscal deficit target from 3 to 4½ percent of GDP would be appropriate given the

14
   IMF staff estimates that, assuming Serbia's external current account deficit normalizes to a medium-term level of about
6 percent of GDP, the tax-GDP ratio could fall durably by about 4 percent of GDP relative to its level in 2008. This estimate
reflects mainly durably lower VAT collections (as consumption is projected to fall relative to GDP) and lower customs revenue
(in part reflecting the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU).
                                                              77
weaker-than-projected economy and the availability of financing. However, there is also a need to address
potential sizable budget deficits going forward that could be inconsistent with sustainable public finances.
There was broad consensus to target a fiscal deficit of about 3½ percent of GDP in 2010. There was also
agreement that achieving this target would require additional fiscal measures of about 2 percentage point of
GDP. The authorities considered tax increases as less desirable owing to the weak state of economy and
concerns that this would undermine the momentum for spending reforms; they instead proposed to
emphasize a comprehensive strategy of multi-year spending reforms. If spending measures prove
insufficient, there could still be a need to make tax increases part of a credible adjustment package.

8.       As regards monetary policy, exchange rate flexibility and focus on inflation should continue to
serve Serbia well. Further monetary easing should proceed with caution. While low aggregate demand will
ease inflation pressures, high inflation expectations have yet to moderate in line with the NBS's inflation
targets.

9.      In the financial sector, with non-performing loans rising, developing an effective strategy for
corporate and household debt restructuring will be key. An FSAP Update mission scheduled for
October will review the status quo legal and institutional mechanisms for debt restructuring, laying the
basis for recommendations in this area.

Relations with the Fund

10.     Serbia currently has a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with exceptional access. In May 2009, the
Board increased the original 15-month, SDR 350.8 million SBA approved on January 16, 2009 to SDR 2.62
billion (about 2.942 billion, or about US$4 billion), equivalent to 560 percent of Serbia's quota or close to
10 percent of its GDP, and extended the SBA by one year to mid-April 2011. These decisions enabled the
immediate release of SDR 701.55 million (about 788 million).

11.    It is now planned to combine the 2nd and 3rd reviews, with a mission likely to take place in
late October and a board date in early December.
