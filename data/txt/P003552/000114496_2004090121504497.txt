We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (Shandong Agricultural Development

under Category (l) from 30% to 45%; and

We are pleased to concur with these requests. Consequently, the Association 
hereby agrees to amend the table set out in paragraph l of Schedule l to the 
Development Credit Agreement to read as set forth in the attachment to this letter.
