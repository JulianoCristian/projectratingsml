The main objective of the project was to\n            assist the Shandong Provincial Government to: accelerate the\n            development of agriculturally unproductive coastal lowlands\n            for culture fisheries; intensify crop production in existing\n            low yielding areas; increase the value of livestock\n            production and processing in the Tuhai River Basin; and help\n            alleviate poverty and provide productive employment for\n            women through upgrading of production and processing of\n            small livestock in the poverty-stricken Yi Meng mountain\n            area. The project substantially achieved the objectives of\n            agricultural growth in the coastal areas of Shandong.\n            IDA's performance in identification, preparation, and\n            appraisal of the project is viewed as satisfactory to highly\n            satisfactory. IDA's performance in supervision is also\n            considered satisfactory, although the project would have\n            benefited from more frequent supervision visits. The\n            borrower's performance in project preparation and\n            implementation was generally satisfactory, though some\n            aspects were deficient. The key lessons learned from the\n            project include the following: (a) stronger measures should\n            have been taken early in the implementation of the project\n            to ensure that on-farm works were completed on schedule; (b)\n            the Association should have ensured the early installation\n            of wastewater treatment systems for agro-processing plants\n            by building appropriate conditions into project\n            implementation; (c) the estimated annual amount of\n            counterpart funds necessary for the project (together with\n            the assumptions from which these figures are derived) should\n            have been identified and discussed at appraisal with the\n            Borrower; (d) more supervision missions should have been\n            budgeted and planned to resolve issues/problems as they\n            developed; and (e) advice from technical experts should have\n            been solicited in the selection of appropriate\n            agro-processing equipment for a number of the plants."}, "docdt": "1996-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
