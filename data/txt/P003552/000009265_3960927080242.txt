MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION Of THE PMESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUSTVE DIRECTORS-
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE SHANDONG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.   .  The tollowing memorandum and recomendation on a proposed Credit for
SDR 82.5 million (US$109 million equivalent) to the People's Republic of China
ie submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 35 years maturity and would help finance an agricultural development
project in Shandong. 
2.       Background.  Agriculture in China, including crops, livestock,
forestry and fisheries, provides sustenance to over one billion peoples it it a
major source of income for some 190 million farm families and accounts for
about 302 of the country's GDP. Only ibout 137 million of China's 960 million
'hectares are arable but nearly half of the arable land is irrigated..
Foodgrains occupy about 70? of the crop land and account for about one-third of
total agricultural output. China has been able to meet the basic food
requirements of its population, about 222 of the world's total, from less than
11i of the world's arable land by developing an intensive farming system with
large inputs of labor, chemical and organic fertiliser, and water. Since the
introduction of economic reforms in 1979, China has adopted many bold measures
to restructure and liberalize its rura1 economy, viz., the dismantling of the
communes and the shift to the household production-responsibility system (PRS),
the rapid-monetization and comercialization of rural economic activities,
major increases in farm prices, the re-introduction of free markets, and an
improvement in public sector marketing and distribution.networks. Farmers have
been given greater autonomy over choosing cropping patterns and diversifying
their activities.  Results have been dramatict  agricultural production,has
increased by over 10? per year since 1980, a spectacular increase over the
historical 3t growth during the preceding two decades,-and despite a reduction
in area sown, grain output steadily increased to a peak level of 407 million
tons in 1984, 34Z greater than in 1978.  In 1985, the Government instltuted
another phase of the reforms, replacing compulsory procurement quotas with
voluntary contracts, adjusting procurement prices and greatty enlarging the
role of the market.  These measures induced farmers to shift production into
higher value and cash crops and as a result, grain production levels fell to
379 and 391 million tons, respectively, in 1905 and 1986 before rebounding to
*       402 million tons in 1987.
3.      As the reforms continue, a major challenge to China's agriculture will
be to maintain an adequate growth rate while accommodating the continued shifts
in consumer demand in response to increasing per capita incomes and population
growth.  Provision of adequate grain to the population and expanston of exports
continue to have high priority. There exist today a number of policy and
institutional constraints involving-pricing policy, public investment, and
agricultural taxation and saving that hinder the performance of the
agricultural Aector. To address these constraints, Chinese planners are
implementing a series of policy reform initiatives aiming to.foster
agricultural development ant 'specialization, increase efficiency, encourage
industrial and commercial 'tz al enterprises,-expand rural exports, provide
productive off-farm employment, improve agricultural tax buoyancy, and improve



-2-
the range and efficiency of rural financial services.  The Bank Group is
supporting these reforms through a Rural Sector Adjustment Loan.
4.       The Government's long-term objectives for the agricultural sector are:
(a;. to increase the production of food, animal feed, industrial crops and
animal products to meet requirements created by population and income growth,
and (b) to raise income and employment opportunities in rural areas. Given
China's shortage of arable land (0.1 ha per capita), development planners have
focused on the teed to increase the productivity of existing cropped areas and
to efficiently develop the few remaining areas of unutilized lands. Steps are
also being taken to stabilize foodgrain output per capita at the 1984 level
(400 kglcapita)', increase production and quality of animal feed, livestock,
fruit, fish and industrial crops, and expand agro-processing activities, so as
to raise value-added in the farm sector. Improved producer incentives includes
(a) enhanced contract systems which reinforce household-level management within
both community and state-owned farm sectors, including longer land leases and
creation of a market in land-use rights; (b) continued expansion of free
markets for output; (c) adjustment of producer prices; and (d) establishment of
private, public and maxed enterprises in rural agro-processing, transport and
comerce.
5.       The Bank Group's strategy for lending in China's agricultural sector
has been to support the Government's objectives outlined above.  Lending to
date has included 18 operations involving a total assistance of about US$1.6
billion for land development; support services, including agricultural
training, research, credit and seed production; development of specialized
product subsectors, including rubber, forestry and fisheries; and area
development projects combining crop and livestock production, agro-processing
and support services. Implementation of these projects is generally on
schedule. Future Bank Group lending would continue to support projects in
large and diverse subsectors, e.g., water resources development, agro-
processing, rural credit and rural sector adjustment.
6.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Bank Group participation would support
the Shandong Provincial Government's economic plan, which aims to accelerate
the development of its agricultural sector by maximising the use of available
resources through improvements in infrastructure and support services,
introduction of improved technology, and strengthened financial and project
management. As part of the Government's efforts toward decentralization, this
project would be planned and implemented by the province without direct
involvement of the central line ministries. Bank assistance in the design and
monitoring of irrigation schemes in the Tuhai Basin component would lead to
more efficient use of water. Bank involvement in the project would assist in
the introduction of improved processing technologies and equipment, which in
turn would lead to increased production and improved marketability of
agricultural products. It would also assist in the improvement of support
services, not only by financing improved seed technology, more effective
extension facilities and purchased inputs, but alet: through impact on the
efficiency of extension delivery. Bank impact would have particularly
important effects on extension efficiency by promoting the introduction of new
technology through training of research and extension workers and by stressing
the need to provide effective extension services to women farmers by employing
women extension workers and village technicians. Bank Group involvement would
help improve microeconomic efficiency by developing guidelines for investment
and enterprise management and through overseas training and technical
assistance. Bank Group staff have catalyzed the development of pollution



-3
standards and monitoring systems, and these would be appiied to the operation
of agro-processing facilities.
7.       Proiect Objectives.  The main objective of the project would be to
assist the Shandong Provincial Government tot (a) accelerate the development
of its coastal lowlands for culture fisheries in line with the objective of
establishing culture fisheries using agriculturally unproductive land. (b)
intensify crop production in existing low yielding areas and increase the value
of livestock production and processing in the Tuhai River Basin, and (c)
upgrade the production and processing of small livestock in the Yi Meng poverty
area, so as to provide productive employment (primarily for women), alleviate
poverty and reduce income disparities.
8.       Project Description.  The proposed project consists of three main
components: (a) Coastal Development - mariculture development, incluu_.ng
cultivation of shrimp and specialty seafood in four counties (5,350 ha of
shrimp and 800 ha of abalone, scallop and sea cucumbers); provision of
hatcheries, feed mills, cold storage and procese.ng facilities and technical
service centers: and strengthening of research and development; (b) Tuhai River
Basin - integrated agricultural development including improvement (81,400 ha)
and expansion (190,200 ha) of irrigation facilities in five irrigation areas;
provision of fertilizer, quality seeds and support services to increase
productivity; development of Chinese date trees intercropped with foodgrains
and fast-growing forest trees; establishment of date processing; improvement of
natural grassland; rearing of draftibeef cattle, sheep and broilers; support
livestock breeding and veterinary services; and construction of feed and meat
processing and storage facilities; and (c) Yi Meng Livestock - livestock
development, covering breeding and rearing of rabbits, pigs, chickens and
geese; processing of livestock feed, meat, goose down, rabbit wool, and
provision of extension and veterinary support services. The proposed project
would also strengthen overall project management by providing technical
assistance, training and applied research. The project, to be carried out over
five years, provides funds for civil works, construction materials, power
supply, fertilizer, equipment, vehicles, breeding stock, technical assistance
and training. The total project cost is estimated at US$272 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$109 million (402). Retroactive financing of
up to US$10 million for expenditures on civil works and equipment incurred
after October 1, 1988 would be permitted. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7513-CHA is distributed
separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  To ensure effective implementation of the project,
the Government has agreed to the following: (a) adequate quantities of
chemical fertilizers would be procured for farmers and an annual plan for such
provision would be submitted to IDA for review prior to November 1 of each
year; (b) the training components would be carried out in accordance with a
schedule acceptable to IDA; (c) the Shandong provincial government would ensure
that the project activities would conform to appropriate guidelines on
environmental control issued by the provincial government and acceptable to
IDA; (d) project funds onlent to enterprises and farmers would be onlent at
interest rates no less than ABC charges on subloans for similar purposes with
similar maturities and such rates would be reviewed from time to time with



-4-
IDA in light of the cost of funds to PREDIC and its financial viability and
changes in ABC interest rates; (e) the Project Management Office (PMO) would
submit to IDA a detailed annual budget and work program for new construction
and operation and maintenance of existing facilities for review by November 1
of each year; and (f) adequate irrigation water charges would be collected to
meet at least the annual O&M costs and 202 of the total capital construction
costs of the irrigation works borne by the Government.
10.      Benefits and Justification.  At full development, annual incremental
output would include 147,000 t wheat, 156,000 t corn, 15,000 t soybeans, 1,100
t peanuts, 36,000 t cotton, 55,000 t vegetables, 65,000 t dates, 206,000 cu m
timber, 10,000 t rabbit meat, 8,000 t pork, 4,500 t beef and lamb, 2 m geese,
3.8 m broilers, 120 t rabbit hair, 1,300 t wool, 8,800 t shrimp and 16,000 t
specialty sea food. Per capita incomes would increase for 1.3 million families
by 552 in the Tuhai Basin from crops alone and by 1152 for 200,000 families in
the Yi Meng area. The income increase in the Yi Meng area would significantly
alleviate poverty in one of the poorest areas in China. Annual output in
mariculture would increase by US$25 million. Significant employment would be
created in all three components. The project would promote the role of women
in the development process by assisting a large number of women enter or expand
livestock raising or be employed in processing activities.
11.      Risks.  The project faces no major organizational and technical risks.
The risks that exist are either small initially or have been effectively
minimized. The risk of inadequate management capability in project entities is
minimized because management is essentially in place, appears adequate and
would be strengthened under the project. The project manager will also have
available the successful project management techniques developed in the North
China Plain Agriculture Project (Cr. 1261-CHA). Technical risks are minimized
because the irrigated crop, tree crop, improved pasture, livestock and
mariculture programs would apply production methods that have been locally
tried and tested in existing commercial operations or validated in project area
pilot studies carried out by local research centers and institutes. The risk
of inadequate water supply is minimized because the Province has obtained firm
agreement from the Yellow River Commission that sufficient water from the
Yellow River would be provided during the period of peak demand from March to
June, so that project water requirements durx-ng this period would be met. The
risk of excessive soil salinity and waterlogging would be minimized by drawing
on the land development experience gained under the North China Plain
Agriculture Project. Only a small export market risk (for rabbit hair and
shrimp) exists and is minimized by the fact that most output of the two
commodities would be consumed locally. No adverse environmental impact is
expected from the project. Waste disposal from processing plants would abide
by standards established and approved by local environmental agencies, and
effluent monitoring would be built into the project.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
