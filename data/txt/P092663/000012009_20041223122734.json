The loan supports the\n            Government's public policy statements and agenda in key\n            economic areas with a specific focus on maintaining\n            macroeconomic stability, enhancing the investment climate,\n            and improving public financial management and\n            anti-corruption. In addition, it provides vital financing at\n            a critical stage and provides an effective vehicle for the\n            Bank to engage the new administration. The expected results\n            of this approach include sustained macro stability, an\n            improved investment climate, greater government\n            accountability, and improved public services for the poor.\n            The proposed DPL supports the policy reforms in the\n            following areas: Macroeconomic stability and\n            creditworthiness: The administration has indicated its\n            commitment to build on the fiscal discipline achieved, and a\n            willingness to address problematic issues in subsidies, tax\n            compliance, and inter-governmental fiscal transfers.\n            Investment climate: The administration has expressed its\n            commitment to continued tax and customs reforms, given the\n            problems in these areas. Public financial management and\n            anti-corruption: The administration is committed to\n            continuing fiduciary and budget reforms through, and among\n            other actions, issuing implementing regulations for several\n            laws, establishing a Treasury Single Account, and\n            strengthening the Inspector General's office. By 2007,\n            these reforms are expected to result in significant\n            improvements to budgeting and transparency, and\n            accountability in public financial management."}, "docdt": "2004-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
