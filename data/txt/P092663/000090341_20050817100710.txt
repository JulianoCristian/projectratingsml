3. Program Description

3.a.    Overall Program

1.      Indonesia has emerged from a policy agenda that focused on stabilization to one
with a strategic, long-term development vision. It was the last East Asian country to
"graduate" from IMF support at the end of 2003, six years after the regional crisis. To
signal continued prudent macroeconomic policies and economic reforms, the government
broadly implemented the 2003 Economic Policy Package -- better known as the White
Paper, a one-year comprehensive reform agenda designed with broad stakeholder
participation. Broadly in line with expectations, the reforms were successful on a number
of fronts in promoting macroeconomic stability, a stronger banking sector, and enhanced
public financial management.

2.      Against this backdrop, the newly elected President outlined a "100-day plan" soon
after taking office at the end of 2004. The policy agenda built upon and added to the
White Paper, and provided a precursor to an evolving medium-term strategy organized
along three main areas: (i) economic policy, which seeks to promote growth through
macroeconomic stability, trade, investment, infrastructure, rural expenditure, and energy;
(ii) human welfare, which emphasizes poverty reduction through improved and equitable
service delivery in education, health, and housing; and (iii) justice and governance, which
places strong emphasis on public financial management and anti-corruption.

3.b.    Description of the Operation

3.      The First Development Policy Loan (DPL 1), a single tranche loan of $300
million, was designed and approved in 2004 as the first in a series of annual policy-based
operations. Together, these operations comprise a program to provide medium-term
support to the government's reform agenda. Included in the Bank's CAS1 under an
"Enhanced Base Case" scenario, DPL 1 was anchored to the government's White Paper
and its objectives were to improve: (i) macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness; (ii)
public financial management and anti-corruption; and (iii) the investment climate (see
Table 1).     Coming at a critical juncture in the country's transition to a strategic
development agenda, DPL 1 also allowed the Bank to remain engaged in the policy
dialogue during the concurrent political transition, helping to sustain the reform
momentum and to inform the government's medium-term strategy. In line with the CAS,
subsequent DPLs would be provided if the country were to move into the "High Case"
lending scenario ­ which would require a continuation of reforms in DPL 1 areas as well
as progress in justice sector reform and public service delivery.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

4.      In line with Bank guidance, this simplified ICR reviews various dimensions of
performance of DPL 1, based on actions related to the three core policy areas taken prior
to approval, evidence of sustained implementation toward DPL 2, and available outcome
indicators to date. In keeping with the medium-term nature of the program, the ICR for

DPL 3 will include a full discussion and assessment of overall development outcomes for
the entire series.2

5.       Overall Assessment. The DPL 1 achieved satisfactory outcomes. It achieved its
overall aim of helping to sustain the reform momentum during the transition to a more
long-term development agenda. The specific policy actions in the three core policy areas
undertaken prior to Board approval contributed to the broader program objectives. Based
on available data, the program appears on track to reach the targets set for medium-term
outcomes by the end of the program (see Table 1). Indeed, the policy reforms entailed in
the White Paper have largely been implemented and the broader reform process remains
reasonably strong. Continued progress even in the aftermath of the devastating tsunami
of December 2004, which has strained the resources and capacity of the Indonesian
government, testifies to the government's commitment. It also strongly suggests likely
sustainability of reforms undertaken. Lastly, while the team believes that DPL 1 has had
a substantial institutional development impact, particularly in the core area of public
financial management and corruption, the review finds that actions so far give rise to a
modest rating, with potential for a higher rating if reforms broaden and deepen through
subsequent DPLs.

6.       Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness.                            Under DPL 1, the
government undertook to (i) reduce government debt; (ii) issue international bonds; and
(iii) divest majority shares in all Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) banks.
Despite the considerable shock to the economy and the strain imposed on the country's
resources and capacity following the December 2004 tsunami, economic growth has
gathered momentum in the first quarter of 2005 and is easily on track towards the
government's projection of 5½ percent growth in real GDP.3 Specific medium-term
outcomes expected by the end of the program include: (i) continued budget deficit at or
below 1 percent of GDP; (ii) mobilizing between 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent of GDP in
additional non-oil and gas tax revenue; and (iii) an upgrade in Indonesia's credit rating to
B+ or equivalent. These targets are currently on track. The revised budget for 2005 is
now projected to be a deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP. Non-oil and gas tax revenues in
2005 are currently projected to be 0.5% of GDP higher than in 2004.4 S&P raised
Indonesian sovereign ratings from B to B+ in December 2004.5

7.       Investment Climate. Actions undertaken included establishing a financial sector
safety net, the effective functioning of the Investment Team, and progress in tax
administration and customs reform. Continued progress in this area has been made since
DPL 1 approval. The government has continued to address vulnerabilities in the banking
system ­ which has enjoyed strong performance recently ­ and improving the legal and
regulatory environment, including measures on business start-ups and a draft action plan
on SME development. Medium term outcomes by the end of the program include: (i)

November 2003.
3  2005 Article IV Consultations and Third Post-Program Discussions, IMF, May 2005
4  In addition the government has indicated that there would be a substantial increase in the excise tax on
cigarettes (up to 20%) in July 2005.

increasing the share of investment in GDP by 3-5 percent; and (ii) raising the share of
financial assets in non-bank financial institutions by 5-10 percent. The country is on
track to meet these indicators. The investment picture in Indonesia has begun to change
rapidly with investment rising as a share of GDP by 2% in 2004 over 2003, and expected
to rise by another 1.7% in 2005. The non-bank financial sector is also expanding rapidly
and the percent of NBFI assets as a share of total financial assets rose from 22.5% in
2003 to 27% in 2004.

8.      Public Financial Management and Anti-Corruption. Actions in this critical
area under DPL 1 included: (i) issuing regulations for the State Finance Law; (ii)
administrative reforms in the Ministry of Finance, including steps to establish a Treasury
Single Account; (iii) issuing Presidential Decree on Government Procurement; and (iv)
continuing the special audit program for SOEs. The new administration has made
fighting corruption one of the highest priorities of the government and further progress
has been made in this area, including the establishment of investigative units within the
Inspector General (IG) that are conducting investigations and cooperating with other
units. The Anti-Corruption Commission and Anti-Corruption Court are operational as
shown by the high profile case against the Election Board. While the Judicial
Commission is not fully operational, fourteen members have been selected and are
awaiting Parliamentary Approval. The Attorney General Reform program shows positive
momentum with the set-up and Blueprint for Reform being very encouraging. These
efforts are supplemented by the active probe into the Munir Case, and the BPK and
Attorney General case against Bank Mandiri. Medium term outcomes by the end of the
program include: (i) 100 percent of government financial statements meeting new
accounting standards; (ii) all core government cash operations consolidated into a
Treasury Single Account; (iii) positive trend in investigations with successful outcomes
as a proportion of total number of investigations. These outcomes are expected to be
reached by the end of the program. For the first time ever, the government has completed
an un-audited consolidated Financial Statement for the Central Government for 2004.
Currently, the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and account consolidation timetable and
activity plan are not complete but the Cash Management regulation that underpins the
TSA is virtually complete and a pilot designed to test the TSA and zero balance bank
accounts is underway. Of the 23 investigations conducted or underway by the IG
investigative units, there have been 13 cases of proven misconduct, four with insufficient
evidence and six on-going investigations.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

9.      Overall, the program supported by the DPL remains broadly on track.
Nevertheless, several factors should be noted for potentially affecting program
implementation and achievement of expected outcomes.

10.     Tsunami Aftermath.6 The country was severely affected in human terms with
94,000 deaths, 132,000 missing, and upwards of 500,000 displaced. The number of poor
people could increase by more than 1 million. Total damage from the tsunami is
estimated at $4.5 billion. However, the economy overall has not been affected as Aceh
accounts for about 2% of Indonesia's GDP and population, and the largely undamaged oil
and natural gas sectors contribute around half of Aceh's GDP. Thus, fueled by stronger
domestic consumption and investment, the country's economy is projected to expand by
5.5% in 2005, despite the tsunami, and 6.0-6.5% in the following two years.

11.     Political / Security Climate. The new president won a decisive mandate, though
his coalition currently lacks a stable majority in parliament. This could lead to policy
divisions between government and legislature.             In addition, the majority of local
executives and legislative bodies are dominated by opposition parties raising risks of
implementation difficulties in the country's largely decentralized policy environment. A
backdrop to the political climate is continuing security concerns over West Papua, Aceh,
and Islamic terrorism, which all have the potential of affecting the government's reform
focus and implementation.

12.     Rising Inflation. The backdrop of rising inflation puts at risk the progress in
reducing vulnerabilities.      While the higher inflation has been partly due to the
administrative increase in fuel prices, underlying inflation has also risen, and the
exchange rate, which has been on a depreciating trend since late last year, reached a
three-year low against the U.S. dollar in April. Although these developments partly
reflect global sentiment toward emerging markets, domestic factors, including ample
liquidity and slower pace of interest rate increase in Indonesia compared to global trends,
have exacerbated the pressures. Recent measures taken by BI and the government have
calmed the foreign exchange market, but pressures are still evident.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

6.a.    Bank Performance

13.     Overall Bank performance has been satisfactory. DPL 1 is a key element of the
Bank's strategy and an appropriate instrument to bolster the reform process and to engage
in policy dialogue with authorities during the country's political and economic transition.
The reforms supported by the operation were based on the government's own reform
program, reinforcing country ownership of the development process. Lessons learned
from past policy-based lending were incorporated in the overall design of DPL 1,

2005

including: (i) the choice of a programmatic approach based on upfront and step-by-step
reform implementation, instead of ex-ante conditionality; (ii) the single tranche design
provides the Bank with flexibility to modulate policy-based support in line with country
performance; (iii) the focus on a small set of actions that are critical for achieving
medium-term results; (iv) coordination with development partners reduces transaction
costs to the government, avoids overlap, and ensures a cohesive donor dialogue (the
Government of Japan provided parallel financing of US$100 million for DPL 1 and has
expressed interest in continuing support to future DPLs. The Asian Development Bank
has likewise expressed interest in parallel financing future DPLs). Lastly, the Bank
prepared the DPL in a very cost-effective and responsive manner by keeping total costs
low relative to other programmatic policy-based operations (US$159,395 compared to an
average of US$385,000 for all Bank programmatic operations) and expediting the
preparation of the DPL to provide timely support during the country's dual transitions
(preparation took 82 days from concept review to Board approval, compared to an
average of 270 days for other programmatic operations).7 This proved to be prescient
given the devastating tsunamis that occurred a month after the operation disbursed.

6.b.    Borrower Performance

14.     Overall Borrower performance has been satisfactory. Despite the challenges
noted in the previous section, e.g., tsunami aftermath, security threats, political and
economic environment) the reforms contained in the White Paper have broadly been
implemented and the reform momentum has been sustained. Both the out-going and
incoming administrations showed strong commitment to moving the government's focus
away from stabilization to a longer-term development agenda.               The government's
transitional strategies and evolving medium-term strategy have been encouraging and
provide the bases for the DPL program. This in itself signals a shift in the paradigm of
development assistance in Indonesia, wherein the government takes a lead role in
determining the direction, content, and pace of reforms, with the Bank complementing
these efforts through an effective policy dialogue and analytic work.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operations

15.     Indonesia has shown that the momentum for reform can be sustained in the face
of a challenging implementation environment. Commitment to the reform process has
been underpinned by government strategies designed through broad participatory
processes.    This is complemented by strong engagement by the Bank, which is
decentralized and field-based, allowing for constant dialogue and a strong, open
relationship with the government. As the DPL program matures, and especially as donor
coordination deepens, the pressure to broaden the scope of the program will also likely
increase. Based on experience with harmonized budget support in other countries, the
Bank must manage this process carefully to avoid over-loading the policy dialogue.
