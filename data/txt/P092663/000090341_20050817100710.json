Findings and implications of the\n            project: Commitment to the reform process has been\n            underpinned by government strategies designed through broad\n            participatory processes. As the Development Policy Loan\n            program matures, and especially as donor coordination\n            deepens, the pressure to broaden the scope of the program\n            will also likely increase. Based on experience with\n            harmonized budget support in other countries, the Bank must\n            manage this process carefully to avoid over-loading the\n            policy dialogue."}, "docdt": "2005-08-02T00:00:00Z"}
