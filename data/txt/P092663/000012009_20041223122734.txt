Front-endFee:         1%o fthe loan amount, to bepaid out o floanproceeds.

Objective:            The proposed First Development Policy Loan (DPL) has been
                      designed to recognize past actions and support continued
                      progress in Indonesia's policy reforms during the transition
                      between administrations and from stabilization to development.
                      The loan supports the Government's public policy statements
                      and agenda in key economic areas with a specific focus on
                      maintaining macroeconomic stability, enhancing the investment
                      climate, and improving public financial management and anti-
                      corruption. In addition, it provides vital financing at a critical
                      stage and provides an effective vehicle for the Bank to engage
                      the new administration.

Description:          It is anticipated that the proposed loan will be the first o f a
                      series o f DPLs - in a programmatic framework - in support o f
                      Indonesia's   medium-term growth and poverty reduction
                      program. The expected results o f this approach include
                      sustained macro stability, an improved investment climate,
                      greater government accountability,      and improved public
                      services for the poor.

                      The proposed DPL supports the policy reforms inthe following
                      areas:

                      Macroeconomic        stability  and     creditworthiness.     The
                      administration has indicated its commitment to build on the
                      fiscal discipline achieved, and a willingness to address



                                        i

             problematic issues in subsidies, tax compliance, and .inter-
             governmental fiscal transfers. In the medium term, continued
             progress in these areas would result in a sound fiscal position
             with low budget deficits, additional mobilization ofnon-oil and
             gas revenues, and further upgrades to Indonesia's international
             credit rating.

             Investment climate. The administration has expressed its
             commitment to continued tax and customs reforms, given the
             problems in these areas. It will make hrther progress in
             financial sector reforms, rationalize regional government taxes
             and fees, focus on public private partnerships to develop
             infrastructure and improve policy toward SMEs.             These
             reforms, over the medium term, are expected to result in a
             stronger financial sector and an increase in the share o f
             investment to GDP.

             Public financial management and anti-corruption. The
             administration has committed to continuing fiduciary and
             budget reforms through,        among other actions,       issuing
             implementing regulations for several key laws, establishing a
             Treasury Single Account and strengthening the Inspector
             General's office. By 2007, these reforms are expected to result
             insignificant improvements to budgeting and transparency and
             accountability inpublic financial management.

Benefits:    The    proposed DPL i s       an appropriate     instrument    to
             simultaneously tackle several key issues at a time o f policy and
             political transition.

             Endorsement of sound policy. The previous administration's
             largely successful implementation o f the White Paper has
             contributed to reducing macroeconomic uncertainty - a key
             concern at the end o f the IMF-supported program in 2003. The
             White Paper made significant progress inimportant policy areas
             and the proposed DPL recognizes these past reforms.

             Vehicle for ongoing and future policy dialog. The proposed
             D P L also provides a mechanism for early and intensive
             engagement with the Government on forward looking policy
             actions to consolidate and deepen these reforms. The new
             administration's public statements as well as the Letter o f
             Development Policy (LDP) indicate its commitments on a range
             o f issues. Within the context o f the proposed programmatic
             framework, Bank engagement on policy issues will be
             enhanced.



                               11

          Enhanced partnership. Traditional adjustment lending in
          Indonesia has had uneven success and entailed considerable
          reputational costs for the Bank, both within the Government
          and civil society. The DPL provides a unique opportunity for
          the Bank to change course and re-engage with the Government
          by basing financial assistance on completed actions derived
          from the Government's own reform program and in line with
          the Government's annual budget cycle. The proposed loan -
          coming in the first few months o f the new administration -
          would also convey a strong positive signal to the financial
          markets and the intemational community to back up the
          encouraging policy agenda o f the new Government.

          Meetingfiscal needs. The proposed loan would help meet the
          Government's financing needs for the current fiscal year.
          Without the loan, Government will be forced to take actions -
          such as drawing down further on its deposits at the centralbank,
          cutting development spending, or retumingto capital markets in
          an unanticipated manner - that could increase macro
          uncertainty.

Risks:    The proposed operation faces several risks.

          Political. Though the President won a decisive mandate, his
          party and coalition partners currently lack a stable majority in
          parliament. This could lead to policy divisions between the
          Government and the legislature. In addition, the majority o f
          local executives and legislative bodies are dominated by
          opposition parties raising risks o f implementation difficulties in
          Indonesia's largely decentralized policy environment. The
          proposed programmatic nature o f Bank engagement as well as
          the triggers laid out in CAS; mitigate the risks to the Bank.
          Future operations will be undertaken only if satisfactory
          progress is made on implementing the Government's reform
          agenda.

          Economic. Despite public commitment to fiscal discipline,
          there i s the risk that political pressures lead the Government to
          pursue an excessively expansionary fiscal strategy. Once
          r e f o m momentum slips Indonesia's hard-won macroeconomic
          stability could be at risk. The Government also has large
          contingent liabilities - e.g. blanket guarantee on bank deposits,
          loss-making state owned enterprises (SOEs), and actuarial
          liabilities at public pension funds. Although there i s officially
          no sovereign guarantee, the central government implicitly faces


                            ...
                            111

                    risks from regional borrowing allowed under a recent law.
                    There i s the risk that domesticfuelprices will not be raised as    ,
                    political pressures have delayed or forestalled increases in the
                   past. State owned banks continue to pose risks due to weak
                    governance. The Bank continues to have a dialog with the
                    Government on state banks and i s working with the
                    Government to assist the development o f NBFIs to provide
                    alternate sources o f long-term finance. The investment climate
                    remains poor and poses risks to growth. The legal system, labor
                    laws, decentralization, taxes and customs all present significant
                    constraints. The Government's public commitment to maintain
                    fiscal and macro stability, and pursue the reform agenda i s key
                    to addressing a broad range o f economic risks. The Bank's
                    analysis and dialogue in these areas and the programmatic
                    nature o fthe loan also mitigate these risks to some extent.

                    Fiduciary and reputational. In the past, the Bank has been
                    associated with Indonesia's weak governance environment.
                    Concerns have also been raised by civil society groups about
                    the.properuse of donor funds. The Bank's fiduciary assessment
                    for the DPL concludes that since 2000-01, there have been
                    considerable improvements in Indonesia's public financial
                    management systems. Despite these reforms, Indonesia clearly
                    has an enormous public sector institutional reform agenda to
                    implement. There remain concerns about the quality o f
                    Indonesia's public expenditure management system; however,
                    the proposed loan would take place in an environment o f
                    substantially improved public expenditure management.

                  I. INTRODUCTIONANDSTRATEGICCONTEXT


        The proposedloanis beingpreparedat an importanttime inIndonesia's history.
On October 20, Dr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the former coordinating minister for
security and political affairs, took over as the first directly elected President in Indonesia's
history - having won a decisive mandate with 61 percent o f the vote. Inmore than 600,000
polling stations across the country, more people voted inthis election than in any other direct
presidential election in any country in history. Indonesia's electoral process with three
national elections within six months has beenremarkably peaceful.

        Although the new administration has been in office for a short period, it has
begun to articulatea clear vision and policy stance. Inhis inaugural address to the nation,
President Yudhoyono highlighted poverty, unemployment, debt, and corruption as key
challenges. The Government has also developed a 100-day plan that identifies actions to be
taken by the administration on the basis o f three broad themes: (i) a safe andpeaceful
                                                                     creating
Indonesia (ii)creating a just and democratic Indonesia and (iii)creating a prosperous
Indonesia. Many o f the priorities aim to consolidate previous achievements, while others
emphasize new areas, including resolving conflicts in Aceh and Papua. More recently, on
November 17, the President again spoke to the nation and reconfirmed his commitment to the
above themes. H e added detail on policy direction in economics, welfare, legal reform,
politics and security. H e signaled a sound approach to policymaking that would maintain
stability while increasing attention to the investment climate, corruption, education, and
health among other areas.

        This proposed single-tranche First Development Policy Loan (DPL) in the
amount of US$300 millionaims to support the new administrationin its reformprocess.
The DPL is being designed during a time o f transition inIndonesia. Inpolicy terms, the DPL
supports a transition from a stabilization agenda to a development agenda that has begun. The
DPL also aims to sustain the momentum o f reform across administrations in a time of
political transition and to provide vital financing and support to the new Government in its
early months. The DPL recognizes past reforms and creates the basis for early engagement
with the new administration on key policy issues. The DPL also develops a forward -looking
programmatic framework for Bank support o f Indonesia's medium-term reformprogram.

        The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) prepared the ground for
programmatic lending. The CAS (Report No. 27108-IND) included the proposed DPL for
the first half of FY05 under an "Enhanced Base Case" scenario. Reaching the "Enhanced
Base Case" required systematic implementation o f the "White Paper" reforms, particularly in
the areas of (i)macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, (ii)   investment climate and (iii)
public financial management and anti-corruption. It i s anticipated that the proposed loan will
be the first o f a series o f DPLs to support reform efforts. Once Indonesia moves into the
"High Case" scenario laid out in the Bank's CAS - which would require a continuation of
reforms inDPLl areas as well as progress injustice sector reform and public service delivery
-theGovernment couldobtainfurtherprogrammaticassistancefromtheBank.




                                                 1

        Indonesia is a prime candidate for development policy lending. With macro-
economic stability regained and a new administration inplace, Indonesia i s entering a new era
which could allow it to switch from a short-term crisis management mode to a longer term
strategic development approach. At the end o f 2003,Indonesia successfblly "graduated' from
the IMF-supported program. The Government expressed its commitment to a continued
program o f economic reform through the adoption o f a comprehensive, time-bound package
o f policy reforms until end-2004. The implementation o f the White Paper has helped to
consolidate earlier macroeconomic achievements.

        This loanforms part of the financial supportfor the implementationof the White
Paper discussed at the last ConsultativeGroup meeting. At the December 2003 meeting
o f the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) - held after the White Paper was issued - the
intemational community agreed to provide up to US$1 billion in program loans for 2004 to
meet financing needs that the Government had identified, subject to firm implementation o f
the White Paper. The CGI clearly understood that the Paris Club had provided exceptional
financing in 2002 and 2003 - and with the end o f the IMF-supported program this would no
longer be available. To help with the gross financing needs, fast disbursing program loans
were to be made available. For 2004, the Bank offered potential support o f US$450 million in
program loans - with the proposed DPL o f US$300 million being the core element o f this
support. The remaining US$l50 million would have been the final tranche disbursement o f
the Water Resources Sector Adjustment Loan (WATSAL), which has been recently
cancelled.

        The new Administration has strongly restated the request of the outgoing
government that this loanis providedbeforethe end of 2004. It has publicly articulated an
initial set o f economic policies and reaffirmed that fiscal discipline and macroeconomic
stability would continue to be comerstones o f its policies. It has indicated its commitment to a
substantive program o f actions through the LDP to the Bank and requested that the Bank
continue to be a reliable development partner for Indonesia by providing the resources o f the
proposed loan. The Bankwould like beresponsive to the Government's needs.

        The timing of the proposed loan presents opportunities and risks. The new
administration took office very recently, and its policies are still being finalized. While this
transition presents some risks, the Bank believes these are substantially outweighed by the
opportunity for the Bank and the Government to engage early in a meaningfbl dialog on key
policies and programs. Through the DPL, the Bank will also be able to convey an
endorsement o f the new administration's initial policy statements and thus help promote
appropriate market sentiment. Recognizing the risks inthe proposed timing o f the operation,
the structure o f the proposed loan as a one-tranche operation provides the Bank with
flexibility for future policy-based support.

            11.     ECONOMY,INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND POVERTY


       Indonesia's economic fundamentals have improved markedly since 2001. Rising
consumer demandincreased economic growth from 3.8 percent in2001 to 4.5 percent in2003
(Figure 1). Growth is expected to reach 4.9 percent in 2004 and 5.4 percent in 2005, the
highest level since the onset o f the economic crisis in 1997. Inflation fell from 13 percent in
December 2001 to 6.2 percent inOctober 2004, and one month SBI interest rates fell from 18
percent in December 2001 to 7.4 percent in November 2004. Despite this progress, growth
has been insufficient to reduce unemployment, and interest rates remain high by regional
standards. Investment demand has begun to rise, but at 18 percent o f GDP (2003) remains
low, especially inlight o fhighcapacity utilization.

        The new government is well positioned to take advantage of the election
momentumto improvethe investmentclimate and accelerategrowth. A continued focus
on macroeconomic fundamentals coupled with early and effective implementation of
important reforms would provide confidence to markets and investors.              In particular,
improving the investment climate i s key given that consumer demand and capacity utilization
are already high. If the investment climate improves and investment increases, Indonesia's
growth could reach 6 percent-a     level sufficient to reduce unemployment-by    2006.

        However, macroeconomic and fiscal gains have been achieved in part by low
levels of public investment. Government spending, including on infrastructure, health and
education have been low, and overall service delivery weak. Looking ahead, the
government's main challenge is to expand public investment while keeping macroeconomic
stabilization on track. There are a number o f options to increase public service resources
including improved allocation o f expenditures, the reallocation o f subsidies, an increase in
non-oil and gas tax revenues, and a re-profiling of public debt.

        A central challenge for the period 2004-2009 is medium term government
financing. Despite continued fiscal consolidation and relatively low deficits, financing
remains a problem with limitedopportunities for asset sales (an important source o f financing
annual in recent years) and large amounts o f domestic and foreign debt coming due. Gross
financing needs will remain in the 3 percent of GDP (US$lO-11 billion) range until 2009.
The government will need a diversified approach to meeting these financing needs including
increased domestic and foreign borrowing, and better debt management to improve the
maturity structure o f the portfolio (see also Annex 4).


A. RECENTECONOMICAND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

        Steady growth with signs of investment recovery. Growth o f 4.5 percent in 2003
was higher than expected inthe wake o f the Bali bombing (October 2002), the IraqWar and
SARS. Economic performance was mainly driven by private consumption and increased
regional government spending. Growth rose slightly in the first half o f 2004 to 4.7 percent
(yoy), and investment rebounded, growing by 8.3 percent, up from 1.9 percent in 2003 as a

whole. This turn around ininvestment activity is reinforced by a 35 percent increase incapital
goods imports (yoy) between January and September 2004. Strengthening fundamentals,
steady growth and successful elections, are reflected inpositive market sentiment. The stock
market index rose to over 900 inNovember 2004, a historic high, from 692 at the end o f 2003
and 425 at the end o f 2002 (Figure2).

         Despitethese positivesigns, Indonesia's investmentis recoveringfrom a low base
and the investmentclimate remainsweak. Between 1996 (pre-crisis) and 2002, investment
as a share o f GDP declined from 30 percent to below 20 percent, where it remains today.
Investment has been a problem for the entire region but Indonesia's investment rate is the
lowest since the early 1970s and Indonesiahas slippedwell behind its competitors (Figure 3).

         Export competitiveness remains under pressure. Indonesia has also lost market
share in export sectors where it competes with its neighbors. The weak investment climate
and especially foreign direct investment, contributed to this disappointing performance
(Figure 6). Exports inthe first six months o f 2004 were up only 2 percent from a year earlier,
while exports from Thailand grew by 8.6 percent, Malaysia by 17.5 percent, the Philippines
by 13 percent, and Korea by 27 percent. In light of high capacity utilization and strong
domestic demand, Indonesia will need additional investment to take advantage of the global
economic recovery.

               Box 1.Revaluation of the GDP -Important Implications for Key Indicators

  InMay 2004, the Indonesiangovernment updatedGDP estimates as part of a exercise carried out every ten
  years to capture the change inthe structure o f the economy. The GDP-components have been re-weighted
  and include new products (e.g. IT sector) based on the 2000 Input-OutputTable. The result was an upward
  revisioninthe nominal level and growth rates compared to the previous 1993 base year (Box Table 1). For
  example, nominal GDP was almost 10 percent higher in2000 and 18 percent higher in2003. This change in
  nominal GDP affects key macroeconomic indicators including tax, budget deficits and debt to GDP ratio.
  Insome cases, these ratios have declined sizably. For example, the government debt to GDP ratio in2003
  was 69 percent (1993 GDP base) but only 59 percent (2000 GDP base); the budget deficit ratio improved as
  well: in2003 it was 2.1 percent (1993 GDP base) and 1.8 percent (2000 GDP base).

  Giventhe transition to the new GDP base it is important to highlight the base year for consistency purposes:
      The Government continues to present the 2005 budget in 1993 base GDP but explains the differences
      with the 2000 base. For consistency, the Government continues to use the 1993 base including inthe
      attached Letter o f Development Policy. In2005, all government documents will be based on the new
      2000 base GDP as 1993 base GDP data will no longer be available.
      Incontrast, this document uses 2000 GDP for all real and nominal calculations. The 2000 base GDP
      currentlybest reflects the real state o fthe economy.

        This growth in the domestic market, combined with weak export performance,
has increased demand for protection. Indonesia has a low average import tariff o f 7.3
percent but poor coordination on trade policy has resulted in increasing non-tariff barriers,
and export restrictions. A ban was placed on rice imports during the harvest season in 2004
and then extended to the end o f the year. Sugar and salt, plastic raw materials, and textiles all
now require special import licenses. On the export side restrictions were continued or added
on logs, rattan, leather andpalm kernels; and cocoa i s under threat. On a positive note inearly
2003, luxury taxes were reduced or eliminated on a wide range o f electronic and other goods.
These were fostering smugglingand their elimination or reduction appears to have stimulated
production andinvestment inIndonesia.

                                        Box 2. Doing Businessin Indonesia

  The World Bank's Investment Climate Assessment and the World Bank's Doing Business Survey 2005
 reflect difficulties in Indonesia's investment climate. These two reports highlight the importance o f policy
  and macroeconomic uncertainty for private sector investment decisions and point to the weak institutional
  environment businesses are still exposed to:

      Investors continue to perceive the Indonesianmacroeconomic situation as fragile andpolicy uncertainty
      as high (48 percent o f fmmention this).
      Less than 60 percent o f firms are confident that their property rights can be protected and 56 percent
      consider the interpretation o fregulations unpredictable (Box Table 2)
      In Indonesia, it takes 151 days to start a business, much longer than regional competitors such as
      Thailand (33 days) and Malaysia (30 days).
      Long periods to enforce contracts and go through insolvency reflect the weak legal environment (Box
      Table 2)

problems. Indonesia continues to under-perform its neighbors in access to quality health,
education and other basic services. In February 2004 the Government issued its Progress
Report on the Millennium Development Goals which highlights the challenges to improving
social welfare, particularly with regard to health and education outcomes. For example,
Indonesia's maternal mortality rate i s twice that o f the Philippines and five times higher than
that o fVietnam.

        Employment growth has been discouraging. Formal sector employment declined
from 32 million in 1999 to 26 million in 2003, while informal employment increased from
56.9 million to 64.2 million. Latest annual figures show that job losses in the formal sector
were particularly severe in2002-2003 with more than one millionjobs lost inmanufacturing.
As a result, the open unemployment rate reached 9.5 percent in2003. Low productivity, high
wages, and increasingly rigid labor regulations drive these disappointing job numbers. Higher
wage demands are the price o f an evolving collective bargaining system. But excessive wage
growth is also a product o f a flawed mechanism for minimum wages, which relies on
debatable surveys to estimate the cost o f living used in the negotiations. Higher productivity
will depend on sufficient skilled workers and flexible labor regulations, neither o f which are
currently inplace.

        After five years of prudent post-crisis economic management, Indonesia has
achieved more fiscal consolidation than expected. Reducing budget deficits (Figure 7) and
mobilizing non-debt financial resources (e.g. privatization, and BRA asset sales); together
with steady economic growth have brought the debt to GDP ratio down rapidly. The
government debt to GDP ratio declined from 80 percent in 2000 to 53 percent as of June
2004, lower thanthe 60 percent threshold stipulated inthe 2003 StateFinance Law (Figure8).
These macroeconomic improvements have been reflected inIndonesia's credit ratingwhich -
now at "By'by S&P - has been upgraded three times since September 2002. Despite these
substantial improvements, Indonesia's credit rating remains five notches below the
investmentgrade andtrails neighbors such as the Philippines andVietnam.

        The 2004 budget is the first for Indonesiawithout an IMF program.For the first
time since the crisis the Government has had to find financing for US$3 billion o f debt
previously rescheduled under the Paris Club. In the initial budget this increased financing
need was met by a draw down in the government account with the central bank, continued
privatization and asset sales, and most importantly increased domestic and foreign bond
issuance (Table 3). The 2004 budget revision included an upward adjustment for both
revenues and expenditures, though the budget deficit as a share of GDP remained almost
unchanged at 1.1 percent. The upward revisions were mainly due to the higher oil and gas
revenues and corresponding expenditures, especially subsidies. The net impact o f the oil price
change on the budgetary balance was almost zero. However, disbursements on program and
project loans, and net bonds were reduced while asset sales (BRA and PPA) and the draw
downofthe government account were increased.

         Financingis on track to match the revised budget estimate. The Bank's current
estimate for 2004 financing is presented in Table 3. Given current estimates with program
loans of US$ 400 million(including the DPL) financing needs would be met. However, the
2004 budget deficit target may be exceeded. Arrears on oil and gas revenues are greater than
oil and gas expenditures. As the government operates on a cash basis, a shortfall innet oil and
gas revenues would affect the deficit assuming compensating measures are not taken.

         Sound management and oil price increases provide opportunities for needed
 development spending in 2005 The Bank projection for 2005 assumes that, in line with
 public statements, the government increases h e 1prices and increases the deficit to around 1
 percent o f GDP from the current 2005 budget target of 0.7 percent. Fuel subsidies would then
 decline to 1.8 percent of GDP from the current estimate of 2.5 percent o f GDP in2004. These
 resources would be reallocated to regional governments and development spending would rise
 to 3.7 percent of GDP, 0.6 percentage points higher than 2004. Gross financing would remain
 challen ing with financing needs projected at 3.6 percent of GDP (equivalent to US$11
 billion) . The contribution from asset sales by PPA (the asset management agency replacing
         F
 BRA) and privatization are expected to be small while foreign and domestic debt principal



  Gross financing needs are the sum o fbudget deficits and debt principalrepayments (domestic and extemal).

payments are very high. Meeting this financing demand will require an expansion in debt
financingwhich will reachmore than 80 percent o f gross financing needs in2005.

        Improving the investment climate is key to accelerating growth. Inthe past few
years, consumers have been the key drivers o f economic growth supported by consumption
credit. The Bank expects that with continuing macroeconomic stability and reforms to the
investment climate, the investment rate will rise and GDP growth could average 6 percent or
more from 2006. Inflation i s expected to fall to 3 percent, built on a credible inflation
targeting regime, even allowing for some pass through of higher fuel prices and the current
account to remain is expectedinsmall surplus (Table 4).

        Recovery should lead to higher growth in taxes. Bank projections indicate that the
ratio o f non-oil and gas tax revenues to GDP could increase by 0.3 percentagepoints of GDP
a year, offsetting a decline in oil revenues of approximately 0.15 percent per year. The
increase in taxes i s slightly higher than the 0.2 percentage point per year gain between 2000
and 2003, but is consistent with the President's strong commitment to tax reform and higher
compliance. The projection i s also based on higher economic growth and structural change
(increased manufacturing and investment and a turnaround informal sector employment) that
would result inhigher tax revenues. Finally, improvements intax administration, buildingon
ongoing tax office modernization (converting from a tax to a taxpayer orientation) and other
tax administration reforms are assumedto contribute to increasedrevenues (Table 5).

focus on fiscal consolidation with deficits projected at no more than 1percent of GDP. This
scenario (Table 5) results in a substantial decline in the debt to GDP ratio to 37 percent by
2008 (and 34 percent by 2009, not shown). Central government development spending
increases by about three percent age points to 6.1 percent of GDP by 2008. With the regions
estimated to spend another 3 percent of GDP, total development spending would be back to
pre-crisis levels of approximately 9 percent of GDP. This increase indevelopment spending i s

largely due to the reallocation of fuel subsidies, a decline in domestic interest rates and
increases in non-oil and gas tax revenues.       Domestic fuel prices are projected to reach
international levels by 2007, with international oil prices at an assumedUS$35 hbl.

financing are expected to be more modest. BRA'Sunsold assets were transferred to PPA
(asset managementunit), but the quality o fremaining assets is low.

       Debt financing concerns point to the importance of continued, reliable low-cost
financing. The scenario assumes that gross external financing (including export credits) will
average US$4 billion per year. This leaves gross domestic bond issuance as the residual at
approximately Rp.60 trillion, or approximately US$6.5 billion per year from 2006-2008.
However, net issuance of domestic debt would be much smaller at Rp.25 trillion (or
approximately US$3 billion). At these levels o fborrowing, total debtto GDP falls rapidly.

       Factors Affecting Prospects.        There are two key factors that could affect this
medium-term macroeconomic prospect: (i)slowdown inglobal economic growth and trade
                                             a
(due to high oil prices), and (ii)domestic economic policies. The economic performance o f
key trading partners such as the United States, Japan and China are especially important for
sustained higher growth. However, Indonesia's medium-term macroeconomic prospects
depend most importantly on Indonesian policy, especially reforms designed to improve the
investment climate. Encouragingly, Indonesia's fiscal stability is quite robust to different
macroeconomic assumptions. For example, the IMFArticle IV consultation indicates that: "A
severe shock involving a 30 percent depreciation, a 250 basis pointrise ininterest rates, and a
slowdown ingrowth to 3 percent would raise the public debt ratio by 10percentagepoints of
GDP."

111.    THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY AGENDA: FROM CRISISMANAGEMENT
                          TO SUSTAINABLEDEVELOPMENT

        Inpolicyterms, Indonesiais intransitionfrom a focus on crisis managementand
stabilization to a focus on sustainable development.After a difficult period of crisis and
post-crisis management, and the broadly successful implementation o f the "White Paper",
Indonesia has a new administration with the opportunity to implement a longer-term
development agenda. The new government has articulated its vision to increase growth,
createjobs andreduce poverty.


A. CRISISAND POST-CRISISMANAGEMENT

        In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Indonesia's first priority was restoring
macroeconomicstability. The consecutive IMF-supported programs and concurrent World
Bank and ADB programs supported fiscal consolidation, restoration of a viable banking
system, corporate restructuring, and, increasingly, legal and governance reforms. The reform
progress was uneven and recovery from the crisis was slow, in part due to the political
transition. Indonesiawas the last East Asian country to graduate from IMF support at the end
of 2003, six years after the onset o f the crisis. Overall, reforms have been largely successful
inrestoring macroeconomic stability, although weaknesses remaininthe bankingsystemand
corporate restructuring still remains unfinished. While governance reforms proceeded more
slowly, inroads have been made on legal reform, notably in bankruptcy law, the strategic
framework for court reform, andthe development of specific institutions to combat corruption
(Le. the Commission to Eradicate Corruptionand the Anti-Corruption Court).

        At the same time, Indonesiatransformeditselffrom one of the most centralized
countries in the world to one of its more decentralized nations. Regions are now
responsible for one-third o f all government spending, and half of the development budget.
Most spending on education, health and infrastructure is local, and the regions employ three-
quarters o f the civil service. The rapid shift to a decentralized government was inevitably
disruptive inthe short term, and many challenges remain inits implementation, but was, in
general, much smoother than anticipated. Decentralization has created new openings for
governance reform, innovation and demonstration effects by shifting control over resources
and public services to a level of government closer to the client. And the introduction of
competitive elections for local executives - and more recently direct elections for local
mayors and district heads - enhances the prospects for greater accountability at the local
level.


B. "WHITE PAPER"IMPLEMENTATION

        The implementationof the Government's (`White Paper'' effectively bridgedthe
"credibility gap'' that could have emerged at the end of the IMF-supportedprogramin
an election year. At the end of 2003, Indonesia "graduated" from the IMF-supported
program and Paris Club rescheduling ended. In order to signal the continuation of prudent

macroeconomic policies and economic reforms, the Government presented a comprehensive
policy reform agenda (popularly calledthe White Paper) through end-2004.

     Macroeconomicfundamentals improved markedly. Monetarypolicy remained consistent
     with macroeconomic conditions and inflation fell, whereas fiscal policy remained
     prudent, so as to achieve the debt to GDP ratio below 60percent as prescribed by the
     StateFinance Law (Section II).
     The banking sector wasput onfirmer footing. The bank restructuring agency IBRA, set
     up duringthe crisis, sold-off most major assets and was closed on schedule inFebruary
     2004. The remaining assets were handed over to a new Asset Management Agency
     (PPA) which completed the sale of the last "IBRA" bank in November 2004. The
     authorities issued a blueprint for the financial sector safety net and began
     implementation: a Deposit Insurance Law was passed by Parliament and the Central
     Bank law was amended to allow for a lender of last resort. Minority Government
     shareholdings intwo state owned banks- Bank Mandiri and BRI- were also sold to the
     public.
     Publicfinancial management was improved. As highlighted inthe fiduciary assessment
     (Section IV and Annex 5), Indonesia has made major headway in the difficult area of
     public financial management. Parliament enacted the State Finance Law in 2003,
     followed by the State Treasury and Audit Laws in 2004. The reorganization o f the
     MinistryofFinancewas launchedinSeptember2004, andwillbecompletedbyJanuary
     2005, to provide the requiredinstitutional basis for these reforms.
     Thefoundations for a betterjudicial system were established. Management ofthe entire
     judicial system was shifted from the MinistryJustice to the Supreme Court according to
     a "one roof' model. The Supreme Court, in close collaboration with civil society,
     designed an impressive "blueprint" to guide reforms in all major aspects of the court
     system and established an office to implement the blueprints and coordinate donor
     assistance. Specialized courts were set up to handle commercial cases and corruption
     cases. After a long delay, an Anti-corruption Commission was set up with the
     appointment o f five commissioners.        The Commission has sweeping powers to
     investigate and prosecute corruption allegations and to undertake preventive and
     community outreach measuresto tackle the roots o fcorruption.

        Despite significantprogressin implementingthe White Paper policy actions, the
investment climate remains weak. Overall investment remains below 20 percent of GDP
and is only recovering slowly (Section 11). Some of the policy initiatives fell short of the
target, including the high level investment committee which had a minimal impact. Other
developments, includedsome protectionist measures, (a banon rice imports, an export banon
rattan), seemingly erratic and allegedly biased court decisions ina series o fhighprofile cases,
and continuing discussions about merging state banks, all hampered investor confidence
exacerbated by the substantial uncertainty associated with Indonesia's prolonged elections
andterrorism risks.

his inaugural speech on October 20,2004, the new President Dr. Susilo BambangYudhoyono
articulated his vision to reduce poverty. H e emphasized that "...the greatest challenge is to
free our people from poverty, ignorance, backwardness, and all problems that prevent the
growth of our people`s abilities. ... the challenge of our era is to consolidate our democracy
and accomplish our reform agenda...". More specifically, he stressed that his administration
would adopt policies that would attract investment and that he would personally lead the
 anticorruption effort. On October 28, the new Cabinet was presented a "100-day plan", a
processthat shouldbeginto implement the vision outlined inthe inaugural speech. This "100-
 day plan" i s organized along the following three broad objectives: (i)                                                                                                                                                                                                  Creating a safe and
peaceful Indonesia (ii)Creating a just and democratic Indonesia, and (iii)Creating a
prosperous Indonesia. Many o f the actions o f the 100-day plan follow on fi-om the "White
 Paper", while others emphasize new areas, such as resolvingthe conflicts inAceh and Papua
 (Table 5).

                             In his most recentaddress to the nationon November 17", the Presidentlaidout
  a broadagenda ineconomics, people's welfare, andjustice (Annex 3). H e highlightedthe
  efforts currently underway including; the formulationo f a MediumTermPlanby end-January
  2005; establishing the ground rules for members of the Government including a "contract o f
  accountability"; addressing pressing issues o f which he mentioned the burden of fuel

subsidies explicitly; and an intensive program of outreach to other state institutions especially
Parliament.

        In economics, the emphasis would be on improving investment and exports. H e
focused on obstacles createdby problems in law enforcement, corruption, policy uncertainty,
infrastructure and security, among others. H e signaled support for a more active international
role intrade negotiations, for increasedrural expenditures including support for research and
development and biotechnology. H e committed to energy and infrastructure strategies
designedto address pressing problems inthese areas.

        In the area of people's welfare the focus would be on education, health, housing
and poverty. In education he emphasized improving quality and access, including for
religious based schools. In health he reiterated the importance o f local health centers
(puskesmas), affordability for the poor, eliminating TB and more attention on HIV/AIDS.
Housingwould be a priority and a new ministry would be created to increase the amount of
housing available. The Poverty Eradication Committee would be revitalized and poverty
reduction goals established. Public services would be made more efficient, illegal fees
abolished, andthe disabled andelderly would get better services.

        The President has made the fight against corruption one of his main priorities
and emphasized collaboration with the Anti-Corruption Committee, including issuing a
Presidential Instruction in December. H e has stressedthat progress inthis area this will be
a yardstick by which the success o f his Administration will be measured. H i s cabinet
appointments in the legal sector have reputations o f high integrity and strong reformist
credentials. The new Attorney General, inparticular, has taken a highprofile role inthe early
days of the Administration, proposing institutionalchanges to enhance oversight inhis office
and setting ambitious targets for the prosecution of ongoing corruption cases. Among the
earliest moves o f the new Government has been the requirement that all cabinet ministers
(andfurther Echelonlevel Iand I1bureaucratsinmanyministries) sign a contract committing
themselves to clear performance targets and to maintaining high standards of integrity. All
ministers were also compelled to submit andpublishtheir personal asset declarations with the
Anti-Corruption Commission.        The President banned all government officials from the
common practice o f accepting "parcels" (i.e. welcome or holiday gifts) from the public. New
procedures have already been put into place to suspend government officials from their posts
under investigation for corruption allegations. These measures, along with strong public
statementsby the President andkeymembers o f the new Cabinet, have been designedto send
a clear signal to the public that this administration marks a change o f tone with regards to
corrupt practices widely thought to be deeply ingrained inthe Indonesian public sector. More
detailed measures to implement this anti-corruption drive have been promised in a
Presidential Instruction on Combating Corruptionto be issuedinearly December.

        The electorate and investors will also be closely watching government policies in
the areas of (i)trade, (ii)the financial sector, (iii)labor, and (iv) decentralization. All of
these are critical to improve the investmentclimate and to ensure continued macro stability.

Trade. Indonesia is a very open economy, with an average tariff of 7.3 percent.
However, recent protectionist measures have hurt Indonesia's reputation as an open
economy. Indonesia needs an open trade regime to hold down costs and attract new
foreign investment, particularly inthe export sectors. The new administration seems to
be taking a more progressive approach. Early announcements have included a decision
to establish a uniform five percent tariff by 2010, and an immediate review of all non-
tariffimportbarriers andexport restrictions.

Financialsector. Despite goodprogress in financial sector reform since the crisis, state
owned banks continue to play a large role in Indonesia's bank-dominated financial
sector. The two largest banks inthe country are state-owned and continue to pose risks
to the overall financial system due to poor governance and weak internal controls.
Recent proposals to assist SMEs by permitting state banks to restructure existing SME
non-performing loans need carefil implementation to ensure that governanceissues and
moral hazard do not weaken the health o f the banks and undermine the overall
environment for SME lending. The new administration plans to take a more proactive
approach to developing the non-bank financial institutions inIndonesia - as articulated
inits LDP. Soundmeasuresinthis areawouldhelpdiversifythe financial sector as well
as provide an avenueto mobilize long-term domestic resources for development.


Labor. The Government has also addressedsome o f the critical labor issues inits First
100Days Agenda. Most of the short-term actions withinthe next three months focus on
providingbetter protectionfor Indonesia's migrant workers. But some important actions
to ensure a more flexible labor legislation are listed, among them the improvement of
regulations concerning recruitment, wage and dismissal procedures. If enacted,
improved measures inthese areas could help reduce rigidities in the employment laws,
particularlywith regardto minimumwage negotiations and severancepay allowances.

Decentralization. In October 2004, the parliament amended the two decentralization
laws 22 and 25, which has provided some clarification, but some more changes are still
neededbefore decentralization can work effectively. First, the functional responsibilities
within sectors across levels of governments need to be clarified. The revised law 22
establishes criteria for the decentralization o fresponsibilities across levels of government.
The next steps are implementing regulations to operationalize the service assignment
criteria. Second, several provisions in the new decentralization laws suggest that sub-
national government borrowing i s likely to remain restricted to that from the central
government, at least in the near-term. This suggests that the problems with central
lending, in particular on-lending, need to be addressed in forthcoming new and revised
government regulations.

       IV.WORLD BANKSUPPORTFORTHE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

        The DPL is a core part of the Bank's CAS (2004-7)' discussedby the Board in
November2003. The CAS highlightedthe types ofreforms andpolicy improvements needed
to reach the enhanced base case and high case scenarios. All of these indicative measures
were drawn from the Government's own economic policy reform package ("White Paper").
The measures under the enhanced base case, under which this first DPL was programmed,
representa subset ofkeyWhite Papermeasures.

        The Bank's assessmentis that sufficientprogresshasbeenmade for Indonesiato
become eligible for a DPL now. Progress in implementing the White Paper has been
discussed above (Section 111). Progress in implementing measures corresponding to the
enhanced base case i s outlined in Table 6. While not all White Paper targets have been
achieved, andthe impact o fmanypolicy measures i s yet to be felt, the Government has made
significant progress, particularly in the areas of macroeconomic stabilization and public
financial management.

        In addition to enhanced base case criteria, the Government can claim several
additional significant achievements. Domestic government securities are being issued in
monthly auctions inaregular andtransparentmanner. The 2005 budgeti s now basedon GFS-
classification as mandated by the State Finance Law. Important reforms to decentralization
laws have been enacted. The Bankruptcy law has been amended- and the permission of the
Minister of Finance i s now required in the event of a bankruptcy case against an insurance
company. This was necessitatedby a series o fwell-publicized law suits exploiting aprovision
that allowed a creditor (policy holder) to sue under the previous interpretation of the
bankruptcy law.

       PRSP preparations in Indonesia are well-advanced, involving government
agencies, civil society and a broad range of stakeholders. A final draft i s expectedby the
end of 2004, which would also coincide with the finalization of the government's medium-
term plan (PJM). While the respective roles o f the medium-tenn plan and the PRSP are still
under discussion, the Bank has recommended stronger links or even a consolidation of these
important strategic documents.

       The proposed DPL draws on the Bank's extensive analytic work over many
years. The Bank has been producing annual Development Policy Reviews in conjunction
with the CGI meetings as well as semi-annual economic updates and bi-annual Public
Expenditure Reviews. The Bank has also produced flagship reports on decentralization,
combating corruption and trade, has just recently completed a set of 18 policy briefs for the

incoming government, and i s finalizing an investment climate assessment. Further details of
analytical work supporting the DPL are providedinSectionV.

        The proposed loan also has strong synergies with other Bank operations. In
particular, it has close links to the Government Financial Management and Revenue
Administration Program (GFMRAP) - which will also be presented for Board consideration
inDecember2004. GFMRAF' embodies manyofthe governance andfiduciary reforms at the
Ministryof Finance and measuresproposed by the Government inthe LDP. It also provides
the technical assistance needed to implement the ambitious public finance management
reform agenda. (See section V and GFMRAP documentation for further details).

        During the preparation of this loan, the Bank has worked closely with the IMF,
the Japanese Government, and the ADB. The IMFparticipated closely throughout the loan
preparation process and provided important inputs into the macroeconomic analysis and the
fiduciary assessment. The Bank will participate in and benefit from the IMF's post-program
monitoring missions on an ongoing basis. The Bank has also worked closely with the
Government o f Japan - which i s considering providing a substantial amount o f co-financing
to Indonesia - during loan preparation. The Bank and the Japanese Government held joint
discussions with the Indonesian authorities and undertook joint appraisal of the DPL. The
Bank and the ADB have been working on burden-sharing arrangements with regard to
support for the new administration. The ADB which has three outstanding program loans
                                               -
with tranche disbursementsthat have been stalled for the past year - is now likely to disburse
about $125 million this year.

        The DPL design has benefited from inputs from civil society and other partners.
The Bank's CAS - where the framework for the proposed DPL was first presented - was
widely discussedinseveralforums. Nearly400 civil society representativesprovidedinputs-
including for the benchmarks for the proposed DPL. The CAS document i s publicly available,
hasbeenwidely disseminatedanddiscussed. Inaddition, as part o fthe preparation o fthe DPL
the Bank, together with an Indonesian economic research organization, LPEM, co-sponsored
a Public Finance Day on October 21, 2004. This forum brought together experts, key policy
makers, bilateral and international organizations to discuss public finance challenges of the
new administration. Participants emphasized that program loans by the international
communitycanplay apositiverole insupporting the new administration's reformprogram.

                    V. THE DEVELOPMENTPOLICY LOANPROGRAM


          The Government has requested the Bank's support for implementing key
 elements of its overall program.            The Letter of Development Policy (LDP, Annex 1)
 outlines the Government's commitments inthe areas o f macroeconomic stability, investment
 climate, public financial management, decentralization, judicial and legal reform and anti-
 corruption, andpublic service delivery.


 A.     DEVELOPMENT      POLICY LOAN       FRAMEWORKAND PROGRAM

          In response to the Government's request, a programmatic approach to
 development policy lending has been designed. The proposed DPL i s part of a series of
 operations insupport of Indonesia's medium-term program of policy and institutionalactions
 to advance substantially its growth and poverty reduction objectives (Figure 11). Over the
 next three years, the expected results o f this programmatic approach would include fiscal
 consolidation, an improved investment climate, greater government accountability, and
 improvedservices for the poor.

 B.     THEFIRSTDEVELOPMENT             POLICY LOAN

          The first operation in the series will focus on actions completed prior to Board
 presentation. The core reform areas supported by the proposed loan are macroeconomic
 stability, improvements in the investment climate, and public financial management & anti-
 corruption. Continuing the momentum o f reform in DPLl-core areas as well as progress in
 justice sector reform and public service deliverywould move Indonesia into the highcase of

        Government program and objectives. The Government's main objectives are to
reduce the debt burden and macroeconomic vulnerability as well as improve expenditure
allocation including poorly targeted subsidies. In addition to careful attention to the deficit
level, fiscal stability requires greater efforts at revenue mobilization and curbing inefficient
spending.

        Prior actions for DPL 1. The following set of measures were completed prior to
BoardpresentationofDPLl:
    0   Reduction of government debt to GDP (2000 base) to below 60 percent (December
        2003) was a major achievement and contributed significantly to the upgrade of
        Indonesia's credit ratings (see Chapter I1andAnnex 4);
        Issuance of a US$ 1billion international bond: In March 2004, Indonesia issued an
         international bond which was oversubscribed and at a lower spread than other
         countries o fthe regionthat issuedinternationalbonds duringthe same period;
        Divestment of maiority shares in all BRA banks: This process, completed in
        November 2004, was an important step in overcoming the legacy of the financial
         crisis.

         Next steps in the reform process. Over the coming months, the Government's
program inthis area i s expectedto include progress inreducing subsidies to the non-poor and
developing andimplementinga debt managementstrategy.

         Expected Results of the DPL Program. By the end of 2007, the DPL supported
program i s expected to further improve Indonesia's macroeconomic fundamentals. This
would include a reduction o fpublic debt to GDP to below 40 percent (2000 base) as well as a
re-profiling o f the debt, continued fiscal discipline supported by mobilization of additional
non-oil and gas revenues of between 0.6 percent and 0.9 percent of GDP. These improved
macroeconomic fimdamentals would be reflected inanupgrade o f Indonesia's credit rating to
B+or equivalent.

                                    Government program and objectives. The Government's main objectives are to
        reduce transaction costs for business, strengthen the financial sector, and encourage
        investment in infrastructure. In order to achieve this, reforms to improve services at tax and
        customs will be continued. Decentralization and regional government fees and regulations
        have been a special problem for the investment climate and the Government is committed to
        amending the relevant law to reduce nuisance and economically harmfbl taxes and charges.
        Working together with the private sector, the Government also plans to increase investments
        ininfrastructure, andto develop aneffective framework to support the development ofSMEs.
        The Government is also committed to continued financial sector reforms - especially in the
        areas of developing non-bankfinancial institutions.

                                    Prior Actions for DPL 1. The following set o f measures to improve the investment
         climate were completed prior to Boardpresentation ofDPLl:
                                    Deposit insurance law was passed and amendment issued to establish Bank Indonesia
                                    as lender of last resort which i s important progress towards establishing a financial
                                    sector safety net.
                                    A modern Large Tax pavers Office was further expanded in 2004 satisfying those
                                    businesses covered under the LTO andhigher revenues.

                                    Next steps in the reform process. Over the coming months, the Government's
         program in this area is expected to include regional tax reforms, further progress in the
         establishment of a financial sector safety net, development of a strategy to strengthen non-
         bank financial institutions, development o f a medium-term plan for infrastructure
         development that encourages public-private partnerships, and reforms aimed at developing
          SMEs.

                                     Expected Results of the DPL Program. By the end o f 2007, the DPL supported
         programis expected to make Indonesia a more attractive place to invest. This improvement in
         the investment climate would be reflected inan increase o f the investment rate by 3-5 percent

                    Governmentprogramand objectives. The Government's mainobjective is to make
            a decisive impact on the extent of corruption in Indonesia through measures to increase
            accountability andtransparency ingovernment financial management andpublic procurement
            and to reform the legal and judicial sector to enhance legal certainty and impartiality and
            ensure a more effective deterrent against corruption.

                    The Government's main objectives are to increase accountability and transparency in
            government financial management and public procurement and to strengthen the institutional
            framework for addressingcorruption.
                    Prior Actions for DPL 1. The following set of measures were completed prior to
           Boardpresentation ofDPLl:




                                                                                                           25

    0   State Treasurv and Audit Laws were passed and ImplementingRegulations for State
       Finance Law issued. These laws contribute to modernizing the budget execution and
       resourcemanagement, and strengtheningthe state audit institutions.
    0  Organizational reforms in the Ministn, of Finance, including the first steps toward
        establishing a Treasury Single Account were launched, laying the basis for a more
        efficient budgetprocess and a reduction incorruption.
    0  A Presidential Decree on public procurement was issued that paved the way for
       streamliningpublic procurement through the establishment o f a NationalProcurement
       Policy Office andbringingIndonesiaup to international procurement standards
       The Special Audit proDam for State Owned Enterprises has been continued and the
       results made public enhancing internal governance structures in enterprises highly
       susceptible to corruption.
       The Anti-Corruption Commission and Anti-Corruption Court were established and
       their members selected through an open and transparent recruitment process.
       Adequate state resources were allocated to these institutions inthe state budget.

       Next steps in the reform process. The Government i s committed to a substantial
reform agenda in these areas including issuing the remaining implementing regulations for
State Finance Law and Treasury Law. The Treasury Single Account within the new Treasury
DG will begin to phase in according to a schedule worked out with the assistance of the
World Bank GFMRAP project. Oversight of taxes and customs will be improved through
increased support for the Inspector General function. As discussed above, the President has
made fighting corruption one o f the highest priorities of the Government. Measures outlined
inthe 100-day planincludereformthe Attorney General's Office, acceleratedprosecution of
corruption cases, strengthened capacity of the Anti-Corruption Commission and Anti-
Corruption Court, and ratification of a new Presidential Instruction on anti-corruption
measures.


       Expected Results of the DPL Program. By the end o f 2007, the DPL program i s
expectedto contribute to a more efficient, transparent and accountable managementof public
resources. These improvements in public financial management would be reflected in the
consolidation o f all core government cash operations into a Treasury Single Account, a 100
percent compliance o f government financial statements with new accounting standards, and a
positive trend in investigations with successful outcomes by the Inspector General in MoF.
Lower corruption indices, improvements in corruption spot checks, higher numbers of
corruption prosecutions, and improved investor and public perceptions of the extent of the
problem would be indicators of success in anti-corruption efforts. A key component of this
progresswill also be evidence of substantial reforminthe legal andjudicial sector.

                         VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION


A.    LESSONS   LEARNED PASTADJUSTMENTLENDING
                          FROM

         Bank experience with traditional adjustment lending to Indonesia following the
crisis i s mixed. The two most recent adjustment loans - the Social Safety Net Adjustment
Loan (SSNAL) and the Water Sector Adjustment Loan (WATSAL) - have faced questions
regarding the quality of loan design and implementation. Despite the SSNAL's significant
achievements, it was viewed as being too complex and detailed - especially because it
attempted to achieve institutional change through conditionality. The SSNAL was closed in
December 2000 without disbursing the second tranche o f US$300 million. The WATSAL
shows a mixed record o f achievements and serious backtracking on reforms. Approved in
May 1999, US$150 million was disbursed in two tranches. However, the remaining third
tranche o f US$l50 million was not disbursed, as the Government backtracked on a reform to
empower water users, particularly farmers. The Bank and the Government have agreed to
close the loan.

         The main lesson to be learned from the Bank's past experience is that classic ex-
ante conditionality is not very effective in Indonesia. This is broadly in line with the
ADB's experience also. While conditions under past sector adjustment loansmay havebeen
effective and important in addressing sectoral challenges, their impact on the economy as a
whole hasnot necessarily been significant. The DPLtakes this into account.

         In addition, the DPL also benefits from key messages from OED's evaluations of
adjustment loans Bank-wide in the 1990s. The main lessons from this review are that
multi-tranching tends to contribute to slow implementation, particularly if the operation
becomes overly complex as a result. Traditional ex-ante conditionality based on promises o f
future actions risks weakening reform ownership. Conditionality becomes unrealistic if
institutional capacity does not correspond to technical demands o f the loan. In addition,
rapidlychangingpolicy environments are difficult to anticipate inloandesign.


B.     DESIGN THEPROPOSEDDPL
               OF

         The design of the DPL takes into account lessons learned from past adjustment
lending as well as the latest thinking on development policy lending'. The loan also draws
heavily on the experience gained in Brazil, where the first programmatic loan was prepared
during a transition o f governments and was aimed at consolidating reforms of one
administration while obtaining commitment from the next administration to continue the
reformprocess3.

                                               28

       The underlying principles of this Indonesia DPL operation are the following:
  (i)Upfront     action instead of ex-ante conditionalitv. This loan i s based on actual
       performance rather than promises, as it recognizes the successful implementation of
       the "White Paper". Building on these accomplishments, the new government has
       demonstratedits commitment to continue and consolidate the reformprocess.
 (ii)programmatic
       Support o freform programbasedon the Government's track record. The DPL and the
                               -
                      approach will support a broad government reform program and will
       predicate future Bank support on progress against a set o f anticipated prior actions.
       Given the medium-term nature of the reform process, progress may not always be
       even across all areas. As long as the overall reform program remains on track, slow
       progress ina specific area maybe compensatedwith actions inothers.
 (iii)Results-orientationandstreamlinedconditions.PrioractionsfortheDPLarefocused
       on a small set o f actions that are critical for achieving medium-termresults. Similarly,
       a limited set o f triggers for subsequent operations provide an indicative basis for the
       Bank's decision to proceedwith lendinginsupport o fkey results.
 (iv) Aligning program loans with budnetarvcvcle. Over time, the proposed programmatic
       approach i s designed to be closely aligned with the Government's annual budget
       cycle, to become apredictable source o f financing for the Government.
 (v)   Working inpartnership. The Government o f Japan i s likely to provide substantial co-
       financing in the proposed DPL and the Bank i s working to identify other partners in
       follow-on operations.


C.   IMPLEMENTATION        ARRANGEMENTS

       As all the actions supported by the proposed loan have been completed prior to
Board presentation, implementation arrangements are only relevant within the context
of the overall programmatic framework of support. The Bank and the Government have
agreed to maintain a close and continuing dialog on future policy actions. The signing o f the
Letter of Development Policy jointly by the Minister o f Finance and the Coordinating
Minister o f Economic Affairs i s a clear indication that the Government considers
implementation o f the future reform agenda ajoint responsibility across economic ministries.
The Government has also set up a coordinating committee under the leadership o f the
MinistryofFinance andBAPPENAS.Itcomprises all the implementing agenciesresponsible
for carryingout the future program- andthis committee will meet bi-monthly. The Bankwill
coordinate with this committee on an ongoing basis and will also leverage its other activities
inIndonesiainsupport ofthe reformagenda.


D. MONITORINGEVALUATION
                     AND

       The design of the DPL recognizesthe criticality of monitoring and evaluation as
well as stakeholder participation for the operation's success4. The Government and the
Bank will take advantage of several important data sources to assess progress for the DPLs.

and updates; (vi) Ministry of Finance reports (from GFMRAP and other MoF periodic
reports), (vii) reviews and analyses of laws and implementingregulations from the Bank and
other stakeholders, (viii) financial audits, and (ix) reports from advisory and working groups.
Current baseline information is already available regardingthe various actions andtriggers. It
i s expected that the Ministry o f Finance will establish a detailed time schedule and
implementation planfor meetingthe highcase scenario and indicative triggers for subsequent
operations.


monitoringandevaluationofDPLson an ongoingbasis.Thepublic finance expert forum -
        The Bankwill also consultwith an array of stakeholdersduringthe formulation,

PEA - is an example of a vehicle to ensure continued engagementby multiple stakeholders
in monitoring DPL performance. Looking forward, PEA plans to sponsor workshops,
roundtable discussions, and working groups to discuss progress on the specific reform
benchmarks and advise on progress, impact, implementation capacity and timing. The DPL
provides an opportunity to engage key experts and stakeholdersindiscussing issues o fpublic
finance andeconomic governance andcontributing to more informedpublic decision-making.


E.    LOAN    ADMINISTRATION

        Borrower and CreditAmount. The Borrower is the Republic of Indonesia and this
operation is a single-tranche loan o f US$ 300 million. The loan proceeds would be made
available to the Borrower upon loan effectiveness, as all policy actions supportedby the loan
have been completed prior to Boardpresentation.

      DisbursementandReportingArrangements. The loanwill be disbursed ina single-
tranche and will follow the standard disbursement procedures for Development Policy
Lending. The loan amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency account of the Borrower
at Bank Indonesia that forms part o f Indonesia's official foreign exchange reserves. The
equivalent Rupiahamount will immediatelybe credited to the general treasury account o f the
Borrower that is used to finance budget expenditures- as the loan is intended to be used to
support the general government budget5. The Borrower would provide to the Bank a
confirmation that this has been done, and any other relevant information relating to these
issues that the Bank may reasonably request. Disbursement will not be linked to any specific
purchases, except that the Borrower i s required to comply with the standard negative list o f
excluded items that may not be financed with Bank loan proceeds. Ongoingdiscussions with
the Government on the overall reform program being supported by the proposed series o f
DPLs will form the basis for reporting on substantivepolicy issues.




  As discussed earlier and inmore detail in Section VI1and Annex 5, the Bank is satisfied that Indonesia has
made satisfactory progress on its fiduciary environment for the proposed operation.


                                                     30

F.    POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACT ANALYSIS

        Most of the specific policy measures that are supported by this loan are not
expected to have any significant distributional impact that either warrant or are
amenable to specific PSIA. Bank PSIA also confirmed that regained macroeconomic
stability - one o f the three core areas of this DPL - has contributed substantially to poverty
reduction after 2000 through price stability and growth. The Bank, in partnership with the
Government and other stakeholders, has been leading poverty and social impact analysis in
numerous key policy areas, including trade policy, local government policies, and subsidy
policies. The Bank and its partnerswill continue to carry out PSIA o fkeypolicy areas, which
will feed into the dialogue on the new Government's mediumterm plans, includingits PRSP.
These analyses would also underpin follow-on loans, particularly if they entail the
reallocation o f public expenditures, the reduction o f transaction costs for business and the
reassignmento fregional taxes.


G.    ENVIRONMENTAL        ASPECTS

        The proposed loan will not support specific measures that are likely to have
significant effects on the environment. While the loan supports sustainable economic
growth, the environmental sustainability of the growth depends on the effectiveness of
Indonesia's framework for managing economic expansion and transformation of the
economy.     In this context, key aspects are sound environmental policy as well as the
institutional framework and capacity to safeguard and sustainably manage environmental
resources and impacts. The Bank`s ongoing and proposed activities support environmental
governance, and forest law enforcement as well as decentralization and reform of AMDAL.
The Bank is helping to assess and strengthen the institutional and policy framework for
environmental impact review process inprovinces and districts, and support governments in
improvingand strengthen their ability to use environmental impact assessment effectively.


H. BENEFITS

        The proposed DPL is a means to endorse sound policy. The largely successful
implementation o f the White Paper has contributed to reducing macroeconomic uncertainty -
a key concern at the end o f the IMF-supported program in 2003. The White Paper made
significant progress in key areas such as macro stability, investment climate, and public
financial management. The proposedDPLrecognizes these past reforms.

        The proposed DPL is also vehicle for ongoing and future policy dialog. The
proposed DPL also provides a mechanism for early and intensive engagement with the
Government on forward looking policy actions to consolidate and deepen these reforms. The
new administration's public statements thus far as well as the Letter of Development Policy
(LDP) indicate its commitments on arange of issues. Within the context ofthe programmatic
framework for future Bank support, the level o f Bank engagement on policy issues will be
further enhanced.



                                                 31

        The DPL creates a basis for enhanced partnership with the Government and
other stakeholders.Traditional adjustment lendinginIndonesiahas haduneven success and
entailed considerable reputational costs for the Bank, both within the Government and among
civil society partners. The DPL provides a unique opportunity for the Bank to change course
and re-engage with the Government ina more innovative way by basing financial assistance
on completed actions derived from the Government's own reform program and in line with
the Government's annual budget cycle. The DPL also offers the possibility of a new level of
Government ownership of the Bank's assistance strategy and a higher degree o f reliability of
the Bank's partnership. The proposed loan - coming in the first few months of the new
administration - would also convey a strong positive signal to the financial markets and the
international community to back up the encouraging policy agenda set out by the new
Government.

        The proposed loan contributes to meeting vital fiscal needs. The proposed loan
would help meet the Government's financing needs for the Government's current fiscal year.
Without the loan, Government will most likely be forced to take actions - such as drawing
down further on its deposits at the central bank, cutting development spending, or returningto
capital markets inanunanticipated manner - that couldincreasemacro uncertainty.


I. RISKS

        Political. Though the President won a decisive mandate, his party and coalition
partners currently lack a stable majority in parliament. This could lead to policy divisions
between the Government andthe legislature. The President has crafted a cabinet that includes
a very diverse range of political parties with an eye towards buildinga workable coalition in
the legislature under differentpolitical scenarios. However, this leads to the potential for risks
to policy coherence and consistency within the cabinet, though a set of strong Coordinating
Ministers have been put in place to mitigate such risks. In addition, the majority of local
executives and legislative bodies are dominated by opposition parties raising risks of
implementation difficulties in Indonesia's largely decentralized policy environment. The
programmatic nature of proposed Bank engagement as well as the triggers laid out in CAS,
mitigate the risks to the Bank. Future operations will be undertaken only if satisfactory
progress i s made on implementingthe Government's reform agenda.
        Economic.The Government's commitment to maintainfiscal andmacro stability, and
address subsidies i s key to addressing abroad rangeo fmacroeconomic risks discussed below.
Fromthe Bank's perspective, appropriate timing o f the subsequent DPLs - anddelaying them
ifnecessaryuntilthe overallreformprogramis ontrack -wouldmitigate someoftheserisks.

    0   Despite public commitment to fiscal discipline, there i s the risk that political pressures
        lead the Government to pursue an excessively expansionary fiscal strategy. Once
        reform momentum slips Indonesia's hard-won macroeconomic stability could be at
        risk.
    0   A deterioration inthe macroeconomic situation through slower growthdirectly affects
        the fiscal situation though lower tax revenues. Interest and exchange rate movements
        also poserisks, giventhe structure of government debt.


                                               32

   0    The Government also has large contingent liabilities - eg: blanket guarantee on bank
        liabilities, loss-making state owned enterprises (SOEs), and actuarial liabilities at
        public pension funds. The recently approved law for a comprehensive social security
        system for all Indonesianscould further addto the liabilities unless designedcarefully.
        Although there is officially no sovereign guarantee, the central government implicitly
        faces risks fiom regional borrowing allowed under a recent law. The Bank and other
        development partners are working with the Government on measuresto mitigate these
        risks including sound implementation of the financial sector safety net, developing a
        strategy to address public pension fund reforms, and reform and restructuring of
        SOEs.
   0    Despite public statements indicating a reduction of subsidies to the non-poor (largely
        fuel prices), there is the risk that domesticfuelprices will not be raised as political
        pressures have delayed or forestalled increases inthe past. There is also the risk that
        low investment in the oil and gas sector will continue - despite some recently
        announced incentives - and that actual production will fall short of the budget
        projections, thereby reducing revenues.
   0    State owned banks continue to pose risks due to weak governance and recent
        proposals to permit state owned banks to restructure SME bad loans need careful
        implementation inthis context. The Bank and the IMFcontinue to have a dialog with
        the Government on state banks. The Bank is working with the Government to assist
        the developmentofNBFIsto provide alternate sources o f long-term finance.
        The investment climate remains poor with the legal system, labor laws,
        decentralization, taxes and customs all presenting constraints to growth. The
        Government's public commitment to maintain fiscal and macro stability, and pursue
        the reform agenda is key to addressing a broad range of economic risks. The Bank's
        analysis and dialogue in these areas and the programmatic nature of the loan also
        mitigate these risks.

        Fiduciary and reputational. In the past, the Bank has been associated with
Indonesia's weak governance environment. Concerns have also been raised by civil society
groups about the proper use o f donor funds. The Bank's fiduciary assessment for this DPL
concludes that since 2000-01, there have been considerable improvements in Indonesia's
public financial management systems (Section VII). The Government proposes to lock in
many o f these reforms with support from donors, under the umbrella o f the World Bank-
financed GFMRAP. Despite these reforms, Indonesia clearly has an enormous public sector
institutional reform agenda to implement. There remain concerns about the quality o f
Indonesia's public expenditure management system; however, the proposed loan would take
place inan environment of substantially improvedpublic expenditure management.

adversely affect the investment climate and Indonesia's ability to attract foreign investment.
Ofparticular concern are armed conflicts inthe Moluccas, Dyaks, and Madureses in Central

Kalimantan, and separatist movements in Aceh and Papua, which have all been cited in the
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) as a deterrent to the free-trade system. The new
administration has made it clear very early on that resolving these conflicts is a key area of
focus.

                              VII.     FIDUCIARYASSESSMENT


        In 2000-2001, the fiduciary environment was considered weak. In-depth reviews
by the Bank and donor partners emphasized the lack of efficiency, transparency and
accountability in the management and use of public resources.6 These fiduciary problems
were compounded by fragmented and overlapping Ministry o f Finance (MoF) structures,
leading to inadequate focus on aggregate fiscal discipline, appropriate resource allocation and
reliable fiscal reporting.

        Since then, however, improvements in Indonesia's Public Financial Management
(PFM) systems have been significant and consistent7. A 2003 White Paper on Financial
Management Reform laid out the key principles and a road map for reforming Indonesia's
PFM system. These included specific actions aimed at macroeconomic stability, financial
sector reform and restructuring, and increasing investment, exports and employment
opportunities. The Government subsequentlyimplemented the core of a new legal framework
for PFM. A troika o f laws (on StateFinances, State Treasury and State Audit) passedin2003
and 2004 now provide an adequate architecture to modernize public resource management
and oversight.

        A new budget preparation process is being introduced from fiscal 2005.
Following the 2003 State Finances Law, the 2005 draft budget has introduced functional and
program classifications, presenting information using the international standard GFS2001
classification. For the first time inits history, Indonesia has presentedto Parliamenta national
budget with identifiable sectoral allocations. Budget allocations have begun to be based on
sector strategies and programs rather than historical expenditures. Movement has begun
towards output- and performance-based, and away from input-based, budgeting. One-year
forward estimates are another first step towards a medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF).

        Budget execution and public resource management are being modernized. The
new legal framework for comprehensive management of public resources will allow the
Government to manage its financial assets, debt and cash more efficiently and effectively.
The establishment of a Treasury, introduction of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) and
automation o fthe treasury payment systemare key.

        A functional reorganization of the MOF is under way.                     This will strengthen
accountability, eliminate overlap and duplication o f functions, and enable the Ministry to
focus more effectively on its core functions.           The consolidation of budget development
activities in a new DG Budget and Fiscal Balance, and consolidating budget execution
functions (including cash management and fiscal reporting) in a new DG Treasury, has

Expenditure Review (Report no. 19845-IN), Indonesia: Reforming the Public Procurement System (Report no.
21823-IN), andIMF:Indonesia-ActionPlans to ImprovePublic Expenditure Management, October 2002.

clarified mandates and strengthened         accountability.   The complementary ongoing
reengineering o f business processes i s envisaged to introduce checks and balances, and
diminishthe potential for rent-seeking that hitherto characterizedvirtually all stages ofbudget
formulationandexecution inIndonesia.

        The BPK-the supreme auditinstitution now hasa stronger mandate. The BPK
                                                    -
has independenceindetermining the scope o f audits. It can audit all government entities and
operations as it deems appropriate. Inaddition, public disclosure of all BPK audit reports is
now mandatory.

        Indonesia still has an enormous public sector institutional reform agenda to
implement. The next phase in public sector institutional reforms is expected to focus on
deepening the existing reforms and widening the scope of the reform agenda. This entails
significant changes in processes and practices, as well as technological change. The
implementation and mainstreaming of the institutional reform agenda will require a more
professional civil service, underpinnedby merit-based recruitment and promotions, objective
performance appraisal, effective integrity systems,         and adequate and transparent         ,
compensation. Key elements o f the upcoming public sector institutional reform agenda
include:
        Expanding the scope, depth and reach of anti-conuption efforts - through more
        effective operation o fthe Anti-Corruption Commission andAnti-Conuption Court;
        Enhancingjudicial capacity and credibilitythrough aneffective Judicial Commission;
        Ensuringgreater integrity andmoreeffective execution ofpublic expenditures through
        implementingregulations for the StateFinances andTreasury laws, a Treasury Single
        Account, an automated treasury payments system, a government financial
        management information system, streamlined public procurement and adoption of
        govemment accounting standards;
        Strengthening public expenditure oversight by enhancing the technical capacity of the
        Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) capacity, strengthening legislative capacity for
        oversight of budget execution, and eliminating the overlap in internal audit entities'
        mandates;
        Increasing revenue collection and eliminating revenue leakages through governance-
        andaccountability-enhancing reforms to the tax andcustoms administrations; and
        Strengtheningcivil service management, incentives, integrity andeffectiveness.

        The Government proposesto lock inmanyofthese reforms with donor support, under
the umbrella ofthe World Bank-financed GFMRAP.

Assalamu 'alaikum Wr.Wb
Goodwishes for all ofus

        My dear fellow citizens and compatriots, wherever you may serve andwherever you
may be at the moment, First of all inthe atmosphere of Lebaran allow me on behalf of the
government and also personally to wish a Happy Idul Fitri lSt 1425 Hijriyah, to all
                                                                   Syawal
those of the Muslimfaith. Minal `aidin walfaidzin, forgive us for our misdoings physically
and spiritually. May the blessings of Ramadhan accompany us in our struggle to build a
better future for Indonesia.

        As a nationwe also have reasonto say thanks becauseafter successfully carrying out
the general elections in2004 peacefully anddemocratically, the present national climate from
the political, social and security aspects is in general in a good condition. The Lebaran
situation this year also developed properly, including managing the gulf of Indonesian
workers cominghomefrom Malaysiainsignificant numbers.

        However, inthe midst of our happiness and gratefulness, we are truly concerned with
the violent actions in Poso, and the natural disaster on Alor, East Nusa Tenggara. We
condemn and are angry with the bombing performed by irresponsible personswho have tom
up the human values in Poso, resulting in the death and injuries of some of our innocent
brothers. The Coordinating Minister o fPolitics, Justice and Security, the Minister of Internal
Affairs, the TNI Commander, the Chief o f Police and the Deputy Head o f Public Guidance
have left for Poso in order to immediately control the security situation, to prevent further
violence including measures for early detection, to be followed by the right measures o f
enforcing the law.

        As an expression of our sympathy and as a quick response of the government, the
Coordinating Minister of People's Welfare together with the Minister o f Social Affairs, the
Minister of Health, the Minister o f Communications and the Minister of Public Works have
visited Alor for a review and to provide the necessary emergency aid.              Ihave also
communicated with the Governor o fNTT to prepare andcarry out regional rehabilitation and
reconstruction inconnection with said natural disaster.

        Today the government under my leadership is 4 weeks old. Ifeel that this first month
o f our administration i s the beginning of the start o f rebuildingIndonesia, after our people
have begun to get out of the crisis. Inaccordance with the mandate and the message that I
have received from the people, Iwill continue the managemento f the administration and the
national development of my predecessors. In essence, development consists of continuity
andchange.




                                              47

        What was achieved by the government of President Megawati Soekamoputri, such as
the economic growth that has occurred and the successfbl achievement of macro economy
stabilization we naturally must maintain. Meanwhile what has not yet been fully realized in
the past, such as the still high levels of unemployment and poverty, and the still insufficient
growth of investment and the real sector, naturally will be the task and duty of the present
government to becontinuously resolved and improved.

        Practically everybody i s talking about the Program o f 100 Days. The mass media,
including television broadcasts are never without a discussion o f the government's program
o f 100 days. There are even some who use this 100 days program as a measure of the
government's success.

        Idonotwishtoargueaboutthisissue;whatisclearisthatthegovernment's100days
program is not meant to and will not solve all problems. It i s also impossible to be able to
carry out all activities, including to measure the success of the present government who God
willing still hasto work hardinthe next 5 years.

        We have been taught that to find a simple solution of a problem, first of all we must
understandthe roots and causes of that problem, and only thenwe remove and overcome the
cause of such a problem. Thus, what the government i s going to do during these 100days, in
particular in this first month, Imight call: "Recognize the Problem, Determine the Agenda
andthe Direction." Naturallythiswill also beaccompaniedbyactual steps andmeasures.

        There are at least 10steps that the government undertakesnow.

        First, consolidate the administration. The Ministers, except for the three Ministers
who also served in the Gotong Royong Cabinet, i.e. the Minister o f Foreign Affairs, the
Minister of Energy and MineralResources, andthe Minister of Social Affairs, need to carry
out orientation, adaptation andtake their initial steps. I,
                                                          too have to quickly studythe policies
o fPresidentMegawati, particularlythose of a fundamental and actual character.

        Second, the government needs to immediately position and study all issues, starting
with the political, economic, social, cultural, legal, human rights, defense and security
aspects. This includes commitments and problems that have not yet been finalized in the
past, inthe sense that they are still continuing.

        Third, specifically the government needs to study and review a number of important
policies, such as the fiscal, industrial and agricultural policies, the education and health
policies, steps to eradicate corruption, the policy of solving the issues of Aceh, Papua and
Terrorism, the policy o f infrastructure development on a national scale, investment and trade
policies, andthe foreign policy.

        Fourth, after having gained sufficient insight of the problems and reviewed the
policies that are effective, the government must determine the direction, the agenda and the
development priorities andthe administration management for the next 5 years.




                                                48

       Fifth, in accordance with the Law of the Republic o f Indonesia No. 25 of the year
2004 on the National Development Planning System, said agenda and priorities must be laid
down ina Medium Term Development Plan(RPJM) that must be finished within 3 months.
Inorder that duringthese first 100daysthere should alsobeacorrectdirection, concept and
planinwhat the government is doing, the government has already stipulated the Agenda o f
the First 100Days o fthe Unified IndonesianCabinet.

        Sixth, in order that the government management may truly take place effectively, as
the President Ihave already stipulated the Rules of the Game andthe Code o f Conduct for all
rank and files o f administration or executive institutions, both at Cabinet level (intemal),
Central Government level as well as Regional government level. Infact this i s a contract o f
accountability o f the executive ranks that must be heldhigh. Iwant the government ranks to
work seriously, responsibly, performingproperly, andto be free o f corruption and deviations.

        Seventh, during these 100 days the government needs to show determination and a
highcommitment incarrying out its tasks, including applying a shock therapy. That is why
during the first week Ihave visited four important institutions o f whom the State and the
people expect that they will carry out their task properly, with a highperformance and not to
the contrary carry out deviations including acts o f KKN. These four institutions are the
Office o f the Attorney General, the IndonesianPolice, the Directorate General o f Taxes and
the Directorate General o f Customs & Excises. Ihave clearly told these servants o f the State
that we will carry out the principles o freward andpunishment even more firmly inthe future.

        Eighth, the government must be able to handle the actual problems that exist during
these 100 days, namely the management of the celebration o f Lebaran, Christmas and New
Year, and the management o f the repatriation o f Indonesian workers from Malaysia. The
Government must be able to manage the stability o f the nine basic commodities prices, public
transportation, the availability o f fuel, health services and security during these Holidays.
The retum o f workers from Malaysia in hundreds of thousands must also be carried out
smoothly. As the leader Imust review and check directly all those public services so that
there will beno bigand serious problem.

        Ninth,duringthese 100days the government must also settle and finda solution for
several critical problems that were not yet settled before, such as a policy solution on the high
oil price on the internationalmarket, which places a heavy burdenon the State Budget due to
the large fuel subsidies. A solution inrespect o f settling the Karaha Bodas case, the review o f
the 2005 State Budget including the stipulation o f the budget deficit figure, and a review o f
the assumed oil price. Ineed to point out that the choice is often not easy, and even bitter.
However, whatever is the case the government must make a choice and take a decision.
Because this problem is closely related to the existence of our people, the government
naturally will seriously discuss the matter with the Parliament and the Regional
Representatives Council (DPD).

        Tenth, as o f this year 2004 the system andpractice o f our State has experienced many
changes. This is in accordance with the message of the 1945 Constitution that has already
 experienced four amendments.



                                                49

         We all know that aside from the Supreme Court we have the Constitutional Court.
Aside from the People's Representatives Council there is the Regional Representatives
Council.    The People's Advisory Assembly which in the past was the Supreme State
Institution, has now become a State Institution which no longer elects the President and
stipulates the Broad Outlines ofthe Nation's Direction. O f coursethis needs adjustments and
adaptations from the aspect of paradigms, mindset, mechanism and even the political culture
in which we all find ourselves. And therefore during this first month Ihave carried out
communications and consultations with those high state institutions so that we will mutually
understand our respective roles, function, authorities and tasks, in accordance with the
Constitution andthe laws that are inforce.

         Inconnection with the relations of the government with Parliament that have been
strained in the past, particularlybefore the work meetings between the Government and the
Parliamentarycommissions couldbegin, naturally these were not designed or the wish o f the
government or the Parliament. Iam thankful that the problems that concem these horizontal
relations have relativelybeen solved andboth institutes have been able to carry out their role
and function in accordance with the message o f the Constitution. Clearly the government
naturally wishes to receive control from Parliament so that the decisions and public policies
will trulyberight, andalso inaccordancewith the expectationsofour people.

Dear fellow compatriots whom Ilove,
         At this opportune occasion, at the beginning of implementing the tasks of the
government that Ilead, it would be good for me to refresh and bring up the vision and
missionthat Ihave pointed out duringthe past elections. This i s important so that aside from
achieving consistency, said vision and mission can also be understood as a whole and free
from inaccurate manipulations.

         Ihaverepeatedlysaidthatthe Indonesiatowardswhichwe areheadingis an
Indonesia that is safer, fairer, more democratic and more prosperous. Of course such
conditions we have to buildinphases, through togethemess and hardwork.

         Inthetimerangeof5 years forwardthereareanumberoffundamental issuesthatwe
musthandleseriously, so that our aimto buildabetter Indonesiawill beaccomplished.

         Inthe economic fieldwe mustwork hardso that our economy will grow at atarget of
an average 6.5% per year. We want the state revenues to continue increasing, both from
taxes as well as nontaxes. We also want unemployment to decrease to the rate o f 6% or even
lower by the year 2009. We must lower the poverty rate. On the other hand, we need to
carry out serious efforts to be able to increase investments and to develop our infrastructure
nationwide.

         Inthe field ofpeople's welfare, our main agendawill be to enhance the quality of
education and health. Aside from that we must also encourage religious life fillof harmony
andtolerance. Theprotectionandempowerment o fwomen mustbecarried out continuously.




                                               50

        In the field of justice, the priorities must be assigned to sustainable justice sector
reforms, law enforcement, eradication of KKNin a more effective and serious way, and the
settlement of large scale legal cases.

        Inthefieldofpolitics, weneedtocontinue reformsanddemocratization. Respectfor
civil rights needs to be enhanced, in line with the enhancement o f freedom in the political
system that is stable and orderly.

        And in the field of security, the main agenda is directed at settling the separatism
issue in Aceh and Papua, the eradication of terrorism, and thorough settling the communal
conflict inPoso andinAmbon.

        The accomplishment of above mentioned five agendas, namely the problems in the
economic field, people's welfare, justice, politics and security, naturally needs the right
strategy, policy andplans. The steps and actions from the government duringthese first 100
days, too, cannot be disengaged from the context o f the agenda 5 years forward. It goes
without saying that in 100days what the government can do is to determine the strategy, the
fundamental policy and action plan, including also to lay the foundation for the subsequent
phases. However, both symbolical as well as concrete the government must already work
according to the correct direction and aim. The government wants to carry out effective and
systemic administration management, and also beable to measureits progress.

Dear people,
        Iwillexplain,brieflyandinbroadlines,the5YearAgendaand100DaysAction,
field by field, for a more complete understanding o f the vision, mission, plan and action of
the government forward.

        Iwillbeginwiththeeconomicfield. IwillusethephraseTripZeStrategyinthe
national economic development forward.         The first strategy i s to boost growth through
enhanced investments and exports. The second strategy, to revive the real sector in order to
create more extensive employment opportunities. And the third strategy i s to revitalize
agriculture and rural economy to diminishpoverty. So, actually the triple strategy is nothing
other than a "Pro-Growth, Pro-Employment and Pro-Poor,' strategy.

        We do have to carry out economic growth and enhancedquality output. Ifduringthe
transition period o f the past six years growth was stimulated more by consumption, naturally
for the fbture we will endeavor that the pillarso f growthwill be investment and exports.

        For investment, domestic as well as foreign, to continue to increase and grow, we
need an increasingly conducive national climate. Iagree with the results o f the survey
coordinated by the Intemational Business Chamber in Jakarta in August 2004 last, that
according to its ranking the factors that influence investment including its barriers are law
enforcement, corruption, taxes, bureaucracy and inconsistent policies or regulations,
manpower, crime and security, infrastructure and regional autonomy. Ialso agree with the
identifications by Kadin that the critical factors related to industrial expansion in our country
are problems in the field o f law, taxes, manpower, infrastructure and regional autonomy and



                                                51

industrial strategy and policy. In fact those factors, identifiedby the International Business
Chamber o f Jakarta and by Kadin, constitute the agenda and priority o f putting order inthe
investment climate in the next 5 years. Actually, during the first 100 days, the government
again has begun to touch and handle these factors. Personally, as the President, Itoo have
givenit my utmost attention.

       Fromthe export side, the government will try hardto enhance international economic
cooperation more aggressively, to find access to wider markets for agricultural products in
developed countries, including negotiations o f tariffs that are profitable for us in the WTO
forum. Inthis first month Ihave already held substantial discussions, naturally inthe macro
context, relatingto more extensive economic cooperation with the MalaysianPrime Minister
AbdullahBadawi, the SingaporeanPrimeMinister LeeHsienLoong, the special envoy ofthe
President o f the PRC HuJintao the State Councellor Tang, the special envoy o f the Emperor
and the Prime Minister of Japan Fukuda and the Leader of Nippon Keidanren, and the
Australian Prime Minister John Howard. Inthis context Ihave also heldcommunications and
discussions with the U S Chamber o f Commerce in Washington DC through a video
conference inJakarta.

       God willing, during the APEC meeting this weekend in Chile, Iwill continue the
discussions with other world leaders. The Coordinating Minister o f the Economy and the
Minister o f Trade have been specifically assignedbyme to hold more operational discussions
with their respective counterpartsinthe ASEANcountries as well as APEC.

       The activation of the real sector must be done more aggressively inthe next 5 years.
Themanufacture andservices sectormust get up andgrow, includingthe expansion of SMEs.
We have a stake in diminishing unemployment significantly, through the revival o f the real
sector.   Why must the manufacture industry survive? mainly those that face certain
challenges such as the textile industry, so that there will not be a wave o f lay-offs, that will
only worsen the figure o f open unemployment which now numbersabout 10millionpeople.

       Revitalizationof agriculture and the rural economy must be undertaken. Agriculture
and rural infrastructure mustbe developed. We must also increase government spending on
agricultural development, becausethis can decreasethe poverty figure ofwhich 68% i s inthe
agriculture and rural sector. The expansion o f agribusiness also should not marginalize the
farmers who are getting increasingly marginalized. Iencourage research and innovation in
the agriculture sector, including biotechnology as have successfblly been accomplished in
Thailand. The IPB [Bogor Agricultural Institute] for example as one of the centers of
excellence couldbecome a pioneer inrevitalizing agriculture andrural economy.

        The energy sector must also be encouraged seriously. The demand for energy will
continue to increase, including electricity by first stipulating the medium and long term
energy strategy. Meanwhile the government needs continuously to stipulate the fuel subsidy
policy and the correct price policy. This first month Ihave officially opened the gas
production and processing off shore Natuna. Ihave also officially opened 3 gas electric
power stations inSouth Sumatra, includingthe development o f electric interconnection inthe




                                               52

Sumatra area. Ieven agree and encourage the wish o f the regional government and the
people o f South Sumatrato turntheir province into the storageo f energy.

        Infrastructure development i s very pressingfor us to beundertaken. Theneed for new
investment in the infrastructure sector is estimated to reach US$72 billion for the next five
years, for which naturally we greatly expect contributions from the private sector. During
these first 100 days the government will compile a blueprint of the infiastructure
development plan nationwide and integrated. This includes the aspect of the necessary
financing, which naturally must be integrated between regional and central financing,
including contribution from the private sector. Bearing in mind the big investment in the
infrastructure development, the choice and decision must be exactly right. The cost-benefit
considerations must also be correct. As an example, the plan o f developing the Dumai sea
port Iconsider to be right because the CPO volume which will be carried from that port will
increasefrom 3 million tonnes in2004to become 6 million tonnes inthe year 2006. With the
same objective, the sea port development plan inPangkalan Bun, Central Kalimantanis also
right. The development of a subway and monorail in Jakarta in order to solve the
increasingly worsening traffic jams, will o f coursebe aneedthat shouldbe understood.

        So that the hture economic development will be even more successful, we need
proper synergy and synchronizing. This synergy and synchronizing involves the national
policy and the regional policy, monetary policy and fiscal policy, as well as the joint role o f
the government andthe business community.

        IhavehelddiscussionswiththeBIGovernorregardinghowtoharmonizetheroleof
BI and the government into a correct policy integration. Likewise the Government has
communicated its vision and national economic policy for the next 5 years, to the leaders of
banks inIndonesia. Isupport the effort ofBIinthe frame of strengtheningmonetary stability
andthe increasingly credible bankingsystem. Periodically Iwant to hold meetingswith the
BI Governor. Likewise Iwill also hold periodical meetings with Kadin and the business
community. We must bear in mind, that in fact it i s the business community that creates
economic growth and employment, and not the government. Naturally the government has
the obligationto encouragethe compilationof a correct economic development strategy (SBY
uses EngZishphrase: a government drivendevelopment strategy).

        Bearinginmindthe increasingly stronger relationship between countries inthe global
economy, and also realizing the need for overseas investment to expand the national
economy, international economic cooperation whether with countries or international
organizations must be carried out properly. During the first 30 days Ihave held substantial
discussions with international institutions such as the World Bank, CGI elements and others,
to continue cooperation, naturallycontinuing to be oriented on our national interest. Learning
a lesson o f Indonesia's cooperation with IMF in the past, for the future we should play a
bigger role in formulating the strategy, policy and road map of our economic development,
andnot others.

Dear people,
        Following Iwill present the 5 Year Agenda, 100 days action in the field o f People's
Welfare. For the future we must increasingly fulfill the people's basic rights, such as food,
clothing, housing, the sense of security, education, health and others. These are the measures
o f their welfare, our people. Meanwhile, the concept o f the prosperous family needs to be
revitalized. The prosperous family canbecomethe stronghold and supervisor ofmanythings,
including the threat o f narcotics, alcohol and students fights against our children. This i s
where the role of BKKBN, Puskesmasbecomes important, also Primary School, Junior High
School and Senior HighSchool.

        Inthe education sector we do have to work very hardto enhance the quality of our
education. We need to continuously increasethe education budget inline with our economic
growth. The quality and welfare o f teachers must also be enhanced. Iknow for the weak
economy group it i s difficult to finance their children's schooling.          That is why the
govemment i s looking for an effort to lessen the education costs, including the costs of
buyingtextbooks. The Reform and structure of national education also covers the structure
and improvement of religious education, such as pesantren that are distributed throughout
Indonesia.    In order to lighten the education burden Iurge that aside from using the
government budget through the State Budget, perhaps the parents who can afford it and the
private sector could also make a contribution.         Iinvitedonorstodevelop ourhuman
resources, our humancapital to become competitive inthe future.

         A few moments ago Ihad a video conference with ITS and Unair Surabaya. I
challenged these two universities to become centers o f excellence in the education
community. We must fight so that at one time inthe future there will be a university from
Indonesia included in the 100 best Universities in Asia, or the 500 best Universities in the
world.

         In the health sector we want an increasingly better level and quality of people's
health. The quality of life o f the people i s often measuredfrom the level o f health, education,
and income per capita. And in this context Indonesia must work very hard to improve the
quality of life o fits people.

         Inthe future, the government wants to improve the condition of thepuskesmas that
are distributedthroughout Indonesia, includinghospitals. The quality o f health services must
also be improved. In the dialogues that Iheld with the people, in particular in rural areas,
they complained about medicines being too expensive. The Minister of Health is studying
how to make the price of drugs more affordable to the small people. Includinghow the poor
can be exempted from payment at hospitals. The government also needs to stipulate the
correct policy inhealthtreatment o f the senior citizens, particularlyfor the less well-to-do. In
my dialogues with the doctors joined in ID1 and the extended family of other health
communities, Idid challenge "when will Indonesia be really free o f malaria, dengue fever
and tuberculosis." It is the same as the question of when will the world find a cure for
HIV/AIDS and cancer. When meetingme a few moments ago, Iasked the organization for
the prevention and solving o f HIVIAIDS in Indonesia to continue conduct an aggressive
national campaign against the spread o f HIV/AIDS that is getting more worrisome in our



                                                  54

country. The same campaign also against narcotics hat is also threatening our lives, in
particular o fthe nation's younger generation.

         Inthe structure of the Unified Indonesian Cabinet Ihave revived the State Minister
for People's Housing. The ownership of reasonablehousing is one of the basic rights of the
people. We don't want more luxury houses in this country, shopping malls and public
facilities alone, but also people's housing that are adequate andincreasingly affordable.

         Inthe first 100 days the government wishes to compile a housing development plan
for the next five years concretely and realistically. The construction o f housing on a large
scalewill be able to move the real sector, and absorb largenumberso fmanpower.

         A war that we must fight inpeacetime is the war againstpoverty andbackwardness.
The government needs to integrate all efforts to solve poverty, including increasing the
performance o f the Poverty Eradication Committee. What i s expected of our brothers who
are still poor is quite simple, to have food each day, a house to sleep, to be able to send their
children to school, andwhenthey are sick to get medicaltreatment.

         One aspect o f social life that is important i s religious life. We most position religion
as a value, and then as behavior, and not as a symbol. Frankly, during the six years of the
transition periodthere has been a drop inthe harmony and tolerance inour life, including the
relations between the religious communities. We must strengthenbrotherhood, harmony and
tolerance.

         Onthe other handthere are manycomplaints concerning the managementof the Hajj
pilgrimage, both at the level of the Department of Religion as well as service inthe field, in
Indonesia as well as in Saudi Arabia. Inthese 100 days the Minister of Religion is carrying
out a restructuring inthe Hajj pilgrimage managementwith as target economizing, preventing
corruption andimprovedquality o f services for the hajj pilgrims.

         We know that a developed nation is a nation that has good morals and personality,
physical and mental health, and that masters knowledge and technology.             These are the
competitive elements of a nation. Our homework will be to continue buildingthe character,
attitude and behavior o f our nation -which we often call character building. Iwelcome the
social movement lead by AA Gym, called Gema Nusa or the Movement to Build the
Conscienceo fthe Nationas a manifestation o f characterbuilding.

         Still concerning people's welfare, Ireally want to try hard to improve the quality o f
public services, or the service of our society, including protection o f safety and security. At
nearly all occasions when Imeet the people, Ialways ask whether the State, in this case the
government, has provided them with adequate protection and services. The answers are
varied. Beginning from those who are satisfied to those who are not satisfied. When Imet
Governors, Bupatis, Mayors and all the ranks of the administration, amongst others in
Tanjung Pinang, Dumai, Pekanbaru, Palembang, Bengkulu, Pangkalan Brandan and in
Jakarta too, duringthese first 30.daysYIalways emphasize and Iorder them to improve their
service to our people. Although the major part of people's income i s still low, but if the



                                                 55

government provides proper service, naturally they will feel more comfortable.         For the
future, our people must feel more secure wherever they are, during the day or at night, free
from the intensive fear o f various crimes. This is a challenge for our police. And this Ihave
said when Ivisited Police Headquarters, including my briefing for all Chiefs of Regional
Police through a video conference, that the protection of the people fkom crimes will be
increased. Inparticular threats fkom street crimes.

        Likewise an easy, quick service free fkom illegal levies in handling documents,
including licensing, registration as government officials, TNI and Police members, or
applying for any job, health service, transportation services etceteras. The government
through the Department o f Social Affairs, the Department o f Health and the ranks of the
Regional Governments i s considering how to perform services for the deformed and the
elderly inthe public area inthe rightmanner.

Dear people,
         The aspect of life that is currently being focused on much is that of law andjustice.
Everybodywants the face of the law inour country to be totally improved. Although, Ineed
to remind, there is no short cut for reform in the field o f the law, which in reality is very
complicated at the moment. What the government will do inthe future, is a systematic and
intensive effort to make reforms inthe field o f law and law enforcement. Infact, especially
for fighting the crimes o f corruption, the government in cooperation with other state
institutions andcivil society elements will continue to carry out more serious measures.

         The major agenda in enforcing the law i s to fight corruption, to prevent and to take
action against serious crimes against humanrights, eradicate smuggling, illegal logging and
illegal fishing, andcontrolling crimes o fnarcotics and street crimes. Duringthe first 100days
steps into that direction will be taken.

         Inthe fight against corruption the government has and is studying all aspects and
knots that have caused corruption to continue in this country. The government also holds
intensive and continuous consultations with the KPK [Corruption Eradication Committee] to
establish coordination, synchronization and synergy in fighting corruption. Early December
next, God willing a Presidential Instructionon the Eradication of Corruptionwill be issued,
including its mechanism and institution. After that, periodically and incidentally evaluations
will be made of corruption eradication measures, including the obstacles and the results
achieved. At cabinet level, once a month a Special Meeting will be held on corruption
eradication, which Iwill chair directly.

         The Attomey General is undertakingan acceleratedprocess to bringcorruption cases
to court. Ihave issued an instruction that priority should continue to be assigned to large
scale corruption cases that are detrimental to the state in large amounts and that bother the
sense o f justice. Ihave and will continue to accelerate giving permission for government
officials, from the central as well as the regional government, to undergo investigation by the
police on the suspicion o f a crime of corruption. Iinvite the participation and contribution
fkom non-government organizations that are active in "corruption watch", for this effort to
eradicatecorruption. As Head of the State, Ihope that all institutions and sub-systems of the



                                                56

corruption eradication can function properly and correctly, namely the Government and its
BPKP [Agency for the Supervision of Finances andthe Development], BPK [Supreme Audit
Board], KPK, the Police, the public attorney's office, Courts, Attorneys, NGOs and also the
generalpublic.

        So that the eradication o f corruption can be carried out effectively Iask the leaders to
really lead and to set an example. Irepeat my statement when Iinstalled the Unified
Indonesian Cabinet that those state officials in the ranks o f the administration who are
involved in corruption to resign immediately and subsequently receive the proper legal
sanction.

        The crime of illegal logging is also causing a lot o f concern. Not long ago Ireviewed
directly the National Park at Tanjung Putting which i s in a condition that causes great
concem, damaged due to theft and illegal logging. The same situation also occurs in other
regions. My instruction i s brief and clear. Save our forests, punish the illegal loggers and
wood thieves. In Central Kalimantan Isaid that there i s no one in this country who is
untouchable because o f the forest looting.        Iwillevaluatetheperformanceofourlaw
enforcers ineradicating this illegal logging.

        The smuggling cases still occur in our country. Since Ihave already given a very
clear instruction to the police and the Directorate General o f Customs and Excises, we will
see their implementation and perfonnance. The State loses hundreds o f billions from these
crimes o f smuggling. An amount that is very significant to help the poor, including to
improve education and health and teachers' welfare, civil servants, soldiers and also the
welfare o f fanners, fishermen, laborers andother weaker economy categories.

Dearfriends,
        Talking about the 5 year Agenda, the 100days Action inthe field o fpoliticsnaturally
will not be insuchplain view as the steps for law enforcement or infrastructure development
for example. It is clear that we want the democratization process to proceed properly. The
success story o f the 2004 general elections, that has shown that our people are able to carry
out democracy peacefully, although we still have to improve its quality, needs to become a
historical benchmark to further expand our democratic life.

        Several important agendas inthe national political development are the strengthening
o f the political institutions, an increasingly transparent and accountable political process, an
increasingly extendedpolitical participation and the reform o f the TNI, the Police and other
stateinstitutions to take a neutral attitude, andnot to engageinpractical politics.

        Frankly we must admit that all state institutions must learn a lesson from the past
2004 General Elections, to truly free oneself from anypolitical interest. All sides must really
understand the values, norms, rules o f the game and ethics in democratic life so that the
fairness andjustice o f democracy will not be disturbed.




                                                  57

        In the field of security we also must work extra hard to maintain a good national
security level. With national security Iam talking about extemal defense, internal security as
well as public security.

        We must be able to find a good solution for the issue of security inAceh and Papua.
Especially for the settlement o f Aceh, today the government has helda Consultation Meeting
with the Parliament to discuss the policies and follow up measures inthe Aceh settlement.
While continuing to preserve the momentum and the sustainable recovery of security in
Aceh, the government also held an approachandnew measuresinorder to endthe conflict in
a more dignified, fair andpeaceful manner. While we work hardandmust endeavor to really
end the conflict peacefully, the integrated operations that are still going on currently can
really be carried out with better quality, so that its results can be felt by the people o f Aceh
even more concretely.     Together with Parliament, the government is preparing to grant
amnesty and economic reconstruction ifthe conflict really ends, which will be markedby the
rejoiningo f GAM into the greater family ofthe Indonesianpeople.

        The settlement of Papua is also being undertaken more intensively, with special
autonomy as the pillar of settlement. Some time ago Ihave met the Governor andthe leaders
ofPapua, to take concreter steps insettlingthe Papuaissue.

        The eradication o f the crime of terrorism also constitutes an important agenda. This
has the objective to protect the safety and the security of the Indonesian people itself fiom
terrorist acts performed by irresponsible parties. For the future, the major measure o f the
government i s to increase the capacity to be more able to carry out prevention and action
against terrorism, increase operational activities o f intelligence and the police, including
increasing cooperation with friendly countries, since it i s a fact that terrorism currently has a
global network.

        Our intelligence and police continue to work to reveal the terrorism actions in the
Kuningan,JakartaareainSeptember2004 last. The ChiefofPolicehasreportedanumberof
progresses inthis effort. But the people o f Indonesia naturally hopes that the legal measures
on the terrorist can be carried out concretely and wisely. This is a challenge for our
Intelligence andPoliceduringthe first 100days.

        The solution o f the communal conflicts in Poso and Ambon also has priority. The
Intelligence, the Policeand the TNI, with the support o fthe generalpublic must reallybe able
to preventthe occurrence o fnew violence inPoso as well as inAmbon. The government also
has undertaken quick measures so that the horizontal conflict in Mamasa does not develop
further andapeaceful solution canbefound.

        As President, Ialso pay attention to the welfare of the soldiers and their families, the
same as my concem for teachers, civil officials, farmers, fishermen, laborers and other
weaker economy classes. The officers have a highassignment fiequency, amongst others the
assignment to Aceh, to Poso, to Ambon, to North Maluku, to Atambua, to Papua and other
assignments. The families left behindoften have problemso f life, such asjust enoughwages,
the costs needed to send their children to school, or costs for medical care. Not to mention



                                                58

when the soldiers are killed or injuredinaction, while we know that the insurance is not too
big. This needs serious thinking and efforts to improve their welfare. This is also applicable
to the Seroja widows who were left behindbytheir husbandswho were killedwhen inaction
inEastTimor. Inlinewiththe economic growthandthe increased staterevenues, weneedto
consider their improvedwelfare.

Dear brothers and compatriots,
        One o f the government's agendas is to enhance international cooperation to support
our national interests. In the era o f globalization and the continued development of
geopolitics and geo-economy, international cooperation i s a must. We want to continue to
develop a wide and constructive cooperation network, whether bilateral , multilateral or
regional. The ASEAN cooperation remains the major pillar. Other cooperations where we
play arole are the cooperation inthe frame o fAPEC, OKI andAsia-Africa.

        The extension of the cooperation agenda is being undertaken with Malaysia,
Singapore, Japan, the PRC, Australia, the USA and the Near East countries. At the least this
i s what the government i s doing during this first month. Inaccordance with my discussions
with the leaders o f said countries, within the period of 100 days it is expectedthat there will
be progress and more certain plans, involving the cooperation that we will increase, in
particular inthe economic field, including investment and trade. Ifeel there is a desire from
friendly countries to increasethis cooperation and therefore Iinvite everyone, including the
business community, not to neglect this opportunity andmomentum.

        Inmyjourneyhomefrom Cairo, Egypt,whereIattendedtheprocessionofPresident
Yaser Arafat's funeral, Ihad a meeting with the Indonesian Ambassadors for the Emirate
Arab union, for Iran, for Qatar and for Kuwait. Inthe 2-hours meeting inthe early morning,
which was also attended by the Chairman of MPR RI and the Speaker of the Indonesian
Parliament Iasked eacho f the Ambassadors to presentpossible opportunities for cooperation
withthe countries ofthe MiddleEast, inparticular inthe economic field. Istill see that there
are opportunities ifwe really endeavor this seriously.

Dear friends,
        What Iam presenting i s my report to the Indonesian people on what the government
has done during the first 30 days. Naturally the government cannot do everything. But it i s
clear that what the government does naturally has a clear direction and aim, settling the
problems that the Indonesian people will face in the next 5 years and then carry out the
redevelopment ofIndonesiatowards better conditions.

        Inclosing Iwish to underscore that "the spirit of change towards a better direction"
 continues to burn in the hearts of us all. Yet we must remember that these changes cannot
 only be desired or dreamt of. We must planthis "Change", we must reflect it inour political
behavior, we must practice it in our measures, and we must solder it firmly into our
 administration, andwe mustpreserve it in.the mediumterm andinthe long term.

 Thank you.
 Wassalamu'alaikum Wr.V%.

A.         GovernmentDebtManagement

           The level of government debt in Indonesia, while on a falling trend, is still highby
international comparison (Table 1). Also, the structure of the debt implies substantial risks. A
depreciation o f the Rupiahand/or an increaseindomestic short term interest rates will have a
substantial and immediate impact on the Government's budget.

           Efforts by the Government at formulating and communicating a credible debt
management strategy to market participants and continued responsible macro-economic
management would greatly contribute towards keeping risk spreads low and yield curves
relativelyflat.
                                                                     Table 1. Indonesia: CentralGovernmentDebt,BillionRupiah

External debt

             At the end of 2003, half of the government's debt was denominated in foreign
currency. A very high share of the external debt i s non-commercial, and the currency
 composition i s dominated by U S dollars and Japanese yen (Table 2). Most o f the external
 debt is long term, and a substantial part (around 70 per cent) has fixed interest rates,
 indicatingthat the mainrisk on the external debt is exchangerate risk.

 Domestic debt

                             The total domestic debt as o f end 2003 was Rp 624 trillion, with Rp 390 trillion o f
  this being in a tradable form. The Government has been making significant changes to the
  profile o f its tradable domestic debt over the last few years, to smoothen the maturity profile
  and lengthen the duration o f the debt (see Chart 1and Table 3), thereby reducing the risk to
  the government's budget.

                              Managing roZlover or refinancing risk has been the main objective for the
   management o f the domestic debt, and currently the focus is on how to further smooth the
   redemption profile to smoothen the hump in 2008 (Chart 1). It i s clear that the government
   has been successful inreducing rollover risk with the share of debt falling due within 1and 2
   years, being relatively low.

                               The risk indicators point in the direction that the main risk on the domestic debt is
    interest rate risk, Le., the risk that the cost o f the debt will increase due to an increase in
    market rates. With 60 per cent o f the debt having its interest rate re-set within 12 months, an
    increase inmarket rates will have immediate and substantial effect inthe form o f an increase
    inthe cost ofthe domestic debt. The mainreason for the highinterest rate riskis a highshare
    o fvariable rate debt that i s linked to the 3 month SBIrate.



                                                                                                                                                             61

Impact of theproposed DPL on the overall debt

        Government debt management i s centered on the trade-off between cost and risk.
From a pure risk perspective, a loan in domestic currency compared to a loan in foreign
currency i s attractive, as it will insulate the government's budget to changes in the loan
payments due to changes in the exchange rates. Similarly, a fixed rate loan i s attractive
compared to a variable rate loan, as changes inmarket interest rates will have no effect on the
loan payments, and therefore the government's budget. However, a low-risk choice typically
comes at the price o f higher cost. A loan in domestic currency under current market
conditions will come at a higher interest rate, and a fixed rate loan will normally have a
higher interest rate than a variable rate loan.

        The choice of structure for specific loans, and therefore eventually the overall risk
profile o f the debt, will depend on the strategy for government debt management. Taking into
account that the total central government debt i s approximately US$ 140billion, a US$ 300
million equivalent loan will only marginally change the overall risk profile o f the portfolio.
Furthermore, as Indonesia does not, at this time, have a comprehensive and formalized
strategy for debt management inplace, the choice o f loan structure should focus on the costs
with due account taken to current borrowingpractices, and at the same time ensure the future
flexibility o f changing the risk characteristics o f the loan to make sure that it fits into the
overall strategy for debt management.

        The Government has indicated that it would like the proposed DPL to be a US-dollar
denominated LIBOR-based variable spread loan. At prevailing rates, there is about a 250
basis point difference betweenthe interest rates on the Bank's proposed loan and the yield on
the 10-year Indonesian global bondissued inMarch 2004. (This does not account for the fact
that the maturity o f the Bank's loan i s twice the maturity of the global bond). Assuming that
the alternative to borrowing from the Bank i s to borrow from international capital markets,
this implies that, borrowing from the Bank would result in a saving in interest payment - at
prevailingrates-of about US$7.5 millionper year on a loanamount o fUS$300 million. This
wouldhelp reduce the debt burdeno fthe Government.

extreme shock scenario - up to a 30 per cent depreciation inthe exchange rate, a 250 basis
point rise ininterest rates, and slow down of GDP growth to 3 percent -the public debt ratio
would increaseby 10percentagepoints of GDP, but the debt ratios would still be sustainable,
andthe pathofconsolidation wouldbe expectedto continue.

        The assumptions underlyingthe analysis are that real GDP growth i s projectedto pick
up to between 5-6 percent during 2007-09, the investment ratio to increase by about ?4
percent of GDP annually, reaching 22 percent by 2009, export growth to gradually rise to
around 6 percent per annum, inflation to decline further to around 3 percent, the real
exchange rate i s to remain broadly stable at its present level, and real interest rates at
approximately 3 percent. Continued fiscal consolidation i s projected with primary surpluses
remaining intheir current range of around 2%percent of GDP under the baseline scenario -
implying a steady improvement inthe non-oil primary balance of about % percent of GDP
annually. In addition to the extreme shock scenario, the IMF report also identifies n
intermediate "muddle through" scenario with weaker output growth, lower improvements in
capital flows, and an overall weaker macroeconomic environment. The debt profile in this
altemate scenario i s also projectedto improveover the mediumterm.

A.     Fiduciary ChallengesinIndonesia

       Years o f rapid economic growth, economic and social gains and a stable political
environment had obscured the real situation in which aggregate fiscal discipline was weak,
resource allocation poor, public expenditure plagued by corruption and fiscal reporting
unreliable. The crisis exposed the weakness o f the New-Order style o f managing state
resources and forced the government - squeezed by high levels o f debt, an erosion o f
government revenue and a more unstable macroeconomic environment -to be more efficient
inits operations.

       The Government o f Indonesia (GOI) together with its development partners (World
Bank, JMF, andADB) haveconducted a series ofin-depth PFMdiagnostics, includingajoint
GOI-Bank-ADB Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Country
Procurement Assessment Review(CPAR), bothpublishedin2001lo.

       The analyses emphasizedthe following problem areas:
        The legal and institutional environment was outdated. Indonesia's management of
        government financial operations had been based on outdated laws.                      The legal
        framework from the colonial period - the 1925 Indische Comptabiliteitset Stbl -was
        complemented by a series of decrees which were not adequate in addressing the
       requirements o f modem public financial management. This PFM system allowed for
        systematic and pervasive corruption, collusion and nepotism                   o,       because
        assignments were unclear, transparency was low, and enforcement was poor.
        Fragmented and overlapping structures inthe MOF reflected the deficiencies o f PFM
        inIndonesia. The division of budgetingand treasury functions between a number of
        directorates and agencies made it difficult to assure aggregate fiscal discipline, to
        allocate resources efficiently andto report reliable fiscal data.
        The budget formulation process was opaque and inefficient. In the past, it was
        difficult to quantify basic components o f the budget, e.g. total public investment or
        sectoral allocations. This led to enormous inefficiencies because it was difficult to
        evaluate government programs. There have also been major gaps inbudget coverage
        owing to the prevalence of significant numbers o f off-budget funds. Finally, the
        budget framework was split: while the routine budget was prepared and managed by
        the MOF, the development budgetwas prepared and managedby the planningagency
        (BAPPENAS), although it included deliberation with the MOF.
        Budget execution was open delayed and monitoring arrangements were weak
        Currently, delays and inefficiencies in the treasury payment system raise the cost of
        suppliesto government andare the source of significant governance-relatedproblems.
        Inaddition, thehighlydetailednatureofthebudgetallocationsimpliestightcontrolin
        theory. However, in reality, the MOF was overburdened implementing the budget.

Annex for a compilation ofthe mainrecommendations andthe current status oftheir implementation.

       Spending units were - and still are - often unable to get full or timely access to their
       budget allocations during the course o f the budget year. When spending units do
       obtain their allocations, their management systems have been unable to disburse them
       with efficacy.
       Procurement processes were prone to corruption and collusion. Corrupt and
       collusive practices are deeply entrenched in public procurement. A multiplicity of
       legal instruments continues to regulate different aspects o f public procurement and
       limit competition. No single agency has a clear mandate for formulatingprocurement
       policy, monitoring compliance, and ensuring clear and enforceable sanctions. The
       lack of capacity in working level staff o f the tender committees makes them
       vulnerable to undue andimproper influence.
       Accounting and reporting were fragmented and not always reliable.               Several
       agencies within MOF are involved in financial accounting and reporting.
       Fragmentation has meant that none o f the systems are able to produce a reliable and
       reconcilable set o f accounts. The lack o f segregation o f key accounting duties in
       spendingunits, andlack of oversight ofthese functions either by spendingministryor
       MOF staff, is a serious weakness. The financial controllership functioni s non-existent
        at the spending ministry/agency level. Ex-post reviews o f payment orders are
       compliance-oriented, limited to checking arithmetical accuracy and sufficiency of
        supporting documentation. Treasury and cash management functions are not well
       coordinated: thousands o f bank accounts are maintained by spending units, many of
       which are unauthorized bank off-budget funds. There is a redundant and
       uncoordinated proliferation of stand-alone computerized government accounting
        systems.
        The mandates of government audit entities were not clearly      defined The internal
        and external audit bodies in Indonesia have been characterized by unclear roles,
       responsibilities, authority, funding, reporting, and accountability. Furthermore, the
       boundaries of responsibility between external and internal audit, between the BPK
        and BPKP, and the BPKP and the Inspectorate Generals respectively have not yet
        been clearly defined. These agencies are also under-resourced interms ofbudget, staff
        andfacilities.


B.      The ReformProcess

        Since 2002, the Government of Indonesia has made substantiveprogress inimproving
the institutional, legal and regulatory environment o f PFM. These improvements have been
part of a broader reform process, acceleratedby the implementation of the EPP (or "White
Paper"). A breakthrough has been achieved with the enactment o f the Laws on State
Finances, State Treasury and State Audit during 2003-2004. The implementing regulations
are currently being drafted. These laws create an adequate legal underpinning for
modernizing Indonesia's PFM systems and oversight, and provide the basis for anchoring
future reforms. Complementing these is the ongoing structural transformation o f the MOF
around its core functions - in particular those o f budget development and treasury
management-inlinewith good internationalpractice.




                                              65

        The new legal framework i s the culmination of many years o f hardtoil. InNovember
2001, the Financial Management Reform Committee (FMRC, Komite Penyempurnaan
Munujemen Keuangun) presented a first draft of a White Paper on PFM reform. This PFM
White Paperwas completedinMay2003 andoutlined atwintrack approach: first, improving
the legal and regulatory framework to sustain the government's fiscal position and build
public confidence; and second, investing inefficient andtransparent systems to manage these
functions andpromote accountability and integrity. The reform agenda outlined inthe White
Paper i s a critical component of the Government's long-term goal o f macroeconomic
stability. This was clearly evident with the inclusion of a number o f the White Paper's key
objectives inthe 2003 EPP.

        The State FinancesLaw (Law No.17/2003). The StateFinance Law, while at ahigh
level of generality, provides for the first time a modem and coherent framework for
Indonesia's PFM system, on which the reform agenda can build. It provides for such basic
components as developing a macro-economic and fiscal framework for the budget, the budget
cycle, the informationto bepresented to Parliament with the draft annual budget law, and the
reporting standards to be used inpreparingthe budget. The major changes currently being
implemented are the following:
        Integratingthe hitherto separatedevelopment androutine budgets;
        Introducinga formal economic and fiscal framework early inthe budgetprocess, to be
        consideredby Parliament andto guide the development o fthe detailed budget;
        Introducing a multi-year focus, through the development o f a MTEF, to ensure that
        the annualbudget is developed with considerationo fits impact on future years;
        Increasing the performance focus of the budget, through the development o f ministry
        and agency work plans and an overall government work plan setting out strategies,
        objectives and targets. Inthe past the budget dialogue has been largely a discussion
        about perceived needs for inputs (salaries, supplies etc) with little or no explicit focus
        onthe desired or expectedoutputs or outcomeso fthese expenditures;
        Improving budget classification by changing the sectoral classification of
        expenditures to accord with the functional classification in GFSM2001 and to amend
        the Budget Administration Code to align it with the GFS economic classification;
        Expandingthe scope o f the budget to include some o fthe significant off-budget fiscal
        activities. The HousingFundandthe Petroleum Account (both operatedby the MOF),
        and the on-lending operations o f the RDI(to state owned enterprises) and RDA (to
        sub-national governments), should be included in the regular budget reporting
        process.

        With these measures, the new State Finance Law will also improve fiscal
transparency. Budgetdocuments will become more comprehensive and informative. This will
include among others: (i) new economic and fiscal framework (including MTEF), (ii)
                           the
clearer expenditure classification, including the integration of routine and development
budgets, and (iii)  enhanced ex post fiscal reporting through the provision o f comprehensive
financial statement, including a balance sheet, cash flow statement and the budget execution
report to Parliament within six months ofthe end ofthe fiscal year.




                                              66

        Planning and budgeting functions have also been clarified. Recently promulgated
regulations operationalize the Law on State Finances. Planning and budgeting have been
integrated by formally linking ministerial work plans with budgets. The respective roles of
BAPPENAS andMOF inbudgetpreparationhave been clarified, with BAPPENAS assuming
full responsibility for the planning process (including preparation of the work plans) and
MOF havingthe leading role inthe formulation of the annual budget (see Figure 1).

                                                                 BAPPENAS    @y-

         A conceptual framework for gradual introduction of performance concepts in the
budgetprocess has been laid down, requestingministries to specify outputs and outcomes in
their work plans and report on their performance at the end o f the year. Fiscal discipline has
been enforced by imposing hard budget ceilings on ministries in the formulation of their
budget proposals. A "bottom-up" approach to budget preparation has been introduced:
spendingunits are requestedto fillinbudgetsubmission forms specifying their budgetbids at
the most detailed level of the functional, program and economic classification.

          State Development Planning System Law (Law No.25/2004).                   The State
Development Planning System (SPPN) Law now provides the legal basis for the national
developmentplanningprocess, linkingplanningwithbudgeting. There are anumber o fplans
outlined inthe law spanning a period of 20 years and each connecting up with one another: a
20 year longterm development plan; a 5 year mediumterm government development plan; a
5 year ministry medium term developmenthtrategic plan; an annual government work plan;
and an annual ministrywork plan.

          The longer term strategic vision of the government coincides well with the reform o f
Indonesia's planning and budgetingsystem. The State Finance Law (2003) and the Planning
Law (2004) now provide the legal basis for the public financial management and planning
respectively, with the MOF and BAPPENAS playing complementary roles. Both laws stress
the importance of linkingplanningwith budgeting. The PlanningLaw now also provides the
legal foundation for the Government's MediumTerm Development Plan(RPJM). The RPJM
i s intended to be an elaboration of the administration's five-year program. Following
Indonesia's first direct Presidential election, the first RPJM (scheduled to be finalized by
January 2005) is expected to reflect the priorities and platform of the new President and his

Cabinet. The FWJM is to set out the national development strategy, general policies and
programpriorities, andthe macroeconomic and fiscal framework.

        State Treasury Law (Law No.1/2004).                    The Law on State Treasury is the
cornerstone for modernizing the budget execution and resource management functions. The
MOF reorganization created a new DG Treasury by transfer of the treasury functions
previously handled at the DG Budget, DG Financial Institutions (DGFI), the Secretary
General, the State Financial Accountancy Agency (BAKUN), and the many field offices of
the DGBudget andBAKUNdelivering payment, verification, and accounting functions. The
treasury reforms are focused on ending the extensive proliferation o f independent bank
accounts, inefficient use onbankingintermediation for payment processes, andthe absence of
any strategy for making temporary cash surplus remunerative.                     The new Treasury law
provides an appropriate legal umbrella for moving forward. The regulations are under
process11.

        Central government accounting will be based on international standards. The
government is gradually movingtowards the introductiono f full accrual accounting standards
by 2008. Eleven government accounting standards regulating the preparation of government
financial reports on a modified accrual basis (budget implementation reports and cash flow
statements), including information on accounts payable and receivable were issued in
December 2003. The regulations also provide for the elaboration o f a government balance
sheet, albeit based on unverifiable information on line-Ministries' assets and liabilities. This
i s the work of the Government Accounting Standards Committee (Komite Standar Akuntasi
Pemerintah     - KSAP) established in 2002. The KSAP comprises representatives of all
stakeholders, including the accounting profession and the academic community.                           The
organizational structure and processes have been established to develop and review the
accounting standards.

         Procurement Decree (Keppres 80/2003)'2 introduces many improvements in the
procurement regime in Indonesia and lays out a timetable for establishing a policy
formulation and oversight agency by January 2005.                   An omnibus procurement law is
envisaged for consolidating, clarifying and simplifying the numerous procurement rules and
regulations.

         State Audit Law (Law No.15/2004). The State Audit Law lays out the broad legal
framework for BPK to operate as the country's SAI, as envisagedunder the Constitution. The
administrative aspects of its functioning, includingthe appointment andtenure o fBPK Board
members, are regulated by Law 15/1973. While the central issue of overlap of internal audit
function (between BPKP and others) has not been resolved, there i s repeatedreference to the
need for BPK to refer to the audit findings of Yntemal Comptrollers" o f the government and
also on the option to utilize resources from Internal Auditors/Comptrollers in carrying out
BPK'swork where they do not have sufficient resources.

''  Key regulations under the State Treasury Law include those on (i)     Accounting Standards; (ii)   Budget
Execution; (iii) Cash Management; (iv) Asset Management; (v) Debt Management; (vi) Financial and
Performance Reporting; (vii) Procurement; (viii) Special Purpose Agencies; and (ix) Internal Controls.

        The SA1now has a stronger mandate under the State Audit Law. It has independence
indeterminingthe scope of audits and can audit all government entities andoperations as it
deems appropriate. Inaddition, it now hasto disclose publicly all audit reports.

        MOF Reorganization. The organizational structure and responsibilities of the MOF
departments have been reformed by a series o f Presidential and Ministerial decrees signed
between May and June, 200413. The budget and treasury functions have been consolidated
and separated into distinct Directorates in line with international good practice. The checks
andbalancesintroduced by this separation of roles and functions increase accountability and
transparency, effective budgeting, debt management and financial reporting. The physical
movement of offices and personnel is to be completed at MOF headquarters in the regions
prior to the commencemento fthe 2005 budget year.

        The effects of the reorganization process will be visible throughout the country. The
MOF structure has been altered considerably to allow it to organize around the key functions
o f a modern ministry o f finance. The consolidation o f treasury functions within the DG
Treasury will see substantial rationalization o f relevant distributed services. Inparticular, the
regional accounting offices (KAR) and local verification offices (KASIPA) will be merged
into local M I L Sand KPPNs, which will now form part o f the DG Treasury. Local
payment offices will now take on an internal verification function, and be renamed KPPN.
The mainelements of the MOF-reorganization are shown inFigure2.




13 The organization and responsibilities o f the MOF departments have been reformed by three Presidential
Decrees signed on May 10, 2004: Decree #35 on MOF tasks and responsibilities; #36 on Echelon-I units of the
MOF; and# 36 on central andregional offices ofthe DGTreasury inthe MOF.

C.      MovingForward

        Although commendable progress has been made in PFM reform during the last
several years, an enormous agenda remains. The next phase in PFM reforms will require
equally undivided attention. Key measures o f the upcoming reform agenda include: (i)
effective and monitorable implementation o f recent laws and corresponding regulations; (ii)
establishment o f an integrated financial management information system including, as a first
step, an automated State Treasury and Budget System (Sistem Perbendaharaan dan
Anggaran Negara - SPAN); (iii) progressive consolidation o f government bank accounts
                                       the
into a TSA located in the        BI14;(iv)   adoption o f Government Accounting Standards; (v)
establishment o f a National Public Procurement Office ("PO);               and (vi) strengtheningBPK
capacity and removing functional overlaps between internal audit entities. Together these
could constitute the basis for processes and practices which could facilitate efficiency,
transparency, and accountability.

         A modernized State Treasury and Budget System (SPAN) would be the central
element o f fmancial management and accounting operations inIndonesia. The SPAN will:
    0    Include core hctional requirements for the execution components o f government
         budget through an integrated accounting system. In general, this would include
         recording o f revenue collections, appropriations, commitments, verifications, and


l4 The treasury operates about 60 bank accounts at BI headquarters. As a first step, the balances in these
accounts will be consolidated for investment pufposes. This can be done by either converting these accounts
into TSA sub-accounts with provision for daily sweeping o f the balances into TSA, or closing these accounts
and replacing them by ledger accounts at the treasury, so that their separate identity can be maintained, if
required.

        fund allocations leading to payment (covering accounts payable, accounts receivable,
        general ledger operations, and report generation);
        Record and process all state budget transactions and incorporate aggregate data from
        other elementso f general government as rapidly as possible;
        Record all relevant stages of the payments and receipts processes and enable reports
        to be made on key variables, such as commitments, funds available, bills outstanding
        andpayments andreceipts (both cash andaccruals basis); for individualagencies and
         at various levels o f aggregation;
        Incorporate controls on any specified variables as necessary, for instance to ensure
        that commitments do not exceedavailable funds;
         Generate standard monthly reports and provide query facilities to determine the
        budgetary position of agencies, the statebudget andthe general government budget;
         Maintain data according to the budget classification for as many past years as
         required, andallow projections o fup to three years;
         Facilitate reconciliation between treasury system accounts and banking data by
         generating chronological lists o f transactions ina form comparable to those generated
         bythe banks; and
         Ensure compatibility o f the system with other systems, such as those for tax and
         customs administrations. The treasury system will also support the budget preparation
         process.

         To support these reforms, the Government o f Indonesia has preparedtwo projects: the
World Bank-financed GFMRAPl' and the ADB-financed State Audit Reform (STAR)
Program. The GO1believes that both projects will support the implementation of the overall
reformprogram, and eliminate overlap andduplication between donor-financed programs and
projects.

         The GFMRAP is envisaged by the MOF as the umbrella for sequencing PFM and
revenue administration reforms, and for donor coordination".                   GFMRAP-I (2004-2008)
focuses on improving PFM. It supports strengthening policy capacity in the MOF and
Bappenas, budget policy and formulation,                  budget implementation and treasury
modemization, public procurement reform, and implementation o f public sector accounting
standards. It also pilots activities supportive of revenue administration reforms (such as the
establishment o f an investigations unit and making the Tax Court more transparent and
efficient), and strengthening o f legislative oversight o f budget formulation and execution.
GFMRAP-11(2007-2010) is envisagedto strengthenthe tax and Customs administration and
trade facilitation, and improve integrity, transparency and accountability systems in tax and
customs. It will also address PFM issues such as SPAN extension and further strengthening



l5The World Bank and the IMF, at the Government's request, have jointly assisted the Government to prepare
the project. The GFMRAPbuilds on several years of analytical work by all three partners.
IdIn  designing and implementing the overall reform program, the GO1has been receiving technical support
frommultilateral partners such as the AsianDevelopment Bank (ADB), the IMF,the UNDP, UNCTAD andthe
World Bank, and from bilateral partners such as the Australian Aid Agency (AusAid), the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA), the European Union (EU), GTZ and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID).

legislative oversight capacity. GFMRAP-I11(2009-2012) may likely address residual PFM
andrevenue administration issues.

        The ADB-financed STAR Program aims to strengthen the legal and institutional
framework for internal and extemal audit inIndonesia. It provides support for strengthening
the SAI, as well as for clarifylng internal and external audit roles and responsibilities,
strengthening audit capacity andinfrastructure.

reforms to be addressedbythis first andsubsequentDPLs.

                                     November 19,2004

        This note provides the IMF staffs current assessment of Indonesia's macroeconomic
conditions and outlook for the coming period, ahead o f the staffs next Post-Program
Monitoringmissionto JakartainearlyDecember.

EconomicConditions

        Real GDP growth in the 4%-5 percent range is expected for 2004, driven mainly by
consumption, although investment andnon-oil exports show some signs ofrecovery. Following
a pickup in April-July, inflation has edged back down, to 6.2 percent (year-on-year) by
October, with the swings in inflation mainly reflecting an unusual pattem in food prices and
fluctuations inthe rupiah.

        Financial markets have strengthened since mid-year, driven initially by increasing
prospects of a peaceful election, and more recently by an overall positive reaction to the
election outcome. The exchange rate has recovered from its lows inearly June andi s currently
trading at aroundRp 9,000 per U.S. dollar. The stock markethas recently reachednew highs.

        Data through October are consistentwith an annual2004 fiscal deficit o f 1?4percent of
GDP, down from 2% percent last year. In recent months, non-oil revenue performance has
improved, and so have oil revenues, the latter reflecting high oil prices. At the same time,
spending has also accelerated, including both payments of fuel subsidies and development
expenditures.

        With regard to monetary policy, Bank Indonesia, in response to exchange market
pressures that reflected concems about political uncertainty and higher global interest rates, as
well as some concems about the inflation outlook, raisedreserve requirements inJuly. At the
sametime, BImanagedliquidityindomestic money marketsto prevent short-term interest rates
fiom continuing to decline. However, base money growth remains strong and credit to the
private sector, especially consumer loans, haspickedup.

         Further progress has been made toward a sound banking system, and with the
completion o f the sale of Bank Permata, all banks taken over during the crisis have been
returned to private ownership. The passage of the deposit insurance law sets the stage for
gradual phase out o f the blanket guarantee scheme. However, high ratios of compromised
assets andlow liquidityratios at statebanks still posea significant risk.

         The balance of payments position remains sound. Despite a surge in imports of raw
materials and capital goods, Indonesia continues to enjoy trade surpluses reflecting high oil
prices and a recent upturn in non-oil exports. Intemational reserves, at some US$35 billion,
remain comfortable at 150percento fshort-term debt.




                                               76

        In September/October, the outgoing government passed several laws that were
outstanding from its White Paper. The law establishing the Judicial Commission and
amendments to the Bankruptcy Law address some key concems about the investment climate.
However, the social security bill leaves the actual content of reforms vague and could
potentially create unfimded liabilities, while the laws on decentralization, state finances,
auditing andTreasury all require implementingregulationsto becomeeffective.

Outlook and Policy Challenges

        The outlook will dependimportantly on policy choices that the new government makes
in formulating its economic program. In this context, a preliminary assessment of the
government's 100-dayplanannouncedon November 17indicates that the underlying economic
strategy is aimed at improving the investment climate, reducing corruption, improving
infrastructure, all within the framework of a stable macroeconomic environment. However,
several measures need better specification while others could have fiscal implications.
Discussions with the authorities in the context of the Fund PPM mission will provide an
opportunity to discuss this planandform abetter assessment.

        Having said that, the government's stated objective to maintain macroeconomic
stability, including only a limited revision o f the deficit to accommodate its objectives are
welcome. Successll implementationof a policy package that maintains the current positive
market sentiment by signaling commitment to macroeconomic stability and strengthened
structural reforms to improve the investment climate, could help generate high growth rates,
andreducefurther unemployment andpoverty.

Status of IMFRelations

    0    Indonesia's Extended Arrangement with the Fundended inDecember 2003. The Fund
         remains engaged in a close policy dialogue with the authorities through post-program

                                  Indonesia: Assessment Letter (Update)

    This note updates the IMFAssessmentLetter dated November 19,2004.The update is based on
    the findingsof the IMF staff mission to Indonesiaduring December 1-9.

    Economic developments remain favorable.Fund staffestimatesindicate that realGDP growth
    could reach 5 percent this year, withend-yearinflationnow projected at 6 percent. Financial
    markets have remained strong, with the stock marketcontinuing to reach new highs. However,
    the budget deficit for the year is now expectedto be somewhathigher than targeted, due to lower
    income tax collections and higher fuel subsidiesand shortfallsin profittransfersfrom Pertamina
    (state-ownedoil company) as a result of higher oil prices.On the externalfront, despite a surge
    in imports, the current account is expectedto register a surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP in 2004,
    reflecting strong export growth. Internationalreserves have edged up to about US$36 billion and
    remain comfortable at 150percent of short-term debt.

    The mission was encouraged by the new government'sdeterminationto build on the progressso
    far, including its emphasis on maintainingmacroeconomic stability and moving ahead forcefully
    with structuralreforms to improve the investment climate.

    With sound economic policies, the outlook is promising. Growthis projected at 5.5 percent and
    inflation to remain in the 6 percent range.The authoritiesintend to pursue further fiscal
    consolidation, and aim to limit the budget deficitto about 1 percent of GDP in 2005. The
    governmentis moving to improve the business climate,includingby resolving some long-
    standing investor disputes, taking visible actions to addresscorruption, and improvingthe
    flexibilityof the labor market.

    Nevertheless,risks remain. The government'sintentionto provide a tax amnestycould result in
    revenue losses if not complementedby appropriate measures toenhance tax compliance.The
    governmentalso faces the politically difficult decision of eliminatingfuel subsidies,which will
    be important to make room for spendingin high-priorityareas such as infrastructure.Asset
    quality at state banks remains weak and governance, includinginternal controls and risk
    management,needs to be further improved.Finally, early and demonstrableactions to address
    corruption and improve governance in the publicsector (includingin tax administration),and to
    strengthenthejudicial and regulatory systemto ensure creditorrights and sanctityof contracts,
    will be key to attracting investment and generating growth andemployment.
