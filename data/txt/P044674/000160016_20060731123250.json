sustainable, and has a modest institutional development\n            impact. The performances of both the Bank and the Borrower\n            are satisfactory. The lessons cited addressed issues of\n            design and implementation, the management of multi-sector\n            operations and donor coordination, sector-supporting\n            strategies and actions, and the needs of the poor and\n            gender. Specific lessons included: 1) the need for projects\n            operating in post-conflict countries to build in flexibility\n            with fungible resources, accessed based on justification, to\n            be able to address unforeseeable needs and conditions\n            adequately, as they occur during implementation; 2) giving\n            consideration to separating fast implementing and disbursing\n            interventions for restoration of livelihoods and to address\n            emergency needs, from interventions that may tend to take\n            longer and have a longer-term development impact. 3) the\n            importance of access to markets and services for any\n            economic and social recovery process; 4) mainstreaming\n            project component implementation and incorporating component\n            design into the agency's strategic plan in order to\n            facilitate internalization and enhance ownership and\n            sustainability; 5) having smaller and more focused projects\n            that involve fewer implementing agencies; 6) harmonizing\n            procedures using the same manual of procurement as\n            reference, and with central financial management using one\n            MIS and with general management under one responsible\n            entity; 7) the need to consult with beneficiaries in\n            identifying and finalizing needs and areas of support in\n            order to start-up and implement activities; 8) providing\n            minimal support to displaced families as an incentive for\n            returning to villages; 9) adopting design and build options\n            for implementing emergency road infrastructure improvements;\n            10) ensuring that emergency operations that target the\n            private sector include interventions and monitoring\n            indicators that address immediate needs for jumpstarting the\n            private sector's contribution to the economy, and also\n            build sustainability into project design by targeting\n            export-oriented activities; 11) narrower targeting of\n            criteria embracing the poor in particular, such as increased\n            employment or income, to better focus assistance; and 12)\n            targeting the needs of the female members of the communities."}, "docdt": "2006-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
