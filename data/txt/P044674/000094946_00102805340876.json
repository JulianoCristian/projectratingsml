implementation of five sub-components: agriculture,\n            infrastructure rehabilitation; private sector\n            reconstruction, social protection, and, balance of payments.\n            The main expected benefit is to mitigate the consequences of\n            the ongoing humanitarian crisis, by providing assistance to\n            displaced people, through agricultural inputs, grants for\n            reconstruction of destroyed housing, and micro-finance. In\n            addition, the project will lay the basis for long term\n            recovery, by rehabilitating key infrastructure, initiate\n            economic growth, and restore macroeconomic stability.\n            Nonetheless, the risk of resumption of hostilities with\n            Ethiopia still exist. Retroactive financing has been\n            approved for the project, for expenditures made after June\n            1st, 2000, and, full disbursement is expected by December 2002."}, "docdt": "2000-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
