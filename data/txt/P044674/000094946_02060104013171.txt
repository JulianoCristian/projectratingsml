ANNEX I
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Scope of Services
The environmental analysis will be in which fully reviews the three areas of
concem identified during project preparation.
Agriculture coniponent and the use of pesticides
The Environmental Analysis will: (i) identify the potential issues associated
with the use of pesticides through the project, (ii) identify the potential issues
associated with procurement and management of these pesticides, relative to
the GOE and the IDA safeguard policies, and (iii) propose mitigating,
monitoring and capacity building measures relative to these potential issues,
including altemative to the proposed uses, such as Integrated Pest
Management (IPM).
The Analysis wilh regard to the use of pesticides should be carried out in a
manner which complies with the recently adopted Eritrean National
Environmental P'rocedures and Guidelines; and with the World Bank
Operational Policy 4.09-Pest Management, which describes one of the 10
safeguard policies of the World Bank Group. It is anticipated that the
Environmental Analysis will be carried out in a manner which satisfies both
Eritrean and IDA requirements.
The Environmental Analysis will specifically;
*  Identify the types, qualities and quantities of pesticides current y
in use, and proposed to be used by the project
*  Assess their likely environmental impact, given the nature of their
use and the users proposed;
*  Reviewv the current literature on the likely environmental, health,
and others social impacts of the pesticides currently in use, and
proposed to be used in the project;
*  Summarize   of National and   IDA   legal and  regulatory
requirements regarding pesticide use, and how these should be
addressed during project implementation;
* Identify and analyze alternatives to the pesticides currently in use
or proposed in the project, including a list and analysis of the most
recent findings on safe pesticides and chemicals (within the latter,
particularly for net impregnation) as discussed in the POPs and
GCDPP meetings in respectively Bonn and Geneva; evaluate
associated costs, benefits, readiness/reliability, and the overall
feasibility of their use in Eritrea.



Prepare a Pesticide Management Plan with activities, timetable,
responsible parties, and qualitative benefits, with a particular
focus on improving the scope for Integrated Pest Management.
The Pesticide Management Plan will be prepared in accordance with GOEs
National Environmental Procedure Guidelines; and with World Bank
Operational Policy 4.09-Pest Management. The Plan will address, among
other things, the issues raised in the Environmental Evaluation Questionnaire
(Project type 3.4c) prepared by the Ministry of Land, Water and Environment
0htt:Haf.worldbank.org/er/environnent/) and other guidelines which may be
available. The Plan will include: (i) a list of alternative pest control chemicals
and techniques that could reduce the use of pesticides in Eritrea; (ii) a list of
mitigating and monitoring measures to be supported by the project, and (iii) a
costed proposal for building the necessary institutional, human and technical
capacities to deal with pesticides, as related to project implementation, in the
implementing agency, as well as in any other applicable Government agency
or ministry.
Finally, although it is very unlikely that they should be an issue, the
Environmental Analysis will exarnine the potential relevance of the World
Bank's OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats) and OP 4.36 (Forestry) in the even that
the project might result in an expansion of agriculture into previously
unfarmed areas.
Impact of Housing Program
The Environmental Analysis will review proposals to be financed by the
project with respect to the construction of new housing, wvith a view to
assessing likely negative environmental impacts on tree cover associated
with, but not limited to,
The impact of increased settlement densities on wood fuel use in
project areas;
The impact of new construction on forest cover;
Plans for mitigating these impacts through, for exarnple, the use of
alternative fuels and cooking strategies; and low-wood using
building technologies.
The Analysis will review the state of knowledge with regard to low-cost
building technologies in Eritrea, and will assess the trade-offs between
providing subsidized building supplies, or cash grants for construction.
Private Sector Development
The Private Sector Development component has been designecl to finance a
range ol subprojects, and as such, has the characteristics of a Financial
Intermediary type of project. Before approving a subproject, the Fl verifies
(through its own staff, outside experts, or existing environmental institutions)
that the subproject meets the environmental requirements of appropriate
national and local authorities and is consistent with OP 4.01 and other
2



applicable environmental policies of the Bank. Procedures for carrying out
subproject specil'ic environmental screening and assessment were developed
during preparation of an earlier operation, and it is expected that these
procedures, which rely on carryout environmental analyses for subprojects,
will be followed.
The Environmental Analysis will review these procedures with regard to the
adequacy of Eritrea's environmental requirements relevant to the component
and the proposed EA 'arrangements for subprojects, including the
mechanisms and responsibilities for environmental screening and review of
EA results. The Analysis should include an assessment of the institutional
mechanisms (inc'luding, as necessary, identification of measures to strengthen
capacity) for the subproject EA work. The Analysis should include a plan for
ensuring that subprojects are adequately reviewed.
