environmental assessment focuses on\n            three main components of the Emergency Reconstruction\n            Program Project: agriculture and the use of pesticides;\n            housing program; and, private sector development. Potential\n            environmental impacts, and the appropriate mitigation\n            measures are: 1) provision of agricultural inputs, includes\n            activities such as farm machinery for land preparation,\n            pesticides and fertilizers, seeds, animal restocking, and\n            water pumps for irrigation. While these activities will prod\n            agricultural production, improper land management and\n            pesticide uses, may induce declining crop yields, and soil\n            fertility, and erosion, as well as genetic mutation in\n            animals, and cancer, and other health issues on humans. Thus\n            it is recommended to eliminate the use of chlorinated\n            hydrocarbons in pesticides; avoid excessive fertilizer uses\n            to minimize soil erosion, and water contamination; avoid\n            importation of plant seed varieties, and animal breeds to\n            preserve the local genetic pool, and, select the appropriate\n            machinery per soil type, avoiding arid/fragile lands; 2)\n            housing construction, and fuel wood collection inevitably\n            causes land degradation and soil erosion; therefore, the use\n            of corrugated iron sheet roofs, and masonry walls is\n            suggested, as is the approach to village forest plantation\n            programs, to re-vegetate, and maximize the efficient use of\n            fuel wood, since it can not be avoided; and, 3) support for\n            enterprise development, predominantly for micro, and small\n            enterprises, hence no major environmental adversity is\n            foreseen; however, institutional mechanisms should enforce\n            environmental regulations, i.e., through the Department of\n            the Environment."}, "docdt": "2001-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
