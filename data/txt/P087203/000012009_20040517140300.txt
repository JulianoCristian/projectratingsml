1 Introduction


             The National Power Authority is committed to the construction of the

             Power Line in Freetown with the collaboration of the World Bank, they

             engaged a Canadian consultant to prepare this RAP. Together with the

             team of NPA staff and 16 national surveyors the preliminary census was

             undertaken and the corresponding data base prepared. On the basis of

             this information an analysis was made which has resulted in the

             preparation of a detail Resettlement Action Plan.


             In the following sections the RAP has been structured according to the

             Appendix A of the World Bank's Operational Policy.


2 Scope of work


             The Power and Water Project is a project of the Government of Sierra

             Leone and its National Power Authority (NPA). The power component

             includes the improvement of electricity supply in the Western Area. The

             rehabilitation of power lines required for the expansion of the Western

             Area Supply and Distribution Network will affect the population living

             under the transmission and distribution lines. This Resettlement Action

             Plan addresses this aspect of the Project and it will mitigate the loss

             encountered by that population. During the operational phase of the

             project those lines will provide reliable transmission of electricity to

             Freetown's customers at an economical cost and with a high level of

             efficiency for domestic use as well as for other sectors such as

              commercial      and   transformation.   It  will  also  support economic

              development in an environmentally sustainable way.


              To achieve this Project, the Government of Sierra Leone has secured

              credits from National and International sources among which is the

              World Bank. The loan from the World Bank for such a project is subject

              to the approval of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). This Plan must

              meet the World Bank requirements defined in the document OP 4.12 on

              Involuntary Resettlement. This document is attached as Appendix 1


3 Description of the project


              The power component of the Power and Water Project will rehabilitate

              and reinforce a 161 kV transmission line to carry electricity to Freetown

              and other major cities; a 33 kV distribution system in Freetown and two

              diesel generator facilities to supply electricity during high demand

              periods.


              This portion of the Power and Water Project concerns the rehabilitation

              of facilities in the Western Area of the City of Freetown.


               It is important to underline that this project was planned and partly

              implemented (40%) prior to the escalation of the war in Sierra Leone.


              The towers in the sector concern by this RAP are in most cases (80%)

              erected and some portion of lines are already installed. Some damages

              were made to the lines and will have to be restored. Certain numbers of

              towers are to be erected, rehabilitated or completed.


              The war affected nearly every individual as well as public and private

              institutions. Among these, NPA suffered much loss and damage on its

              equipments and material which included newly installed power lines and

              towers.

RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN (RAP)                                         Power & Water Project
33 kV and 161 kV transmission line                                                 P087203
Sierra Leone




            Settlers establish themselves on public property and constructed houses,

            shacks beneath and along side the electrical towers and lines. This

            settlement under the lines was an expedient solution that was tolerated

            for humanitarian concerns by all parties (Government, NPA, NGOs, UN

            Organizations in Sierra Leone). The displaced persons received support

            from the international community, which included supply of food, plastic

            sheeting, cement for construction, installation of water lines etc. Much of

            this was supplied by UNHCR, International Committee of the Red Cross

            and other International and National NGO's. Obvious signs of this

            support can still be observed along most of the power lines.


4     Potential impact


            The route of the two power lines was designed in 1997, and efforts were

            made then to minimize negative impacts on the population. When

            approximately half the construction was completed everything had to be

            stopped because of the war. Since no power was running in the lines

            people established themselves on the ROW. Completion and operation of

            the lines will oblige people in the ROW to relocate. In the case of the 33

            kV line the ROW is 10 m wide and 153 household and 1144 individuals

            will be affected along the 9.2 km of the ROW. In the case of the 161 kV

            line, the ROW is 30 m wide and 115 households will be affected including

            1574 persons over the 3 km of line. In this last section, the NPA is

            considering other alternatives to reduce the impact on the displaced

            population.


5     Objective of resettlement program


            The NPA will implement the work on the improvement of the supply of

            electrical power to Freetown. The implementation of such a Project has

            to be done without putting undue pressure on the population directly

            affected by the power lines. This resettlement program attempts to

            mitigate the negative impact of such land reacquisition. Persons affected

            by this Hydro Power Project should be assisted in their efforts to improve

            their livelihoods and standard of living. The results of the resettlement

            should restore the living standards to pre-Project levels or at least to

            levels prevailing prior to the beginning of the Project implementation,

            whichever is more advantageous to the population.


6     Socioeconomic studies


            The Socio-economic Survey was done during the same period as the

            evaluation of all assets within the ROW. The survey had several primary

            objectives:


                §    To inform the affected population about the Electrical Power
                      Project
                §    To obtain feedback from the affected population about the
                      Project
                §    To establish a social profile of the affected population
                §    To identify the affected households and individuals
                §    To identify vulnerable individuals or groups
                §    To record the base line situation of all affected people
                §    To record all assets and impacts within the ROW



            Consultation took place at 3 levels: National, local and household level.


            Affected persons and their representatives have been informed of the

            project and about the process leading from census to construction of

            new homes, compensation and physical relocation. Consultation has

            allowed the avoidance of sensitive sites.




         § The number of PAP is:

            161 KV:               115 households        1574 individuals
            33 KV:                153 households        1144 individuals
            Total                 268                   2718


         § Almost all of the structures are used for residential purposes. Sometimes

            during the day some are used for commercial purposes (restaurant or

            shop) but are transformed into sleeping places for the night

         § Among the households to be relocated, it is estimated that only 50% will

            require the Program to physically resettle them. The other 50% will

            require cash compensation and will accept to proceed on their own to a

            relocation of their choice, independent of the program (20% inland, 30%

            elsewhere in Freetown). More accurate information will be provided by

            the household members throughout the RAP implementation process.


         § The value of reconstruction of residential affected structures is based on

            the total of square meter of construction to be relocated or compensated

            (Valuation methods- Chapter 9):

         § The estimated value of land surface is based on $20 per square meter:

            161 kV                       31 538 m2 x 20$ =            630 760$
            33 kV                        17 459 m2 x 20$ =            349 180$

Sierra Leone




            stipulated in its Operational Policy (OP 4.12) titled "Involuntary

            Resettlement" and dated December 2001. This document has been

            provided to the RAP preparation team by the Africa Environment & Social

            Development Unit of the World Bank.


            This RAP complies with national requirement: The Constitution, the

            National Power Authority Act, and the Public Land Act are the national

            laws applicable to this power line rehabilitation Project. The RAP

            component of the Project is to acquire land or reacquire the NPA land for

            the public interest. In full respect of the law, it is technically feasible to

            acquire or reacquire in a compulsory way, the land required for this

            Project. However the Law requires that land acquisition should be

            acquired by private treaty or agreement in the Western area and that

            expenses and compensation shall be paid by the Authority. On demand,

            a reasonable payment can be made by the Authority to cover expenses

            resulting in loss due public needs. Specifically concerning the 161 kV line

            ROW, the law gives larger land acquisition power to the public agency.


            Overall, the World Bank requirements are more favorable to Project

            Affected People than the applicable National Laws. For this RAP and its

            implementation, the World Bank policies take precedence and in this

            case, WB policies will be the guiding principles.




8     Institutional Framework

            National Power Authority is the sponsor of the Project and is responsible

            for the implementation of this Resettlement Action Plan. The NPA has

            developed contractual relation with an independent consultant team of

            16 members who is in charge of preparing the resettlement and

            compensation action plan for this Project. The NPA will contract some or

            all members of the present team to implement this RAP. This team has

            already carried out the census exercise and therefore has a good

            knowledge of the affected people and area. The team will be completed

            with 4 new members. It includes community liaison officer, traditional &

            cultural specialist, legal expert, land surveyor, civil engineer, data

Sierra Leone




9     Eligibility


             Project Affected People (PAP) are all persons who lose assets or lose the

             use of assets as a result of the Project, whatever the extent of the loss.

             Loss of assets may be loss of land rights or land use, structures, crops,

             or a combination of these. Not all PAP have to relocate as a result of the

             Project as in some cases only a narrow strip of the concerned asset will

             be encumbered. In these cases they will receive cash compensation for

             their loss.


             Eligibility to resettlement and compensation is based upon the census

             mentioned above. Any household who has been identified in the field at

             the census stage as having interests affected by the Project is eligible to

             resettlement and compensation packages proportionate to the level of

             impact. All types of land rights give eligibility to compensation and/or

             resettlement whatever the land tenure regime (formal or customary,

             ownership or tenancy etc...)



10      Valuation methods



             The general amount per square meter of floor space for a permanent

             structure is estimated to be 250,000 Leones or 100 US$. This figure

             comes from international organizations involved in the reconstruction

             process in Sierra Leone between 2002-2004 and was confirmed by

             national evaluator services of the Ministry of Land.


             The value of land in Freetown can be estimated at $20 per square meter

             in the zone where the Project is located. Since in most of the cases, the

             concerned land users are not titled land owners, they will not receive

             this amount. They will be compensated for the added value of the land

             they were using. The average estimated value is $2 per square meter.

             Also, new land (equivalent to the previous) is provided with property

             titles, it will be offered as in-kind compensation.

11      Resettlement method and package



            The construction of a replacement house will be offered wherever the

            existing building has to be removed. This may be either on the

            remaining part of the plot if it is viable (10% for 161 kV 6% for 33 kV)

            and the affected household agrees to such a solution, or on another

            resettlement plot of its choice. Resettlement houses will be improved

            compared to the original ones, and as a minimum it will feature among

            other improvements, a corrugated iron or zinc galvanized roof, a

            concrete floor and foundation, and a ventilated latrine pit or an

            appropriate sewage system for latrines. Structures will be made of:



                §    Cement block with proper concrete lintel
                §    Or Stabilized laterite block type "interlocked" (10% cement)
                §    Or material of higher quality than the ones found on the
                      structures prior to the relocation.


            Replacement land will be offered in cases where the surface outside of

            the ROW and setback tolerances, is not viable. Replacement land will be

            at least equivalent in surface and in potential to the former one. The

            household will be consulted on the location and characteristics of this

            land. Secure and legal land titles will be given to all re-settled families.

            Furthermore, the new resettlement sites will not incur higher

            transportation cost to go to work or to the market place.


            Cash or in-kind compensation will be offered against encumbered or

            acquired asset where the remaining assets are economically viable and

            building has to be totally demolished.


            Consultation with the affected persons at the household level will ensure

            that the final compensation / resettlement package is appropriate for the

            affected household needs and expectations. Consent of spouse and

            children will be complied with wherever applicable.

Sierra Leone




            As this is a linear Project with little impact on communities as such, no

            group resettlement are expected. Resettlement land site will be

            identified by the NPA in the neighborhood of the affected household or at

            another site of choice. For this reason no significant impact on "host

            communities is expected.


            Applicable Sierra Leone compensation rates will be used as the basis for

            the calculation of compensation. Wherever there is a difference between

            Sierra Leone rates and WB guidelines, an adjustment will be made and

            applied to meet WB requirements as per the Operational Policies (OP

            4.12)



12      Resettlement site



            The choice of resettlement sites is determined by mutual consent

            between the NPA and the household owner. It is estimated that 50% of

            the households will decide to ask for cash compensation and relocate in

            other area without the program support. Since in-kind compensation for

            relocation is a priority, the implementation team will analyze the

            compensation request of each affected person to assist them in their

            relocation and to ensure that they are relocated wherever they chose

            with housing land title and economic activity, to the level of their

            compensation. For the remaining 50%, where possible the relocation will

            be in the same area of town. For the 33 KV ROW it will be a case-by-

            case decision of the household along the 9.2 km of the line. For the 161

            kV ROW, the concentration of affected household in a small area will

            require one or 2 construction Projects on the side of Congo River.




13      House construction



            Construction will be done by the individual owner or by a contractor and

            this will be identified at the beginning of the implementation stage. The

            type and quality of houses will be better then the one previously used.

Sierra Leone




            Technical advice will be provided to each household and plans will be

            prepared in consultation between the beneficiary of the compensation

            and the engineer of the implementation team. The plans will comply with

            the World Bank policy described in OP 4.12


            Un-employment is a constant problem in Sierra Leone. Many structures

            if not the large majority are built by the individual owner in Freetown. If

            for any reason the beneficiary of the relocation is not capable to do the

            construction he will find in is family or among his neighbors the workers

            to build his house. The compensation budget for each household will

            likely be better used by the new land owners investing for themselves

            than by any construction contractor. Distribution of the compensation

            will generally advance more smoothly if the relocated individual takes a

            direct and leading part in their own reconstruction project. This way of

            proceeding will create income within the family members instead of

            benefiting a contractor who is not related to the affected people. The

            budget for the reconstruction will remain the same but will benefit more

            directly the affected people.



14    Environmental issues on resettlement site


            For the resettled household of the 33 kV ROW, the low population

            density along most of the line will allow each reconstruction to respect

            the urban environment of resettlement (Note: This refers to the size of

            plot, stability of soil, surface water drainage, sewage system, in & out

            access, minimal bush cutting and natural effects, neighborhood and

            general social acceptance of the construction.) On the case of 161 kV

            ROW PAP, the population density will require the construction of a larger

            number of individual houses will require a specific environmental

            assessment. Such a construction would be erected on a riverside and soil

            studies will be required. The resettled families will need to be protected

            from possible flooding. However, It is likely that resettlement for the 161

            kV ROW will not be implemented due to redesign of the route

            higher than 1.8m; no construction other then fences; permanent access

            given to the NPA for maintenance or construction.



15    Community participation


            The implementation team will encourage affected persons to take an

            owner is incorporated in the valuation file and will be available to local

            during the compensation/resettlement process, the potential heirs are

            already known through the survey. As well, reference to the Land Act

            and come to an applicable mutual solution to the problem without having

            recourse to the Court.


            In the case of persistent disputes concerning the amount of

            compensation or of the persons entitled to any form of compensation,

            the case may be brought to the Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in the

            place were the land is situated. If it cannot be resoved in this instance,

            the case can be brought through the justice system up to the High Court

19    Implementation time frame


            It is planed that the implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan will

            need about 8 months for the bulk of the plan. No construction work will

            take place where the implementation of the compensation and/or

            resettlement measures is not completed. A conservative estimate of

            consultation and preparation time requirements is taken into account in

            the schedule.


20    Budget


            The total cost of the RAP is estimated at this interim stage at 5,500,000

            $USD. This includes approximately 55% for the 161 kV ROW and 45%

            for the 33 kV ROW. This amount has been incorporates the cost of

            compensation and resettlement for all affected people of all categories,

            together with cost of the implementation organization, monitoring,

            evaluation and assistance to vulnerable people. An additional 10% is

1. INTRODUCTION


    The National Power Authority is committed to the construction of the Power Line in

    Freetown with the financing from of the World Bank, they engaged a Canadian

    consultant to prepare this RAP. Together with the team of NPA staff and 16 national

    surveyors the preliminary census was undertaken and the corresponding data base

    prepared. On the basis of this information an analysis was made which has resulted in

    the preparation of a detail Resettlement Action Plan.


    In the following sections the RAP has been structured according to the Appendix A of

    the World Bank's Operational Policy.




2. SCOPE OF WORK


    The power component of the Power and Water Project is part of a Project of the

    Government of Sierra Leone and the National Power Authority (the NPA) for the

    improvement of electricity supply in the Western Area of the country. The rehabilitation

    of distribution and transmission lines required for the expansion of the Western Area

    Supply and Distribution Network will benefit but also negatively affect the population

    living and working in the Right of Way under the lines (30 m for 162 kV line; 10 m for

    33 kV line). The Resettlement Plan is concerned with the socio-economic aspects of the

    Project and in particular it describes the process of compensation and physical

    relocation of the affected people. During the operational phase of the Project, these

    lines will provide reliable transmission of electricity to customers in Freetown at a

    reasonable cost and with a high level of efficiency for domestic use as well as for other

    users. It will also support economic development in an environmentally sustainable

    way by replacing fuel generated power by hydro power.


    To achieve the objectives of this Project, the Government of Sierra Leone has secured

    credits from National and International sources including the World Bank. The loan

    from the World Bank for such a Project is subject to the approval of a Resettlement

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT

    The power component of the Power and Water Project includes rehabilitation and

    reinforcement of a 161 kV transmission line to carry electricity to Freetown and other

    major cities; a 33 kV distribution system in Freetown and two diesel generator facilities

    to supply electricity during high demand periods.


    This portion of the Power and Water Project directly concerns the rehabilitation of the

    fuel generated power transmission and distribution facility in the city of Freetown. It is

    located in the area enclosed between King Tom, Wilberforce and Black Hall Road sub-

    stations. The transmission lines will traverse three densely populated areas. They will

    circle the central area of Freetown with a 33 kV line on a length of approximately 9.2

    km. A section of 33 kV line of 1 km will connect the Wilberforce substation to the main

33 kV and 161 kV transmission line                                                     P087203

    33 kV circle line. Also part of this Project includes an existing section of the 161 kV line

    that runs for approximately 3 km parallel to the 33 kV line. Eventually, this 161 kV line

    will be connected to the Bumbuna hydropower line to supply the Freetown distribution

    station presently supplied by generators.


    It is important to underline that this Project was planned and partially implemented

    (40%) prior to the escalation and spread of hostilities in Sierra Leone. The towers in

    the sector included in this RAP are in most cases erected and some portions of the

    power lines are already installed. Some damage was sustained to the lines and to the

    towers; they will have to be restored. Half of the towers are yet to be erected,

    rehabilitated or completed.


    During the war many people built their homes in the Right of Way (ROW) of the power

    lines, some claim to have legal property documents, others have occupied land in an

    informal way. In accordance with the World Bank policy on resettlement and for the

    purpose of this document, they are all considered users of the land. They are living,

    working, running business, going to school or to place of worship under these lines and

    they will all be affected by this Project. Many of these Sierra Leones were displaced

    during the war. People fled from the rural zone to Freetown to save their lives and that

    of their families. The war affected nearly every individual as well as public and private

    institutions. Among these, the NPA suffered much loss and damage to its equipment,

    and materiel which included newly installed power lines and towers. The flow of

    displaced people had severe consequences on the NPA's plans. Settlers establish

    themselves on public property and constructed houses, shacks in the ROW beneath

    and along side the towers and electrical lines. The movement of this population largely

    contributed to the demographic change of the city, leading to an increase in population

    from a conservative estimate of half a million to well over two million individuals. The

    scarcity of land forced the most vulnerable of the new arrivals to settle wherever they

    could find space. The settlement in the ROW was an expedient solution that was

    tolerated for humanitarian concerns by all parties (Government, NPA, NGOs, and UN

    agencies). The transmission lines at that time did not represent any immediate danger

    to the settlers since they did not carry any electricity. In many parts of the ROW, the

    displaced persons received support from the international community, which included

    supply of food, plastic sheeting, cement for construction and installation of water lines.

    Much of this was supplied by UNHCR, International Committee of the Red Cross and

    other international and national NGO's. Obvious signs of this support can still be seen

    along most of the power lines.




    With the completion of the present Project, the NPA intends to increase the quality of

    power supply to Freetown. The people living in the ROW have to be relocated because

    of the danger of living in the immediate vicinity of high voltage power lines. The

    distance from the central line of each of the 2 lines are:


               § 5 m on each side for the 33 kV line and a 2 m offset tolerance for
                  structures
               § 15 m on each side of the 161 kV line.


    The NPA commissioned an independent Canadian consultant with a team of 16 Sierra

    Leone professionals to undertake the production of the Relocation Action Plan. The

    study is being carried out to comply with Sierra Leone laws and WB safeguard policies.


    The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Transmission System was prepared in

    collaboration with the consultant responsible for the Environmental Impact

    Assessment. This RAP is independent of the RAP that will be prepared for the

    Completion of the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project.



3.1.    Transmission line route selection and optimization


    The route selection process is described in detail in Chapter 4. It was undertaken in

    1994. It aimed to achieve the selection of economically and technically feasible options

    on the basis of the following criteria:


               § Avoidance of settlements where possible;
               § Minimize passage through areas of high environmental sensitivity;
               § Avoidance of major infrastructures;
               § Utilizing existing infrastructure or public corridors where possible;
               § Minimizing the total length of the route.




                                                                               Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                    April 2004

                                                                                         4

    A number of corridor options were first compared and the corridor with the least

    impact on settlements was selected. Cultural sites were also taken into account, and

    the selected corridor avoided any impact on these sites. This scoping study

    investigated a proposed corridor, which would avoid Forest Reserve and settlements.

    Alignment was adjusted so as to take into account the result of detailed studies and

    resulted in minimal impact on houses, churches and schools.



    Socio-economic surveys and consultations with potentially affected persons were

    undertaken by the NPA as part of the iterative process described above, while the

    valuation of affected assets was carried by an independent consultant.


    For the 3 km of the 161 kV line, the census revealed significant impacts on the

    population, therefore the NPA is considering alternative routings to minimize the

    impacts. The impact on a group of 40 households was avoiding by rerouting the

    transmission lines in the area of Black Hall Road.




4. POTENTIAL IMPACT


    The route of the two power lines was designed in 1997, and efforts were made then to

    minimize negative impacts on the population. When approximately half the

    construction was completed everything had to be stopped because of the war. Since no

    power was running in the lines people established themselves on the ROW. Completion

    and operation of the lines will oblige people in the ROW to relocate. In the case of the

    33 kV line the ROW is 10 m wide and 153 household and 1144 individuals will be

    affected along the 9.2 km of the ROW. In the case of the 161 kV line, the ROW is 30 m

    wide and 115 households will be affected including 1574 persons over the 3 km of line.

    In this last section, the NPA is considering other alternatives to reduce the impact on

    the displaced population.

4.1.     Project activities which will cause economic & physical
         displacement


    This Project is proposing to reacquire the NPA ROW property for public use in order to

    transmit electricity securely. The impact on the squatter community will be immense,

    thereby creating the need for mitigation measures. These measures will include the

    application of a resettlement policy that will take into account the vulnerability of the

    displaced persons.




4.2.     Zone of Impact


    The Project will restore the transmission and distribution lines in the Western Area and

    is presently originating from a fuel generated power transmission and distribution

    facility in the City of Freetown, Sierra Leone. It is located in the area enclosed between

    King Tom, Wilber-Force and Black Hall Roads, three areas that are Swell populated.

    The lines will circle the central area of Freetown with a 33 kV line on a length of

    approximately 9.2 km. A section of 33 kV line, 1.5 km in length, will connect the Wilber

    Force substation to the main 33 kV circle line. An existing section of the 161 kV line

    runs approximately 3 km parallel to the 33 kV line which is also part of this Power

    Project. The 161 kV line will eventually be connected to the Bumbuna hydropower line

    to supply King Tom distribution station presently supplied by a nearby fuel generator.


    The following paragraphs provide an overview of the environmental and settlement

    features of the transmission line route.


                 § The two lines cross an industrial zone, a cemetery and a dumpsite in the
                    King Tom sector. No residential structure will be affected. Both lines,
                    after crossing Ascension Bay, are in a highly populated area along the
                    Congo River.

                 § Between Ascension Town and Congo Cross Bridge, the 33 kV line will
                    affect homes and small businesses. Some structures will remain viable
                    due to the reduced size of the required ROW.
                 § In the same area on the East side of the river the 161 kV line runs for
                    less than 6 km with its 30m easement, it will affect 115 private
                    structures, small businesses, a community school, houses etc. These
                    structures will have to be relocated with their 1574 Project affected

                  persons. The NPA is presently studying other alternatives to reduce
                  resettlement.
               § From the River Side substation a section of 33 kV line will run for
                  approximately 3 km to the Wilberforce Substation. This line will go
                  through a residential area highly occupied before entering on the military
                  barrack ground near the Wilberforce sub station.
               § From Riverside substation the 33 kV line will continue to run on the
                  hilltop of a mountain crest towards the East.
               § From Hill Cut Road to the Government Printing Department, the lines will
                  cross a low-density residential area.
               § Between the Governments Printing Department and the Bellaire Park
                  base No..... Household will be affected.
               § Between Bellaire Park and Mountain road 28 household will be affected
                  and will have to relocate in the near by vicinity
               § From the base of Mountain Road then Around Fourah Bay College to the
                  Quary looking over Kissi Road Cemetary, no structures will be affected.
               § Quary Mountain: To avoid a new high density populated area on the
                  West side of Quary Mountain the 33 kV line will be rerouted. It will
                  require 2 towers on top of the Quary Mountain. This will avoid about 45
                  household and over 300 individuals that were to be affected.
               § Between the top of the Quary at the North Cliff to the Kissy Road
                  cemetery, half a dozen households will be affected and relocated.
               § From the foot of the Quary, the ROW crosses the Kissy Road Cemetery
                  before entering a Government property parking lot where there is a
                  tower site (Tower 44). The lines go over the compound of a Catholic
                  mission before crossing Black Hall road before arriving at the Black Hall
                  Road S/Station

    The total surface affected by the 33 kV line is estimated at 220,000 square meters, the

    area affected by the 161 kV line is estimated at 180,000 square meters.




4.3.    Alternatives to minimize resettlement


    Normally, the 33 kV line requires 10 m of ROW. However, a derogation of a minimum

    of 2 m of horizontal offset from the closest power lines is permitted for existing

    structures. With this derogation some structures will be permitted to remain, the

    people will be affected, however only by minor restrictions with regards to the uses of

    the land. (Appendix 9: "Line Design and Construction Standards")


    In the case of the 161 kV line the ROW is 30 m and no derogation will be permitted for

    any structures. In this Project, the 161 line kV is in a highly populated area. The

    population was established during the war and for most of them they could still be



                                                                             Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                 April 2004

                                                                                      7

    considered as vulnerable persons. Putting the 161 kV lines in operation in this sector

    would require moving and relocating some 1000 individuals living in 110 households.

    At the beginning of the production of this RAP, the NPA were aware of the financial cost

    of such relocation; they realized also the social impacts of the proposed move and

    other related costs. The NPA started immediately to study other alternatives such as

    cable isolation to be able to reduce the ROW, installing under ground cable, and

    moving the distribution center to a less populated location. It was however also

    decided to continue the data collection analysis in order to determine the overall social

    and financial impact of putting this line in operation using the existing design.




4.4.    Mechanism to minimize resettlement during implementation


    At the implementation stage, sites where towers remain to be erected will be

    positioned and adjusted to avoid impacts on as many households as possible.

    Wherever possible, reconstruction will be done on the same plot and in some cases

    only a portion of the building will be relocated in order to respect the ROW setbacks.

    To avoid certain populated areas the lines will be rerouted. This is the case of the

    Section between the Quary above the Kissy Cemetery and Forah Bay College. The

    addition of 2 towers will avoid some 40 houses.

5. OBJECTIVE OF RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM


    The NPA and the World Bank agree to work on the improvement of the supply of

    electrical power to Freetown. The implementation of such a Project has to be done

    without putting undue pressure on the population directly affected by the power lines.

    This resettlement program attempts to mitigate the negative impact of such land

    reacquisition. Persons affected by this these project activities should be assisted in

    their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standard of living. The results of the

    resettlement should restore the living standards to pre-Project levels or at least to

    levels prevailing prior to the beginning of the Project implementation, whichever is

    more advantageous to the population.


    To achieve this objective the NPA team for implementing the Involuntary Resettlement

    Program will follow the following rules:


               a) Involuntary resettlement will be avoided were feasible, or the number of
                   relocation minimized by exploring all possible alternatives.
               b) Where resettlement can not be avoided; resettlement activities will be
                   conceived and executed as sustainable development activities with the
                   participation and consent of the affected population.
               c) In all cases, the affected parties will be in a better situation after the
                   Project then prior to it. As a minimum requirement, the relocated
                   population will be in a situation that is equivalent to the one they were
                   prior to the Electrical Power Project.



6. SOCIO-ECONOMIC SURVEY

    The Socio-economic Survey was done during the same period as the evaluation of all

    assets within the ROW. The survey had several primary objectives:


               § To inform the affected population about the Electrical Power Project
               § To obtain feedback from the affected population about the Project
               § To establish a social profile of the affected population
               § To identify the affected households and individuals
               § To identify vulnerable individuals or groups

    A group of 12 surveyors, divided in four teams of three each, visited all households to

    ask questions on socioeconomic situation of the family and of the people living in each

    specific compound. One technician took a digital picture of each household with the

    occupant and took a GPS reading of the position of the plot.


    All information were transferred into a database and stored on a CD-ROM.


    Various consultations took place at different levels:


    At the National Level with relevant institutions and Ministries:

            § The direction of the NPA invited all Ministries to a consultation conference
               where an overview of the Power and Water Project was presented. The main
               theme of the presentations concerned the Plan for resettlement and
               Compensation. The Ministries of Finance, Development, Land, and Justice
               expressed their views about resettlement with respect to public utilities as
               well as for the construction and rehabilitation of power lines. The NPA
               presented their requirements for resettlement. The direction of the NPA
               stressed that appropriate compensation was a requirement for approval of
               World Bank funding. National financial constraints were discussed and
               alternative solutions brought forward by the participants. Compensation
               should be in-kind; Land and Land title should be offered to affected person.
               The meeting participants reiterated that the NPA and the Government would
               not have sufficient funds to cover the cost of the Program without adequate
               financial support for the total compensation program. They recommended
               that the World Bank should consider raising the global amount of the loan to
               include the 2/3 of the cost of the compensation program. The other 1/3 will
               be covered by land and land title compensation.

    At Local Level during meetings with community members and leaders:

            § Six meetings were held with the local community along the ROW. They were
               attended by 300 persons. The Project was exposed and compensation
               requirements were presented. People understood the necessity of the
               Electrical Power Project for the benefit of everyone. They expressed their
               fears about loosing what they have in the ROW. They referred to past
               compensation programs implemented for electricity, roads and other
               utilities. They asked that avoiding the relocation of houses should be a
               priority, that there should be serious reconsideration of relocating the 161
               kV distribution center and that rerouting of lines to avoid houses should be
               chosen wherever possible.

    At Household Level during the Socio-economic Survey:




                                                                              Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                  April 2004

            § Household meeting allowed the survey team to disseminate information to
                all potentially affected people. The participation of affected people was very
                collaborative. The result of this survey is presented in Appendix 4 and in the
                Figures presented below.

    Affected persons and their representatives at local and national levels have been

    informed of the Project and about the process leading from the initial survey to

    construction of new homes, compensation and physical relocation. Consultation has

    provided information concerning sensitive cultural sites, a reliable identification of

    affected persons, as well as an effective implementation of the census exercise.


    Project Affected People (PAP) consists of all of those persons who will lose assets or

    will lose the use of assets as a result of the Electrical Power Project whatever the

    extent of the loss. Loss of asset includes loss of land rights or land use, structures,

    crops, or a combination of the above. Not all PAP have to be relocated as a result of

    the Project, because in those cases only a small portion of the asset will be

    encumbered.



    -   The number of files opened is:

        161 KV:        119
        33 KV:         160
        Total          279

        (11 files are government properties or property were no compensation is expected to be paid
        ex.: ROW over a cemetery were no damage is expected)




    -   The number of PAP is:

        161 KV:        115 households       1574 individuals
        33 KV:         153 households       1144 individuals
        Total          268                  2718

        (An average of 10 persons are living in one household)

    -   The estimated number of people that will have to move as a result of the Project
        are:

        161 KV (90%):       104 households 1417 individuals

    -   Of these households a small portion will relocate to an area of the same plot,
        thereby respecting the required setbacks. In these cases there will be little
        disruption:

        161 KV:      10%
        33 KV:       6%

    -   Almost all of the structures are used for residential purposes. Sometimes, during
        the day some are used for commercial purposes (restaurant or shop) but are
        transformed into sleeping places at night.

    -   Among the households to be relocated, it is estimated that only 50% will require
        the Program to physically resettle them. The other 50% will require cash
        compensation and will accept to proceed on their own to a relocation of their
        choice, independent of the program (20% inland, 30% elsewhere in Freetown).
        More accurate information will be provided by the household members throughout
        the RAP implementation process.

    -   The value of reconstruction of residential affected structures is based on the total of
        square meter of construction to be relocated or compensated (Valuation methods-
        Chapter 9):

        161 kV     16 072 m2 x 100$ =           1 607 200$
        33 kV      14 098 m2 x 100$ =           1 409 800$
        Total                                   3 017 000$
          The average household area is 83 m2


    -   The estimated value of land surface is based on $20 per square meter:

        161 kV     31 538 m2 x 20$ =              630 760$
        33 kV      17 459 m2 x 20$ =              349 180$
        Total                                     979 940$
          The average area of land per household is 140 m2

    -   The added value of land surface done by land user is estimated at 10%:

        161 kV     31 538 m2 x 200$ x 10% =          63 076$
        33 kV      17 459 m2 x 200$ x 10% =          34 918$

    -   Valuation of small structures including latrines, garages are valuated at the same
        rate used for all structures (square meter)

    -   Only a few cases of damages to crop and trees were identified, because the Project
        is being implemented in a high-density urban area. The compensation value will be
        established case by case. Land use restrictions under the power lines allow plants
        of 1.8 m in maximum height. Provision is made in the budget to plant trees for
        each one damaged or destroyed on public or private property.

         Forest asset:      5 000$
         Crop:              5 000$

    -   Land and Land Title for resettlement are entirely provided by the Government of
        Sierra Leone; the value is estimated at 20$/ m2 and is included in a separate
        budget:

         161 kV           630 760$
         33 kV            349 180$
         Total            979 940$

    -   A provision of 20,000$ for the 33 kV ROW and 25,000$ for the 161 kV ROW were
        made for additional assistance to vulnerable affected persons. It was estimated
        that 10% of the affected people are especially vulnerable (single mothers, very old
        age, young children, amputees, intellectually disabled, sick person etc.) or are at
        survival stage with no specific earning. They are generally totally dependent on
        other family members and are the first to be affected by major changes such as
        relocation. An amount of 170$ or 450,000 Leones is budgeted to cover family
        support to vulnerable members, to pay medication or treatment, special services
        required by the condition of the vulnerable affected person (prosthesis, adapted
        tools, wheal chairs, special house access etc.)

    -   A provision (50,000$ for each 33 kV ROW and 161 kV ROW) for loss of revenue has
        been made to mitigate loss due to relocation of petty trade activity, to mitigate loss
        of apartment rental value and to implement a development Project in collaboration
        with a local NGO, which will start 50 micro enterprises.

    -   A provision of 10,000$ has been made to mitigate loss of any affected cultural
        property. Though no specific cultural property was identified during the present
        survey, it is anticipated that they will be identified during the implementation
        phase. If this amount is not spent on the mitigation of cultural loss at the end of
        the construction of the transmission line, this amount will be made available to
        generate other micro enterprises in collaboration with the local NGO.




    During the field census stage, the PAPs were informed that data was collected for

    valuation purposes and that they should not do any new investment in the ROW. Nor

    should new comers be allowed to establish themselves in the ROW. It was explained

    that the consequence of any new housing or households would be to reduce the

    individual value of the compensation affecting everyone.


    The questionnaire addressed to PAP included items concerning: the type of income

    activities practiced by the family members, their religion, their origin, ethnicity, their

    marital status, the gender distribution of the family members, the type of water

    supply, the type of sanitary facilities and a general assessment of their living

    standards.


    The level of impact was assessed for each structure. If a structure was not affected at

    100%, the affected portion was assed as either being viable or not. Whenever a

    structure was more than 30% affected, it was considered as not viable.


    Most of the people in the lower portion of the Congo River can be considered as very

    poor and often vulnerable people. They do not generally hold any legal documents or

    titles for the land they occupy. In most of the cases they originate from the inland

    portion of Sierra Leone (less than 5% are from Freetown) and were displaced by the

    war. They have low incomes if ever they have any.


    For other vulnerable people, a few special cases were observed. They were not

    necessarily permanently vulnerable (sick person, pregnant women etc.). They will be

    considered during the implementation stage. Provision will be made in the budget for

    this purpose.


    After the census stage and during the analysis phase for the production of this RAP,

    some individuals who were not present at the moment of the field visit, came to the

    census team office to fill-in their form and have their data included in the analysis.

    During the implementation phase these same local offices will be opened to the

    affected people and will provide information as well as accepting grievances from

    Project Affected People.


    Since most of the people from a specific ethnic group have settled near one another,

    the relocation practice will group these people accordingly to their language and tribe

    in a way to minimize adaptation problems. In most cases, they will remain in the

    vicinity of their original household site and adaptation problem should be a less

    important issue.


    Public structures belonging to the community will be included as part of the

    compensation program and will be compensated like other PAP (local schools, mosque,

    church, etc.). They will be rebuilt in the immediate vicinity to accommodate persons

    who were previously using it but who are not directly affected by lose of property.


    Public utilities, such as water fountains, will remain in place and will be renovated to

    offer the service to the population that remains. For relocated people, provision will be

    made to offer similar or better services at the new resettlement sites.


    Resettlement sites will offer school and health care services to families within a similar

    distance range. Distances for PAP will not exceed 1 mile for primary school, 2 miles for

    secondary school and 5 miles for health care services.


    Land Title documents were not produced by any of the affected people. All owners of

    Land Title will deliver copies of them to the Compensation Team. They will be invited to

    do so by public announcement along the ROW; by radio announcements and by

    newspaper announcements. A delay of one month will be allowed. Equivalent Land

    Title will be delivered for the resettlement location.


    All affected households using a piece of land with no Land Title will be compensated for

    leaving the pre-Project piece of land. The compensation will include an equivalent area

    of land with official Land Title


    The affected owner in possession of a Land Title will be refund for all costs related to

    the Title transfer, plus 10% for disturbance allowance.

7. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

    The World Bank is expected to finance the Project. This document has therefore been

    prepared in accordance to the World Bank requirements stipulated in its Operational

    Policies (OP 4.12) titled "Involuntary Resettlement" and dated December 2001. This

    document has been provided to the RAP preparation team by the Africa Environment &

    Social Development Unit of the World Bank.


    This RAP complies with national requirement: The Constitution, the National Power

    Authority Act, and the Public Land Act are the national laws applicable to this power

    line rehabilitation Project. The RAP component of the Project is to acquire land or

    reacquire the NPA land for the public interest. In full respect of the law, it is technically

    feasible to acquire or reacquire in a compulsory way, the land required for this Project.

    However the Law requires that land acquisition should be acquired by private treaty or

    agreement in the Western area and that expenses and compensation shall be paid by

    the Authority. On demand, a reasonable payment can be made by the Authority to

    cover expenses resulting in loss due public needs. Specifically concerning the 161 kV

    line ROW, the law gives larger land acquisition power to the public agency.


    The Land Law in the Western Area refers to the colonial "Public Lands Ordinance"

    known as the "Land Act" and subsequent adaptation Act of 1961 and other

    amendments.


    Payment of adequate Compensation is specified in the Article 42 Section 16 of the

    "Land Act" and title:

        "Compulsory Acquisition of Property (Constitutional Safeguards)" "For the

        Compensation to be allowed, either in respect of the actual value of the land

        or in respect of damages incurred by reason of exercise of any of the said

        power, and any sum or sums so agreed on as last aforesaid, or which shall be

        awarded under the provision of this Ordinance, shall be paid by the

        Accountant General."


    Section 18 gives detail about the method of evaluation of compensation:



                                                                                 Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                       April 2004

    For a period of 2 years after the notice to the owner that the land is to be taken for

    public utility "All increased value by means of any improvement made by the owner

    will be disregarded".


    Compensation for compulsory acquisition is considered by the Court of Law after a

    claim has been deposited. The claims will be prepared by the NPA compensation team

    and signed by the PAP prior to its presentation for compensation.


    Partial demolition of a structure within the ROW needed for public utility: No partial

    compulsory structure acquisition is authorized. (Section 12 of the Public Land ACT

    116). In these cases, it will be accepted if required by PAP and household members.


    If land remains after compulsory acquisition and is considered as not viable, the land

    should be acquired totally by the NPA (Section 10 of the Public land ACT 116).


    Overall, the World Bank requirements are more favorable to Project Affected People

    than the applicable National Laws. For this RAP and its implementation, the World Bank

    policies take precedence and in this case, WB policies will be the guiding principles.


    People affected by public Project were generally not compensated. To avoid

    reproducing this situation the NPA in this Project will compensate the affected people

    prior to any construction in accordance to World Bank requirements.


    Protection of women and girls is describe in Chapter 30 Section 2, 3 of the Law.

    Involuntary Resettlement Requirements of World Bank adopted by the NPA for the

    implementation of the RAP:



                §    All viable alternative Project designs are explored to avoid or
                      minimize the need for resettlement and when it cannot be avoided,
                      to minimize the scale and impacts of resettlement;
                §    Resettlement measures are to be conceived and executed as
                      development activities providing sufficient resources to give the
                      displaced persons, the opportunity to share in Project benefits.
                      Assistance is given to the community in their efforts to improve
                      former production levels, income earning capacity and living
                      standards or at least restore them to the levels they would have
                      without the Project;
                §    Displaced persons are:
                       §     compensated at full replacement cost prior to the actual
                             move;
                       §     assisted with relocation;
                       §     assisted and supported during the transition period.
                §    Particular attention is given to vulnerable groups;
                §    Communities should be given opportunities to participate in planning,
                      implementing and monitoring their resettlement;
                §    Resettlers are helped with integration into their host community;
                §    Resettlement is linked to the main Project implementation schedule,
                      so that Project Affected People are resettled and/or compensated
                      before being affected by the construction or other activities;
                §    There is adequate monitoring and evaluation;
                §    The Project sponsor (the NPA) does offer replacement land. Cash
                      compensation may be appropriate when residual land holdings are
                      economically viable. For households who lose assets/income large
                      enough to make the remainder unviable, compensation is provided
                      as if entire holdings had been taken;
                §    For losses that cannot easily be valued or compensated in monetary
                      terms e.g. access to public services, customers or suppliers, fishing,
                      grazing land or forests, attempts are made to establish access to
                      equivalent    and   culturally  acceptable   resources   and    earning
                      opportunities.

8. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

    National Power Authority is the sponsor of the Project and is responsible for the

    implementation of this Resettlement Action Plan. The NPA has developed contractual

    relation with an independent consultant team of 16 members who is in charge of

    preparing the resettlement and compensation action plan for this Project. The NPA will

    contract some or all members of the present team to implement this RAP. This team

    has already carried out the census exercise and therefore has a good knowledge of the

    affected people and area. The team will be completed with 4 new members. It includes

    community liaison officer, traditional & cultural specialist, legal expert, land surveyor,

    civil engineer, data manager etc. The team will have national and international

    members. An independent office will be opened. Equipment, including 3 vehicles and 4

    computers will be made available to this team and provision made in the budget.


    The following institutions will be involved in the implementation of the RAP:



                §    An independent legal counseling firm will advise the PAP on legal
                      issues relevant to compensation & resettlement;
                §    An independent Non Governmental Organization of Sierra Leone will
                      be appointed to witness the implementation of the RAP and to report
                      publicly on a quarterly basis. This NGO, a member of SLANGO, has
                      experience in resettlement activities in Sierra Leone. This NGO has
                      not yet been contracted and it will be selected through the NPA
                      bidding process.
                §    A Freetown financial institution, the Standard Chartered Bank will
                      participate in the training of the PAP to manage their financial
                      compensation.
                §    The Government of Sierra Leone will be represented on the Project
                      Steering Committee to be set up by the sponsor. The Committee will
                      provide guidance and will review the results of the process on a
                      regular basis.
                §    A National Compensation Commission (NCC) will do all payment of
                      compensation, Cash or In-Kind. It will be done publicly; although the
                      amount of compensation will not be reveled publicly. The NCC
                      members are:

                  §   The NCC is responsible of the identification of the Land User and that
                      each payment is made to secure each PAP.
                  §   A contract between the NPA and each household representative will
                      be signed allowing the disbursement of the compensation cash or in-
                      kind.
                  §   The remaining residents along the line will be contracted for the
                      protection of the line way leave. In return of this responsibility they
                      will be allowed to use the concern land under the applicable
                      restrictions.




9. ELIGIBILITY

    Project Affected People (PAP) are all persons who lose assets or lose the use of assets

    as a result of the Project, whatever the extent of the loss. Loss of assets may be loss

    of land rights or land use, structures, crops, or a combination of these. Not all PAP

    have to relocate as a result of the Project as in some cases only a narrow strip of the

    concerned asset will be encumbered. In these cases they will receive cash

    compensation for their loss.


    Eligibility to resettlement and compensation is based upon the census mentioned

    above. Any household who has been identified in the field at the census stage as

    having interests affected by the Project is eligible to resettlement and compensation

    packages proportionate to the level of impact. All types of land rights give eligibility to

    compensation and/or resettlement whatever the land tenure regime (formal or

    customary, ownership or tenancy etc...)




                                                                               Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                   April 2004

                                                                                       20

9.1.     Eligibility of tenants and sharecroppers


    Tenants as defined by the Land Act are eligible to land compensation, based upon the

    extent of rights they hold in the land. They are also eligible for compensation of their

    crops according to the same rules as landowners.


    There is no legal provision in Sierra Leone with respect to any form of land

    compensation for sharecroppers. However, crops belonging to sharecroppers have

    been valued as such by the evaluators and shall be compensated in accordance to the

    same rules applicable to landowners and tenants.




9.2.     Compensation sharing among household members (tenant vs.
         owner)


    Compensation of the household is calculated by adding values of lost land, values of

    lost structures, value of loss of business revenues, amount of disturbance, values of

    compensation for vulnerable individuals or groups, value of lost crops or trees. The

    total loss is thus established for the household.


    The sharing of compensation among members of the household is established during a

    meeting of the household members. All members are informed that the sharing has to

    take into account the principal that every member has to be in a similar or better

    situation then the one they were in prior to the relocation. They are also informed that

    the compensation will be in priority and essentially in-kind compensation (land, land

    title, construction material, daily construction allowance for workers, trees, seeds,

    tools, etc.) All members must agree and sign the household sharing agreement.

10. VALUATION METHODS


10.1. National valuation methods for expropriation for public use


    The Ministry of Land has provided information relative to valuation of structures in the

    Western Area.


         "There are normally four methods used in the valuation of properties. It is

         usual for two methods to be used at any one time."


    In the present study and for the purposes of compensation the evaluators normally

    used the Cost / Contractor's Method and the Investment Method for purposes of

    comparisons. With the Cost / Contractor's Method the cost to reproduce the current

    building per square foot or square meter is applicable.


    The buildings or structures are also classified into various classes:




                              Categories                               $ Value / m2

            S-A
            Modern concrete house with all amenities (self               270 to 315 $
            contained) ceramic floor
            S-B1

Sierra Leone




    In this relocation program most of the structures are in categories S-B2, S-C, S-CI.

    Exceptionally, there are structures in other categories.


    The general amount per square meter of floor space for a permanent structure is

    estimated to be 250,000 Leones or 100 US$. This figure comes from international

    organizations involved in the reconstruction process in Sierra Leone between 2002-

    2004 and was confirmed by national evaluator services of the Ministry of Land.


    The value of land in Freetown can be estimated at $20 per square meter in the zone

    where the Project is located. Since in most of the cases, the concerned land users are

    not titled land owners, they will not receive this amount. They will be compensated for

    the added value of the land they were using. The average estimated value is $2 per

    square meter. Also, new land (equivalent to the previous) is provided with property

    titles, it will be offered as in-kind compensation.




10.2. Basis for compensation calculation


    The methodology for calculating crop compensation takes into account both the 2004

    market value of agricultural produce, and the time period required to re-establish

    perennial crops.


    The disturbance allowance is 10% of the C1 amount when prior notice of 2 months or

    more is given to vacate the land. Otherwise, it is 15% of C1. No additional amount will

    be paid on top of the disturbance allowance. (Note: C1 refers to the basic

    compensation, Section 10.3).


    All assets that can be removed, such as building materials, will be an additional benefit

    to affected people. Their value will not be deducted from the amounts of

    compensation.




                                                                              Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                  April 2004

Sierra Leone




10.3. Compensation under Sierra Leone Law and the NPA supplement


    As shown above, compensations must comply with two sets of rules; the Sierra Leone

    law and WB safeguard policies. The latter is potentially more advantageous to PAPs,

    especially with regard to the "full replacement cost". However, the Government of

    Sierra Leone is desirous to not set precedents with respect to compensation amounts.

    In line with the compensation system which is proposed for the power Project, it is

    proposed to distinguish clearly two terms within the compensation amount:



                §    C1 will be the amount calculated under Sierra Leone law, according to
                      official methods of calculation, excluding the disturbance allowance.
                §    C2 will be an the NPA supplement intended at fulfilling WBG
                      requirements,
                §    C is the total compensation = C1+C2
                §    In the case of in-kind compensation, part of the above-mentioned
                      terms wiil be the monetary counter-value of in-kind compensation.

    Disturbance allowance shall be paid on top of C1.


    Those terms will be clearly distinguished throughout the whole sensitization, individual

    consultation and payment process, so that PAPs and authorities will clearly distinguish

    between the amount payable under Sierra Leone law, and the additional supplement

    from the NPA.




10.4. Compensation for land, structures and crops


    Compensation and resettlement packages ­ An individual approach

    Cash compensation will be offered where the remaining land is economically viable and

    structures have to be removed.


    The construction of a replacement house will be offered wherever the building has to

    be removed. This may either be on the remaining part of the plot if it is deemed viable

    and the affected household agrees to such a solution, or on another resettlement plot.




                                                                               Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                    April 2004

                                                                                       24

Sierra Leone




    Replacement land will be offered in cases where the remaining existing land is not

    viable. Where required, the provision of a replacement house will also be offered.

    Consultation at the household level with the affected persons will ensure that the final

    compensation/resettlement package is appropriate to the needs and expectations of

    the affected household.


    As this is a linear Project with little impact on the larger communities, no group

    resettlement will take place. Replacement land will be identified by the NPA in the

    neighborhood of affected households, within the same communities from where the

    affected people originate. For this reason, no impact on "host communities" is

    expected, as no group relocation will occur. For instance, there will be no major impact

    on public facilities such as water supply, schools or clinics. All people will be

    compensated prior to any enforcement of the ROW encroachments.




10.5. Basis for compensation calculations


    Legal advisors from Ministry of Justice provided texts of laws confirming full rights of

    the NPA to acquirer land in a compulsory way. Compensation is to be paid for affected

    loss asset such as `'tree, structures or objects'' when ownership is proved. Details in

    the law shows that compensation should be `'reasonable'' Details are in the Public Land

    Act No 116 and in Appendix 6.




11. RESETTLEMENT METHOD AND PACKAGE

    The construction of a replacement house will be offered wherever the existing building

    has to be removed. This may be either on the remaining part of the plot if it is viable

    (10% for 161 kV 6% for 33 kV) and the affected household agrees to such a solution,

    or on another resettlement plot of its choice. Resettlement houses will be improved

    compared to the original ones, and as a minimum it will feature among other

    improvements, a corrugated iron or zinc galvanized roof, a concrete floor and




                                                                               Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                   April 2004

                                                                                       25

    foundation, and a ventilated latrine pit or an appropriate sewage system for latrines.

    Structures will be made of:



                 §    Cement block with proper concrete lintel
                 §    Or Stabilized laterite block type "interlocked" (10% cement)
                 §    Or material of higher quality than the ones found on the structures
                      prior to the relocation.



    Replacement land will be offered in cases where the surface outside of the ROW and

    setback tolerances, is not viable. Replacement land will be at least equivalent in

    surface and in potential to the former one. The household will be consulted on the

    location and characteristics of this land. Secure and legal land titles will be given to all

    re-settled families. Furthermore, people will not encounter higher transportation cost

    to go to work or to the market place.


    In the vicinity of most of the ROW there is still open land available for construction

    within a radius of 2 km which is acceptable in Freetown. There is one exception, if both

    lines are restored as designed or projected and people have to relocate massively in

    the sector between Ascension Bay to south of Congo Cross Bridge, people will have to

    relocate outside of the area.


    Cash or in-kind compensation will be offered against encumbered or acquired asset

    where the remaining assets are economically viable and building has to be totally

    demolished.


    Consultation with the affected persons at the household level will ensure that the final

    compensation / resettlement package is appropriate for the affected household needs

    and expectations. Consent of spouse and children will be complied with wherever

    applicable.


    As this is a linear Project with little impact on communities as such, no group

    resettlement are expected. Resettlement land site will be identified by the NPA in the

    neighborhood of the affected household. For this reason no impact on host

    communities is expected.

    Refer to valuation methods for the interpretation of "reasonable''.

    All affected perennial crops will be compensated for based upon assessment carried out

    during census stage. Damaged crops will also be compensated.


    Applicable Sierra Leone compensation rates will be used as the basis for the calculation

    of compensation. Wherever there is a difference between Sierra Leone rates and WB

    guidelines, an adjustment will be made and applied to meet WB requirements as per

    the Operational Policies (OP 4.12)


    Meetings will be held on a household basis, with each affected head of household and

    all adult household members. This could take place either in the affected landowner's

    house or at sub-country offices. PAPs may be assisted by whoever they wish; family

    members, Land Compensation Committee Members, lawyers and legal counselors.


    The proposed compensation for the land and assets will be detailed. So as to expedite

    the process and where appropriate, land and replacement of non-land asset

    compensation will be discussed together with compensation for all other landowner's

    lost assets.


    Household and family members have to express their agreement on the overall

    compensation (new land, in-kind goods, and cash); all must be identified and their

    consents must be sought at this level where applicable.


    When the deal is agreeable to all parties, a compensation agreement will be signed by

    the parties. More specifically all adults (woman and men) living in the household must

    sign their acceptance.


    All agreements will be assembled and the National Compensation Commission will

    approve them and will issue the contractual compensation certificates.

    The CCCs will be applicable to all parties. A certificate can be issued for new land, in-

    kind goods, cash or other kind of compensation as long as it represents the acceptance

    of the parts.


    Notice to Vacate will be served in accordance with the National regulations. The date of

    commencement of the notice to vacate period will be the date of signature of the

    compensation certificate, regardless of the actual date of signature of the transfer

    deed. The Notice to Vacate will be for a period of no less than 2 months. If it is

    between 2 and 6 months, an extra 10% disturbance allowance is payable to the

    affected landowner. Nobody can be forced to leave until fully compensated and moved

    to their new home if applicable.




11.1. Payment procedure


    Compensation certificates: When the affected household for the compensation of lost

    assets has selected its options, all parties involved will sign a compensation certificate.

    These compensation certificates will clearly separate the compensation term paid for,

    under the Land Law requirements (C1), and the term resulting from the NPA

    supplement.



    Signatories of the compensation certificates will be as follows:



                 §   Compensation Recipient,
                 §   And 3 of the following:
                 §   Government representative,
                 §   NPA representative,
                 §   Community Leadership Member
                 §   Member of the National Compensation Commission
                 §   Witness NGO
                 §   Other as required




                                                                                Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                    April 2004

11.2. Payment


    Payments of all amounts more than half a million Leones ($200) will be made by

    cheque. Payment will be made by the NPA. On payment, the same parties as above

    will sign a Receipt of Payment.


    For all affected people advice will be offered in banking services to able to open a bank

    account and secure funds. A specific training will be offered to PAP and will be under

    the responsibility of the NPA with involvement of an NGO, and Standard Chartered

    Bank, the bank in charge of forwarding payments to PAPs. In many cases the

    beneficiary of a cash compensation of over ½ million do not have a Bank Account. All

    charges for the opening of bank account will be covered by the NPA.



11.3. Cultural Property


    Concerning affected cultural property, no site of archaeological interest has been

    identified along the route, and no culturally significant site has been brought to the

    attention of the NPA during the consultation that was carried out along the ROW. No

    significant cultural property is known to be affected by the Electrical Power Project

    based upon consultations held to-date and no payment procedures have been planned.




11.4. Graves


    Wherever possible, any impact on structures such as graves or places of offerings in

    general will be avoided. No graves were observed in the house compound affected by

    the ROW. Some graves may be affected by the Project. In the event that a grave is in

    land which is to be cleared for tower construction, compensation will be in accordance

    with normal cultural practice in Sierra Leone; the household will be offered a specific

    compensation to relocate the graves.

11.5. Places of offerings


    Places of Offerings affected by the Project: If any are found, they will be compensated

    according to the relocating cost of non-permanent structures.




11.6. Archaeological and cultural sites


    The construction of the transmission system does not include much earthmoving. And

    the overall impact on the land being used is low; it may be that chance finds are made

    during the course of the construction. These may include the following:


               § Archaeological heritage which has remained unnoticed in the past;
               § Sites of cultural significance such as sacred woods or trees or rock
                   outcrops, which the local residents may have not mentioned at the
                   survey stage.

    Prior to the commencement of the works, an archaeologist will survey the corridor in

    the filed to check for any potential finds.


    The Contractor will develop a procedure in their Environmental Management Plan to

    address cultural chance finds. Where the site appears to require a specific intervention,

    notice will be made to the Ministry in charge of Archaeological sites. Consultation

    between the Ministry, the NPA, and the local authorities will take place to develop an

    appropriate response.




11.7. Organizational framework


    General organization for implementation


    The general organization of the resettlement will be based on inputs from the following

    institutions.


               § the NPA will be entirely responsible for the plan, and will implement it
                   with their own teams and budgets, in accordance with procedures and
                   obligations outlined in this Plan;



                                                                               Paul T. Willcott

                  whole process; this NGO (member of Slango) has already been invited
                  by the NPA;

                  available to PAPs throughout the RAP implementation;
              § External auditors will assess the process from technical, social-
                  economical and financial aspects, by request of one of above-mentioned
                  parties, or at lenders` request; the cost of these audits will be borne by
                  the NPA unless otherwise agreed.

11.12. Assistance to vulnerable people


    Vulnerable people may be such prior to the compensation process because of a

    disability or disadvantage, and/or may be made more vulnerable as a result of the

    compensation process. Vulnerable people include:



                 §    Disabled people or people suffering from serious illnesses,
                 §    The elderly persons, widows or orphans,
                 §    Women and children at risk of being dispossessed of their productive
                      assets ­land- as a result of the land compensation process that may
                      benefit the sole male household head.

                 §    Identification of person and cause of vulnerability; the person is
                      either self-identified or through the community; this step is critical
                      because often vulnerable people do not participate in community
                      meetings, and their disability/vulnerability may remain unknown;
                 §    Identification of required assistance at the various stages of the
                      process: negotiation, compensation, moving;



                                                                               Paul T. Willcott

    and needs:


                §     Assistance in the compensation payment procedure (going to the
                      bank with the person to cash the cheque);

                §     Assistance in building: providing materials, workforce, or building
                      house;
                §     Health care if required at critical periods: moving and transition
                      period.

    A designated item within the Budget is available for these specific assistance actions

    targeting vulnerable people.




12. RESETTLEMENT SITE

    The choice of resettlement sites is determined by mutual consent between the NPA and

    the household owner. It is estimated that 50% of the households will decide to ask for

    cash compensation and relocate in other area without the program support. Since in-

    kind compensation for relocation is a priority, the implementation team will analyze the

    compensation request of each affected person to assist them in their relocation and to

    ensure that they are relocated wherever they chose with housing land title and

    economic activity, to the level of their compensation. For the remaining 50%, where

    possible the relocation will be in the same area of town. For the 33 KV ROW it will be a

    case-by-case decision of the household along the 9.2 km of the line. For the 161 kV

    ROW, the concentration of affected household in a small area will require one or 2

    construction Projects on the side of Congo River.


    The availability of resettlement land in the vicinity of the affected corridor is being

    investigated by the NPA. Resettlement land will be purchased by the NPA in the vicinity

    of the corridor. The principles for the identification, purchase and attribution of

    resettlement land are the following:



                                                                              Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                   April 2004

                                                                                      39

                       communities;
                 §    People will be resettled within the same area where they were
                       originally residing: this will avoid any impact on public facilities that
                       might result from the large influx of resettlers to one single location;
                       there will not be any group relocation in this Project, but resettlers
                       will be re-inserted in the social fabric on a case-by-case basis.



    A secure Land Title will be attributed to resettlers, depending on each situation.


    Consultation with affected stakeholders is pursued by the Government and the NPA.

    The land will be formally titled by the NPA and the Government in the name of the

    affected stakeholders. All compensation certificates and transfer relating to land will be

    signed jointly by the vendor, the NPA and Government on the one hand, and by the

    affected buyer on the other. The payment of the stakeholders is the value of the

    compensation received for the loss land occupied in the ROW.


    The importance of amicable transactions is stressed, and dispute settlement

    procedures will be presented. Legal counsel will be made available to PAPs at this

    stage.




13. HOUSE CONSTRUCTION


    Construction will be done by the individual owner or by a contractor and this will be

    identified at the beginning of the implementation stage. The type and quality of houses

    will be better then the one previously used. Technical advice will be provided to each

    household and plans will be prepared in consultation between the beneficiary of the

    compensation and the engineer of the implementation team. The plans will comply

    with the World Bank Requirement described in OP 4.12




                                                                                 Paul T. Willcott

Sierra Leone




    Un-employment is a constant problem in Sierra Leone. Many structures if not the large

    majority are built by the individual owner in Freetown. If for any reason the beneficiary

    of the relocation is not capable to do the construction he will find in is family or among

    his neighbors the workers to build his house. The compensation budget for each

    household will likely be better used by the new land owners investing for themselves

    than by any construction contractor. Distribution of the compensation will generally

    advance more smoothly if the relocated individual takes a direct and leading part in

    their own reconstruction project. This way of proceeding will create income within the

    family members instead of benefiting a contractor who is not related to the affected

    people. The budget for the reconstruction will remain the same but will benefit more

    directly the affected people.




14. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ON RESETTLEMENT SITE


    For the resettled household of the 33 kV ROW, the low population density along most

    of the line will allow each reconstruction to respect the urban environment of

    resettlement (Note: This refers to the size of plot, stability of soil, surface water

    drainage, sewage system, in & out access, minimal bush cutting and natural effects,

    neighborhood and general social acceptance of the construction.) On the case of 161

    kV ROW PAP, the population density will require the construction of a major building

    that will require a specific environmental assessment. Such a construction would be

    erected on a riverside and soil studies will be required. The resettled families will need

    to be protected from possible flooding. It is likely that resettlement for the 161 kV

    ROW will not be implemented due to redesign of the route


    A specific study was done to cover environmental issues and was presented separately.


    The ROW reacquired by the NPA will be secured from contracted land owners residing

    outside of the ROW. Their contract will allow them to use a defined portion of the ROW

    under specific restrictions: No plants higher than 1.8m; no construction other then

    fences; permanent access given to the NPA for maintenance or construction.




                                                                                 Paul T. Willcott

15. COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION


    The implementation team will encourage affected persons to take an active part in the

    reconstruction and when possible the program planning.



                §     Contribution during census
                §     Contribution for choice of relocation sites
                §     Construction of houses
                §     Contribution in relocating

    The implementation workers will be chosen in priority from among PAP. They will be

    contracted and supported to build their house on their new plot of land.




16. HOST COMMUNITIES

    As this is a linear Project with little impact on communities as such, no group

    resettlement will be required. For this reason, replacement land will be identified in the

    immediate area of affected households and only limited impact is anticipated on host

    communities.




17. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES

    The NPA has taken steps to minimize the potential for disputes. Legal Counsel is put in

    place to advise the Project Affected People on legal issues, and all survey and valuation

    results are crosschecked by community members and the concern asset owner, a

    picture of the owner is incorporated in the valuation file and will be available to local

    Counselors. Valuation has been made by independent surveyors. Also, in the event

    were   the   identified  land   owner     would   unfortunately  decease     during    the




                                                                               Paul T. Willcott

    compensation/resettlement process, the potential heirs are already known through the

    survey. As well, reference to the Land Act provides mechanisms for inheritance.


    Aggrieved persons have a right of access to the Court as guaranteed by the

    Constitution of Sierra Leone, the Land Act, and The National Power Authority Act.

    When properties disputes occur, the Land NPA team will encourage aggrieved persons

    to find a mutual understanding of the case and come to an applicable mutual solution

    to the problem without having recourse to the Court.


    In the case of persistent disputes concerning the amount of compensation or of the

    persons entitled to any form of compensation, the case may be brought to the

    Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in the place were the land is situated. If it cannot be

    resoved in this instance, the case can be brought through the justice system up to the

    High Court of Sierra Leone.


    A series of mechanisms are in place to minimize disputes to the extent possible,

    including:




                §     Legal Counseling body is available to all affected people
                §     During the survey and valuation stages, the community witnesses
                      participate in the plot delimitation and the evaluation of assets,
                      together with the Affected Person and the NPA representatives; all
                      documents are signed by all the above.
                §     The Witness NGO is witnessing the fairness of the compensation and
                      resettlement process on a daily basis.




17.1. Grievance processing mechanism


    The grievance/dispute processing and settlement mechanism is based on a three-tier

    system, as per the following sketch:




                                                                               Paul T. Willcott

                                       First instance:

                                              of

                                     Second instance:
                      Amicable settlement outside the scope of the
                        customary law under the auspices of Legal
                                          Counsel


                      If not successful



                                      Third instance:
                                        Court of Law


                      Figure 1. Grievance processing mechanism


    Relying on customary mechanisms as a First Instance:

    In such compensation and resettlement operations, many grievances take root in

    misunderstandings, or result from conflicts between neighbors, which usually can be

    solved through adequate mediation using customary rules. Most (90%) of grievances

    can be extinguished with additional explanation efforts and limited mediation. A first

    instance mechanism is aimed at the amicable settlement of disputes.


    When an aggrieved person presents a grievance or dispute to the Legal Counsel, the

    legal advisor will seek settlement using first the customary mechanisms available in

    the community. These mechanisms use customary rules well known to all and




                                                                           Paul T. Willcott
                                                                               April 2004

                                                                                   44

    considered binding by all. Community leaders typically and rightfully play an important

    role in achieving settlements acceptable to all parties.


    Second Instance: Amicable settlement under the auspices of Legal Counsel/Witness

    NGO and the NPA. When a settlement cannot be reached at the First Instance level,

    the second instance mechanism is triggered. It will consist of the following members:



                  §   Witness NGO (chairperson),
                  §   the NPA,
                  §   Aggrieved PAPs and/or their representatives or counsels;
                  §   Independent Legal Counsel.



    Mediation meetings are organized with the interested parties. Minutes of meetings will

    be recorded.


    Third Instance: Appeal to Court

    The Constitution allows the right of access to a Court of Law by any person who has an

    interest or right over the property. According to the Constitution and the Land Law the

    jurisdiction includes:



                  §   The Determination of disputes relating to the grant, lease,
                       repossession, transfer or acquisition of land by individuals, the
                       National Land Authority or other authority with responsibility relating
                       to land; and.
                  §   The determination of any disputes relating to the amount of
                       compensation to be paid for land acquired.



    Appeal to the Court will be therefore through the normal jurisdiction. Given the

    mechanisms described above, it is not expected that many disputes will reach this

    level.




17.2. Management of family conflicts and heritages


    As mentioned above, the Constitution and the Land Act include provisions that ensure

    adequate protection to heirs and right-holders in the unfortunate event of the eligible


                                                                               Paul T. Willcott
                                                                                    April 2004

                                                                                       45

    person's death. The NPA has taken steps to implement these legally required prior

    consents under the Land Act, using an in-house dedicated legal team to that end.

    Therefore, in such events, heirs and all right-holders are already identified and this will

    help greatly in dealing with these situations.




18. ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES


    This Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared by an independent consultant in close

    consultation with the NPA, who has helped to develop the Plan and has provided all

    relevant information. The present Resettlement Action Plan is fully endorsed by the

    NPA. The NPA is committed to its implementation and agrees to carry out all

    obligations under this Plan.




19. IMPLEMENTATION TIME FRAME


    It is planed that the implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan will need about 8

    months for the bulk of the plan. No construction work will take place where the

    implementation of the compensation and/or resettlement measures is not completed. A

    conservative estimate of consultation and preparation time requirements is taken into

    account in the schedule.


    Following the RAP, where the resettlement and compensation process was defined, all

    assets in the ROW were estimated and each household and PAP were identified.


                 §    Compensation Process Preparation Phase leads to contractual
                      agreement and ends with signature between the PAP and the NPA, it
                      defines precisely the value of each compensation. (2 months
                      required)
                 §
                 §    The Resettlement Process Preparation Phase defines how each
                      compensated person will be compensated (resettlement land plot, in-
                      kind payment, cash payment, etc) and it ends with a signature of
                      how the PAP want to be compensated.



                                                                                Paul T. Willcott

               §     The Direct Implementation Phase is divided in five Sub-Phases:

                  1. Land acquisition and production of title documents in the name of the
                     PAP
                  2. Other cash compensations
                  3. Notice to vacate
                  4. Construction
                  5. Physical relocation including specific assistance to move.

               §     Monitoring and Evaluation is a Phase which start at the beginning of
                      implementation of the RAP and will continue after the completion of
                      the implementation.

20. BUDGET


    The total cost of the RAP is estimated at this interim stage at 5,500,000 $USD. This

    includes approximately 55% for the 161 kV ROW and 45% for the 33 kV ROW. This

    amount has been incorporates the cost of compensation and resettlement for all

    affected people of all categories, together with cost of the implementation

    organization, monitoring, evaluation and assistance to vulnerable people. An additional

    10% is included to the total of these items for potential contingencies.



    Recommendation: That the funds for compensation be deposited in an In-Trust

    Account with double signatures NPA ­ Consultant.

21.1. General objectives and evaluation monitoring


    Evaluation and monitoring are key components of the Resettlement Action Plan, and as

    such are part of the whole programme under the NPA responsibility / obligations. The

    NPA will be operating power facility permanently which allows for various evaluations

    and monitoring actions to be undertaken over a sufficient period of time.



                                                                             Paul T. Willcott

Evaluation indicators



    As part of the preparation of this program, the NPA has established a comprehensive

    database of all Project Affected People, based on the census and the socio-economic

    survey, which were carried out. The socio-economic survey has addressed all aspects

    of the living standard of the PAP. It has included direct questions about monetary

    incomes. This allows for a first set of indicators to be defined, in relation to monetary

    incomes, including both agricultural and non-agricultural sources.


    During the social-economic survey carried out for this RAP, the direct questions on

    monetary incomes may have led to overestimated answers motivated by expected

    increases in compensation. But other objective indicators have been included in the

    data collection process such as digital pictures of each household, information about

    the possession of telephone, television, radios, generator or power connection,

    transport equipment, together with indicators of the pattern of expenditures and the

    type of cooking energy. The aggregation of quantitative indicators originating from all

    questions during each visit has been incorporated into the database and will continue

    to be incorporate new socio-economic information until the signature of compensation

    agreement. It will allow for crosschecking of data about standards living.




Evaluation methodology


    The Evaluation Methodology is the following:


                  § Identification of a sample of Project Affected Persons, designed to
                      take into account all situations, including the following categories,
                      with appropriate criteria crossing and sample significance tests:

                          o Physically Displaced People resettlement under this RAP;
                          o Physically Displaced People having chosen not to be resettled
                             under this RAP but having opted for cash compensation;
                          o Affected People not physically displaced;
                          o Both female and male heads of households;
                          o Households of various sizes of individuals, various size of land
                             holding and various levels of impact;
                          o People who relocated in various areas, including to in-land
                             district as the case may be;



                                                                                Paul T. Willcott

                     departments of the Central Government.



Auditor

    The Auditor will be an independent consultant or NGO with experience in RAP design

    and practical implementation, and agreeable to all parties involved. The detailed terms

    of reference for the evaluation will be prepared by the NPA and reviewed by the

    Independent Panel of Experts, prior to submission to parties involved. The NPA will

    provide their documentation to the evaluator. The Executive Summary of the

    evaluation report will be released to the public following an appropriate procedure.




Periods for evaluation

    The independent evaluation of the RAP implementation will take place in two

    successive stages:


                §    Within 6 months after completion of the implementation: 1st mission
                      of evaluation;
                §    2 years after completion of the implementation: 2nd evaluation
                      mission.

    Both evaluations will be carried out following similar methodologies and using the same

    indicators.

21.3. Monitoring


    The objectives of the monitoring are the following:


                 §   To identify affected persons who might get into difficulties as a result
                      of the Compensation/Resettlement process;
                 §   To provide a safety mechanism and appropriate responses addressing
                      these situations.

    The NPA will maintain in Freetown a Resettlement Task Force for 5 years after

    completion of this RAP. The Task Force will be available to respond to any specific

    situation that may be presented to them.




CONSULTANT RECOMMENDATIONS


    The following recommendations were made within the main body of the report

    where a full rational is presented. They have been arrived at as the result of a

    thorough analysis of the specific details of the design of the Resettlement

    Action Plan. They also reflect spontaneous suggestions made by people directly

    affected during the Public Meetings held in Freetown.


    Recommendation 1

    It is recommended that new construction be undertaken by the people affected

    directly rather than by building Contractors. This will encourage active

    participation in the resettlement process.


    Recommendation 2

    It is recommended that, whenever possible, Compensation be In-kind (land,

    construction material..) rather than in the form of cash payments. This will

    help to attain the objective that the quality of the living standards will increase

    as a result of the resettlement process. The risk is that cash payments will be

    spent on other purchases.

    Recommendation 3

    That the funds for compensation be deposited in an In-Trust Account with

    double signatures NPA ­ Consultant.


    Recommendation 4

    Relocate the 161 kV switch yard from King Tom to the hilltop of Freetown. This

    will avoid the construction of the line with a 30 m ROW in one of the highest

    populated areas of Freetown. This relocation will avoid considerably increased

    resettlement efforts.


    Recommendation 5

    Install 2 or 3 new hydro towers over Black Hall Road Substation to avoid a

    settlement     of  40     households on    the  west  bank   of   the    Quary.

    KEY DEFINITIONS


    Project: rehabilitation and reinforcement of a 33 kV distribution line circling Freetown,

    a section of 33 kV line linking this circular line to Wilberforce, a 161 kV line of 6 km

    going down in the Congo river valley to the King Tom station, and all developments

    required for their construction or rehabilitation and operation, such as, access roads,

    borrowing areas, workers sites, transmission lines, switchyards...


    Project-Affected Area: The Project-affected area for the RAP is the area where the

    Project may cause direct or indirect impacts to the environment and the residents. This

    includes the permanent and temporary land take area, the corridors which will be used

    for rehabilitation or construction and maintenance of the transmission lines, the vicinity

    of the construction sites and access roads.


    Project-Affected Person: Persons who lose assets as a result of the Project,

    whatever the extent of the loss; lost assets include land rights, structures, crops,

    business, access or a combination of those losses; not all Project Affected Persons

    (PAPs) have to physically relocate as a result of the Project.


    Displaced Persons: Those Projected Affected Persons who are affected as a result of

    the Power Project; they may be either physically displaced or economically displaced;

    Displaced Persons are only one category of the Project Affected Persons.


    Physically Displaced Persons: those affected persons who have to physically

    relocate because they reside within the land to be acquired for the ROW or

    encumbered as a result of the Power Project.


    Economically-Displaced Persons: those affected persons who are affected in way

    that they loose incomes from crops, land, businesses etc.


    Replacement Cost: WB policies require that all affected assets (land and structures)

    are compensated for at their replacement cost. Replacement cost of an affected asset

    is equivalent to the amount required to replace the asset in its existing condition. The

    replacement cost of land is its market value. The replacement cost of structures is
