Sierra Leone were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            aimed at reconstructing parts of Sierra Leone's\n            dilapidated infrastructure by means of rehabilitated assets,\n            expanding capacity, and enhancing institutions in several\n            sectors. Despite being conceived as a multi-sectoral\n            project, the project did not include any multi-sectoral\n            component. Implementation was carried out by two different\n            teams with different Team Task Leader (TTLs) without\n            coordination, which compromised the quality of supervision.\n            The commitment of the Government to essential reforms in\n            Sierra Leone was weak, as evidenced by the lack of support\n            to a management contract for National Power Authority (NPA)\n            and the lack of clarity regarding the competent authority\n            for solid waste management in Freetown. These circumstances\n            added to the poor improvement of NPA's performance and\n            solid waste collection in Freetown. The project design\n            should be as simple as possible in a post-conflict context\n            where there are a vast number of needs to be fulfilled.\n            Design also needs to take into account the capacity of the\n            implementation agencies so that the Project Development\n            Objectives (PDO) is achievable. Also, the Bank needs to\n            provide a focal point in the post-conflict country to\n            enhance communication and facilitate project implementation."}, "docdt": "2011-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
