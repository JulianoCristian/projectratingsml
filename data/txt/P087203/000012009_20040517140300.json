It is intended to address prioritized\n            issues across different infrastructure services - water and\n            sanitation, urban waste management and power - taking into\n            account all other donor commitments, and ongoing or planned\n            programs. Implementation of the project will necessarily\n            entail reallocation, and resettlement of people living in,\n            and around the project area, thus, the primary aim of this\n            policy resettlement framework is to set out a strategic\n            response to the challenges of involuntary resettlement,\n            which potentially can be anticipated, and facilitate proper\n            decision making, and the mobilization of resources. Cash\n            compensations for land losses will be based on market\n            values, or as recommended by the Bank, at land replacement\n            costs. Land tenants shall be entitled to compensation based\n            upon land under statute, while land users, will be entitled\n            to compensation for crop losses, entitled to land\n            replacement, and income restoration. Housing and physical\n            structures will be compensated in cash ay market values, or\n            in-kind compensations at full replacement costs, including\n            labor and relocation expenses prior to displacement.\n            Perennial crop losses will be compensated in cash, upon\n            rates calculated as the one year net agricultural income.\n            Business and income losses compensation shall be covered by\n            payment of half of turnover, for six months. People without\n            property rights will be assisted by securing access to other\n            land for crops (to be approved by authorities), while street\n            vendors on the right of way, should also have access to\n            other locations. Loss of shelter by vulnerable groups, shall\n            be compensated at full replacement value for structures,\n            relocation. Moving expenses will assist affected people\n            during the transition period, while monitoring, and\n            grievance mechanisms will be in place should conflict occur."}, "docdt": "2004-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
