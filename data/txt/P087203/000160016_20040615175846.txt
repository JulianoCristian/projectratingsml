A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

1.      During the period o f civil unrest (1995-1999) the country's physical infrastructure,
particularly electricity, water, and sanitation, suffered from widespread destruction and lack of
maintenance. The sparse coverage and unreliability o f infrastructure services are recognized as
major impediments to sustainable economic growth andpoverty reduction.

2.      The proposed Power and Water Project is a multi-sector project, reflecting a
comprehensive development approach. It is intendedto address prioritized issues across various
infrastructure services - water and sanitation, urban waste management and power - taking into
account all other donor commitments and ongoing or plannedprograms.

3.      The project supports the country's Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP)
andthe National Recovery Strategy, o f which power, rural water supply, and urban sanitation are
key elements. The project would also directly support the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy
(TSS), under the "Accelerating Economic Growth" pillar inthe lendingprogram for FY 04. The
Government has written on several occasions to request Bank support for this operation. The
Ministry o f Energy and Power (MoEP) presently has a multi-dimensional focus on the
development o f the country's power and water supply - a critical initiative for commercial,
industrial and service delivery inthe country.

4.      With the assistance o f the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), the
Government o f Sierra Leone (GoSL) undertook a major diagnostic study o f the institutional
framework and policies that are constraining performance in the power sector. Currently, the
constrained interconnected power system in the Western Area o f Sierra Leone (of 27.2 MW
nominal capacity) i s characterized by daily massive blackouts, high tariffs (approximately US$
0.22/kWh), very high losses (in excess o f 35%) and low collections. This study identified the
major constraints to improved performance in the power sector, most notably, the lack o f
significant private sector involvement as reflected by a shortage o f capital, inefficient
management o f the National Power Authority (NPA), and the need to attract staff with the
required skills and competencies. In addition, the study identified the lack o f any sustained
planning and coordination inthe energy sector, in general, including the modern and traditional
sectors as a major performance constraint.               The Government adopted the major
recommendations o f the report, including the need to undertake major sector reforms
encompassing revising the NPA Act (1982), setting up an independent regulatory framework for
the sector as well as a Policy, Planning and Coordination Unit within the MoEP, and putting in
place a sectoral public-private partnership,         through instituting a performance-oriented
management contract for NPA.

5.      Recent survey reports estimate that only around 30% of the rural population has access to
safe drinking water supply from either water points, gravity fed systems, spring boxes, or rain
water harvesting, etc. Basic sanitation coverage is estimated to have been reduced from 30%, in
1990, to less than 20% as o f the year 2000. This desperate situation of the sector shows that
there i s need for financial assistance to implement programs to improve the situation. In rural
areas, communities are served primarily by unprotected shallow wells, lakes and rivers. Solid
and liquid wastes, human and animal excreta, all contribute to contaminating ground water

sources. Siltation inriverbeds and lakes caused by miningactivities exacerbates the problem for
rural communities insearch o fpotable water.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

6.      The identification o f the Power and Water Project grew out o f sector-specific assessments
o f immediate and longer term infrastructure needs, as Sierra Leone emerges from its post-
conflict era. These assessments were based on recent experience and cumulative knowledge
generated by several Bank projects, notably the Urban Water Supply Project (Cr. 2702-SL), the
Freetown Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project, and the Power Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2356-
SL).

7.      Giventhe breadth of infrastructure requirementsand limitedresources available, strategic
choices were arrived at by establishing a broad overview of sector requirements and
commitments by other development agencies. Important gaps in donor support were identified,
with the aim o f addressing immediate power, rural water supply and sanitation, and urban solid
waste management needs, while supporting longer term efforts to strengthen institutional
capabilities and introduce policy reforms.       The comprehensive development framework, as
opposed to single sector operations, reflects an effort to address infrastructure problems on a
broad front, enabling the Bank to tackle targeted, critical needs across a range o f essential
infrastructure, which would otherwise not be covered by other donor programs at this stage.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

8.      Inthe Interim PRSP the Government proposes a framework with three broad areas for
concentration for the mediumterm: good governance, revival o f the economy, and social sector
development. The general objective o f the governance reform program i s to ensure the effective
functioning o f government machinery for the efficient delivery o f services. The InterimPRSP
aims to revive the economy through implementation o f sector programs, among them power.
This program is to be complemented by the inclusion o f carefully targeted electrification
interventions to facilitate the delivery o f projects in education and health as well as assist the
development o f small enterprises. Part o f the social sector development program focuses on
increasing access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.

9.      The project thus supports all o f these three areas through improved access to essential
power, rural water supply, sanitation, and urban solid waste management services. It will be
accomplished through the rehabilitation and/or strengthening o f essential infrastructure and
institutional capabilities to plan and sustainably manage and maintain these services. The project
will provide funds for targeted critical investments with the aim o f establishing core
infrastructure services that will contribute to poverty reduction and facilitate economic growth.
Concurrently, it will continue to pursue power and water sector reforms aimed at increasing
private sector involvement through investment and public-private partnerships, particularly
through institutinga performance-orientedmanagement contract for NPA and GVWC.

10.     The lendinginstrumentto be used for this project i s a Sector Investment Loan (SIL).

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveand key indicators

11.     The project's development objective i s to improve sustainable access to essential power,
rural water supply and sanitation, and urban solid waste management services. The following
outcomes will be sought:
    Power: Residents o f Western Freetown will have a more stable power supply and a more
    sustainable platform for future adequate power supplies (including the 50 MW Bumbuna
    hydroelectric project, which is expected to be commissioned in late 2006). Over the longer
    term, a national power grid will provide electricity to more people in a more efficient and
    cost effective way, boosting economic and social development capacity with widespread,
    reliable and affordable electrical power. The Project will also ensure the sustained financial
    viability of the NPA, while establishing a sector management and regulatory framework,
    conducive to private, strategic partners' participation inthe future development o f the power
    sector;
    RWS: Rural residents intargeted Districts will have clean drinking water and adequate rural
    sanitation facilities, contributing to improved health;
    SWM: Freetown residents will have a reliable, sustainable, affordable, socially acceptable
    and environmentally safe solid waste collection and disposal system, leading to improved
    general health and living conditions; and
    UWS: The urban water supply utility, GVWC, will be managed in a more commercially
    oriented way, and will improve the quality of service it provides to Freetown's water
    consumers.

12.     The achievement o f these development objectives will be monitored through the
following performance indicators (see details inAnnex 3):

ComponentB: Water Supply, Sanitationand SolidWaste Management-USH5.33 million
[with US$15.00 millionfor IDA includingPPFAdvance: US$.30 million)

B.1. Rural Community Water Supply and Sanitation Subcomponent (US$9.36million with
US$9.03 million for IDA). This component will include rural water supply and sanitation
interventions in four districts (Bo, Kenema, Bombali, and Tonkolili).        The component will

situation in Freetown in the short term (three to six months from effectiveness); and (ii)  the
formation of a more permanent solution to the city's solid waste management problem through
establishmentof the Freetown Solid Waste ManagementCompany (FSWMC).

B.3.     Urban Water Supply Subcomponent (US$2.87 million for IDA). The mission agreed
with GVWC's Board and the National Commission for Privatization that reforms are urgently
needed and will include: (i)providing funding for reform consultancies inthe area of financial
management and business planning, enabling the implementation of commercial oriented
reforms inGVWC; (ii)    funding for emergency works inthe Eastem parts of Freetown andmeters
installation to improve the cost recovery of the service delivery to the low-income communities;

4. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe projectdesign

14.     The project preparation process included several studies providing lessons in project
design and lessons derived from other Bank and DP projects as well as recent sector reviews.

Water and Sanitation

15.     Rural Water Supply subcomponent:            Based on previous interactions with the
SALWACO (under the completed Urban Water Supply Project), the major lesson taken into
account during project design i s the need to address the company's technical and financial
management capacity. Therefore, the component's design includes a relatively high cost of
project management consultants, to be in charge of the implementation process and to work
closely with SALWACO, building its capacity over the life of the project. This will also assure
that the engineering as well as the financial management and procurement aspects of the
component will be handled according to Bank standards and guidelines. SALWACO has put in
place a Project Implementation Unit comprising a project manager, project financial manager,
and procurement officer. These individuals will be integrated into the Project Management
Consultant team to work as counterparts. The experience thus gained will enhance the capacity
building of SALWACO. Additionally, the problem of service sustainability is a critical one,
requiring special focus on, among other issues, proper maintenance procedures, cost recovery
through tariffs, supply chains o f spare parts, and adequate management of the facilities
constructed for the long term. These issues are addressed through the project cycle, further
explained below and inthe relevant annexes.


                                                 6

16.     Solid Waste Management subcomponent: This component i s to establish a SWM
company for Freetown, based on legal and technical expertise and incorporated along
autonomous lines, free o f political interferences. The process i s to be completed within 18
months from credit effectiveness, and subsequent to an emergency cleanup o f Freetown. Given
the fact that the risk involved i s high, and keepinginmindthat it might not succeed, a condition
o f disbursement has been attached (18 months from credit effectiveness). This will: (i)      reduce
the risk o f funds lying idle in case o f failure; and (ii)
                                                          allow reallocation o f these funds, with the
consultation o f GoSL, to other components which are performing well. The preparationteam i s
acknowledging the high risk involved in the establishment o f an autonomous solid waste
management company, and making the necessary provisions for an exit strategy before moving
to a business as usual mode inthe current post conflict situation.

17.     Urban Water Supply subcomponent: Several important lessons learned duringthe urban
water supply project are incorporated into this component. First, any future intervention with
GVWC must address the establishment o f sound institutional arrangements and strengthen the
company's managerial capacity. This i s addressed through the hiring o f an external consultancy
firm, which will assist in the overall management o f GVWC in collaboration with its current
management.      It is acknowledged that it would have been better to design this component
through the introduction o f a performance or management contract, however, the funds required
for such an intervention are not sufficient within this credit. Therefore, the reform consultants
will concentrate on the commercial transformation o f GVWC, paying particular attention to
financial management and governance issues. Second, given the limited capacity o f GVWC to
implement certain aspects o f the reform, the responsibilities and obligations of each party have
been spelled out clearly, leaving limited room for interpretation.           Additionally, the team
acknowledges that this process, even though currently endorsed by GVWC and the NCP, might
encounter difficulties during implementation. Therefore, a disbursement condition o f signing the
consulting contract has been added (six months from credit effectiveness), following the same
logic o f the SWM component explained above. The GVWC Board and the NCP have agreed on
the TOR to be submittedto the Bank for review. The Request for Proposalfor the recruitment o f
the Technical Assistance Provider (TAP) would be advertised by the GVWC through accepted
international channels (UNDevelopment Business) after its review by the Board o f GVWC, the
NCP andthe Bank. The Board o f the GVWC and the NCP would be part o f the TAP recruitment
process and the TAP Team would be answerable to them. The process will started on May 15,
2004.

18.     Policy: Key to sustainable water supply and sanitation service provision i s the
development o f a national policy and strategy. In addition, there is a need for a standardized
baseline assessment tool to better estimate country coverage ratios. The project will cooperate
with several NGOs which are already involved in this process, making use o f the comparative
advantage these institutions possess.         The project will also take notice of the Economic
Commission for Africa's plannedpolicy note, and finance complementing studies required. It is
acknowledged (and financing provisions made accordingly) that more thorough sector work i s
needed in the SWM area, before the proposed company could be incorporated.               Urban water
supply tariffs in Freetown are inadequate and would need to be studied and revised to better
reflect the cost o fproduction.

19.     The overall ICR rating for the Urban Water Supply Project (Cr.2428-SL) was
unsatisfactory (Operations Evaluation Department rating for the project was marginally
                                                    7

unsatisfactory). Overall achievement of the project's physical outputs was considered to be
satisfactory. However, sustainability was rated unlikely. The project did succeed inmaximizing
the yield of the Guma Reservoir, but was weak on efficiency measures that would maximize
asset use while minimizing losses, all of which impact on sustainability. The Government did
not institute important sector policies affecting cost recovery and financial viability. Metered
consumption was found to be minimal, leaving GVWC with inadequate resources to handle
regular maintenanceof assets. The current government agrees withthe universal metering policy
now instituted by GVWC, and the project will provide technical assistance to facilitate
implementation of essential sectoral reforms.

20.      The overall ICR rating for the previous Power Rehabilitation Project (Cr.2356-SL) was
unsatisfactory. The final status report for the Power Rehabilitation Project (PSR) rated the
outcome as satisfactory, mainly basedon the successful emergency action program following the
restructuring of the project in 2000. However, the ICR evaluation found that, in addition to the
force majeure (the civil armed conflict), there were factors within the control of IDA and the
Borrower that were unsatisfactory, such as delays inachieving most of the major implementation
indicators, which should have been in place before the full conflict erupted. Furthermore, the
ICR rated the project's sustainability as unlikely, due to NPA's lack of capacity to finance any
major repairs outside routine maintenance on existing units. The project is addressing these
lessons in several ways. It will: (i) provide further institutional support along with measures to
ensure the sustained financial viability of the NPA; (ii)promote the establishment of an
integrated sector managementandregulatory framework; and (iii)       stabilize an adequate supply of
power while facilitating participation of the private sector inthe future development ofthe power
sector.

21.      Inpost-conflict situations with significant destruction of infrastructure, and inwhich the
physical aspects of power development take precedence over the institutional development
aspects of power systemdevelopment, it i s impossible to move rapidly to the full privatizationof
a power utility, but rather it is important to concentrate on developing creative solutions to
management contracting that could gradually pave the way for future privatization. The project
has incorporated this approach. Indeed, a management contract for NPA is being prepared as a
first step towards its privatization.

22.     Local efficient utility management contractors are likely to have an advantage over
foreign managers inthat they can be more adept inpreparing and selling reform packages to the
public. Indesigning the management contract, it has been acceptedthat local managers with a
proven record o f success would be allowed to associate themselves with foreign managers, as
authorized withinthe Bank's procurement guidelines.

23.     Based on the lessons learned from positive examples of consensus building for private
sector participation in the power sector, it is proposed to put in place a mechanism for
transparent two-way communication with affected stakeholders and not wait for problems to
arise. The communication would explain the purpose and nature of the power sector reform and
inform stakeholders about the expected benefits of the project. At the same time, the
dissemination of information will help to manage expectations and ensure that stakeholders are
aware of the circumstances thatjustify the project.

5. Alternatives consideredand reasons for rejection

24.     The project approach is aiming to balance the huge needs inthe sectors involved with the
very limited resources available. The immediate questionthat comes to mind is whether we are
not trying to do too many things simultaneously. The question was debated at length, internally
as well as externally (with the client) and project design i s the outcome o f these deliberations.
As muchas itmightbe better to concentrate on single sector activities, giventhe limitedcapacity
o f the borrower, the urgent needs in all the sectors involved have had a effect on our decision,
and the team i s aware o f the trade-offs and risks involved. It i s not plausible, given this post
conflict situation, to leave power, solid waste, or water supply and sanitation outside the scope o f
project activities. Additionally, given the fact that there i s limiteddonors' intervention currently
inthese sectors, and that the Bank is expected to play a leadingrole inthe nationalrecovery, the
options o f exclusion were narrowed even further.

25.     The most critical factor affecting project design was the urgent need for IDA to respond
to the Government's request to assist them in addressing critical sectoral reform, capacity
building-and investment needs in all the infrastructure sub-sectors, in a post-conflict situation.
The complementary FY05 Infrastructure Development Project will address critical priorities in
the transport, sea port and aviation sub-sectors. The current operation, under the responsibility
of the MoEP, will address critical needs in the power, rural and urban water supply and solid
waste sectors. For the power sector, this operation also sets the reform and infrastructure
platform for the FY05 50MW Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project (BHP). Institutionalization o f a
performance-oriented management contract for NPA is expected to significantly improve
sectoral performance.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

26.     The water component is exploring several partnership arrangements with NGOs, mainly
in the area of policy related work, identification o f rehabilitation needs by local institutions
operating within the Districts, and collaboration on technical standardization o f equipment,

27.     For the power component, a preliminary commitment has been obtained from the OPEC
Fund/BADEA in the amount o f US$2.5 million (approximately) and the possibility of getting
additional funding from the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) i s beingexplored.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

28.     Two Project Implementation Units (PIUs) will be established in order to efficiently
manage the implementation o f the Power and Water Project components, One PIU, to be located
within NPA, will implement the power component and one PIU will be established within
SALWACO to implement the: (i)rural water supply subcomponent; (ii) water supply  urban
subcomponent in Freetown with GVWC; and (iii) solid waste management investments
                                                         the
targeted for Freetown.



                                                  9

29.      The NPA PIU will be responsible for effectively implementing the US$3.77 million
capacity building and institutional strengthening subcomponent (excluding workforce
rationalization), and the US$l4.11 million works/goods investment package. A Special Account
(SA-P) would be established under NPA to accommodate the IDA expenditures for the power
component. A Management Steering Committee comprised o f representatives of the: (i)      NCP;
(ii)NPA; and chaired by (iii)MoEP would be established to provide oversight to the
implementation of this subcomponent.         It also would be responsible for managing the
rationalization of NPA's workforce. The organizational arrangements of the NCP (which will
manage three of the Power Sector Reform subcomponents) as well as the proposed Policy,
Planning and Coordination Unit (PPCU) inMoEP are set out inAnnex 6. The Government has
agreedto operationalize the PPCUby the end of September 2004.

30.     At present, NPA is gaining increasing experience in handling procurement, through its
management of the EU-funded Western Area Emergency Rehabilitation of the Transmission and
Distribution Network and the PPF for this Project. Under the project, NPA's procurement
capacity will be strengthened through: (a) hiring of consultants to assist the NPA PIU in
managing the project procurement process and supervising its implementation; and (b) providing
training on Bank/public procurement, through Bank-sponsored workshops. The project also
includes funding for staff to attend Bank supportedregional procurement courses at the Ghana
Institute for Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) or the East and Southern Africa
Management Institute (ESAMI).

31.      The Water Supply/Solid Waste Management PIU will be located in SALWACO to
manage the investments under the rural water supply, GVWC urban water supply, and SWM
subcomponents. A Project Management Consultancy firm (PMC) will be engagedfor 4 years by
SALWACO to manage the rural water supply subcomponent and assist the PIU in its overall
support to these three subcomponents. The firm will provide experts in the areas of financial
management, engineering (design and construction supervision), and procurement.               A
Management Contract/Technical Assistance will be entered into for 3 years to provide the
institutional support for improved corporate financial management and institutional reforms of
the GVWC. A TA consultant will be appointed to assist with the establishmentof the FSWMC.
A Special Account (SA-W) will be established to accommodate the IDA expenditures of these
three subcomponents. The SA-W will be under the authority o f the Water Supply Division
(WSD) with a subsidiary Project Account operated under the same authority.            A steering
committee comprised of representatives of the: (i)    SALWACO; (ii)  GVWC; (iii)   FSWMC; (iv)
MoEP/WSD; (v) Ministry o f Local Government; (vi) Ministry of Youth and Sports (vii) Ministry
of Health and Sanitation (Environmental Health Division) and (viii) Ministry of Social Welfare,
Gender and Children's Affairs (Social Services Division) will be established to provide an
oversight to the implementation of these three subcomponents.

32.     It is envisaged and expected that these two PIUs would move towards integration into
their respectiveparentagenciedministries as the institutional reforms come to fruition. The PIUs
will establish an exit strategy as apart oftheir function andresponsibility.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation of outcomedresults

33.     Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) i s o f prime importance in a post-conflict environment,
where capacity i s weak and complete institutional arrangements for M&E are still being put in
place. In this context it i s essential to ensure strategic and systematic monitoring o f project
outcomes and results, so that any needed adjustments can be made on a timely basis.
Information on the intermediate results, indicators, and arrangements for results monitoring can
be found inAnnex 3 for boththe power andthe water components.

34.     For the water component, regular reviews will take place at which progress towards
targets can be assessed, implementationbottlenecks identified, and solutions found. The reviews
will include independent assessments by consultants, reviews o f official records, targeted
surveys, and focus groups with key stakeholders. Results o f the reviews will be discussed at an
annual stakeholder workshop.       Bank supervision missions will be timed to overlap with the
annual workshop. The MTR will provide another occasion for an in-depth review o f project
results.   M&E data will emerge from the various executing agencies.              It will be their
responsibility to pass it on to the Bank via the reporting requirements. The PIU located at
SALWACO will produce quarterly reports to send to the MoEP and key stakeholders.

35.     For the power component, a consultant has been recruited to assist the PIU and the NCP
instrengtheningtheir capacity inthe area of M&Eo fproject results. The consultant is expected
to prepare a monthly report on project data, as well as to organize training sessions aimed at
building project ownership and evaluation capacity. The report will include pre-established
targets for key result indicators that will be usedby the various stakeholders to monitor progress
made in implementing this project. The data collection exercise for this component i s also
organizedthrough the consultant.

36.     The proposed arrangements for the M&E function will be performed by the above-
mentionedconsultant who will:

(i)     establish baseline parameters for output and outcome indicators shown inAnnex 3;
(ii)    aggregate sub-project level indicators into the project level indicators o f Annex 3
        obtained from the PIU, NCP andNPA;
(iii)   send a monthly progress report on project implementation to the World Bank as defined
        inthe project implementationplan; and
(iv)    assist inconducting mid-term review and advise on corrective actions.

37.     M&E reports will be delivered in year 1 on a monthly basis (baseline confirmation);
years 2 and 3 (mid-termreview and opportunity for the definition o f an exit strategy); and year 5
(at project completion).

38.     The key performance indicators used to monitor NPA performance will include: energy
generated in kWh; station use inkWh; energy sold inkWh; commercial losses (%); sales billed
(in kWh); revenues collected (Le'000); revenues to billed (%); total debtors (Le'000); debtors
expressed as months o f sales (months o f sales); cost o f sales (Le'000); cost o f sales per kWh
generated (Le'000); cost o f sales per kWh sold (Le/kWh); MFO used (kg); DFO used (kg);
lubricant used (kg); kWh generatedlubricant (kWWkg); number o f workforce including
contractors; number o f customers; and number o f customers per employee.

                                                 11

39.      The key ratios defined to monitor the financial health o fNPA comprise: rate o f returnon
average fixed assets inoperation; debt service coverage ratio; returnon equity; net profit margin;
revenuehales ratio; gross operating margin; debt to equity ratio; collection ratio; and debtorhales
ratio.

4.      Sustainability

40.      The sustainability ofthe water and sanitation facilities rests on three key elements:

A. Community willingness and capacity to manage and sustain services: To help communities
manage their services in the long-term, capacity will be strengthened in community-based
organizations, operations and maintenance, financial management, hygiene education, and
effective water usage and disposal. This will be done through sensitization sessions by teams
composed o f SALWCO district level staff (to be transferred to the elected local councils) in
association with the consultants' sociologist and community development specialists, (recruited
specially for that purpose). Management of operation and maintenance o f completed facilities
will be the sole responsibility o f the community, with day-to-day management provided by their
water and sanitation committee (WSC). The WSC would monitor the use o f the water points,
collect tariffs, keep accounts, and undertake routine and preventive maintenance either on their
own or out-sourced to the private sector. For point sources, members o f the WSC (normally
women) would be trained to perform routine maintenance and minor repairs, while area
mechanics would be trained to install pumps; relatively more difficult repairs will be made by
the distributor o f the pumps. When there is more than one water point in a community, Water
User Groups (WUGs) would be established for the operation o f each water point and would
collect revenues to be transferred to the WSC.

B. Availability of spare parts accessible by the communities: The establishment of a spare parts
distribution system will be considered in order to ensure the sustainability o f the water supply
facilities. Subproject procedures include an initial purchase o f the most frequently needed parts
for at least the first six months after project implementation. The goal will be to have spare parts
available for the communities to buy within reasonable distances, possibly through regional
outlets.

C.    Good implementation and construction o f facilities built, while transferring capacity to
SALWACO, GVWC, and FSWMC: Ensuring sustainability will also require that all project
contracts will be implemented with high engineering standards, while capacity i s transferred to
the communities to enable them to perform routine maintenance and operation for hand dug
wells and boreholes. Some o f the systems to be constructed under the project will be more
complex, large, gravity fed systems (supplying water to several villages and a substantially larger
number o f people).      Sustainability in these cases will be ensured by a combination o f small
repairs and preventive maintenance undertaken by communities, while the overall technical
responsibility for maintenance (requiring engineering skills) will be assigned to the technical
staff o f SALWACO, based at the district level.

41.      The sustainability o f the power component is supported by GoSL's commitment to, and
ownership of, the sector reform program. It rests mainly with the implementation o f a number o f
policy actions and effective achievement o ftheir respective objectives. These actions include the

                                                   12

selection o f a management contract for NPA and the promotion o f economic tariffs for sales of
power to improve both the efficiency o f the management o f its operations and long-term
financial viability o f the company. The proposed actions will address the issue o f lack o f
capacity to finance any major repairs outside routine maintenance on existing units, which was
identified as the main reason why the sustainability of the previous power project was rated
unlikely in its ICR. Other important policy actions contributing to the sustainability o f the
project include the revision o f the Electricity Law andNPA Act and the establishment o f a sector
regulatory framework, which will all help create an enabling environment that i s conducive to
transparent private sector participation in the energy sector; and the creation of a National
Energy Policy Planning and Coordinator Unit (NEPPCU) within the (MoEP) to better plan for
the least cost development of the sector. Finally, the T&D investments to reduce technical
losses, as well as the commercial actions taken by the new management contractor to
significantly reduce the commercial losses, are expected to yield substantial improvements to
ensure the long term viability o f the power systems o fNPA.

42.       The project will establish a new regulatory and institutional environment with new
working methodologies and managing practices. The establishment o f sound communication
activities will help to ensure that the different actors involved participate in the transformation
process and accept the new environment.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economicandfinancialanalyses

I.01     Economic

Power component

43.      The power component comprises: (i) sector reforms; (ii)capacity building and
                                                 power
institutional strengthening;     (iii)instituting a four-year performance oriented management
contract for NPA; (iv) supporting the NPA project implementation unit (PIU) I,including
providing TA for project supervision and management;             (v) the infrastructure component
comprising rehabilitation of the Kingtom thermal power plant; rehabilitation and reinforcement
of the NPA low voltage distribution network; rehabilitation and reinforcement of the medium
and high voltage distribution network (including a 33 kV sub transmission line), and supplying
prepayment meters and other technology to address non-technical losses; and (vi) setting up a
program to address environmental and social issues arising from implementing (v) above. The
methodological approach outlined below is for parts (iii) (vi); qualitative discussions of
                                                            through
the project's unquantifiable benefits are also provided. The following three-step approach was
followed in undertaking the economic analysis of the power component of the Project (more
detailed results are includedinAnnex 9).

Step 1:         Analysis of the power market andforecasts of market (demand) growth. The
                objective is to demonstrate that a market exists for the output of the project
                component:

Step 2:         Least-costanalysis: to demonstrate that the proposedinterventions under the
                project are the least-cost means of serving the incremental demand.

Step 3:         Estimation of the profitability ofthe Project as measuredby the economic internal
                rate of return.

44.      Demand Growth Analysis. A review has been performed of historic levels of demand
for the Western Area System of the National Power Authority (NPA).              Actual demand has
clearly been influencedby lack of generating capacity (currently 28.1 M W to serve more than
40,000 customers in the Western Area) and consequent load shedding. Most customers are
served for 12 hours every two days. The day of peak generation was December 5, 2002 and the
maximum value was 26.5MW. Energy losses and auxiliary consumption must be deducted from
this value to determine the (constrained) maximum demand, which is estimated to be 18.4 M W
(of which 5.8MW would not have beenbilled).

45.      Since the major conflict of 1999 when the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Sierra
Leone shrank significantly, there has been sustained growth, peaking at 6.5% in2003. The IMF
forecast of real GDP growth in Sierra Leone posits a 6. 8% in 2004, followed by 7.1 % in 2005
and 6.9% in2006. UnpublishedIMF staff calculations project 6.7 % growth in2007 and 6.6% in
2008. To undertake the economic analysis o f the Project, three annual growth scenarios of peak
electricity demand (in MW) were developed: 3; 4; and 7%. On this basis, the projected annual
growth rate in unconstrained peak demand (in MW) of 4% for the base forecast seems to be
                                                  16

conservative, while 7% i s a reasonably highforecast and 3% a pessimistic scenario. For the base
case, peak demand inthe WesternArea system i s projectedto increase from 30.0 MW in2002 to
40 41 MW in2010 and to 60.8 MW in2020.

46.     Least Cost Analysis. At the level of the power system, the economic competitiveness
of a specific power project comes from its contribution to total power system cost savings in
meetingthe system demand. In the context o f Sierra Leone and in the areas o f activity being
studied, the determination o f the least-cost development is often implicit and shaped by the most
urgent needs and resource constraints. Elements(iii)   through (vi) of the project, as described in
para. 39 were evaluated and verifiedto be least cost.

47.     Economic Analysis. This section covers costs, benefits, results, sensitivity analysis,
macroeconomic impacts and non-quantifiable benefits.

48.     Costs. The following costs have been included in the analysis: (a) investment costs of
the project power component (See items (iii)   through (vi) as set out inpara 39 above); (b) annual
costs, including Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs o f the project itself and related
incremental costs o f the assets added under the project. Annual costs also include the cost of
supplyingthe additional energy associated with the Project, which is valued interms o f the bulk
supply tariff. Working capital has been neglected in the analysis because it is generally small
compared to the other cost components.

49.     An average economic lifetime o f a plant o f 30 years is assumed for T&D plant and 10
years for other equipment. The lifetime o f the Kingtom generation assets i s taken to be 5 years,
but replacement has not been assumed after that time due to the reduced use o f the assets post-
Bumbuna. Operation and maintenance costs have beentaken as 1.5% o f capital costs per year.

50.     Benefits.The project's quantitative benefits comprise: (a) reductions inunserved energy;
(b) fuel savings due to improvementsinfuel efficiency and reduced auxiliary consumption; and
(c) reduction in technical losses and meeting growth in electricity demand. Non-technical losses
do not have a direct economic benefit and are therefore excluded.

51.     Because o f the present failure to meet electricity demand, low income domestic
consumers are obliged to use paraffin (kerosene) lamps and candles for lighting, while
commercial, industrial and high-income domestic consumers use standby power generators. An
average cost o f unserved energy (COUE) can be estimated from these alternatives and applied to
the project components that supply such a demand. A conservative approach has been used,
equatingCOUE at US$0.25/kWH Le. slightly inexcess o f NPA's average tariff (US$0.22/kWh).
With the planned commissioning o f the 50 MW Bumbuna hydroelectric project inlate 2006, the
supply constraint should be eased and therefore benefits accruing to COUE have only been
included inthe analysis through 2006.

52.    Fuel savings due to improvements in generation efficiency and reduced auxiliary
consumption are based on the economic cost of bulk supply o f energy (US$O.l l/kWh) above the
Bumbuna firm annual supply of 157 GWh through 2010. Fuel taxes and duties have been
excluded from the economic analysis. Reductions in technical losses and growth in electricity
demand are valuedat the cost o f bulk supply of energy.


                                                 17

53.       Results of the Economic Analysis. The project has been evaluated using the EIRR
approach with all costs and benefits expressed in constant prices. The internal rate o f return o f
the project i s the discount rate at which the net present value (NPV) o f the total costs equals that
o f the estimated project benefits. Comparing costs and benefits with and without the project as a
whole, as set out inAnnex 9, it can be seen to be economically viable with an economic internal
rate o f return (EIRR) o f 20.8%.

54.      Sensitivity Analysis. The rates o f return are robust as indicated by calculating
sensitivities with respect to key parameters, including reasonable increases in actual investment,
O&M and supply costs and decreases inloss reduction and sales assumptions.

55.      MacroeconomicImpacts.These impacts o fthe project include: (i)          external resource in-
flow made possible by the project from IDA credit (US$17.7M for works covered by the present
analysis), and external support from other donors, which would release government resources for
other development programs, especially in the social sector; and (ii)     savings on oil import bill
due to improved efficiency o f fuel use in the repaired power stations and through displacing
inefficient, small auto-generation with central generation (fuel savings alone due to works
covered here calculated at US$23.1M NFV).

56.       Non-quantifiable Benefits. The Project's            intangible benefits,    including their
contributions to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), include: (i)           reducing poverty by
stimulating economic growth; (MDG 1 target 1); (ii)         improvements in healthcare through the
provision o f reliable energy supply to hospitals, clinics and community health centres; (MDG 4
target 5 and MDG 5 target 6); improvements in education through the provision o f reliable
energy supply to nurseries, schools and colleges; (MDG 2 target 3); (iii)     improvements inwater
supply through the provision of reliable energy for water pumpingand treatment; (MDG 7 target
10); (iv) improvements in environmental quality due to reduced emissions from power plants
through efficiency improvement and through displacing inefficient, small auto-generation with
central generation; (MDG 7 target 9); and (v) improvements in management and technical
operational skills o f NPA staff from capacity building and training, which will lead to improved
productivity, better management and operations.

57.      Financial Analysis Costs & Benefits. Capital and O&M costs are identical to those
                               -
used for the economic analysis. The cost o f bulk supply has been based on actual data provided
by NPA. Benefits are interms of revenue received byNPA based on the presenttariff structure.
Technical losses have been valued at the cost o f bulk supply o f energy. Non-technical losses
have beenvalued interms o f revenuelost.

Water Component

58.      The objective o f the project i s to improve the sustainable access to rural water supply and
sanitation, and urban solid waste management services. The economic analysis i s performed on
a per sub-component basis and divided into three main parts, which include: (i)            rural water
supply; (ii) waste management; and (iii) water supply.
             solid                                urban

59.      Rural WaferSupply Component. For the rural water supply sub-component, the analysis
consists o f a cost-benefit calculation o f the infrastructure investments simulating a "with-and
without-project" scenario modeled over 12 years and using a 12% discount rate (for a detailed
                                                   18

calculation see Annex 9). Given the fact that the project i s prepared under a very short time
frame and the actual investments have not yet been finalized, a cost-benefit calculation will be
performed for each o f the technologies to be used (this i s referredto, at times, as a "framework"
type project - an indicative framework o f works have been identified and engineering studies are
on-going; but the actual works have not yet been agreed upon). More particularly, when the
scope o f works i s finalized, the rules o f engagement require that each sub-project will include a
financial and economic analysis, ensuringcost effectiveness. Meanwhile, the methodology used
includes a generic cost benefit calculation, based on the various types of proposed investments
(gravity fed systems and hand dug wells).

60.     The project will provide benefits in the form o f improved water supply services and
sanitation, and hygiene education to an estimated 150,000 people in four main districts o f Sierra
Leone. In the cost benefit calculations, costs include all project costs plus increased recurrent
costs. Benefits streams will accrue from improved availability o f water supply in towns and
rural communities, and improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Some o f the issues to be
addressed within the economic analysis include: (i)     affordability, willingness to pay, consumers
tariff, and financial impact on beneficiaries; and (ii)   sensitivity o f the main parameters on the
NPV and ERR o fthe investmentvalues.

61.     Urban Water Supply Component The urban water supply component will support the
urban water supply utility, GVWC, in three main areas: (i)         provision o f funds for financing
reform consultancies inthe area o f financial management and business planning -US$1 million;
(ii)fundingofemergency works(extendingthesecondaryandtertiarydistributionnetworkto
the already constructed primary line) in low income areas o f East Freetown and the installation
o f meters - US$1 million; and (iii)   the financing o f urgently needed equipment and training for
GVWC staff - US$0.45 million.

62.     The economic rationale behind investing US$1 million in hiring reform consultants i s to
enable a better utilization of, and return on, the physical investments already made in the
GVWC's infrastructure, which led to an increase inthe production capacity and extension o f the
city's transmission network (at a cost o f US$36 million).            Nevertheless, the project was
unsuccessful in improving the management and institutional setup o f GVWC. Therefore, in
congruency with the ICR's main recommendations, it was decided to devote a large percentage
o f the available funds to ensure an improvement o f the financial management and business
practices o f GVWC. Although a quantitative calculation o f this investment will not necessarily
make much sense, the qualitative analysis assumes that giventhe fact that the consultants will be
runningthe business and financial practices o f the company more effectively, savings (benefits)
are likely to derive from improved: (i)   book keeping, tracking o f funds, and procurement related
practices; (ii)commercial practices related to the utilization o f existing assets; (iii)  aggressive
implementation o f a meter installation program and stricter customers' disconnection policies,
resulting inincreased revenues and commercial ratios; and (iv) a better detection o f leakages and
technical losses o f the distribution system. It i s noted that even though the proposed structure i s
not contractually binding, since it i s not a performance contract per se, the consultant's TOR
includes specific actions, targets, and reporting, aimed at ensuring a results oriented contract,
withthe ability ofthe supervisors to direct actions along the proposedthree-year period.

63.     The civil works investment part o f this component aims to complement the recently
completed main pipe transferred to the Eastern parts o f Freetown. By extendingthe distribution

                                                   19

network and connecting low-income areas o f Freetown, these works will be contributing towards
the objective o f the completed urban water supply project's works, increasing water supply
coverage ratios. The economic rationale, and subsequently rate o f return on these works, i s
likely to be high, as currently they are not benefitingfrom the large investments already incurred
by transferring the mainpipeline to that area.

64.     Solid Waste Management SubComponent. The solid waste management component
was designed based on a field study performed recently inFreetown. It aims to balance the short
term need o f removing the major health hazards associated with the large piles o f solid waste
currently situated in Freetown, and the long term need o f establishing a sustainable collection
systeminthe city.

1.02    Financial

Power

65.     The component's financial management system would be comprehensive and allow for
the proper accounting o f all the transactions at every level o f project implementation. The
system would be capable o f producing Financial Management Reports, as required by IDA, as
well as meeting project information needs in a timely manner.              The project Financial
Management system will consist o f a proper book o f accounts, and a reliable and functional
internal control system. It does have competent, experienced accounting and financial staff with
more than three years o f experience with the previous Bank-financed project. Annual audits will
be carried out by both external auditors selected on the basis o f competitive bidding and the
Government's own Auditor General and/or Accountant General to ensure full involvement o f the
Ministry o f Finance inproject implementation (see Annex 7 for more details). RegardingNPA,
its management and financial accounts are held on numerous ad-hoc spreadsheets and its general
ledger is a manual paper-based system. A new operational software accounting package was
implementedinApril 2004.

66.     The financial issues that have been identified during various Bank missions as critical to
the successful implementationo fthe project include: the lowrate o frevenues collectionbyNPA;
the high level o f system losses, about 40.8% as measured for 2002, including generation
auxiliary consumption o f about 5.3%, technical losses o f 13.6 % and non-technical losses o f
21.9%; and the system inefficiency resulting from the very aged status o f the installations
leading to high operating costs, including fuel and lube oil consumption. In addition, a number
o f factors have contributed to exacerbate the already precarious financial situation o f the utility:
the historical cost accounting in a environment with highinflation inwhich NPA's fixed assets
have not been revalued for a long time has resulted in understating NPA's losses and making
inadequate provision for the replacement o f the fully depreciated assets; and uneconomic tariffs
setting structure which has worsened "A's     financial situation.

67.     The following project financial covenants for the power component o f the PWP have
been designed to appropriately address the above-mentioned issues. The covenants would
include, but are not limitedto the following ratios: (i) total revenues should be equivalent to not
less than the sum o f cash operating expenses and interest and other charges on debt; (ii)        the
annual rate o f return o f approximately 4 percent on average current value o f NPA's fixed assets
(or on revalued fixed assets) in operation; and (iii) the debt service coverage ratio whereby the

                                                 20

net revenues o f NPA should be at least 1.5 times the estimated debt service requirements. The
project would further seek the adoption o f an automatic adjustment formula that captures the cost
o f fuel and the exchange rate betweenthe dollar and the leone, as part o f the measures to help
buildthe financial viability ofNPA.

Water

68.     The review o f the past, present and future financial situation o f GVWC indicates that the
main issues of the sector lie with weak management, poor revenue collection, excessive (about
40%) technical and commercial losses, weak financial structure, and significant operating losses.
These deficiencies, which are further exacerbated by the extremely low tariff rate (probably one
o f the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa), have reached the point o f endangering the operational
performance o f the company and its ability to adequately service the Freetown area. As per the
ICR o f the Urban Water Supply Project o f Cr. 2702 -SLY dated December 24, 2003, none o f
GVWC's financial targets set at appraisal were met and performance related to these targets has
even worsened over the last few years. In 2002, the rate o f retum on average fixed assets was
2.08%, based on the audited financial statements, compared to a rate o f 8.1% estimated at
appraisal. Furthermore, the nominal tariffs GVWC currently charges will not even enable it to
reach financial equilibrium. It i s important to note that because of the civil unrest, massive
dislocation o f people, and temporary breakdown o f economic activity, GVWC could neither
operate as planned, nor could it adjust water charges periodically to match operational costs as
was agreed inthe Urban Water Supply Project Agreement.

69.     Currently, less than 30% o f consumers pay their bills. Consumers paying at the general
water rate presently owe Le9 billion or about US$3.2 million, with commercial consumers and
the Government owing Le12 billion or US$4.3 million and Le4.5 billion or US$1.6 million,
respectively, totaling L e 25.5 billion or US$9.1 million, which represents 2.5 times the end-2003
revenues of GVWC. According to appraisal agreements under the Urban project, tariffs were to
be adjusted periodically to enable the company to increase its financial independence.

70.     To address these issues, the project contains major TA which will include a Water Utility
Operation andManagement Expert, an Accounting and Financial Expert, and a number o f short-
term specialists and trainers. In addition, the GVWC Board and the NCP have committed to
undertake numerous reforms (see Annex 4b for details).

2. Technical

Power

71.     The standards and designs appliedinthe study for the rehabilitation and refurbishment o f
the NPA Western Area transmission and distribution system generally conform to recognized
international standards, such as those of the Intemational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
Sierra Leone has generally adopted Britishpractice in overall system planning and design and
this has been respected, particularly in the choice of voltage levels and network operating
philosophy. International best practice has been appliedinterms o f quality of supply, reliability
and loss levels.



                                                 21

Water

72.     The project involves water supply and sanitation civil works and goods that employ
standard techniques and installations, which are well established in the industry. The
government and SALWACO are accustomed to such standards and designs, and they are
considered by the World Bank and international engineering experts to represent an appropriate
level o f technology for Sierra Leone.          The project will also be undertaken according to
appropriate standards and technology suitable to the local conditions, such as the environment
and the level o fthe proficiency o f users and local technicians.

TechnicalRuralWater SupplyDesignand ImplementationIssues

73.     SALWACO will engage a Project Management Consultancy firm (PMC) for 4 years to
manage the rural water supply component.             This will include provision o f expertise in
engineering design and construction supervision. The project management consultants would
helpSALWACO develop technical guidelines and specifications over the life oftheproject. Inthe
meantime, internationally acceptable engineering standards would be used, accompanying the
Project Implementation Plan. Additionally, a Water Analysis Technician from the National
Water Analysis Laboratory in Freetown, in collaboration with district-based technicians, will be
responsible for carrying out drinking water quality monitoring (surface and groundwater) to
ensure that it i s safe for drinking in light o f special problems that the communities may
encounter, in accordance with guidelines established by the Laboratory and further emphasized
inthe Project ImplementationPlan. The cost of upgrading the Laboratory, including the supply
o f portable water testing and logistics, i s provided inthe investmentcosts.

LocationStudiesof Well Sites

74.     Geophysical surveys will be carried out by the implementing agency (PMC) using an
experienced hydrogeologist and trained technicians, accompanied by a sociologist enabling the
team to deal with problematic site choices.          It will involve the use of resistivity survey
equipment, motor-driven and test-drilling hand equipment which will help determine water
quality and quantity.    Test-drilling will be required for areas where the basement rocks are
relatively shallow. The geological formation data during the test-drilling will be collected and
logged ina logbook, which will be used to determine the optimum well sites taking into account
water quality and quantity.

Constructionof Water Wells and Rehabilitationof Boreholes

75.     The construction of water wells involves the dry digging o f the well shaft in the dry
season. Water table and lining the same with reinforced concrete by direct labodbackyard
contractors o f wells in various villages in Bo, Kenema Tonkolili and Bombali districts will be
pursued. As per established practice, the optimum well site ineach location will be preceded by
hydro-geological and line surveys to be carried out by the executing agency. Each well will be
fitted with a hand pump. In addition, a number o f existing boreholes will be rehabilitated; the
rehabilitation will consist of hand pump replacement or repair, flushing o f stagnant water, and
disinfection.



                                                    22

Constructionof Latrines

76.      Construction o f public and individual sanitation facilities will be promoted in
communities. This will involve the safe management o f human excreta (through the construction
o f individual and public latrines). The PIU will provide the generic designs, supervise the works,
and possibly provide items such as reinforced squatting slabs, roofing sheets and nails, sand-
crate blocks and vent pipes with fly screens. Community-based organizations and NGOs would
be the most likely implementation agencies to promote and implementa latrines program. These
sanitation investments require additional understanding and studies before any construction
should be permitted to begin. Immediately following the effectiveness o f the credit, a workshop
will be held in each o f the four districts to assemble the appropriate district health staff and
existing NGOs which are involved inimproved sanitation services provision to develop the best
mechanisms for delivering improved sanitation services under the credit, recognizing the limited
funds available. At this point intime, it is unclear as to the best implementationmechanism, but
it is a must that this difficult element be an integral part of the service delivery in any village
participating in the water supply investments. NGOs may promote the involvement o f women
and school children inthis element o fthe project.

Construction'of GravityFedWater Supply Systems and SpringBoxes

77.      This work involves the construction o f four gravity fed water supply systems inthe Bo,
Kenema and Tonkolili and Bombali Districts to serve close to 0.1 million people in several
towns and villages. The main materials requiredare pipes and fittings, steel rods, cement, etc. In
addition, a number o f springboxes will also be constructed.

3. Fiduciary

78.      Overall, the project will result in positive fiscal impacts on GoSL's finances.         In
particular, a well-managed N P A will first service its long-overdue debts to the Government
starting from end-2005 and pay its taxes when it becomes profitable. The additional revenues
arising from this situation would be directed towards the least cost development o f the sector. In
addition, should NPA become profitable, it will be able to finance its fuel needs from its own
resources, thus saving GoSL some budgetary resources that could be used for other activities.

4. Social

79.      In the context of reconstruction after the civil unrest, this project provides a major
opportunity to contribute to development through the improved provision and quality o f
necessary infrastructure, such as water and electricity services. Better access to water in rural
areas, for example, will increase health standards in general and improve living conditions,
especially for women. Solid waste collection in Freetown will help eliminate the immediate
health hazards o f huge waste heaps, which are presently located close to residential and
commercial areas. A more regular and steady supply o f electricity will promote private
investments, increase security, and improve working and studying conditions.

80.      It is anticipated that implementation o f both the water and the power components will
have some adverse impacts on the human environment inthe form o f necessary land acquisition.
It is less likely to happen inwater supply than inthe power supply component civil works. The

                                                 23

power component includes rehabilitation and enforcement o f the Right o f Way (ROW)o f a 33
kV distribution line, which stretches from the Kingtom substation to the Black Hall Road
substation, 12 kilometers away. The land required for the ROWwill affect people currently
living and doing business under the line itself. The number of affected households is estimated
to be around 1,000. People affected will be physically relocatedto new homes located innearby
areas, based on the following criteria: (i) iftheir homes are situated inthe ROWandthey lose a
substantial part of their assets; or (ii)
                                        ifthey cannot for that reasonremainatthe present location.
Alternatively, if the impact i s lower and does not affect their home structure in such a way that
allows them to remain at the present location, they will receive compensation incash or inkind.
For land acquisitions that may be requiredduring project implementation for both the water and
power components, but for which exact locations have not yet beendetermined, the Resettlement
Policy Frameworks (RPF) have beenprepared. It describes the procedures for compensation to
affected people due to project activities inthe water and power sectors, respectively.

81.     Representatives o f the rural communities inBo, Kenema, Tonkolili and BombaliDistricts
will work together with the technical survey teams to decide on the optimal sites for wells and
boreholes, VIP latrines, and gravity fed water supply systems. The power distribution towers
and lines are already constructed throughout the existingroutes in Freetown, and, therefore, the
public will not be participating inthe design stage. They are, however, actively participating in
the surveys and preparation o f the resettlement and compensation plan. Concerning the future
investments in the Western Area, the local community will be participating in the decision
making process concerning rehabilitation opportunities.

82.     The PIP includes indicators for monitoring and evaluation.        The RAP provides the
indicators for measuring both process and outcomes o f resettlement and compensation and it i s
advised that independent observers (such as NGOs) be responsible for monitoring resettlement.
The MoEP will monitor and evaluate project implementation through its utility agencies
(SALWACO and NPA) while the environmental and social development specialists in the PIU
will be responsible for the day-to-day monitoring o fproject activities. The World Bank will also
monitor and evaluate the results during its supervision missions.

5. Environment

83.     The water component will sensitize communities in the environmental aspects o f their
sub-projects, and train them inhygiene and sustainable use o f water and sanitation facilities. The
approach i s meant to incorporate environmental concerns into the project design and focus on
environmentally sound criteria for siting boreholes and wells, construction methods for
wellheads and aprons, waste water disposal techniques, and appropriate on-site latrine location.
Subprojects will have to meet environmental standards as described in the Environmental and
Social Management Framework (ESMF).

84.     Water Resources: During subproject preparation, the safe yield and potential drawdown
o f water levels inthe vicinity of the boreholes will be checked to confirm that the proposedwater
source i s sustainable and will not adversely affect nearby wells. Excreta disposal facilities will
need to be set back from water sources. If surface sources are developed, the sustainability o f
the proposed abstraction and the impact o f withdrawals on downstream beneficial uses will be
assessed.

85.     Erosion: The construction of boreholes, pumping stations, pipelines and storage tanks
can result inerosion and loss of vegetation. Measures to mitigate these impacts will be included
into construction contracts.

86.     Wastewater: The main impact of water supply systems i s the wastewater that i s
generated, and which will produce muddy pathways and standing pools of water where
mosquitoes breed, if not disposed of properly. Design and construction contracts must provide
for wastewater disposal at all piped water outlets. Procedures to govern private operator(s)
handling o f such environmental issues will be includedintheir contracts. Provision would also
haveto be made for waste disposal at water treatment sites.

87.     Power component: One o f the power component's activities i s the rehabilitation of the
KingtomPower Station inFreetown. The "Environmental Audit of the Kingtom Power Station,
Freetown" has taken stock of the environmental management of the station during the past few
years and identified the actions required to be taken in order to stop the present air, soil and
marine pollution. The implementation of the managementplanwill make Kingtom station safer,
cleaner, and a more environmentally sound operating station. The "Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) of the 33 kV Transmission and Distribution Network of the Westem Area in
Sierra Leone" has assessed the impact in this area of Freetown and recommended mitigation
actions. Attention has also been paid to the management of hazardous materials such as PCBs.
Relevant chapters in the "Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook", including safety
aspects, have been addressed. The PIU, which has been established within NPA has been
building the local capacity to address the environmental and social issues (resettlement) by
recruiting one environmental and one social development specialist.

6. Safeguard policies

88.     The environmental category i s "B" and the safeguard screening category i s "S2", which
means that there are recognizable adverse impacts on the biophysical and human environment,
butthat the impacts are evaluatedto be of such naturethat adequatemeasurescanbe putinplace
inorder to minimize andmitigate the impacts. OP 4.01 andOP 4.12 are triggered bythe project,
as shown below, but there i s also a possibility that OPN 11.03 and OP 4.37 may be triggered as
the project proceeds and specific investments are identified and locations determined. The
ESMFhas providedthe appropriate guidance onhowto meetthe requirementsofthose policies.

89.      EnvironmentalAssessment: The procedures for screening and assessment of the ESMF
have been followed. The solid waste management plan provides for guidance on how to manage
the existing waste heaps as well as future waste collection and management. The audit for
Kingtom power plant and the EA for the Western Area identified the environmental issues and
provided for further mitigation measures. For the Western Area power distribution, the major
issues are related to health and security while at Kingtom, the environmental issues were related
to air, soil and marine pollution.

90.      Resettlement: For the water component, a small amount o f land will be needed for
boreholes, pumping stations, storage tanks and communal water points. Construction o f these
facilities as well as pipelines can result intemporary or permanent loss o f land, crops and other
means o f income generation. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared to
provide guidance on how to compensate affected people in such cases. Thepower component
has a greater impact as it i s implementedin Freetown and requires substantial land acquisition.
Therefore, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared for people and property affected
by the 33 kV sub-transmission line from Kingtom to Black Hall substations. The RPF also
provides guidance on compensation issues at locations which have not yet been determined,
mainly in the Western parts o f Freetown. In addition, for the other components o f distribution
upgrading inthe Western Area, where the exact scope o f resettlement impacts i s not yet defined,
a Resettlement Policy Framework has been prepared.

91.      Cultural Property: There is a remote chance that cultural artifacts may be discovered
during the excavation o f pipe trenches and foundations. The ESMF addresses the issue, and
construction contracts will specify actions that contractors must take when possible cultural
artifacts are unearthed. Likewise any cultural property which will potentially be affected during
implementation o f power component activities will be addressed by the environmental
management plan.

92.      Safety of Dams: The ESMF sets out the procedures which must be followed if a
participating town intends to draw water from a reservoir controlled by an existing or new dam
(this project, however, will not finance any new dams). The ESMF and RPF identify potential
adverse social and environmental impacts that could result from village WSS facilities and
measures to mitigate them. Both the ESMF and RPF include procedures to follow during the
planning, design and construction o f sub-projects. Each sub-project will be requiredto prepare a
proposal that sets out the proposed: (i)  scope o f the facilities; (ii) institutional and financial
                                                                      the
arrangements to sustain it; (iii)mitigation measures for adverse social and environmental impacts
that may arise from the construction and use o f the facilities; and (iv) compensation plan for
those who loose income as a result o f the project. The EIA for both Kingtom Power Station and
Western Area, the RAP and the RPF, which have been prepared for the power component, have
identified the present and future impact o f project activities. The EIAs contain environmental
management plans which spell out the mitigation measures to be put inplace. The resettlement
instruments, likewise, describe in detail how affected people will be compensated for their
losses.

93.     The borrower's capacity to implement environmental and social mitigation measures (as
described inthe environmental management plans and RAP) i s at present limited. Therefore, the
PIUs will be re-enforced with environmental and resettlement specialists, who will receive

                                                26

training in order to more successfully ensure that the mitigation plans are adequately
implemented by the safeguard policies.

94.     Consultations have been held with different stakeholders. In particular, the potentially
affected people have beenconsulted on an individual basis as well as inpublic meetings. For the
power component, the fact that a substantial number o f people would have been affected, ledto a
likely re-routing o f one of the transmission lines (the 161 kV line from Kingtom to Wilberforce
Junction).

7. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

95.     There are no policy exceptions and the project is infull compliance with the requirements
o f all World Bank safeguards.

Sector Issues. The major sector issues include: (a) the high cost and very poor reliability o f
power supply, particularly in the Western Area o f Sierra Leone; (b) the poor technical and
financial performance o f NPA; (c) under investment inthe development o f the power sector; (d)
the macroeconomic impacts of the need for Government to provide financial support to the
sector, when NPA i s unable to cover its costs; and (e) poor coordination and oversight o f the
sector by the Government.

Policy. Current policy in the power sector is guided by a major sector study (Restructuring and
Private Sector Participation in the Sierra Leone Electricity Sector) that was undertaken and
published in October 2002, with the support o f the World Bank administered Public-Private
Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF). Among the key recommendations o f the report are: (a)
reform the electricity sector to increase private sector investment and participation through
involvement in public-private partnerships, such as a performance-oriented management for
NPA; and (b) establishing a unit within the MoEP charged with improving energy sector
coordination and planning.

The Power and Water Project is addressing electricity policy sector issues as follows: (i)under
the Power Sector Reform component, providing support for revisions o f the Electricity
Code/NPA Act; (ii)   establishment of an energy regulatory function; (iii)  establishment o f a
Policy, Planning and Coordination Unit within MoEP; and (iv) instituting a four-year
performance contract for NPA.        These policies are expected to contribute towards an
improvement in sectoral performance and provide the platform to assist inthe implementation of
the FY05 Bumbuna hydroelectric project.

 Annex lb (Water Supply, Sanitation and SolidWaste Management): Countryand Sector
                                       or ProgramBackground
                           SIERRA LEONE: Power andWater Project

Currently there is no updatedwater sector policy in Sierra Leone. The water supply and control
Act of 1963 is still inplace while several DPs indicate the needfor more analytical work to be
carried out, leading to the development of an inclusive water sector policy, addressing all
subsectors. Over the last decade Bank projects in the water supply and sanitation sector have
concentrated mainly in the urban water supply area, with emergency interventions targeting
secondary cities. Other DPs have also had only sporadic interventions inthe sector, mainly due
to the difficulties involved and lack of resources. Nevertheless, several international and local
NGOs are working intensively in remote areas, rehabilitating and constructing water points and
sanitary facilities, although not on a large scale, leaving a large gap to be filled.

No institution has recently financed an in-depthreview of policy issues in the water sector in
Sierra Leone. The Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) i s considering providing limited
financial assistance to help the GoSL prepare an integrated water and sanitation policy
document. During the preparation of the project, discussions on policy relatedmatters have been
raised with the MoEP, which expressed its concerns regarding the lack of tangible advance inthe
formulation of an official water and sanitation policy inthe country. The project will finance the
development of such a strategy and is expectedto liaise with other donors operating inthe sector
to support this objective.

Policy related issues to be addressed by the project include: (i)financing of studies needed to
develop a water sector policy, supporting the establishment of coverage baseline data, and
resolving the sector institutional problems (further elaborated upon below); and (ii)    financing
several technical studies related to groundwater mapping and quality, funds permitting (Trust
Fundsfinancing will be sought).

The division of roles between the Water Supply Department (WSD) within the MoEP and
SALWACO needs to be reviewed and changed. The normal allocation o f responsibilities
between a Ministry and a rural water supply company, is one that assigns the Ministry with
policy guidance of the sector, and the company with facilitating works and providing technical
expertise. More particularly, the division of responsibilities betweenthe WSD and SALWACO
i s blurred. There i s no clear sector policy guidance provided by the WSDiMoEP. SALWACO i s
currently assuming simultaneously multiple roles, of a policy provider as well as contract
implementer, a conflicting situation by nature. The project will address the above problem
through: (i) supporting the MoEP as a major policy entity, assisting the WSD within the MoEP
to become more effective, and enabling it to provide policy guidance to the sector; and (ii)
supporting SALWACO's role as a technical facilitator of works and strengthening its District-
based presence (in line with local government reforms) and engineering capacity through
collaboration with the project managementconsultants.

Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in the rural environment is in a critical state. Water
suppliesfrom SALWACO are intermittent and insufficient, a situation that is further exacerbated
by the ever-increasing number of displaced persons. The shallow wells constructed by the
population are mostly polluted. The water allocation for a large part of the rural population has

                                                   30

been estimated to be between 10 and 15 liters per person (for drinking, cooking, washing) per
day, which i s far below the basic requirements o f 25 to 30 liters per person per day.

At present there is a lack o f efficient institutions inrural areas to provide systematic support to
communities, and projects undertaken have generally not been sustained. Rural communities
need to be able to make informed choices, identify their needs, initiate, maintain and manage
their own rural water supply and sanitation facilities. Fundamentalreforms are needed for rural
water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector development inorder to buildadequate institutions at
the district level as well as sufficient community capacity. A solid subsector strategy is necessary
inorder to achieve project goals.

Given the small size o f the country and the remoteness o f its districts from spare parts markets,
there i s a need to standardize equipment used in the construction o f water supply facilities
limiting the difficulties o f obtaining spare parts inthe future. The project will pursue contacts
and collaboration with several grassroots NGOs, already operating in the Districts, to achieve
this objective. Project consultants, incharge of preparingthe investments, will liaise with these
institutions to achieve this objective.

Policy related matters inthe urban water supply sector in Sierra Leone are also at a crucial point.
The Bank has been successful in completing the physical works under the Urban Water Supply
Project (completed in 2003 at a cost o f US$36 million), which substantially expanded the water
production capacity in Freetown. Nevertheless, the project was rated unsatisfactory in the ICR
(and marginally unsatisfactory by OED), since it was unsuccessful in implementing the
necessary policy reforms required to assure the commercial viability and sustainability o f the
facilities constructed.

The urban water supply component has as an objective the improvement o f policy related
measures at the GVWC, completing the issues which were not sufficiently addressed by the
previous project. Meetings with the National Commission for Privatization, the body in charge
o f supervising GVWC, and the Board and management o f GVWC, spelled out the way forward
which includes: (i)   the improvement o f the company's financial and operational management
through extemal consultants to be in charge o f improving the financial and commercial
operations o f the company; and (ii)     the gradual introduction o f commercial oriented user fee
charges  .

SWM in Freetown poses costly and serious problems.               L o w service coverage, substantial
inefficiencies, low quality o f service and labor productivity, and illegal dumping constitute only
a partial list. Currently S W M i s the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Youth and Sports, which i s
struggling with tight budgets, lack o f qualified manpower and limited equipment, and no
institutional experience in waste management. Realizing these difficulties, the project aims to
introduce effective measures which include: (i)     inthe short term - an emergency cleanup ofthe
city, reducing the health hazards associated with the current situation; and (ii) the mediumand
                                                                                   in
long term - the development o f a viable institution which i s independent, has executive
authority, and equipped with appropriate budgets, followed by self-sustaining options such as
user fees, increased property taxes, and other means to provide a firm footing for long-term
sustainability.   Obviously, the process will also include the appropriate legislative and policy
support required.

                Annex 4a (ComponentA: Power): DetailedProjectDescription


SubcomponentAl: Power sector Reform (US$S.OO million, including IDA Financing for
US$7.86 million)


 Supportfor the Revision of ElectricityAct andNPA Act.       The objective is       to create an
enabling environment to ensure that the existing electricity texts and legislations are conducive
to private sector participation inthe energy sector inboththe urban and rural areas. A consultant
will be recruited to assist incarrying out these reviewsfor about US$0.5 million. The resulting
newElectricity Law andNPA Act are expectedto be enactedby June 2005.

Establishment of a Regulatory Function.       The objective is to establish a regulatory function so
as to provide a clear-cut delineation of responsibilities between GoSL, the regulator and any
other institutions involved in the sectors, including private sector participants.   The regulation
throughout project implementation will be embedded in the contracts (regulation by contract)
and regulatory expertise (one consultant) will be secondedto the NCP to oversee the application
of sector regulation.    The possibility of having a multi-sectoral (energy, telecom) utilities
regulatory function will be explored, and the services of a consultant would be funded under the
proposed operation to assist in carrying out this task. The technical assistance needs (staffing,
operating costs, number of years) as well as light institutional support to the NCP are estimated
to cost about US$0.75 million. The text creating the regulatory function would be enacted by
February 2005 andthe regulatory expert will be recruited by April 2005.

Creation of an Energy Policy, Planning and Coordination Unit, A 2002 PPIAF-financed Power
Sector Restructuring Study recommended the creation of this unit for the purpose of
consolidating energy sector activities in Sierra Leone. This operation will assist in funding this
unit. The associated costs have been estimated to be US$l.O million throughout the project
implementation period. The costs will include three years of intermittent technical assistance,
staffing and some operating costs. A consultant was recruited under the PPIAF financing to
assist the Ministry of Energy and Power in preparing the unit areas of responsibility as well as
detailed needs for strengthening and capacity building.

Implementation of a Four-Year Management Contractfor NPA. This operation will finance the
participation of the private sector in the power sector in Sierra Leone, through a performance-
based management contract for a period of four years at a cost estimated to be about US$5.0
million. The contract would be the result of a two-phase-competitive process, wherein several
pre-qualified bidders (Phase I)would submit offers to manage NPA to achieve a number of
predetermined performance indicators. The process of selecting a management firm will be
monitored through the National Commission for Privatization (NCP), which i s empowered by
GoSL to overseethe privatizationof state-ownedenterprises.

Subcomponent A2: Capacity Building and Institutional Strengtheningmraining(US$3.77
million,includingIDA Financingfor US$2.33million)

Setting-up of theproject Implementation Unit within NPA. The operation will be implemented
through a PIU. The PIU will comprise a Project Coordinator, a financial Management Specialist,
a Power Sector Technical Expert, an Environmental Specialist and a Social Expert. This

                                                 40

operation will fund the cost associated with the implementation and operationalization o f the
PIU, including a communications unit, the provision o f office accommodation for the other
power component PIUs and related institutional support, for an estimate o f US$0.75 million.

Rationalization of NPA Workforce.     A manpower audit o f the NPA workforce, which has been
financed with "A's    own resources, i s available. Its recommendations would be discussed with
both GoSL and the unions to ensure their respective ownership. A number o f donors, including
the EU, are then expected to assist the GoSL in financing the implementationo f the agreed upon
recommendations o fthe report.

Training of Key Operations and Management Stafl The            PPIAF-funded       Power      Sector
Restructuring report has identified the following areas for training to be provided to key
operations/management staff: procurement guidelines and disbursement procedures, particularly
for World Bank-financed projects; project management and supervision; contract monitoring
and project financial management; and engineering. The proposed operation will finance this
training program for US$O.1million.

Loss Reduction Strategyfor Distributionfunction.      The high losses (in excess o f 35%) in the
NPA system is a major impediment to the viability and sustainability o f the NPA and its
operation. The proposed operation for US$0.3 million will finance the assistance o f an advisor
to designan evolving strategy and program for the continuous reduction o f losses as the situation
changes and ensure its relentless pursuance.

Supportfor Bumbuna Project Implementation Unit (PIU) .         The operation for US$0.95 million
i s to provide support for the establishment and operations of a unit that will oversee the re-
commencement and completion o f the BHP. It i s understood that support for the Bumbuna PIU
does not imply IDA support for the implementation o fthe Bumbuna hydroelectric project.

Subcomponent A3: Infrastructure (US$14.11 million with IDA Financing for US$6.10
million)

Short-term Requirements For Essential Spare Parts and Tools. A consultant was recruited under
the PPF financing to assess the operati,onal requirements o f the Kingtom generating station, with
the objective of: (i)assisting NPA in restoring adequate and reliable supply of electricity to its
customers at economic cost and with a high level o f efficiency for future sector transformation;
and (ii) supporting economic development inan environmentally sustainable way. The results o f
the assessment indicated that NPA is inshort-term needs o f essential spare parts andtools for the
generating station.   The repair o f the generating plants at the station is geared towards the
improvement oftheir efficiency and to prolong their economic life span. Inaddition, for most o f
the plant, maintenance i s well overdue. Specifically, the following will be executed under the
project: for the Sulzer 4, (i)
                             the decarbonising o f the engine to sustain its operation untilthe next
overhaul; and (ii) installation o f a waste heat boiler for steam generation; for the Sulzer 5, the
                  the
replacement o f the cooling and exhaust systems to ensure the smooth and safe operation o f the
engine and the rehabilitation o f some infrastructure components (manifolds, gas boiler, and
boiler water treatment); for the Mirrlees, the services o f an engineer and or supervisor would be
required to monitor the one-year maintenance; for the Mitsubishi, carrying out the required
training for the maintenance and operation o f the set; for the Caterpillar sets carrying out the
requiredmaintenance. The costs for this have been estimated at US$2.7 million and earmarked
for financing by the OPEC Fund.
                                                 41

Improvements in Generation Auxiliaries at Kingtom. The improvements to be funded (for
US$0.6 million) will cover the heavy oil system; the cooling water system; and the lube oils
system, and would include rehabilitation, repairs and consulting services. The results o f the
assessment conducted by the consultant on the generation auxiliaries at Kingtom indicated that:
(i)fortheheavyoilsystem,thesludgeoilcontainmentfacilityneedstobecleaned,refurbished
to a standard that will ensure effective operation and cause no threat to the environment; the fuel
oil storage tanks would be emptied, cleaned internally, while the mechanical integrity o f the
structure would be established and remedial work would be identified and carried out; the off-
loading would be extensively cleaned; the fuel oil centrifuges would be brought to automatic
mode; the fuel filtering system would be modified and the fuel metering replaced; (ii)        for the
cooling water system, the correction o f their adverse effect on the power output and efficiency o f
the diesel engines would mainly be achieved throughthe inspection and overhaul o fthe systems,
including pumps, heat exchangers, controls, filters and valves; the identification and analysis o f
any deviations in perfonnance o f over-handled plant from design or acceptance test results; the
formulation o f a program o f modifications to plant to restore to as near as possible their original
condition; and (iii)  for the lube oil system, the fixing o f the leaks intheir piping system and the
refurbishmento ftheir diesel engines to reduce the consumption o f lube oil.

Procurement of Fire Safety Equipment. The results o f the physical inspection as well as reviews
and site interviews have shown that additional equipment and consulting services would be
required to: extend the fire fighting system to cover the Mirrlees and Mitsubishiengines, and the
Caterpillar Mobile diesel generators; restore a centralized automatic alarm and detection system;
restore sprinkler protection systems on Sulzer engines; replace missingand defective fire hoses,
hand-held extinguishers, nozzles, etc.;     identify and repair leaks in the fire hydrant system;
complete repair and overhaul of the main diesel fire pump; and complete the overhaul o f the
jockey pump and the petrol fire pump. The operation will fund this equipment and related
consultant services for US$0.2 million.

Introduction of Prepayment Meters (PPMs). In order to improve the collection performance o f
NPA, while increasing its revenue base and cash flow, this activity, which is earmarked to be
funded by the Islamic Development Bank for US$1.2 million, i s to complement the 1,050 meters
already procured with NPA's own resources.

Construction of two Customer Service Centers. This activity is an integral part o f loss reduction
measures as well as improvements designed to bring services and delivery closer to customers.
It includes the services o f a local architect to prepare the drawings for the construction o f two
buildings, and also includes the necessary furniture and particular equipmentrequirements o fthe
center. The proposed activity is earmarked to be funded by the Islamic Development Bank for
US$0.4 million.

Rehabilitation and Reinforcement of the Low Voltage Network (US2.9 million). The target o f
this activity is the 415 V portiono fthe distribution system and is also earmarked to be fundedby
the Islamic Development Bank. It i s to assist NPA in dealing with the problems within this
network that are contributing to the poor service quality to customers. It will contribute to the
reduction o f technical losses within the NPA system. The works include the upgrade o f
conductors and the replacement o f fuses and other equipment.

Rehabilitation and Reinforcement of the Medium and High Voltage Network (US$4.5 million).
The primary objective of this activity is to assist NPA to restore adequate and reliable supply of
electricity to its customers at an economic cost and with a high level of efficiency for future
sector transformation. It will also support sustainable economic development. The horizon
system demand to be supplied is 60MW. The works required comprise the completion of the
sub-transmissionproject, the rehabilitation of the distribution network andrefurbishment.

(i) Completion of Original Sub-Transmission Project. The majority of the transformers and
switchgear supplied for the completion of the original project appear to be in reasonable
condition. The overhead line construction had beenfelt to be fairly advancedwith up to half of
the towers constructed, conductor and insulators delivered to stores and remaining tower sections
also in stock. However, muchof the conductor has beenusedin general maintenance work and
the conditions of storage for insulators and tower sections have been poor. Completion of the
project involves the construction of the overhead lines and associated cables, purchase and
installation of atransformer and two switchgear panels and the testing, repair and commissioning
of the existing equipment.

(ii) Assessment for llkV andLowVoltage Distribution. Theanalysis ofthe llkV
    Needs
network indicates that it will be able to supply the horizon demand once the sub-transmission
system is built. Some cable repair and supply of transformers are required, plus the upgrade of
the Kortwright-Leicester network to llkV supply. Some new low voltage panels, wood poles,
conductors and fittings are also needed and key feeder sections are to be re-conductored to
reduce losses. This operation will also finance the provision of tamper-proof service cables and
meter boxes ina further effort to reduce the non-technical losses inthe NPA system.

SubcomponentA.4. Social Impact and Environmental Mitigation Measures (US%4.01
millionwith IDA providingUS2.37 million)

Kingtom Generating Station. This activity, costing US$0.50 million, will include: (i)     improving
the situation at the Kingtom power generating station with the installation of air emission and
pollution monitoring facilities, checking o f soil contamination by local staff using quick check
testing methods at the station site, provision of effluent monitoring facilities and of noise
measurementinstruments, andwaste management and occupational health and safety aspects.

Rehabilitation and Reinforcement of the Transmission and Distribution Line. The activity will
cover: launching public education and awareness campaigns, provisionof waste disposal site and
personnel safety equipment, replanting o f disturbed sites, for the rehabilitation and reinforcement
of the transmission and distribution line (the 33kV line). Includedwith this is the verification o f
detailed quantities and removal of PCBs currently in use within the distribution system of the
NPA.The IDA will provide US$O.9millioninsupport ofthis activity.

Transmission and distribution Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF). The focus o f this activity costing US$2.01 million will be on compensation
to affected people who are living, working or having property inthe Right of Way of the 33 kV
transmission, located specifically inthe populated area enclosedbetweenKingtom, Wilber Force
and Black Hall road. The number of affected people are 1,144 individuals in 154 households.
The allocation for this subcomponent will cover the following: (1) infrastructure, including
community services (for example school, health center, church, mosque, market); (2) houses and
public services (for example water, sewage, access etc.); (3) purchase o f new land for physical
                                                 43

relocation; (4) other kindand cash compensations; (5) actual transfers and transfer assistance; (6)
cost o f resettlement implementation team; and (7) cost o f a monitoring and evaluation system.
For the same purpose, this allocation will cover the cost o f compensation in association with
impact on people and property at locations inthe Western Area.

SubcomponentA.5. Project Management and Supervision (US1.44 million with IDA
providingUS0.84 million)

The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of NPA will be responsible for supervising the
implementation o f twelve (12) other activities altogether: (i): procurement o f spare parts and
tools; (ii)improvement o f generation auxiliaries at Kingtom; (iii)   procurement o f fire safety
equipment: (iv) procurement and introduction o f prepayment meters (PPMs); (v) construction o f
two customer service centers; (vi) rehabilitation and reinforcement o f low voltage network; (vii)
rehabilitation and reinforcement o f medium and high voltage networks (T&D); (viii)
environmental mitigation measures at Kingtom generating station; (ix) implementation o f an
environmental action plan (EMP) in conjunction with the rehabilitation and reinforcement o f
T & D; (x) implementation of the T&D resettlement action plan; (xi) training to key operations
and management staff; and (xii) loss reduction strategy for distribution function. Technical
assistance will be financed to ensure that all procurement related to the implementation o f these
twelve components will be in accordance with the World Bank guidelines or those o f other
fundingagencies. Inaddition, this TA will provide assistanceto NPA inproject supervision.

    Annex 4b (ComponentB): Water Supply, Sanitation and Solid Waste Management):
                                    DetailedProjectDescription


Subcomponent B1: RuralWater Supply (US$9.36 million with US$9.03 millionfor IDA)

The subcomponent will provide grants to communities and schools for emergency
rehabilitatiordconstmction o f WSS facilities and latrines. The main objectives o f the proposed
subcomponent are to: (i)    improve water supply and sanitation services and accessibility in the
project areas; and (ii)  improve the health and living conditions o f the rural population. The
identification o f the indicative investment program was based on the review and findings o f the
field investigations, taking into account existing facilities and the limitedresources available for
civil works (around US$6 million).       The rationale for investments used a criteria o f a cost
effectiveness analysis (aiming to achieve the lowest per capita investment by using low cost
technology methods) while considering equity impacts on geographical distribution.

Activities will be located in the districts o f Bo, Kenema, Bombali, Tonkolili, inthe East, North
and Southern Regions. The population o f the four districts i s estimated at about 1.75 million, out
o f which about 670,000 reside invillages. Presently, the communities invillages without wells
get their drinking water from swamps and streams, which i s a major cause o f many water-related
diseases. Only four districts have been chosen to participate in the project due to the limited
funds available, and in order not to `spread the investments too thinly', risking higher
consultancy costs leading to a reduced impact. The investment will rely heavily on gravity fed
systems (around 50 percent of the total civil works investments), reducing the per capita and
O&M costs wherever possible.          Given the fact that the subcomponent is prepared on an
emergency basis and under a time constraint (in which engineering designs have not yet
commenced) the program will be subject to further review and cost fine tunings based on the
emerging engineering options by the appointed consultants.

Project supervision i s to be carried out by the PIU, composed of SALWACO, the environmental
health division, and the Project Management Consultants staff. Offices will be headquartered in
Freetown and in the two districts o f B o and Makeni, which are o f close proximity to the
communities. A detailed explanation o f the organizational structure, the project management
arrangements, and the roles, objectives and responsibilities o f the various actors within the PIU
are explained in detail inAnnex 6 o f the PAD and the self-standing Project Implementation Plan
(PIP).

At the beginning o f the implementation phase, the PIU will conduct orientation sessions in all
rural communities participating in the project (selection criteria for inclusion are still being
finalized). Duringthe sensitization phase, project objectives will be explained to chiefs, elders
and community men and women.              The process will include criteria and guidelines for
participation as well as an explanation o f the project's institutional framework.        A socio-
economic focus, emphasizing social mobilization, hygiene behavioral change and community
involvement i s incorporated into the project component's design. The preparation i s taking place
inparallelto country wide Local Government and Districts reforms. The PIU inthe district will
be integrated into the new District council structures established.



                                                  45

The subcomponent will also finance orientation sessions at the community, local and regional
levels, and provide training for parties involved with the project planning, design,
implementation, and monitoring. The communities will be involved in all phases of the project
cycle, and empowered to make informed decisions, identify their needs, initiate, assist in the
construction if possible, and operate and maintain their own water and sanitation facilities. The
creation of Community-Based Management (CBM) for the facilities constructedwill be pursued,
wherever possible, and accompanied by training (some of the larger gravity fed systems
constructed will feed several communities and therefore would combine CBM of village-level
activities with overall district management of the systems). It is expected that the communities
will form a gender-balancedWater and Sanitation Committee (WSC), nominate a Village Pump
Care Taker and a Village Pump Attendant in the case of handpump technologies.                 The
community will also raise money and open an account (wherever possible), collecting
community contributions for the O&M costs of the facilities. A Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) would be arranged by Project Management to spell out the obligations of both parties
and elaborate basic guidelines for continued support. The MOU would be subject to review as
deemedfit bythe Project Management.

The Environmental Health Division, within the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS), is
assignedwith the responsibility of ensuring that water provided to communities is safe, and that
sanitation is not presenting any negative environmental sanitation hazards. This division was
formed to work alongside with Water Supply Division (WSD) of the Ministry of Energy and
Power (MoEP) and will assist in the implementation of the sanitation intervention, which
includes:

Construction of Sanitation Facilities: Construction of public and individual sanitation facilities
and solid waste management facilities would be promoted in communities.            This part will
involve the safe management of human excreta (construction of individual and public latrines).
The PIU will provide the generic designs, supervise the works, and possibly provide items such
as reinforced squatting slabs, roofing sheets and nails, sand-crate blocks and vent pipes with fly
screens. NGOs would be the most likely implementation agencies to promote and implement a
latrines program. These sanitation investments require additional understanding and studies
before any construction should be permittedto begin. Immediately following the declaration of
credit effectiveness, a workshop would be held in each of the four districts to assemble the
appropriate district health staff and existing NGOs which are involved in improved sanitation
services provision to develop the best mechanisms for delivering improved sanitation services
underthe credit, recognizing the limitedfunds available.

Sanitation and Hygiene Education: Sanitation and hygiene education are mandatory elements,
and will particularly be directed towards women, young people and children. The main health
benefits of improved water supply lie in the reduction of diseases related to the unsafe disposal
of excreta, most of which are best controlled through improved environmental sanitation and
hygiene promotion at the community level. Therefore, it i s critical that efforts be made to
control the transmission of disease, through basic sanitation andhygiene promotion.

SubcomponentB2: SolidWaste Management(US$2.80 millionfor IDA)

Successful solid waste management (SWM) depends on an efficient operational system from the
outset. The four technical pillars o f any SWM system are: (i)storage at or near the point of
generation; (ii)collection of waste; (iii) cleansing; and (iv) disposal o f wastes. Each of
                                          street
                                                46

these precepts for sustainable SWM also requires implementationby a financially sound, capable
institute that has executive authority and appropriate policy and legislative support. A sound
solid waste management system i s also essential for sustained economic growth, which in turn
can also help generate better revenues and potentially better waste management resources and
services. A house-to-house waste collection systems need to be gradually introduced on a user
fee basis, initially by the Freetown Solid Waste Management Company (FSWMC) for a number
o f years and later contracted out or fully privatized.

The project distinguishes two phases: a three-to-six-month emergency phase for immediate
clean-up o f Freetown and a four-year phase whereby solid waste collection and disposal i s
carried out by a newly established FSWMC. Both phases will be supported through Bank
fundingo fnewequipment, operational expenses andtechnical assistance. The ultimate goal is to
privatize SWM operations altogether when a suitable enabling environment has been established
and proven functional. Based on a field review o f the existing situation, it appears that waste
collection can be positively impacted by an increased number of skip trucks, skips, garbage and
dustbins-all    strategically placed, increased collection crews and provision of better collection
equipmentandtools.

Emergency Cleanup: The clean-up cost, estimated at US$0.3 million, is reflective o f the
emergency measures that would be needed to clean the city o f its illegal dump sites, including
clean up drains. For the operation, it i s assumed that in addition to the existing equipment, the
above will be procured ina timely fashion. Inaddition, the SLRA will provide the services o f 1-
2 dump trucks at no cost to the MoYS during the anticipated clean-up period. The proposed
labor will be contracted out by the MoYS, which will also provide the oversight function to the
operation. The short-term cleanup should be ledby the MoYS and assisted by the MoHS and the
FCC in terms o f sharing of equipment and cleanup responsibilities. Clean-up of clogged city
drains would be coordinated with the SLRA, which has jurisdictional authority on the drains.
The initial emergency clean-up efforts will focus on removing the larger illegal dumps--the"hot
spots," such as near Anne Walsh School and Bombay Street Junction. Additional containers,
including mobile trailers will be placed at the heavily congested residential and commercial
areas. These should include Guard Street, Kline Street and others. In the same manner,
residential communities, such as those around Kissy Street, will get preference due to high
population density. As the clean-up progresses, other areas, with guidance from the MoYS, can
be included. It is estimated that the emergency clean-up operation will take approximately three
to six months from its start date.

Permanent Solution: Following the emergency clean-up, the FSW M C will be established and
perform as the lead organization, assisted by labor from the MoYS/NYMCOS under `a
contractual arrangement. These efforts would be based on sound planning, experience gained
from emergency efforts, and availability o f technical assistance, increased equipment, manpower
and budgets. At this stage, door-to-door collection will be gradually introduced. Additionally,
other measures, such as user charges and private sector involvement should also be explored to
establish long-term sustainability o f SWM. Open dumps are the only viable SWM disposal
option for Freetown at the moment.           It is suggested that each o f the current landfills is
immediately provided with access to a bulldozer on a regular basis. Other items include the
provision o f a fence, improved access roads, small office facility at each location, and controlled
waste picking by scavengers. The FSWMC will be established under the auspices o f the central
Ministryof Local Government (MLG) and act as the central authority, be an autonomous body,
and have full authority to independently manage all aspects o f S W M inFreetown. Initially, with
                                                   47

the Ministry o f Youth and Sports (MoYS), binding contracts to hire youth labor should be
established for a foreseeable future. Over time, as the FSWMC establishes itself, all o fthe MoHS
waste functions, including environmental and waste-related health aspects, would be transferred
to the FSWMC.

FSWMC will be the lead organization for managing solid waste. As an autonomous organization
under the auspices of the MLG/FCC,financially and institutionally, it will exercise significant
independence. In the beginning, it will generate its finances through budget allocations and
donor assistance. However, over time, the FSWMC will be self-financing through user fees,
business licenses, and other effective means. It will have the authority to contract out, monitor,
and supervise SWM operations and regulate uncontrolled dumping and disposal by others. The
FSWMC, to the extent feasible, will also be responsible for decentralization o f field operations.
It will also help the GoSL in establishing an enabling policy and regulatory frameworks for
SWM in Freetown. Such policies also help raise public consciousness towards environmental
issues andhelp inlaying the groundwork for a conceptual framework at the national level.

FSWMC's charter will detail composition and duties o f its Board o f Directors, voting
mechanisms, cost-sharing agreements, and other specifications, as needed for an effective
framework. On the implementation side, this will include responsibilities for providing new
ideas, technologies and skills, and clear accountability procedures. Over time, and with a good
track record, the FSWMC can evolve into a contracting agency performing on management
contracts for other municipalities. FSW M C will also establish various performance indicators
and clear line supervision among its various activities. For Freetown, user charges, as tipping
fee, basedon the volume o f waste deposited for the area's industries, hotels and institutions will
be implemented. For households, on a gradual basis, user fee concept based on income levels or
propertytaxes shouldbe implemented.

SubcomponentB3: Urban Water SupplyComponent(US$2.87 millionfor IDA)

The subcomponent will have as an objective the improvement o f policy related measures at the
Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC).            The funding o f this subcomponent will finance: (a)
technical assistance to implement the above reforms (US$1.2 million); (b) funding o f emergency
works in the eastern part o f Freetown to improve service delivery to low-income communities
and the installation o f meters (US$l.O million); (c) on-the-job training o f managerial, technical
and administrative staff to improve operations (US$0.2 million); and (d) purchase o f some
vehicles and urgently needed office equipment and a mapping software (US$0.3 million). The
GVWC Board and the NCP would agree on the TOR to be submitted to the Bank for review.
The Request for Proposal for the recruitment o f the Technical Assistance Provider would be
advertised by the GVWC through accepted international channels (UN Development Business)
after its review by the Board of GVWC, the NCP and the Bank. The Board o f the GVWC and
the NCP would be part o fthe TAP recruitment process andthe TAP Team would be answerable
to them. The process started May 15,2004.

Policy related matters inthe urbanwater supply sector in Sierra Leone are at a crucial point. The
Bank has been successful in completing the physical works under the Urban Water Supply
Project (completed in 2003 at a cost of US$36 million), which substantially expanded the
production capacity o f water in Freetown (production capacity increase by 55%). Nevertheless,
the project was unsuccessful inimplementingthe necessary policy measures, which are required
to assure the commercial viability and sustainability o f the urban water services in Freetown.
                                                 48

The GVWC Board and the NCP acknowledged the previous project's ICR findings concerning
shortcomings on institutional and financial reforms. The important lesson learned i s that any
future intervention with GVWC must address the establishment o f sound institutional
arrangementsand strengthen the company's managerial capacity. Urban water supply tariffs are
inadequate and will be studied and revised to reflect a better commercial orientation.           The
GVWC will be reformed to promote private sector participation, including enabling private
sector investment in the sector. To facilitate this directive, the Government i s committed to
reforming the GVWC Act and setting up a regulatory function in the NCP for the urban water
sector. The GVWC Board i s also committed to improving the management o f the GVWC and to
strengtheningstaff capacity inthe area o f financial management and business planning, enabling
the implementation o f commercial reforms in GVWC. The GVWC Board and the NCP are
committed to the following reforms under this project:

        the Boardwill be more proactive and meeton a regular basis;
        clear institutional roles for key managers, including the creation o f a deputy GM;
        improvement o fthe fiduciary systems to reduce waste and fraud;
        improvement of efficiency o f operations by maximizing asset use and minimizing losses;
        rationalize customer base, improve billings and enhance collections;
        simplifytariff structure and introduce on average cost recovery tariffs;
        implement and enforce an efficient and effective disconnectionpolicy for defaulters;
        implement a universal metering program;
        allocate adequate resources for operation and maintenance;
        set-up o f a computerized Management Information System (MIS);
        establish an efficient standpost supplyprogram on full cost recovery basis;
        reduce arrears with major consumers;
    m) implementan effective water loss reduction program;
    n) strengthen procurementfunction;
    0)  establish an effective consumer relations function; and
    p) resist unfundedmandates (explicit subsidies).

The main objective o f the physical works is to support emergency water supply rehabilitation
activities and improve the general service to poorly supplied areas, particularly in the East o f
Freetown, providing adequate access o f water to the urban poor. Activities will include the
rehabilitation o f parts o f the network, and improving the accessibility o f water supply services to
the vulnerable water starved areas indensely populated areas. Low pressures and zero flows are
prevalent, thus making it extremely difficult for numerous residents in these starved areas to
access water. It i s recognized that the main reasons for the low flows are under-capacity o f trunk
pipelines and extremely poor conditions o f the distribution network pipes inthese areas. More
particularly, numerous distribution pipes in the Thunder Hill, Kissy, Brook, and Calabar Town
have not flowed for over 15 years, yet the eastern part o f the city continues to expand at an
alarming rate. The completion o f the Urban Water Supply Project achieved a bulk transfer o f
water across the city to the far eastern village of Wellington.        The laying o f sub-mains to
distribute water from the Wellington Reservoir i s a high priority for GVWC. Project areas
include Calabar Town, Portee, Kissy Brook, Gingerhall, Upperparts o f BerryLeicester Roads up
to Upper Dan Street bounded by Mountain Cut and Kissy Road, Cassell Farm, Kuntolo, Bottom
Oku and parts o f Lower Allen Town all inthe East o f Freetown.

Most residents o f Freetown are serviced by a gravity water supply system from the treatment
works which feeds approximately 85% o f the city's water demand along the coast and a high
                                                  49

level supply to feed the high zone areas - Tower Hill, Wilberforce, Hill Station, Gloucester,
Leicester and the University o f Sierra Leone. The service reservoir at Regent also compliments
the supply to other areas inthe city. The most important terminal reservoir at Spur Road i s the
main dynamic storage source, which supplies water to the other various service reservoirs and
tanks throughout the city - Dan Street, Africanus Road and Wellington among others. Some
reservoirs remain non-functional.

Power Component


Overview        The Power Component of the Power and Water Project (PWP) consists of
nineteen (19) subcomponents, which are to be implementedover a period of 60 months. The
National Commission for Privatization (NCP) will have direct responsibility for the
implementation of two (2) of these, which are the pillars upon which power sector reform in
Sierra Leone will depend. The Ministry of Energy and Power (MoEP) will have responsibility
for the third of the PSR subcomponents and the component regarding BHP. The remaining
fifteen (15 ) subcomponents are in support of the provision of electricity services inthe Western
Area of the Republic o f Sierra Leone and will be implementedby the National Power Authority

Power Sector ReformSubcomponent The NCP will be responsible for the implementation of
two (2) subcomponents and support the implementation of a third. They are: i)the revision of
the Electricity Codes and NPA Act; and ii)the establishment of a regulatory function; The NCP
will also provide support for the engagement of a private operator to manage NPA under a
management contract. A consultant with expertise inmanagement contracting has been engaged
to assist the NCP in drafting the bidding documents and the handling o f the invitation of
prospective management contractors. The same consultant will later assist NCP in monitoring
the performance of the management contractor when the contract is executed. The revisionof
the NPA Act and the establishment of a regulatory function are also to be undertaken by an
appropriately qualified consultant working with the NCP. The terms of reference for this
consultancy assignment have been agreed and invitations have been published so that contract
award would take place soon after the credit is effective.
Creation of Policy, Planning and Coordination Unit The MoEP will have specific
responsibility for the subcomponent intended to produce comprehensive policies and plans for
the sector and establisWoperationalizea unit to ensure the coordination of policies and activities
inthe sector. Implementation of this subcomponent will be by a unit that will report directly to
the Minister ofEnergy andPower.

An experienced Policy Advisor is to be engaged and prepare the required energy and water
policies, to assist the MoEP in selecting and supervising a firm for the execution o f the planning
assignment andto also guide the Head o f Unitinthe establishment o fthe unit.
The preparationo f long-term plans is to be undertakenby a team o f experts from an experienced
firm with the support o f the Project. The firm would train and work with the permanent staff in
preparing the initial set o f policies and plans. The permanent staff will thereafter undertake the
monitoring and coordination function as well as the annual updating o f the plans under the
oversight o f the experts.

Infrastructure,Capacity Buildingand Other Subcomponents. The NPA will be responsible
for most o f the project's subcomponents encompassing infrastructure development, capacity
building, training and institutional strengthening o f the operating utility. Except for the
Rationalization o f the NPA workforce, which will be undertaken by a N P A Management Task
force, all other activities under this component will be the responsibility of a Project
ImplementationUnit (PIU).

To ensure the timely execution o f the project, the NPA has, with IDA'Ssupport under a PPF,
established a PIU staffed with five principal officers comprising; the PIU Project Coordinator; a
Financial Management Specialist; a Power Sector Technical Expert; an Environment Specialist;
and a Social Expert, to be responsible for the implementation, coordination, monitoring and
evaluation o f the project. The Project Implementation Unit will also include a communications
unit. The Communication Unit (CU) will incorporate the existing PR office. The C U will be

involved stakeholders and enhance transparency; (iii)  support the resettlement action plan with
communication tools focused on project affected population; and (iv) assist the introduction o f
private sector participation in the power sector and facilitate labour negotiations. The Project
Coordinator will be assisted in the establishment o f the performance monitoring function by a
Consultant with the necessary expertise to develop a financial model for the use o f NPA to build
a sound financial base within the agreed timeframe. The PIUwill also hire a consultant to advise
on designing and implementingthe procurement process in accordance with IDA'SProcurement

Project Coordination. It i s intendedthat a Steering Committee, to be chaired by the Minister of
Energy and Power, will be formed to oversee and coordinate activities among the three
implementingagencies for the Power Component of this PWP. The PIU established by NPA
with IDA support will serve as the contact unit during project implementation and it will assist
boththe NCP and the MEP infinancial, procurement and project management. The Government
and NPA have agreed to forward monthly Project Progress Reports to IDA and other Donors.

RURALWATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION, URBAN WATER SUPPLY, AND FREETOWN                         SOLID
WASTEMANAGEMENT         SUBCOMPONENTS

The Sierra Leone Water Supply Company (SALWACO) will "house"                         the Project
Implementation Unit, which will be responsible for the (i)  rural water supply and sanitation; (ii)
urban water supply; and (iii) Freetown solid waste management subcomponents of the project.
These subcomponents will have different institutional relationships with the PIU as they are to be
implementedthrough the auspices of (i)   SALWCO; (ii) Valley Water Supply Company;
                                                          Guma
and (iii)the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the subsequently established FSWMC,
respectively. The water supply and solid waste PIU, hereafter referred to as the PIU-W will
channel all expendituresfor these three subcomponentsunder one Special Account, SA-W. That
SA-W would then have two subsidiary project accounts, one dedicated for all rural water supply
and sanitation investments and activities (PA-RW) and one project account managed by the
Guma Valley Water Authority for all local currency expenditures in Freetown for water supply
and solid waste management. All procurement and contractual arrangements for this element of
the componentwill behandledby the PIU-W.

RuralWater Supply and SanitationSubcomponent

SALWACO will engage a Project Management Consultancy firm (PMC) for four years to
manage the rural water supply subcomponent and assist the PIU in its overall support to these
three subcomponents. The firm would provide experts in the areas of financial management,
engineering (design and construction supervision), procurement and other implementation
administrative support. The PMC will also provide assistance to SALWACO in developing the
sector policy framework. All administrative functions related to the payment of contractors and
consultants would be the responsibility of SALWACO but supported by the PMC. The PIU-W
will necessarily liaise with the respective district health and hygiene staff in the four districts
within which this subcomponent will be implemented and emerging structure of local
governments after the upcoming elections. These arrangements are still being discussed but will
be formalized before effectiveness of the credit. Of particular concern inthe establishment of
these relationships, are the mechanisms under which the construction of latrines will be
implemented. The possibilityof engagingcommunity-based organizations andNGOs to work in
the districts on sanitation issues is being investigated and seriously considered with major
involvement of women as a foundation for this very important subcomponent. The PIU-W will
work through the SALWACO district engineers in establishing Water and Sanitation
Committees (WSCs) inall villages andtowns where investments are contemplated.

Funds will be channeled through the SA-W and SALWACO project account to finance all IDA
eligible expenditures for this subcomponent. All civil works, goods, and consultants contracts
under this subcomponent would be signed by the management of SALWACO and the PMC, in
accordancewith World Bank procurement guidelines andprocedures.

Urban Water Supply Subcomponent:

Technical assistance will be engagedunder the credit to enhance the financial management and
institutional development capacity of the Guma Valley Water Company (GVWC). This
technical assistance would come under the managementof the GVWC but liaise with the PIU-W
on mattersrelatedto the financial issues of credit expenditures. As for the physicalimprovement
investments under this subcomponent, the designs have been and would be undertakenby the
engineeringstaff of GVWC inagreementwith the financial andmanagementconsultants (TAP).
Supervisionofthe construction ofthe civil works andof goods procurementwouldbe conducted
byanindependentengineeringfirm engagedby GVWCto overseethe civilworks contracts.

A local currency project account would be operatedby the GVWC. As this PA-UW account is
subsidiary to the SA-W maintainedby SALWACO, a monthly reporting to SALWACO would
be required. All contracts under this subcomponent would be signed by the managementof the
GVWC in accordance with World Bank guidelines and procedures. All expenditures to be
incurredinforeigncurrency for this subcomponentwould be channeledthroughthe SALWACO
PIU-W for direct payment from Washingtonor payment out of the SA-W. As the GVWC has
recently implemented the IDA financed Urban Water Supply Project (completed in 2003),
managementis completelyfamiliarwith WorldBankprocurementandpaymentprocedures.

FreetownSolidWaste ManagementSubcomponent:

A TA consultant will be appointed to assist with the establishment of the FSWMC. The
counterpart government agencies involved with this endeavor are the Ministry of Local
Government, Freetown City Council, and the Ministry of Youth and Sports (currently
undertakingthe solid waste managementfor Freetown). Interms of the emergency clean-up of
Freetownenvisagedto be implementedinthe first 3      - 6 monthsof  the credit technical assistance
will be drawn upon from the PIU-W through the PMC. All procurement and contractual
arrangements for this element of the subcomponent will be handledby the PIU-W. Basically,
the SWM subcomponent will be divided into the emergency clean-up operations (first 4-6
months of the credit) while inparallel longer-term solution of establishingthe FSWMC will be
studiedandimplementedgoinginto year 2 ofthe Credit.

All expenditures of the emergency clean-up will be drawn from the PA-RW operated by
SALWACO and from the SA-W. Contracts and other legal agreementsfor the establishmentof
the FSWMC will be signedby the Ministry of Local Government or the Ministry of Youth and
sports.

               Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements
                         SIERRALEONE: PowerandWater Project

ExecutiveSummary

The objective o f the Financial Management Assessment is to determine whether the entities
identified for the implementation o f the Power and Water Project have acceptable financial
management arrangements inplace. The assessment includes reviews o f the entities' systems o f
accounting, reporting, auditing and internal controls. The entities' arrangement are acceptable if
they are considered capable o f recording correctly all transactions and activities, supporting the
preparation o f regular and reliable financial statements, safeguarding the entities' assets, and are
subject to satisfactory auditing processes.

Financial management assessments were carried out for the two Project Implementation Units
(PIU) o f National Power Authority (NPA), and Sierra Leone Water Company (SALWACO).
The assessments were carried out jointly by a World Bank Financial Management team and
persons responsible for financial management in the identified implementing entities. Financial
management internal control questionnaires and interviews o f key financial personnel were used
as part o f the assessments.

The PIU established at NPA for the purpose o f implementing the project will use the accounting
system o f NPA, which is fully documented in an accounting procedures manual. The accounts
unit o f the PIU has the full complement o f staff headed by the Financial Accountant, who is a
qualified accountant, and will report to the financial controller o f NPA on matters o f finance.
Some o f the staff have worked on previous Bank funded projects and it i s expected that more
training will be provided to enhance their performance.

The financial management systems at SALWACO are weak and it is expected that a project
management consultancy firm will be hiredto manage the PIU being established at SALWACO.
The firm will provide key staff, including a financial specialist who will be responsible for the
management o f the financial resources o f this component. The firm will also be responsible for
establishing the financial management system to be usedunder this component.

Based on the assessments, the financial management system for the PIU at NPA, which will be
responsible for the Power component, i s adequate and meets the minimum requirements o f the
World Bank. However, the financial management system for the PIU at SALWACO has not yet
been established (it will be established after the hiring o f a project management consultancy
firm). Accordingly, the hiringof the project management consultancy firm will be established as
a condition o f disbursement for the water component to ensure an adequate FM system i s put in
place for the management o fthe water component o f the project.

CountryAccountabilityIssues
The Bank has carried out a limited scope Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
for Sierra Leone. The report documents the public financial management system architecture,
identifies weaknesses and makes recommendations to address them. A stakeholders workshop
was organized by the government o f Sierra Leone in June 2002 to discuss the CFAA report and

Financial Management System For the Project

The two main implementing agencies, the National Power Authority (NPA) and Sierra Leone
Water Company (SALWACO), have each created project implementation units (PIU) for the
purpose o f managing the main components o f the project. The PIUs, which will be staffed with
key qualified staff, including financial specialists, will assist the implementing entities to
implementtheir components.

The PIUs will be headed by a Coordinator who will have overall responsibility for project
management. The financial specialists, who will be qualified accountants, will head the accounts
unit within the PIU and will be responsible for the day-to-day management of project funds,
including that o f the Special Accounts. The financial specialists will be assisted by two support
accounting officers to provide sufficient segregation of accounting functions. The financial
specialists will be responsible for maintaining adequate accounting records, preparing financial
reports and statements, and ensuring that the project's financial management arrangements are
acceptable to the Government and the World Bank at all times. The financial specialists will also
be responsible for ensuring that the project financial reports, including the financial monitoring
reports, are submitted to Government and World Bank on time and in accordance with the
financial covenant o f the financing agreement.

ThePIU at NPA

The PIU at NPA has been set up and the key personnel are at post, including the financial
specialist. The financial specialist i s assisted by two accounting officers. The procedures manual
of the NPA will be modified for use by the PIU. The modification will ensure the incorporation

                                                   63

o f the World Bank's disbursementprocedures and project-specific activities. The manual, which
will be part o fthe implementation manual, mustbe satisfactory to the World Bank.

The accounting staff will be provided with training on World Bank disbursement procedures
prior to project effectiveness to ensure the staff perform their functions adequately.

ThePZU at SALWAC0

The PIU at SALWACO will serve SALWACO, FSWMC, and Guma Valley Water Company in
the implementation o f their components under the project. The PIU functions will be performed
by a Management Consultancy Firm, recruited internationally on a competitive basis. Key staff
to be provided by the recruited firm will include the financial specialist. The firm will be
responsible for setting up the financial management system acceptable to IDA within the PIU,
and will document it inan accounting procedures manual. The manual, which may be part o f the
implementation manual, will outline clear steps that would be used for participating agencies to
access funds from the PIU underthe project.

Flow of Funds

The project will have two (2) special accounts, one for the Power component and the other for
the Water component. Ithas also been agreedthat the funds under each component ofthe project
will be centrally managed. All payments will be effected from the accounts units within the
PIUs. Due to this arrangement, there will be no elaborate flow o f funds mechanism under this
project.

Flow of Funds -Power Component

As indicated above, the PIU will operate a centralized funds management system. All requests
for major payments by entities implementing activities or subcomponents within the Power
component shall be submitted to the PIU-P accounts unit for processing and payment. However,
to facilitate smooth implementation, and to avoid all minor payments being sent to the PIU and
to minimize the frequency o f requests from the participating entities, these entities will operate
an imprest account. The imprest account will be used to finance their operating cost
expenditures, such as travel and transport, minor stationery purchases, etc. O n the basis o f the
operating cost budget, approved by the Steering Committee, the accounts unit o f the PIU-P will
release funds from the project accounts (i.e. counterpart funds allocated to the project) to the
entities to meet their operating cost activities for the quarter. On submission o f returns, the
eligible expenditures will be reimbursed with funds from the SA o f the project at the eligible
percentage.

Flow of Funds - Water Component

Similarly, there will be no elaborate funds flow arrangement under the water component, but
requests for major payments by entities implementing activities within the Water component
shall be submitted to the PIU-W accounts unit and an imprest accounting system will be put in
place for the participating entities to enable them to carry out their operating cost activities.

Based on the approved operating cost budget for activities under the project, the accounts unit of
the PIU-W will release funds from the project accounts (i.e counterpart funds allocated to the
                                                   64

project to meet their operating costs for a quarter). The quarterly funds requirementswill become
the ceiling o f the imprest for the Ministryor Department.

Since the other participating entity under this component, Guma Valley Water Company, i s a
revenue-generating entity, it will also operate its own Project Account. The project account will
be used to implement its activities and make payments for items, including the procurement o f
small value items and operating cost activities such as travel and transport, stationery purchases,
repair and maintenance etc., and seek reimbursement from the SA set up for the project. All
major purchases will be forwarded to the PIU-W for payment.

Guma Valley Water Company will be required to deposit an agreed amount in its Project
Account to enable it implement its subcomponent.

It will submit returns to the accounts unit of the PIU-W, as and when it need funds for any
amount spent for eligible payments to be reimbursed. On the basis o f the returns submitted, the
project account can be reimbursed from the Special Account for the Bank's share of
expenditures. The financial specialist will review the returns to ensure that all listed expenditures
are eligible prior to effecting payments. The returns will consist o f statement o f all eligible
expenditures, a reconciliation statement fully reconciled with the original amount received and a
copy of the Project Account bank statement. The request, together with the accompanying
statements, should be signedby the Head and Finance Officer.

AuditingArrangements

Independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank would be selected to carry out annual
audits o f the project, including the two (2) Special Accounts and statements o f expenditures for
each financial year. Since there are two main PIUs and two SAs located in different revenue
earning entities, it was agreed that two separate auditors will undertake audits under the project.
The selection o f auditors shall be on a competitive basis and in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines and would be inplace before the project becomes effective.

For the Special Accounts, the project financial statements will be audited in accordance with
International Standards o f Auditing (ISA) and a single opinion will be issued to cover the project
financial statements, SOEs and the special accounts, in accordance with the Bank's new audit
policy. Since there are three (3) revenue earning entities namely, SALWACO, Guma Valley
Water Company and NPA, involved in the implementation o f the project, their own audited
financial statements would also be required.

The audited financial statements o f the entities and the project, including the auditors
management report, would be furnished to the World Bank within six months o f the close o f
each fiscal year.

Reporting and Monitoring

The PIU-P within NPA and the PIU-W within SALWACO, will each prepare quarterly financial
monitoring reports (FMRs) in the areas o f finance, procurement, including complaints from
bidders, and project progress. The PIUs will be required to prepare these reports on a quarterly
basis as part o f project quarterly implementation reports. The Financial specialists within the

                                                  65

PIUs will have the responsibility o f ensuring that the systems put in place are capable o f
producing these reports on a timely basis. The reports are:

The Quarterly Financial Report, which would consist o f a statement o f cash receipts by sources
and expenditures by main expenditure classifications for the period and cumulatively; cash
balances o f the project and supporting schedules comparing actual and budgetedexpenditures;

Quarterly Physical Progress Report, including narrative information and output indicators,
linking financial information with physical progress, and reporting on issues that require
attention;

Quarterly Procurement Management Report would consist o f information on procurement for
goods and works and for consultant services and compliance with agreed procurement methods.
The report compares procurement performance against the plan agreed at negotiations and
appropriately updatedat the end o f each quarter. The report should also provide any information
on complaints by bidders, unsatisfactory performance by contractor, and any contractual
disputes.

DisbursementArrangements

The proceeds o fthe Credit would be disbursedover a five-year period. A period of four months
after closing date would be allowed to make disbursements for expenditures incurred until the
closing date o fthe Credit.

Use of Statement Of Expenditures (SOEs)

Disbursements for all expenditures would be against full documentation, except for items o f
expenditures under contracts and purchase orders below US$200,000 equivalent for works,
US$150,000 for goods, US$lOO,OOO for consulting firms, and US$50,000 for consultant services
(individuals), training and incremental costs for which disbursements would be based on
statement o f expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documentation for SOEs would be retainedby the
two PIUs at NPA and SALWACO for review by officials or representatives o f the Government
of Sierra Leone, IDA missions, and external auditors.

SpecialAccount (SA)

To facilitate disbursements, two (2) Special Accounts; SA-P for PIU-P for the Power component
and SA-W for the Water component, would be established and operated inUS$ at commercial
banks, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the IDA. Upon Credit effectiveness, a sum o f
US$l,750,000 (initially limited to US$ 850,000) for the SA-P and US$1,750,000 (initially
limitedto US$850,000) for SA-W would be deposited by the IDA into these accounts. Further
deposits would be made into the accounts against withdrawal applications supported by
appropriate documentation.

                             SIERRA LEONE: PowerandWater Project


Sierra LeoneProcurementEnvironment

1. SierraLeone has no up-to date nationalprocurementcode. The laws and regulationsgoverningpublic
procurement are not comprehensive, they are obsolete and scattered invarious circulars issued by various
authorities. A Country Procurement Assessment Report Issues paper (CPAR - IP) is being preparedfor
Sierra Leone and will be discussed with Government in May 2004. The Government of Sierra Leone
(GSL) has already recognized that the current procurement regulations and practices do not ensure
economy and efficiency, transparency and equal opportunity. With the support of the Bank and other
DevelopmentPartners, mainly the UNDP, EUand DFID the GSL has initiated a program of procurement
reform which is being financed partly under the Transport Sector Project. The main outputs of the reform
program will be: a new national public procurement law which will establish the legal and institutional
framework for public procurement; standard bidding documents and; a capacity building plan for the
country. The enactment of the Public Procurement Law and the submission of a post-enactment action
plan are triggers for the release of the second tranche of the Third Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery
Credit (ERIC 111). According to the current program, the draft bill is expected to be ready by June 2004
and the law enacted before December 2004, the closing date of the adjustment operation. The
implementationof the public procurement bill would be part of the public financial management reforms
component of the Bank financed Institutional Reforms and Capacity Building(ICRB) project, which will
be implementedby the Ministry of Finance.

2. The current procurement practices in the country fail against all the benchmarks of a good public
procurement system.       The benchmarks of good procurement system include: (a) existence of a
comprehensive and transparent legal and institutional framework, guided by an independentprocurement
oversight body for policy and quality control; (b) use of modernizedprocurementproceduresand bidding
documents, including transparent bid evaluation and contract award procedures and effective contract
management; (c) a proficient procurement staff applying the regulations and procedures efficiently and
transparently; (d) existence of an independent control system, with audit and recourse mechanisms
separate from the procurementimplementationfunction, with effective enforcement of sanctions; and (e)
anti-corruption measures incorporated in the procurement laws and also accompanied by the application
of effective sanctions.

3. According to the draft CPAR-IP, the main weaknesses in procurement practice in Sierra Leone
include: (i)lack of procurement planning leading to poor packaging, deliberate splitting of contracts,
frequent recourse to shopping(usually involving the same group of bidders and without a written request
for quotations) and frequent use of direct contracting; (ii)poor quantification of requirements; (iii)
inadequate specifications, evaluation and qualification requirements; (iv) lack of standard procurement
documents; (v) poor commitment control leading to delays in payment; (vi) poor procurement record
keeping; (vii) inconsistent application of contractor registratiodclassification requirements; (viii) weak
internal control systems; (ix) inadequate contract supervision and management leading to time and cost
overruns and poor quality of outputs; (x) poor supply chain management; (xi) inadequate stores
management; (xii) delays in processingprocurement due in part to the requirement for the Office of the
Vice President (with very little capacity) to carry out procurements for contracts estimatedto cost more
than SLL12 million on behalf of MDAs; (xiii) very low procurement method and procurement review
thresholds; (xiv) decision making pertaining to procurement is characterized by too many levels and
excessive processingsteps, requiring the Minister's approval of requisitions, and contract awards below
OVP threshold, and (xv) contract negotiations on goods and works contracts.



                                                     67

   4.   The Implementing Agencies under the project are the MOEP, NPA, GVWC and SALWACO. NPA,
   GVWC and SALWACO are autonomous state-ownedenterprises and all operate under the Ministry of
   Energy and Power. The project will also assist inthe establishmentof a new company the Freetown Solid
   Waste Management Company (FSWMC). For each IA, The Procurement Procedures under the project
   will be described in a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and finalized by project effectiveness. The
   procurement arrangements in the PIM for each IA will be harmonized to the extent possible with the
   current procurement practices in the IA to ensure that the IAs are not overburdened with the use of
   different procedures, depending on the source of funding. As part of institutional strengthening, the
   project will finance the preparation of procurement manuals for each of the IA's. The procurement
   manuals should be consistent with the Public Procurement Act, which will be prepared under the on-
   going procurementreform program.

   Use of Bank Guidelines
   5. All works and goods financed under the IDA credit will be procured in accordance with the
   Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, November 2003. Consultants will be
   selected in accordance with the Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
  Borrowers, November 2003. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures will include:(a) an explicit
   statement to bidders of the evaluationand award criteria; (b) national advertisingwith public bidopening;
   (c) award to the lowest evaluated responsive and qualified bidder; (d) foreign bidders would not be
   precluded fiom participation in NCB; and (e). registration/classification of contractors may be used for
   establishing bidder qualification or for preparinga list for use under price comparison procedure but not
   as criteria for bidding. With the exception of complex information systems, the merit point system shall
   not be usedas the basis of bid evaluation. "Bracketing" or rejection of bids outside a range or "bracket" of
   bid values shall not be permitted.

   6. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) will be used for all International Competitive
   Bidding (ICB), and, with appropriate modification, for all NCB. The Bank's Standard Request for

'  Proposals (SRFP) would be used for all consulting assignments. All the implementing agencies should
   ensure that each time they are using the most current version of the appropriate SBD or SRFP and
   standardforms of evaluation. Less competitive bidding and selection proceduresshould not be used as an
   expedient to by-passmore competitive methods and fractioning of large procurements into smaller ones
   should not be done solely to allow the use of less competitive methods or to avoid administrative
   (including IA Board of Directors andMinistry of Energy and Power) or IDA review.

  Advertising

   7. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) is mandatory and will be published in the UN Development
   Business as provided under the Guidelines and in DevelopmentGateway Market (DgMarket). The GPN
  would show all ICB and all consulting services estimated to cost USD100,OOO or more. Specific
  ProcurementNotices (SPN) will be requiredfor contracts to be procuredunder ICB and NCB procedures
  and for consultant contracts (estimated to cost more than USDlO0,OOO) to obtain expressions of interest
  (EOI) prior to the preparationofthe shortlist. The SPNs will (as a minimum) be publishedina newspaper
  of wide national circulation. All ICBs and Consultant contracts estimated to cost USD200,OOO or more
  shall be advertised in Development Business online and in dgMarket. Sufficient time would be allowed
  (not less than six weeks for ICB and not less than 30 days for NCB and 14 days for EOI) to allow
  adequate time for biddersand consultantsto obtain documents andrespondappropriately.




                                                       68

ProcurementCapacity

8.   Most of the implementingagencies have some experience in implementingBank financed projects
(includingthe UrbanWater Supply Project, FreetownInfrastructureRehabilitationProject, andthe Power
Rehabilitation Project). According to the reports from previous Bank supervision (including ICR)
missions, the NPA and GVWC have adequate capacity to carry out procurement under the project.
However, in order to further strengthen their procurement capacity, provisionhas been made under the
project for key staff of the two I A s to be trained in procurement under Bank financed projects. Special
emphasis will also be placed on procurement planning, supply chain management, specificationwriting,
preparation of bidding documents, bid evaluation and contract management. Procurement practice by
SALWACO on the previous Bank financed projectwas severely flawed, and, therefore, SALWACOwill
be required to hire a project management firm to provide support in carrying out procurement and
contract management under the project. The TOR of the firm should include mentoringand on-the-job
trainingof SALWACOstaffto take over responsibilityof procurement within aperiodof four years.

9. The summary assessment shows a "High risk" for the project and the prior review thresholds have
been set to reflect this rating. Procurement Post Reviews (PPRs) will be carried out annually by Bank
staff and/or independent auditors and based on the findings of the reviews, the prior review thresholds
will be reviewed. The main risks identifiedin previous procurement reviews are: (i)poor procurement
planning and monitoring; (ii)poor record keeping; (iii)weak contract management and poor quality
control; (iv) poor commitment control; (v) contract splitting; (vi) inadequate procurement capacity; and
(vii) delays inprocessingprocurement and payments. The actions plannedto address the deficiencies are
included in the project activities and include (i)further training of the IAs, Procurement Committees,
Boardo f Directors and Ministry of Energy Staff in the applicationof the procurement procedures -this
trainingwill complement the nationwidetrainingeffort to be launchedas part ofthe operationalizationof
the Public Procurement Law when it is enacted; (ii)specialized training for IA staff in preparation of
                                -
Bidding Documents and Request for Proposals, due diligence, verification of bidder's qualifications,
contract management and quality control; (iii)setting of standardprocessingtimes; (iv) establishment of
semiannual reporting requirements; (v) establishment of a contract performance support system; (vi)
annual procurement post reviews; (vii) annual review of prior review thresholds based on finding of the
procurement post reviews; and (viii) enforcement of remedies available to IDA, if Government does not
take appropriatesanctions against officials who flout the agreedprocedures.

10. A projectworkshop will be heldinJuly 2004 for key staff o f the ImplementingAgencies. The project
workshop will includesessions on BanWPublic procurement.The focus will be to orient key staff on the
principles of good public procurement practice and to discuss the procurement arrangements under the
project.The project launchworkshop will reinforcethese messages.The project also includes fundingfor
key staff in the I A s to attend the Bank supported regionalprocurement course at the Ghana Institute for
Management and Public Administration(GIMPA) or the East and SouthernAfrica Management Institute
(ESAMI). Other areas o f training supported under the project include contract management, record
keepingandprojectmanagement.

ProcurementPlans

11. Each ImplementingAgency will prepare an annual work plan consisting a procurement plan. The
Ministry of Energy will consolidate the procurement plans and submit it to IDA for review. The
procurement planwill be for the first 18 months of the projectshowingindividualcontract packages, and
for each package its estimated cost, procurement method and processing times for key activities until
completion.The procurement planfor the first 18-monthperiodwas preparedpriorto negotiations.Three
months prior to the start of each subsequent fiscal year, The Ministry of Energy will submit updated
versions ofthe procurement plans inrespecto fthe followingeighteenmonths for IDA review.



                                                      69

12. Any revisions to the formally agreed procurement plan shall require the concurrence o f IDA. The
implementing agencies shall apply the most competitive method o f procurement appropriate to the
circumstances o f the specific procurement as described in the P I M manual and the Table below.
Implementing agencies may select a more competitive method for a particular procurement ifthey wish to
do so, however, IDA concurrence will be requiredto use a less competitive method other than the one set
out inthe agreed Procurement Plan. Absence o fthis concurrence may result inmisprocurement.

supervision and technical assistance to be carried out by both national and international consultants as
well as workshops and group discussions. The preferred method for selecting consulting firms will be
Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS). Alternatively, Quality Based Selection (QBS), Selection
Under a Fixed Budget (SFB) or Least-Cost Selection (LCS) procedures may be used provided the

1. Gross energy produced increased by 16.2 percent to 123.5kWh in2002, from 100.3 kWh
   in 2001. However, gross energy produced decreased by 11.4 percent in 2003 from its
   2002 level. This was primarily due to the overhauling of Sulzer UnitNo. 5 and the 6000
   hours maintenance of the Mirrlees engine. The increase in station use of about 0.5
   percent in 2003 compared to 2002 is as a result of the increase in the lighting system at
   Kingtom and increaseinelectrical work being done at the Kingtom Training School.

   The system losses reducedfrom 38 percent inyear 2001 and 2002 to 33 percent inyear
   2003. This i s attributed to the efforts of management in the improvement that is being
   done in the distribution system to enhance the quality of electricity transmitted, thereby
   reducing the technical losses and also the war that is being waged against illegal
   abstraction of electricity. Also effective monitoring is being done by senior officials to
   ensure disconnection activities are enforced especially at night. Furthermore, efforts are
   being made to reduce the number of faulty meters in the system. Presently, about 25
   percent of these meters have beenchanged.

   The resulting effect of the reduction inthe systemlosses is reflected insales billedwhich
   increasedby 15.6 percent from 2001 to 2002 and further increasedby 20.5 percent from
   2002 to 2003.

2. Production cost decreased by about 15 percent in 2002 from Le31 billion in 2001 to
   Le26.4 billion in 2002. This could be mainly attributed to the fact that about 25 percent
   less diesel oil was used in 2002 than in 2001. Production cost however increased byjust
   over 7 percent in 2003. Although less fuel and lubricant were usedin 2003, there was a
   38 percent increase inthe price of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) and a 25 percent increase inthe
   price of diesel oil inFebruary2003. There was a significant improvement inthe specific
   fuel consumption of HFO at the Kingtom Power Station over the three years under
   review from 15.55 kWh/IG in2001 to 16.7k W M G in2003.

3. The number of customer accounts increased from 37.476 in 2001 to 41.105 in 2002
  which represents an increase o f 9.7 percent. In the year 2003, customer accounts
   increased by a further 2.3 percent to 42.069. Also noted was a gradual increase in the
  proportion of paying customers to total number of customers.            In year 2002, the
  proportion of paying customers to total number o f customer decreasedby 1percent and
   inyear 2003 it increasedby 15 percent from year 2002. This is reflective of the urgent
  need for increase ingenerating capacity to meet the demandof people who are willing to
  pay their bills if they have electricity supply. Also, revenue collected increased by 40
  percent from Le 21.5 billion in2001 to Le30.2 billion in2002. Although less energy was
  sold in 2003, revenue collected was 18% higher than 2002. This was mainly as a result
  of the phased 40 percent increase in tariff approved by Government of Sierra Leone.
  There was a 20 percent increaseintariff inApril and a further 20 percent inJuly 2003,

  The total debtors decreased by about 8 percent over the period under review and the
  Debtors Collection perioddropped from 5 months inyear 2001 to 3 months inyear 2003.
  This arose as a result of the efforts inour revenue collection drive and the eradication of
  limits inthe amount for whichdisconnection couldbe effected.


                                            78

4. The workforce increasedfrom 607 in2001 to 636 in2002, an increaseof about 5 percent.
  The workforce however decreased to 574 in 2003 which represents a decrease of about
   10 percent from 2002. Gross energy produced per worker increasedby about 11percent
   in2002 comparedto 2001. Ithowever decreasedby about 2 percent in2003 comparedto
   2002. Billed energy per employee increasedfrom 103.401kWh in2001 to 114,918 kWh
   in2002. Itincreasedto 120,100 kWhin2003 inspite ofthe reducedgeneration.

  Revenue collected per employee had an upward trendthroughout the periodunder review
   increasing by 77 percent over the three years. The reduction in workforce is reflected in
  the reduction in our administrative costs which also reflects a reduction in net operating
  cost.

5. In compliance with NPA's strategy to turn the Authority         into a financially viable
  organization, the following were achieved since December2003:

   1. Improvements of about 6.6 percent in the efficiency of the use of fuel by the Sulzer
       machines from 16.7 kWh/IG to 17.8 kWWIG. These machinesare supposedto be the
       most de-ratedof allNPA's generators.

  2. An improvement in the credit rating of NPA with its suppliers, the major bankers as
       evidenced intheir willingness to increasetheir exposurewith the utility.

   3. Management has restructured the revenue collection section within the Commercial
       Department. The revenue collection teams are now headedby more senior personnel.
       This has yielded dividend as could be seen in the increase in revenue collection for
      tariffs Iand 11. Below are details of sales to domestic and other small businesses and
       revenuecollected from them.

       From the percentage collection to sales shown above, it is evident that part of the
       collection receivedwas inrespect of OLD OUTSTANDING DEBT.

       Below is an analysis of sales and revenues collected since the last mission in
       December2003

  4. NPA has financed the computerization of a new accounting system (Great Plain
       dynamics). The installation has beencompleted andthe system is now operational.

   5. The future financial perfonnance o f the Authority will improve after the completion
       of the Euro 2 million project and the installation of the Prepayment Meter System
      which would commence by June 2004. It is expected that measures attached to the
      use of the Euro 2 million project will help reduce the technical losses by 2 percent.

Power Economic Analysis

Introduction

A three step approach was followed in undertaking the economic analysis o f the power

Demand Growth Analysis

A review has been performed o f historic levels o f demand for the Western Area System of the
National Power Authority ("A).          Actual demand has clearly been influenced by lack o f
generating capacity (currently 28.1 MW to serve more than 40,000 customers in the Western
Area) and consequent load shedding. Most customers are served for 12 hours every two days.
The day o f peak generation was 5 December 2002 and the maximum value was 26.5MW.
Energy losses and auxiliary consumption must be deducted from this value to determine the
(constrained) maximum demand, which i s estimated to be 18.4 MW (of which 5.8MW would not
have beenbilled).
       Since the major conflict of 1999 when the Gross Domestic Product of Sierra Leone
shrank signiJicantly, there has been sustained growth, peaking at 6.5% in 2003. Theforecast of
economic growth in SierraLeone is asfollows:

                         2005                                      7.1%

                         2008                                      6.6%

On this basis, the projected annual growth rate in peak demand (in MW) o f 4% for the base
forecast seems to be conservative, while 7% i s a reasonably high forecast and 3% a pessimistic
scenario.   Taking the range o f possible levels o f unconstrained demand in 2002 and a range o f
feasible growth rates o f 4 to 7%, the next table shows an unconstrained forecast for the NPA

 LeastCost Analysis

At the level of the power system, the economic competitiveness o f a specific power project
comes from its contribution to total power system cost savings in meeting the system demand.
Inthe context o f Sierra Leone and inthe areas o f activity being studied, the determination o fthe
least-cost development i s often implicit and shaped by the most urgent needs and resource
constraints. Below are set out the elements o fthe project evaluated.

Four-year Management Contract for M A . In the light o f the performance o f NPA in recent
years, due primarily to civil conflict and under-investment, it is felt that considerable
strengthening o f the management is required to undertake the change necessary to achieve
financial stability.  The proposed four-year performance-oriented Management Contract is
considered the least-cost and most effective means o f achieving this target.



                                              84

Setting up o f Pro-iectImplementationUnitwithinNPA

A project o f this size involves the absorption by NPA o f investment nearly twice their present
annual turnover. The setting up o f Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within NPA i s considered
necessary to monitor and control the process. The PIU will be strengthenedthrough technical
assistance to: (a) undertake a full loss reduction study which will include the establishment o f
international best-practice; and (b) supervise implementationo f each infrastructure component.

Infrastructure Subcomponent - Generation

The capital investment subcomponent - generation (at the Kingtom station) consists of: (a)
supply of essential spare parts; (b) improvement o f generation auxiliaries; and (c) supply o f fire-
fightingequipment.

Essential spare parts and tools would have been purchased inthe normal course o f events when
needed by the utility out of operational funds. That this has not been done i s evidence o f the
desperate state o f company finances inrecent years. The requiredlist o f spare parts and tools has
been developed as the least-cost route to acceptable levels o f efficiency, availability and
reliability at Kingtom Power Station. Auxiliary consumption at Kingtom Power Station is in
excess o f 5% o f generated energy and its shortcomings limit generated output. The required list
o f remedial works has been developed as the least-cost method to achieve acceptable levels o f
auxiliary consumption. This includes removing a sunken barge that blocks the fuel unloading
jetty and the cooling water system. The fire safety systems at Kingtom Power Station show
severe shortcomings that have been studied. The solutions proposed are a mix o f rectifying
existingplant and purchasingnew subsystems, where appropriate.

Infrastructure Subcomponent - Transmissionand Distribution

The completion o f the 33 kV subtransmission project i s necessary to interconnect the key 11kV
primary substations in order to supply the growing demand o f the Western Area at acceptable
levels o f supply quality and efficiency. Distribution feeders within Freetown require ongoing
work to return faulted feeders to service, and the upgrading o f a section o f old non-standard
voltage system; however, the overall situation i s considered adequate. The NPA low voltage
network i s characterised by long feeders, unbalanced loads, sub-optimal conductor selection,
inadequate protection, high losses and low voltages. The costs o f supply and installation o f the
works needed to refurbish the LV network have been estimated.

Infrastructure Subcomponent -AddressingNon-technical Losses

The present level of non-technical losses of around 20% is clearly unsustainable. NPA has
instituted a general tightening-up of procedures in meter reading, billing and collection.
Prepayment meters have been proposed as a solution for recalcitrant groups o f consumers.
Meter test facilities and the purchase of new credit meters should all help to reduce non-technical
losses, as will the establishment o f new Customer Service Centres. These measures should
enable a rapid reduction in non-technical losses to 12.5%, provided that sufficient resources are
applied ina timely manner.




                                               85

Environmental Mitigation and Social Impact

From a least-cost planningperspective, these measures are considered to be obligatory and are
therefore included as a project cost. They include: (a) environmental mitigation at Kingtom
power station; (b) environmental mitigation for the distribution network and the 33 kV
subtransmission line. This includes the disposal o f polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and (c)
implementation o f the resettlement action plan (RAP), associated with the construction o fthe 33
kV subtransmission line.


Costs. The following costs have been included inthe analysis: (a) investment costs o f the project
power component; (b) annual costs, including O&M costs o f the project itself and related
incremental costs of the assets added under the project. Annual costs also include the cost o f
supplying the additional energy associated with the Project, which is valued interms of the bulk
supply tariff. Working capital has been neglected in the analysis because it is generally small
compared to the other cost components.

The project comprises the following elements that are considered in the quantitative economic
analysis: a four-year performance-oriented management contract for NPA; setting up a PIU
within NPA and technical assistance (including project supervision)             to support the
implementation o f the capital investment program as well as the resettlement and environmental
mitigation measures; capital investment in power generation, transmission and distribution as
well as innon-technical loss reductionmeasures; and the cost o f addressing resettlement issues
and undertaking environmental mitigation measures resulting from the capital investment
program. Further details on these project components are provided inthe previous section.

An average economic lifetime o f a plant o f 30 years is assumed for T&D plant and 10 years for
other equipment. The lifetime o f the Kingtom generation assets i s taken to be 5 years, but
replacement has not been assumed after that time due to the reduced use o f the assets post-
Bumbuna. Operation andmaintenance costs have been taken as 1.5% o f capital costs per year.

Other `softer' elements, including power sector reform, capacity building, rationalization o f
NPA's workforce and training are not includedinthe quantitative analysis o fthe project.

Benefits. The project's quantitative benefits comprise: (a) reductions inunservedenergy; (b) fuel
savings due to improvements in fuel efficiency and reduced auxiliary consumption; and (c)
reduction intechnical losses and meeting growth in electricity demand. Non-technical losses do
not have a direct economic benefit and are therefore excluded.

Because of the present failure to meet electricity demand, low income domestic consumers are
obliged to use paraffin (kerosene) lamps and candles for lighting, while commercial, industrial
and high-income domestic consumers use standby power generators. An average cost o f
unserved energy (COUE) can be estimated from these alternatives and applied to the project
components that supply such a demand. A conservative approach has been used, equating COUE
at US$0.25/kWH i.e. slightly inexcess o fNPA's average tariff (US$0.22/kWh).




                                              86

With the planned commissioning of the 50 MW Bumbuna hydroelectric project inlate 2006, the
supply constraint should be easedandtherefore benefits accruingto COUE have only been
included inthe analysis through 2006.

Fuelsavings due to improvements ingeneration efficiency andreduced auxiliary consumption
are based on the economic cost o f bulk supply o f energy (US$O.l l/kWh) above the Bumbuna
firm annual supplyof 157GWhthrough 2010. Fueltaxes and duties have beenexcludedfrom
the economic analysis.

Reductions intechnical losses and growth inelectricity demand are valued at the cost o f bulk
supply of energy.

Resultsof the EconomicAnalysis

The project has beenevaluated usingthe EIRR approach with all costs and benefits expressed in
constant prices. The internal rate o f return o f the project i s the discount rate at which the net
present value (NPV) o f the total costs equals that o f the estimated project benefits. Comparing
costs and benefits with and without the project as a whole, as set out inthe attachment it can be
seen to be economically viable with an economic rate o f return(EIRR) of 20.8%.

Sensitivity Analysis
The rates of return are robust as indicated by calculating sensitivities with respect to key
parameters. It can be seen that the EIRRvalues are robust with respect to reasonable increases in
actual investment, O&M and supply costs and decreases inloss reduction and sales assumptions.

Economic Analysis

The total cost o f the rural water supply component has been estimated at US$9.2 million, in
constant 2004 prices, including price and physical contingencies but excluding taxes, interest for
financing the project, and a depreciation allowance. The direct foreign component o f the project
i s estimated at 93 percent o f the total cost, given the high composition o f equipment and
international consultancies associated.

The project will benefit the population in four districts in Sierra Leone, and more specifically,
improve the water and sanitation services o f the area's population through: (a) increasing the
number of water and sanitation connections for low income communities and households; (b)
reducingwater borne diseases inthe served areas; (c) developing an on-site sanitationprogram in
areas served; (d) introducing improved health and hygiene behavior; (e) reducing, to some
extent, morbidity and mortality rates o f the population served; (f) improving the water resources
management o f the districts involved; and (g) improving the water supply policy environment
through the formulation o f a water sector strategy.

More particularly the project will extendthe water supply network inthese districts through the
construction and rehabilitation o f gravity fed systems, springs, hand-dug wells, and boreholes.
The estimated number of beneficiaries to receive improved water supply is around 150,000
people. This estimation i s only provisional and cannot be ascertained. The analysis below will
examine the economic rationale for investing in: (i)a gravity fed system, based on initial
emerging engineering estimates; and (ii)        a hand dug well equipped with a handpump. The cost
data utilized in the analysis i s based on: (a) inputs from the engineering consultant currently in
the field and engaged in the detailed engineering designs for the first 12 months o f the project;
and (b) the completed component design study performed.' (Qualitative analysis for the urban
water supply and solid waste management subcomponents i s presented insection D1o f the main
PADtext.)

Cost benefit of a Gravitv Fed System

The largest proposed system to be financed by the component will originate inthe Kambui hills
and transfer water towards the city o f Bo, based on a gravity fed piped system, serving a number
o f villages on the way. The provisional estimated cost o f this scheme i s US$1.2 million, to be
refined based on the detailed topography and elevations data emerging during the design. The
scheme is estimated to serve around 60,000 people, (although there might be a possibility that
80,000 people will be the actual target; the lower estimate has been used for this analysis). A
cost benefit analysis of the scheme was performed, based on the following assumptions: (i)                     20
liter per capita has been used as the standard provision based on initial engineering confirmation
of source water flows; (ii)    O&M and commercial costs have beenindexed at 2.5 percent inflation
rate (corresponding to U S CPI); (iii) rate usedincalculating NPV and IRR i s 12percent;
                                           interest

constructed are 2.5 and 10 percent, respectively; and (v) health benefits have not been included
in the calculation (see comments on health benefit below). Since the cost benefit calculation
below i s performed on a `framework' basis, a large range o f water prices (between 15 and 65 U S
cents was used. The range corresponds with the lower range o f economic values for water
applicable in the subregion.                      The cost benefit calculation demonstrates that when the water
supplied i s valued at 35 cents, the rate o f return i s 13 percent. It i s safe to assume that the
economic price o f water inrural areas o f Sierra Leone i s much higher than that. Nevertheless, it
should be acknowledged that a 10 percent change in the capital investment cost, increasing the
scheme's cost to US$1.44 million, would increase the breakeven point o f water values to 43 U S
cents. The tables below summarize the cost benefit calculation:

Cost benefit of a Hand Dug Well equipped with handpump

Following the `framework' method explained above, the analysis constructedfor a hand dug well
equippedwith a hand pump is based on recent estimation costs obtained in Sierra Leone. The
cost benefit analysis reviews the economic viability o f such an intervention, which i s likely to be



                                                                       93

the most widely spread under the RWS subcomponent (the construction o f boreholes i s
problematic in Sierra Leone given the (i) content o f iron when deeper drilling i s involved,
                                            high
and (ii)the communities' preference of hand dug wells since broken pumps on boreholes
prohibit the usage o f the facility, while hand dug wells can still be used). For the cost benefit
analysis, the following assumptions have beenmade: (i)    20 liter per capita per day was set as the
standard provision; (ii) and commercial costs have been indexed at 2.5 percent inflation
                          O&M
rate (corresponding to US CPI); (iii) interest rate used in calculatingNPV and IRR i s 12 percent;
(iv) operation and maintenance and commercial costs o f operating a hand dug well are 5 and 2
percent, respectively; and (v) health benefits have not been included in the calculation. The
same price range outlined above has been used (between 15 and 65 U S cents). The range
corresponds with the lower range of economic values for water applicable inthe sub-region.

The table above demonstrates that the rates o f return on investments inhand dug wells are much
lower than those on the gravity fed scheme calculated above, as can be expected. Having said
that, the investmenti s still economically viable should we assume a water value o f 55 cents.

Additionally, the project i s intending to engage in the rehabilitation o f several broken facilities.
By its very nature it is expected that the economic viability o f such interventions will be higher
that those o f newly constructed ones.

Health Benejits. Health benefits deriving from the project have not been quantified. It can be
assumed that the additional clean and safe water supplied to the various unserved rural centers
will have positive health benefits.     As the project does not quantify major investments in
sanitation (although they are expected) and most of the water to be supplied will be through
public facilities (to which health benefits have not yet been documented in the literature), the
team decided not to quantitatively include these benefits in the calculation. Nevertheless, it i s
quite obvious that some positive health impacts can be attributed to increasing the total rural
water supply production capacity.

                                Annex 10: SafeguardPolicyIssues
                          SIERRA LEONE: PowerandWater Project

Both the water and the power components of the project will trigger the Environmental
Assessment, OP 4.01 and the Involuntary Resettlement, OP 4.12 policies. Other safeguard
policies that can possibly be triggered during implementation are the ones for the Safety of
Dams, OP 4.36, and Cultural Property, OP 4.11. If these are triggered, the impact and the
appropriate mitigation measures will be identified and designed following guidelines in ESMF
andEMP's.

         An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared for
the water component. This document provides the appropriate tools for carrying out
environmental assessments and analysis in relation to wells and boreholes, and the construction
o f latrines and spring boxes. It also provides guidance and screening mechanisms for how to
identify impacts which may cause other safeguard policies to be triggered. A Solid Waste
Management Plan outlines the planning tools for a system of solid waste collection and
management in Freetown. A Resettlement Policy Framework is a description of how to prepare
and implement resettlement action plans when an impact on people and property has been
identified.

         An Environmental Audit, an Environmental Impact Assessment, a Resettlement Action
Plan and A Resettlement Policy Framework have beenpreparedfor the power component. These
documents assess the environmental impacts, in particular concerning health and safety, in
relation to the rehabilitation of the power station at Kingtom and the rehabilitation of the
distribution system in the Western Area. The resettlement instruments have been prepared in
order to provide for compensationto those people that are affected by the already existing towers
and the enforcement of the ROWand to provide guidance on compensation issues which may
arise inthe future.

          The PIU for the water component i s in SALWACO while the PIU for the power
component i s in NPA. Both implementation units will provide the daily monitoring and
evaluation of project activities while the parastatals (SALWACO and NPA) and the Ministry of
Power and Water will follow up through their officers and committees. Local and national
NGO's will be contracted for the independent monitoring and the World Bank will supervise
management of the environmental and social development (resettlement) plans through regular
supervision missions.

         Public consultation i s an ongoing process for all components of the project. The water
supply component depends on the involvement of local governments and the utility for its
success, while preparation and implementation o f the power component is more closely related
to stakeholders at utility, parastatal and ministry levels. The local community members, both in
rural areas andinFreetown, are the ultimate stakeholders and beneficiaries of the project. For the
preparation of environmental assessments and the resettlement action plan, project affected
peoplehave been consulted appropriately as describedinthe ESMF, EIA's andRAP.

Republic of Sierra Lcxlne (GOSL) will pursue to support implementationofthe pawex
mmponentofthe Powerand Water Projectduringthe period20014-2010,as Sierra Leone
moves out of the post-conflid stage of its development. The Cbvemment's overall
Strategy for Sierra Leone's power sector is to increase electricity supply (bath grid and
non-grid) in a more e%Cient and cost effective way, thereby boosting eamomic and
socis1developmentcapacity with widespread reliableand affwdabfe electric power. The
power sector goals support the nation's Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy and the
National Rscovery Strategv particularly in the context of Bccderating economic growth.

Dear Mr.Wolfenshon



Recent review of Sierra Leone's rural areas showed low water (25%) and sanitation (5%)
coverageand prevalenceofpoorhealth conditions.
Analysis ofthe situationshowedthe following as some ofthe causesofthesituation:

        Adverse poverty levelofthe people,
        Inability of governmentto raise funds to subsidize new investmentsin water facilities
        in        areas,
        The existenceofalarge numkr o f non-functioningwater systems, and
    0   Lackof communitymanagementof water systems.

To offset the situation, various aggressivereformsare to be initiated inthe sator with a view
to:

Rducc poverty and improve the living standards of the people through water and sanitation
facilities provision. A key strategy in the reform programme will be geared towards
strengthening the nation's decentralization policy and the devofution of power to local
govemment institutions. The Govemment will also adopt the National Community Rural
Water Supply and SanitationProgramme(NCRWSSP) andempowerthe Sierra Leone Water
Company(SALWACO) to preparethe Strategic InvestmentProgramme(SIP) for the sector

These strategies are to be adopted purposefy to promote and improve the delivery of water
and sanitation facilities to rural communities and small towns in terms of economy,
efficiency, effectivenessandsatisfaction.

The NCRWSSP requires an accelerated provision of potable water and hygienic sanitation
facilities in a. congenial environment in rum1weas based on a demand driven approach and
communityownership concept.




                                              112

It is within thisenvironmentthat Sierra Leone's Millennium DevelopmentGoal (MDG) was
designed to meet her development needs through the delivery of water and sanitation
facilities and hygienepromotionservices in ruralareasand small towns.

The government of Siem Leone has also decided to restructure the Guma Valley Water
Company (GVWC) with a view to introducing private sector participation CpSP) for the
economic, eficient andeffective managementofthe Company.

This lener of Sector Policy outlines the various components to be addressed in the
formutarion of a rural wam suppfy and sanitation programme for the country, taking
cognizance of the water resources development, managementand basic hygiene promotion
and behavioural change by the rural population.

Strategic Emphasis

Drinking water supply and water for agriculture use are some essential components of this
intervention.Time saved in fetching water by women and children can be productively used
in agriculture, emphasizingthe strong linkages between Water, Health, Education, Industry,
Agriculture andthe ecosystem itself.

Against this background, the Government of Sierra Leone fully endorses the investment by
the World Bank in the Power and Water Sector pmicularty after the eleven years of civil
conflict.

Under the proposed Power and Water Project, the Government is commined to develop a
national policy guideline and strategy, which would be a key to providing an enabling
environment for sustainablepower, rural water supply and mitation services.

The Government of Sierra Leone will soon conclude elections for the establishment of local
government structures in the country. It is a strong ambition of government to develop and
strengthen capacity at local government level to undertake various development aspirations
of the eountry. The local government institutionswill take over the management, operation,
and maintenance of water supply faciEities within each locality. The Sierra Leone Water
Company will devolve iMresponsibilityand staffto the local government stfitctutes in a view
to building andstrengtbenhgcapacityat this eve!.

A sound institutional arrangement and capacity building at Guma Valley Watcr C~mpmy
{GVWC)at mmagerial level are some of the stronglessons learntduring the implementation
of the urban water supply project hndcd by the Bank. It also became apparent that the tariff
structure to enhance revenue base at @ma Valley Water Company is grossly inadequate.
This same experience could be replicated for the development of the new project hnded
through the Sierra Leone Water Company by the Rank.

Against this background, the Govmmtnt of Sierra Leone has decided to establish a water
and energy regulatory body that will have the mandate to periodically review issues in the
sector with   B view of making the s t o r operate in a much more economic, efficient and
satisfactory manner in the best interest of the peopleofthis country.

The Government of Sierra Leone is committed to the establishment of a National Water
Supply and SanitationPolicy Guideline and Strategy which is expected to be concluded by
June 2006 to address major reformmeasuressuchas:

    reforms in GVWC, by December2006. These improvementswill be undertakenas part
    ofttre implementationofthe proposedPowerand Water Project;
I   The Government is committed to the provision of counterpart contribution through its
    annual budgetary allocation to the Sierra Leone Water Company specifically for this
    project.



The Covmment endorses the proposed power and water supply project which is closely in
tine with the overalIgovernment objective of the development of power and water sector in
the country. The improvement encompasses not only improvements in physical works but
also instrengtheningpoky formulation, capacitybuildingand strongsectoral institutions.

We highly appreciatethe World Sank support to the development of water and power sector
at this crucial moment of our country's development aspiration after the I1 years of civil
conflict. The Bank, targeting the rural population, the most vulnerable group constituting
mainly women and children, is an admirabledecision and gesture for which we will remain
highly apprechtive.
