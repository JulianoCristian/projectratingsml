                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A. Water Sanitation component:
                         Rural water - the construction of the 200 boreholes fitted with hand pumps has been completed, while the hand dug wells have reached 80% completion and latrines are at 90%
                         completion.
                         Sanitation component - 100 institutional latrines have been constructed and serving a population of 30,000; they are spread in schools, hospitals and markets in four districts. Another
                         2,100 household latrines were also completed (compared to the planned 2,240);
                         Solid waste component - This component was completed with emergency works for cleaning of the city done within three months of project effectiveness. A new management under
                         the Freetown Council has been established but seems to be running into problems with lack of spare parts for its vehicles as well as transit sites which are now currently being
                         destroyed as a result of the road expansion;
                         Urban Water - the Freetown Water Supply company continues to face major operational challenges. The company's performance remains weak, reflected in low collection
                         efficiencies, low customer base, high water losses due to water leaks, illegal connections due mainly to inadequate water distribution system.

                         B. Power component
                         A significant portion of the work on the new 33 kV line has been completed. However, testing and commissioning of the line, which was scheduled to be completed in December
                         2010, is delayed until March 2011 because of delays in securing access to the site of one of the towers to complete the remaining work. The NPA and the Government have been
                         working with the landowner to resolve the outstanding issues. Moreover, implementation of the rehabilitation work on the 11 kV line from Blackhall Road to Wellington continues to
                         face major challenges. It is unlikely that this work will be completed by the project' closing date, but the NPA has proposed to complete the work through its own internal resources.
