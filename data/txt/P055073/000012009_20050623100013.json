Conversely, the Borrower\n            performance is rated unsatisfactory, for although the\n            Borrower's performance during preparation was\n            satisfactory, the institutional instability led to\n            insufficient support from the highest level of Government.\n            Lessons convey the following. Project specific lessons\n            highlight the lack of political leadership, in particular,\n            because it worsened difficulties between the two\n            governmental bodies in charge of the project implementation:\n            the resistance of the Autonomous Literacy Service - SAA - to\n            the new approach could only be eliminated, or eased by means\n            of strong political leadership. This lack of political\n            leadership, aggravated the establishment of new\n            institutional framework arrangements; instead, on the basis\n            of existing institutions, arrangements could have been\n            built, avoiding institutional conflicts. Moreover, the\n            program lacked an adequate assessment of literacy providers.\n            Therefore, strengthening training activities is crucial to\n            facilitating implementation, and avoiding most of the\n            problems experienced. Lessons of specific value for the Bank\n            point at the \"Quality of Supervision Assessment\"\n            (QSA6) report, which observed in some specific cases, that\n            conclusions included in \"Aide Memoirs\" and\n            Back-to-Office Reports, were not always reflected in the\n            performance ratings."}, "docdt": "2005-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
