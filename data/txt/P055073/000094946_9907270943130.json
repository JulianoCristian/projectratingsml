aims to\n            develop and test effective arrangements for delivering\n            demand-driven adult functional literacy programs of\n            acceptable quality through nongovernmental providers to the\n            rural poor, notably women and girls in the North, the area\n            of lowest school enrollments for girls. The goal is to\n            develop flexible systems and procedures for delivering\n            technical support services and financing to\n            providers/beneficiaries which permit scaling-up to a larger\n            country-wide constituency. The project has three components.\n            The first component, testing functional literacy programs,\n            funds the selection of sub-projects proposed by\n            provider/beneficiary groups that are community developed,\n            and provides technical support to nongovernmental\n            organizations to build staff capacity in all required areas\n            of expertise while creating an operational network of\n            resource institutions. The second component develops and\n            tests essential strategies for post-literacy to ensure the\n            scaling up and sustainability of the program. It finances\n            the preparation and broadcasting of post-literacy programs.\n            Component 3 finances project management, supervision, and\n            evaluation. It establishes an autonomous institution with\n            government sponsorship, the National Fund to Assist Literacy\n            (FNAA), which receives and manages public, private, and\n            donor funds. This institution provides technical support and\n            financing to non-governmental literacy, and develops and\n            field tests required systems and procedures."}, "docdt": "1999-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
