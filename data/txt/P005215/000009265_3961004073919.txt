UIORANDUN ADD RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IRID TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
0 A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE TKHRA REGIONAL ELEUCTIC COMPANY
WITM THE GUARANTEE OF THE ISLANIC REPUBLIC OF IRA
FOR A POWER SECTOR EFFICThNCY INPROVEKNET PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Tehran Regional Electric Company with
the guarantee of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the equivalent of US$165
million to help finance a Power Sector Efficiency Improvement Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17
years, Including 5 years of grace.
2.          Dakgroun.   Iran is a lower middle-income country with a 1991
population close to 58 million people, growing at 3 percent per year, and a GNP
per capita estimated at US$2,320  (1991).   Iran's economic policies and
performance In the last decade were influenced by the change of regime in 1979
and the war with Iraq.    During the war years (1980-1988), the economy was
subject to controls and administrative intervention in the pricing of various
goods and services, domestic and external trading, investment decisions, and firm
and enterprise ownership. The country also faced trade and financial embargoes
and, In 1986, experienced a virtual collapse in oil income. Iran formulated its
post-war reconstruction policies and priorities in the country's First Five-Year
Plan (FFYP) spanning 1989/90-1993/94. The major policy objectives In the FmYP
include the progressive elimination of financial imbalances, the decentralization
of economic decision-making and the privatization of state enterprises. Plan
implementation has proceeded smoothly, with economic management improving
markedly over the past four years.  The economy has been recovering steadily.
GDP grew an average of 7 percent per year during 1989-92.   Provided Iran
maintains the wide-ranging economic reforms it has initiated, the economy could
grow at 5 to 6 percent per year in 1993-97.
3.          Sector Backaroud.  As Iran rebuilds its economy, the establishment
of adequate infrastructure (including electricity) is a key strategy. In 1989,
electricity consumers In Iran were experiencing about six hours of load shedding
per day. Since then, demand has grown by about 1,000 Mg per annum, reflecting
both economic and population growth.   While the power utilities have been
effective in reducing load shedding, the average blackouts generally last about
2 hours per day (caused by a supply deficit of about 1,000 MN on an estimated
total demand (1990) of about 10,500 MV). This reduction in load shedding was
accomplished by reconstructing plants and network components damaged In the war
with Iraq and by adding new capacity. In spite of an ambitious power investment
plan, it is forecast that blackouts will continue to disrupt downstream sectors.
Reducing the supply/demand gap would be one of the key factors in enabling the
growth in the economy described above.
4.          The Government recognizes that policy reform in the sector is
necessary. Consumers have benefited from low electricity prices since the 1970s,
while the power sector entities' input prices were subsidized by the low fuel and
capital prices charged to them. 1n 1989, with the introduction of the First
Five-Year Plan, the Government had announced its intentions of removing this
subsidy. The financing of the power sector has been freed from the budget; this
resulted in a 73 percent increase in electricity prices in 1989, followed by an
additional increase in March 1991 of 64 percent. Electricity prices were again
increased by 21 percent in February 1992, resulting in a price nearly 4 times
higher than 3 years ago.  The Government has taken a decision that effective
March 21, 1993, the weighted average electricity tariffs would be Increased, by
about 65 percent. It has also decided that by the end of Iran's current fiscal
year (i.e., March 20, 1993), the exchange rates would be unified. As a result,
the price at which the sector can purchase foreign currency would shift from the



2
official batsic exchange rate of Rials 70/US$ to a unified rate. The unified rate
is not yet known and will be determined by the market. Currently, the spread
between the official basic and floating exchange rates is twenty-fold.   An
adjustment of th!s magnitude in the price at which the sector obtains its foreign
currency would have major implications for the power sector: the local currency
needed to finance the foreign cost dominated investment program would go up; the
weighted average domestic tariffs would need to be increased about fivefold to
equal long-run marginal cost (LRMC); and the fuel c-osts would go up as prices of
fuels are adjusted to economic levels. The Government is aware of the large
adjustments required and is committed to making these adjustments in a
sustainable manner. It plans to do this by: (a) continuing to raise prices on
at least an annual basis, so as to attain domestic tariffs equal to the long-run
marginal cost levels by March 1996, and (b) changing the present target of
covering nearly 100 percent of investments by internal cash genetation to a
medism-term target of about 40 percent. This would be In line with industry
accepted practice around the world. The 60 percent balance in investment needs
would ba debt financed on a commercial basis, and could be easily absorbed by the
existing entities with their favorable debt/equity ratios. The Government's plan
for raising domestic tariffs to economic levels by March 1996, is considered
reasonable and would minimize the rate shock effects on the economy.
5.          In a policy statement provided to the Bank, the Government has also
announced its intention to increase private sector involvement in the operations
In the power sector. The Government has initiated this process by selling off
construction, maintenance and ancillary activities previously undertaken by the
povwer utilities. The Government has also announced its intention to privatize
power distribution and is open to consider private sector participation in
generation. To determine an appropriate s*-ructure for the sector that would
foster competition, the project includes a Cowmercialization-Privatization Study,
which would address the legal framework, financial targets and privatization
options. Efficiency gains would be fostered by stimulating competition at the
generation level. The study would make specific recommendations on actions to
follow.
6.          In addition to supply increases, efficiency enhancements and energy
conservation options are being adopted. The project would assist in this effort
to increase system efficiency through the in;roduction of combined cycle
technology. Energy conservation would be promoted by a combination of price
adjustments and demand management. Demand management has been introduced as a
component of electricity tariff structure through time-of-use pricing.  The
continued application of improvements to the planning process, including improved
load forecasting, the updating of a least-cost investment program and improved
financial planning, are expected to result in overall efficiency gains. The
technical assistance component of this project would support the significant
policy reform actions planned by the Government which, along with the
Implementation of the project components, would address the urgent needs of the
sector.
7.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The major objectives of Bank
assistance strategy in Iran are to: (a) assist the Government Implement a sound
economic reform program; (b) support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the
Iranian economy and human resources development; and (c) strengthen Iran's access
to capital markets. (See Report No. P-5947-IRN, dated February 19, 1993.) The
proposed project is in line with items (b) and (c) of the assistance strategy and
would assist the Government in formulating an action program consistent with its
proposed policy reforms. Specifically, through this project, the Bank would
support a rational program of investments and actions, which would enable the
supply/demand gap to be reduced and efficiency enhancements to be achieved
through restructuring. In addition, the Bank's sector policy dialogue with the
Government focuses on the reforms necessary to: (i) enable entities to borrow



3
commercially while increasing private sector participation; and (ii) formulate
and implement an energy conservation program.
8.          Pro1ect Obiectives.   The project's primary objectives are the
upgrading of sector performance and the introduction of institutional reform to
support efficiency increases. The benefits from policy reform are expected to
exceed the direct benefits of project output. The project would help eliminate
the persistent load shedding problem.
9.          Protect Description.  The project would consist of the following
components (details are included in Schedule A): (i) the addition of 200-MW
generating capacity by converting the open cycle gas turbine units c.rrently
under construction at Qom to combined cycle operation along with the related 400-
kV substations and transmission lines; (ii) distribution equipment to improve
customer billing and collection systems; and (iii) technical assistance for: (a)
an Energy Sector Development Study; (b) a Coumercialization-Privatization Study
for the power sector; (c) a Thermal Plant Power Rehabilitation Study; and (d) a
power plant operator training program.
10.         Project Cost and Financinf.  The estimated cost of the project is
US$414 million, including contingencies and interest during construction. The
foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$321 million. The Bank loan of US$165
mlIlion would finance about 40 percent of the project cost. The Borrower intends
to seek co-financing, estimated at US$48 million (12 percent of the project
cost), which would be based on suppliers' credit (procurement details are
included in Schedule B) while the executing agencies would finance about US$201
million from their own resources (48 percent of the project cost). Retroactive
financing for US$2 million would be included in the project cost to cover the
detailed engineering and tender document preparation.
11.         Prolect Implementation.  The proposed Qom combined cycle component
would be implemented by Tehran Regional Electric Company (TREC) and the studies
by Iranian Power Organization (IPO). TREC used the services of a reputable
engineering firm to assist in the feasibility and engineering design and has
retained the same firm to assist in bid document preparation, bid award,
construction supervision and commissioning of the project. Tender documents for
the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and Steam Turbine Generator (STG)
packages were issued in February 1993. The project contracts are designed on a
supply-and-erect basis to ensure efficient implement4tion through single point
responsibility.
12.         Prolect Sustainabiliet.  The Government's policy is to ensure that
the sector is independent of the Government budget. At present, most of the
sector's investments are financed from internally generated funds. To ensure the
financial viability of the entities responsible for supplying electricity, the
Government and TREG have agreed to maintain a minimum self-financing of 20
percent for FY93, 40 percent for FY94 and thereafter, and a 1.5 debt service
coverage startlng FY93. Furthermore, the Government has agreed to establish a
return-on-equity target, based on the recommendations of the Commercialization-
Prlvatization Study, adequate to attract private sector participation. These
measures would ensure the sustainability of project benefits and institutions.
13.         lessons Learned from Previous Bank Innolvement.  The project design
drew heavily on Bank experience in countries other than Iran due to the length
of tine since the last Bank involvement in the country. The design of the Qom
component was based on the results of "Prospects for Gas-Fueled Combined Cycle
Power Generation in the Developing Countries," (from the Industry and Energy
Working Paper series), and reflects the expected gains in efficiency and the
decrease in environmental degradation resulting from combined cycle add-ons. The
institutional and financial aspects were largely based on the recent policy paper
on the Bank's Role In the Power Sector (R92-133/2, dated September 21, 1992).

14.         Actions Ahreed. The Government has agreed to enable TREC to fulfill
its financial targets and to develop by June 30, 1994, an action plan for
implementing the agreed recommendations of the Commercialization-Privatization
Study.   TREC has agreed:  (a) to cover the foreign exchange needs, with
cofinancing or other arrangements, should the proposed suppliers' credit not be
available in a timely manner; (b) to revalue its assets and submit an audit
report to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year;
(c) to generate for each fiscal year, funds from internal sources equivalent to
not less than 20 percent of the three-year rolling average of its capital
eXpenditures for FY93 and 40 percent for EY94 and thereafter;(d) to maintain a
debt service coverage ratio, for each fiscal year starting in FY93, of no less
than 1.5; (e) by no later than Nerch 20, 1994, to take all actions (including,
if necessary, increasing its billing frequency for its residential consumers to
at least every two months), to enable It to reduce its accounts receivable to
three months' sales equivalent and its accounts payable to no more than the
equivalent of two months of purchases; and (f) by no later than September 30,
1994, to furnish to the Bank its action plan for increasing commercialization and
initiating private sector participation in its operations.
15.         EnvIronmental Asuects.   Project selection has been based on a
combination of criteria, including a reduction in the environmental impact of the
power sector. In addition, policy reforms, which focus on energy conservation
(price increases and load management), are expected to reduce the supply/demand
gap by an amount exceeding the output of the project components.   The Qom
combined cycle component is well vithin the environmental guidelines of the Bank
for air and water quality, largely because there would be no additional fuel
required, and there would be substantial efficiency improvement. The cooling
water requirements have been minimized through the use of air cooled condensers.
The project includes no resettlement issues. Overall, the project would result
in the reduction of about 0.3 million tons of Co; per year relative to a fuel
oil-fired steam option.   The project has been classified in environmental
Category B and has been the subject of a detailed environmental analysis.
16.         Prolect Benefits. The primary project benefits would be an increased
supply of 200 NW of generating capacity. Efficiency enhancements would result
from  sector  commercialization,   increased  competition,  private  sector
participation, technology transfer and training. Environmental benefits would
accrue from the reduction of fuel use through efficiency increases as noted
above. The economic rate of return on project investments is estimated to be
about 17 percent based on the floating market exchange rate of Rials 1450/US$.
17.         Biska.  The risks associated with the project are: (i) a failure to
continue with electricity price reform; (ii) the technical risks associated with
the implementation of a new (for Iran) combined cycle technology; and (iii)
market growth below what has been forecast. The electricity price reform risk
is significant given the magnitude of the increases required (para. 4). The
Government has demonstrated its resolve by increasing electricity prices nearly
fourfold since 1989 and committing itself in its policy statements to adjust
tariffs to reach LRNC by March 1996. However, risk remains that adverse public
reaction to large electricity tariff increases may force the Government to extend
the target date. Sensitivity analysis shows that a two-year delay in raising
tariffs to LRXC would lower the project economic rate of return from 17 to 16
percent. The commitment to price reform is reflected in the financial covenants,
which would ensure that fuel price and exchange rate adjustments would be passed
on to the consumer. The technical risks have been addressed through agreements
with TREC to employ consultants who have international experience relevant to the
proposed project. The project also includes financing for operator training of
the gas turbine and combined cycle components to ensure that the availability
targets can be met.   Implementation delays would be minimized by:   (i)
institutional maturity, the technical quality of the staff and past experience
in implementing projects of similar complexity; (ii) the early retention of



5
experienced consultants; (lit) the maximum use of single point responsibilit- in
contract packaging; and (iv) the simplicity of project design. The likelihood
of market growth being less than forecast is considered to be low as the project
analysis is based on a substantial deceleration in demand growth due to consumer
response to the proposed lrrge increases in electricity prices.  Should the
market not develop as planned, there is flexibility to respond by delaying
comltments for the large number of short gestation gas turbine plants in the
investment plan.
Is.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with thF Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recolmend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
