                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project continues to make satisfactory progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO). The Project achieved PDO target of payments to families and
                         widows of those killed during conflict. 96% of the families of the deceased and 98% of widows have been provided with cash benefits against a target of 95% in each category.
                         MOPR has successfully completed a pilot for delivery of Employment and Self Employment (ESES) services in 12 districts covering 3,030 Conflict Affected Persons (CAPs). Services
                         are currently being delivered to 11, 740 CAPs in 42 districts and activities are currently in progress to procure ESES services in the remaining districts. Though still in progress, the

                         Project is on track towards achievement of the target to deliver ESES services to 25,000 CAPs. The project is lagging behind in delivering the psychosocial counseling services,
                         intended as a component of the rehabilitation package. Given that technical assistance from IOM for this component has recently been agreed to, it is expected that there will be rapid
                         progress in the coming days. Finally, the Project has achieved the target of transparent and accountable delivery of the services. Findings from the third party monitoring indicate
                         that 87% beneficiaries were satisfied with the cash benefits delivery procedures, and the majority of activities under the Governance and Accountability Action Plan are implemented
