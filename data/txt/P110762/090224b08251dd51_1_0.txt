                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the last implementation report for the project and hence the ISR provides a brief summary of the overall implementation and a rating for outcomes. The project had a slow
                         start. While the Government implemented an activity initially included as a project component (cash payments to former combatants), the Bank subsequently chose to cancel this
                         component due to a certain fiduciary risk which could be neither proved nor disproved. As a result, the Project was restructured in 2010. Although the cash payments to the families
                         of those killed in the conflict proceeded relatively smoothly, definition of the implementation model for the rehabilitation support (Employment and Self-Employment Services, or

                         has since been either Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory as the project has made steady progress toward achieving the PDO. For example, most of the targets for the cash
                         payment component were met during this early phase, reaching 14,200 families and 4,620 widows of those killed in the conflict, and well-designed and well-executed Employment
                         and Self-Employment Services (ESES) have been provided to more than 14,000 Conflicted-Affected Persons (CAPs), giving them opportunities to obtain employment, and perhaps

                         more importantly, regain a sense of self-worth and social standing.

                         Progress toward achieving the PDO on balance is rated as moderately satisfactory. The reason for this lower rating, even though most of the key PDO indicators were met, is to
                         reflect that the project ran out of time to implement some of the planned component activities, primarily under the component for the Rehabilitation Support for the CAPs which
                         provides ESES. The Project was unable to extend the successful ESES to the remaining 19 out of the total of 73 targeted districts due to lack of time. The equivalent of roughly US
                         $13 million of the US$50 million IDA grant was cancelled in early 2014 because it was apparent that the completion of these activities by the Closing Date of June 30, 2014 was
                         beyond the projectâ€™s capacity and after two previous restructurings and the original intent of the project as an emergency support operation, the Bank chose not to extend the project
                         closing date again.

                         Beneficiary satisfaction has been relatively high. According to surveys commissioned by the Project Management Team as a part of the projected-funded monitoring activities, at least
                         90% of the cash benefits recipients and 80% of the rehabilitation services recipients were satisfied with the delivery process, almost meeting the project target of 90%.

                         Finally, a number of capacity strengthening measures have been implemented, including development of a Management Information System, development and approval of guidelines
                         and protocols for implementing the various components and set-up of a grievance system, all to aid project implementation. The component also supported some activities aimed at
                         strengthening the capacity of the ministry as a whole to manage the peace process, although this became a secondary priority as the project management team concentrated on
                         turning around the project performance.
