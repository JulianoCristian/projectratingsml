                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make significant progress in implementation of key activities and is on track for achieving its development objectives. The Ministry of Peace and
                         Reconstruction (MOPR) has successfully completed a pilot for delivering Employment and Self Employment Services (ESES) to 3,030 conflict affected persons (CAPs) in 12 districts.
                         MOPR is now in the process of rolling the ESES services in two phases -- 15,000 CAPs in 43 districts under phase I and 7,000 CAPs in 18 districts under phase II. Interim cash
                         benefits have been provided to 14,101 families of the deceased and 4,444 widows. MOPR has conducted a third monitoring exercise which shows that 87% beneficiary were satisfied

                         While the cash benefit component as well as the initial phase (pilot phase) for rehabilitation services have been going well, there is a need to trace a few beneficiaries who are yet to
                         receive the cash benefits. The MOPR plans to complete the tracer study in all districts.

                         One major challenge for the project is the lack of availability of sufficient budgets for the EPSP as a result of the limited budget release based on expenditures of FY2011/12. With
                         this limitation if not addressed, there is a risk that the project will only be able to provide employment and self-employment services to only 7000 beneficiaries instead of the target
                         number of 15,000 planned for the current fiscal year. This will risk the project ability to reach to the overall target number of beneficiaries by the end of the project in June 2014.
