Emergency Peace Support\n            Project for Nepal were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            teams preparing emergency operations should be encouraged to\n            be more conservative with planned outputs than they would\n            for a standard investment project, especially in a\n            low-capacity setting and with new processes. The videotape\n            revelation precipitated a restructuring of the project to\n            avoid misuse of funds and adverse reputational consequences.\n            The risk of this occurring was acknowledged at preparation\n            and mitigated through the use of BPOG. A reliable process\n            was put in place to identify genuine beneficiaries,\n            minimizing grievances and the risk of leakage, while close\n            supervision and a timely response from the Bank team averted\n            any reputational impact from the videotape revelation. A\n            high level of risk is likely in emergency operations, and\n            this should not be a deterrent to such projects. Rather,\n            task teams should manage this risk by strengthening borrower\n            capacity for oversight and fiduciary control, ensuring\n            transparency of processes, and maintaining close supervision\n            during implementation. Projects often encounter delays that\n            hamper progress against the project development objective,\n            or PDO, and this was the case both in the early stages of\n            ESES and immediately following restructuring. While some of\n            these delays are unavoidable, such as the need to develop\n            operations manuals before commencing the work, others (such\n            as the delay in commencing phase two of ESES) might have\n            been identified and mitigated earlier with closer\n            supervision and more proactive planning."}, "docdt": "2014-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
