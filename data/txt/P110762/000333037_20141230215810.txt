1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Since the middle of the 20th Century, Nepal has undergone a challenging
transition toward greater openness and economic inclusion. This process has been
made more difficult by Nepal’s varied topography and its diversity of castes, ethnicities,
and linguistic groups. Formidable connectivity challenges have left many communities
economically and socially isolated from the rest of the country. The overthrow of the
autocratic Rana regime in 1950 was followed by a period of democratic politics under a
constitutional monarchy, but by 1960, the King had overthrown the government and
dissolved parliament, establishing in its place an authoritarian Panchayat (assembly)
system. Within this system, power remained concentrated in the monarchy and a handful
of elite, high-caste families from Kathmandu, an arrangement which benefited these
elites notably more than it did the poor. By 1990, the first Jana Andolan (people’s
movement) had forced the King to reinstate open national elections and curtail royal
power. But political parties failed to meet popular expectations for change, and patronage
under the Panchayat system continued.
2.      In 1996, a rebel Maoist movement took advantage of popular
disenchantment and launched a rebellion. Drawing support from marginalized rural
groups that remained outside of the political system and were disillusioned with the state
as service provider, the Maoists set out to end the monarchy and establish a socialist
republic. The initial response of the police and army to the rebellion led to an escalation
of the conflict. The resulting civil war resulted in approximately 14,000 known deaths,
and many more disabled or ‘disappeared’. Up to 100,000 people were internally
displaced.
3.      Following months of difficult negotiations between Maoist and government
groups, a fragile peace agreement was reached in November, 2006. The
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) aimed to develop a new constitution based on
principles of equity of gender, caste, ethnicity and religion. As a consequence of the CPA,
the country’s two-centuries-old monarchy was dissolved. Maoist and government groups
formed a seven party alliance to manage the country’s transition. An interim legislature
and power-sharing government was established, and a Constituent Assembly was elected
to draft a new constitution.
4.      Under the ceasefire, the Maoists were disbanded and put into cantonments
while processes were put in place for either their integration into the regular national
army, or demobilization. During this time, the Maoists were to be paid a regular
allowance. Another aspect of the peace settlement (later called the 23 Point Agreement,
or 23PA) was a commitment by the Government of Nepal (GON) to pay reparations to
conflict-affected persons (CAPs) and their families. These actions followed international
best practice, and were considered essential to sustain the level of trust and confidence
built during the peace process.
5.     A Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction (MOPR) was established with
responsibility to implement all elements of the peace process, including: (i)
reconstruction of physical infrastructure damaged during the conflict; (ii) relief and



                                            1
rehabilitation of conflict victims; and (iii) management of the cantonments. The Ministry
was also charged with oversight of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate
and document war crimes.
6.      It was in this context that the GON requested World Bank assistance to
support the peace process. The intention was to help the GON build trust between
citizens and the State in the post-war environment, via support to the MOPR, and to
ensure that the transition to peace happened smoothly. To this end, the World Bank
agreed to co-finance the cost of allowances to the Maoists in cantonments and reparations
to CAPs and their families. The project was prepared under OP/BP 8.00: “Rapid
Response to Crises and Emergencies”. The World Bank Board approved the Emergency
Peace Support Project on May 6, 2008.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
7.      The original PDO was “to contribute to the consolidation of the peace process in
Nepal by supporting: (i) Government to meet commitments to people affected by the
conflict, including families of the deceased, orphans, widows and disabled people, and
Maoists in cantonments; (ii) ensuring transparency in implementation of benefits under
the Project for the conflict-affected groups including the Maoists in cantonments; and (iii)
strengthening of key institutions which are tasked with policy and implementation
functions in peace building, reintegration and rehabilitation.”
8.       Key indicators, according to the original Project Document (PD) main text3, were:
         Proportion of eligible Maoists in cantonments and families of deceased receiving
          timely due payments on an individual basis;
         Regular and effective coordination between the MOPR and other relevant
          agencies at the central and district levels;
         Acceptable audit reports on payments and compliance with agreed payment
          procedures;
         Medium term strategy for economic reintegration of selected conflict-affected
          populations; and
         Inclusion of selected conflict-affected populations in programs providing support
          for reintegration.
PDO indicators as indicated in the original PD, Annex 2, Project Results Framework and
Monitoring, and also reported as PDO indicators in ISRs 1 and 2, were:
         Participation of parties to the peace process in agreed upon structures and
          mechanisms addressing the peace at central and district levels; and


3
  Please note that these Key Indicators were not reflected under PDO indicators in Annex 2, Project Results
Framework and Monitoring, of the original PD, and not reported in the first two ISRs reflecting the original
design. They constitute a compilation (and in one case reformulation) of ‘Component Outcome Indicators’
(considered Intermediate Indicators in this ICR), and ‘Component Outputs’ included in Annex 2.




                                                     2
        Number of specific agreements of the CPA and 23 Point Agreement adhered to.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
9.      In May 2009, less than a year after the project’s approval, a video was published
in which a Maoist leader made comments to party supporters implying that the money
paid by the GON to Maoist ex-combatants would be used for purposes inconsistent with
the peace process, and that the reported number of soldiers in the camps had been inflated.
Although payments to Maoists had been made by the GON, no withdrawals had yet been
made against project funds for these expenses. The World Bank task team reacted quickly,
consulting senior management regarding the proper actions to be taken to avert any risk
that World Bank funds might be used (or be perceived as being used) in a manner
inconsistent with the financing agreement. It was decided to disallow expenditures under
Component 1, an action that necessitated a Level 1 restructuring. A second objective of
the restructuring was to realign the original PDO with the revised role of MOPR, which
had originally been expected to assist with conflict management, truth finding and
reconciliation in addition to delivering GON commitments to conflict-affected groups.
The restructuring was therefore expected to improve the relevance of the project given
the changed circumstances.
10.     The Level 1 restructuring was approved by the World Bank Board on June 2,
2010. The revised PDO was to “contribute to the Peace Process by providing interim cash
transfers and services to eligible conflict-affected groups and by increasing transparency
and accountability in the delivery of these benefits.”
11.    Under the revised PDO, the original key and intermediate project indicators were
replaced4 by streamlined and more precise indicators, while mechanisms for monitoring
were enhanced. The new PDO outcome indicators were:
        At least 95% of identified eligible families of the deceased and widows receive
         cash payments following the operational guidelines of the project;
        At least 90% of the eligible conflict-affected widows, orphans, those disabled in
         the conflict, families of those killed in the conflict, families of the disappeared,
         Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and those abducted during the conflict who
         seek skills and employability rehabilitation services in the targeted districts
         receive them according to the project operational guidelines;
        At least 90% of surveyed recipients are satisfied with the MOPR benefit delivery
         process (cash payments and rehabilitation services);
        Summary information on payments to families of the deceased and widows is
         available on the MOPR website and local disclosure boards are established and
         updated quarterly; and


4
  Please note that the restructuring document neither mentions the ‘Key Indicators’ (listed in the main
document) nor the PDO indictors (mentioned in Annex 2) of the original PD. For the purpose of this ICR
these are assumed to have been dropped together with the original ‘Component Outcome Indicators’.




                                                  3
         An MOPR grievance mechanism is operational.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
12.     The original PD identified the following beneficiary groups for direct support
through cash transfers: Maoists in cantonments during the transition period; families of
people killed as a result of the conflict; and other conflict-affected groups (i.e., people
disabled in the conflict, IDPs, families of people who had disappeared, minors involved
in the conflict, orphaned children and widows). It also identified the following groups to
benefit from capacity development: the MOPR; the Project Management Team (PMT);
other actors in the peace process as needed, including the Peace Commission once
formed, the Peace and Conflict Management Committee if required; Local Peace
Committees; and other groups such as parliamentarians and possibly other bodies related
to the peace process.
13.     The main beneficiaries of the project following the first restructuring were
essentially the same, except for the Maoists in cantonments, and identified as: (i) conflict-
affected widows, orphans, those disabled during the conflict, and families of those killed
in the conflict; (ii) IDPs and those abducted during the conflict; and (iii) the MOPR,
which received support through capacity building and technical assistance under
Component 3. Maoists in cantonments were removed as project beneficiaries, although
they continued to receive payments from the GON using other funds.

1.5 Original Components
14.       The project originally comprised three major components:
     Component 1: Transitional safety net payments to Maoists in cantonments during the
      transition period (US$18.55 million). Under this component, 19,602 Maoists placed
      in twenty-eight cantonments would receive regular cash allowances, and the project
      would reimburse the GON for those payments made between July 2007 and mid
      January 2009. The eligible Maoists were registered and verified by a two stage
      process involving the two parties to the conflict and the United Nations (UN). This
      component was intended to directly support the process of demobilizing the Maoist
      forces in fulfilment of the 23PA.
     Component 2: Benefits to families of those killed as a result of the conflict and
      reintegration support to other conflict-affected populations (US$28.23 million).
      Under this component:
      o Sub-component 1 would finance benefit payments to families of people killed as
          a result of the conflict. This comprised compensation payments to 14,000-plus
          families in the amount of NPR 100,000 per person killed as per a GON decision
          taken in March 2008. This would be paid as a lump sum, though payment would
          be spread over several months to achieve national coverage.
      o Sub-component 2 would provide support for reintegration assistance to other
          conflict-affected groups: people disabled in the conflict; IDPs; families of persons
          who had disappeared; minors involved in the conflict; orphaned children; and
          widows. This could take a variety of forms (e.g. training, legal and counselling
          services, rehabilitation services for disabled people, and piloting of interventions),


                                                4
         and would be elaborated by the GON with technical assistance (TA) provided
         under the Component 3 and in close consultation with other development partners
         through the Nepal Peace Trust Fund (NPTF).
   Component 3: Capacity building of key institutional structures in support of the
    peace process and project management support (US$3.2 million).5 This support was
    essential to the implementation of the project, and was defined quite broadly in light
    of the evolving peace process. Among the activities planned for this component were:
    (i) capacity building and technical assistance to MOPR to perform its core functions
    more effectively. This included developing a management information system (MIS),
    developing internal procedures, communication campaigns for beneficiaries of
    project-financed payments, monitoring, reporting and beneficiary satisfaction
    surveys; (ii) support of core project implementation tasks of the Project Management
    Team (PMT) such as procurement, financial management (FM), including evaluation
    of project interventions through surveys and other assessment tools; and (iii) training,
    workshops and technical assistance for other actors in the peace process as needed,
    including the Peace Commission once formed, the Peace and Conflict Management
    Committee if required, Local Peace Committees (LPCs), and other groups such as
    parliamentarians and possibly other bodies related to the peace process envisaged in
    the 23PA.

1.6 Revised Components
15.     At the Level 1 restructuring, the original Component 1 was dropped for the
reasons described in Section 1.3. The overall budget for the project was unchanged,
however, as were the basic activities of the project for all beneficiary groups except for
those originally envisaged under Component 1. The original Component 1 was replaced
by the original Sub-component 2.2, and benefited from an increased budget, a change that
shifted the focus of the project towards longer-term peace building and rehabilitation of
CAPs. The original Sub-component 2.1 became Component 2. A summary of changes to
the allocations is provided in Annex 10. The revised components were as follows:
   Component 1: Rehabilitation support to conflict-affected families and individuals
    (US$14.5 million). This component provided (i) assistance in the design of service
    packages (to include needs identification, psycho-social counselling, health and
    nutrition counselling, occupational consultations, skill training, formal educational
    scholarships, microfinance and job placement); and (ii) support for a phased roll out
    in selected districts of skills development and employability services, including
    occupational consultations, education and skill training and job placement (an
    initiative called Employment and Self-Employment Services, or ESES).
   Component 2: Cash benefits to families and widows of those killed as a result of the
    conflict (US$31.8 million). This component would finance: (i) payment of


5
 In the main body of the original Emergency Project Paper, the total budget for Component 3 is reported as
US$3.22 million, with US$28.23 million allocated for Component 2. This appears to be an error. The
correct allocations (reported in Annex 3 of the project paper and in all subsequent documents) are
US$28.25 million for Component 2 and US$3.2 million for Component 3.




                                                    5
    NPR 100,000 each to 18,000 families of those killed in the conflict (identified and
    confirmed by the government); and (ii) payment to 9,000 eligible widows of an
    additional NPR 25,000.
   Component 3: Capacity building of key institutional structures in support of the
    peace process and project management support (US$3.2 million). This component
    and budget were left unchanged from the original project design. It comprised (i)
    capacity building and technical assistance for MOPR to perform its core functions
    more effectively; (ii) support for core project implementation tasks of the PMT,
    which included implementation of the Governance and Accountability Action Plan
    (GAAP) and revamped monitoring and evaluation arrangements; and (iii) training,
    workshops and technical assistance for other actors in the peace process as needed,
    including LPCs, the Peace Committee, the Truth and Reconciliation Committee, and
    others once formed.

1.7 Other significant changes
16.    Significant improvements were noted in all aspects of implementation following
the Level 1 restructuring. During the April 2012 supervision mission, it was noted that
interim cash benefits had been provided to 13,877 families; the MOPR had made rapid
progress in implementation of the ESES component; most of the governance and
accountability actions had been completed; and project monitoring and evaluation had
been improved. A Level 2 restructuring was approved on June 11, 2012, to address the
following issues:
   Extension of project closing date. The ESES program had been well received in the
    12 districts covered in the pilot phase, and it was noted in the restructuring document
    that “there is strong demand from CAPs and other stakeholders, including local peace
    committees, for employment services and capacity building which goes beyond one-
    time cash relief.” MOPR had gained insight and experience in implementing the
    program, and it was proposed that this would enable the program to be expanded to
    the remaining 61 conflict-affected districts. MOPR proposed to implement the
    expansion in two phases: Phase I, covering 42 districts, and Phase II, covering 19
    districts.
   Reallocation of grant proceeds. Tracer studies and outreach activities undertaken
    during 2011 revealed that the original estimates of beneficiary numbers were too high,
    implying a reduction in associated indicator targets. The revised estimate of the
    number of eligible beneficiaries under Component 2 decreased to 14,800 families
    (compared to 18,000 originally) and 4,700 widows (original estimate 9,000). Due to
    these revisions, and the extension of the ESES to the remaining 61 conflict-affected
    districts, the total grant under Component 1 and Component 2 was reallocated.
   Revision of the results framework. The results framework was revised with updated
    targets based on the revised beneficiary numbers. Additionally, the revisions
    improved the phrasing of the indicators and included a target for female participation
    in the ESES.
   Changes to Relief Policy In September 2011, the GON amended its relief policy,
    increasing the cash relief amount to the families of deceased from NPR 100,000 to a



                                            6
    maximum of NPR 300,000 per family. Based on the available project funds, it was
    agreed that the project would finance these additional payments for 2,900 families.
17.     The first phase of the expansion of ESES, to 42 districts, was completed
successfully. However, the final phase of ESES, intended to cover 19 districts, started too
late. The PMT advertised a call for proposals in early 2013, and received an unexpectedly
large number of applications. Due to the limited capacity of staff in the PMT, and the
secondment of project staff to assist with the Constituent Assembly elections that year,
the review of training provider applications took longer than expected and training would
not have concluded before project closure. Although the GON requested another project
extension to finish the work, this was denied due to the already long duration of the
project. The remaining project funds, amounting to SDR 8.45 million, were
accordingly cancelled on January 31, 2014.6

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18.     Project preparation took place in a fragile political setting, in which World
Bank support was requested to facilitate a comprehensive peace settlement between the
GON and rebel groups. Recognizing the importance of a rapid and flexible response, and
the MOPR’s inchoate administrative capacity to design and implement the initiatives
agreed under the 23PA, the World Bank elected to prepare the project as an Emergency
Operation under OP/BP 8.00. The project preparation team comprised highly experienced
Nepalese and international professionals, who brought both understanding of the local
political context and experience from other post-conflict environments. This expertise
was crucial, as there had been no previous operations of this nature in Nepal.
19.     Design. The inherent riskiness of the operation was well understood by the
project team. It was acknowledged in the PD that this was “a ‘high risk, high reward’
operation.” Internal discussions were held with the Country Director, Regional Vice
President and Managing Director regarding the likely risks, and these were well
documented in the PD and the minutes of the concept review meeting. It was
acknowledged that the risk to the PDO (i.e., the sustainability of the peace process) was
high, and could not realistically be mitigated under the project. The most significant risk
to materialize—the videotape revelation—was indirectly anticipated in the PD as
“Bank…viewed as providing support to Maoist party instead of individual Maoists.”
Various measures, including the use of strict Beneficiary Payment Operational
Guidelines (BPOG) and payment by individual check (later, individual bank account
deposits), were put in place to diminish this reputational risk.
20.     Quality at Entry. The project’s original Components 1 and 2 were designed with
direct reference to the 23PA, and the World Bank’s financial and technical support in
these areas made a crucial contribution to the peace process. There was a certain degree


6
  These funds would have comfortably covered the cost of the final training, and also included some
savings due to exchange rate gains and unutilized contingencies.




                                                7
of ambiguity in the design of Sub-component 2 of Component 2 (support for
reintegration assistance to other conflict-affected groups), the clarification of which was
deliberately postponed until a higher level of implementation capacity had been
developed in the MOPR. This ambiguity was ultimately not resolved until the first
restructuring, but the revised Component 1 was subsequently well implemented and
highly relevant to the PDO. Component 3 was originally designed to be broad in scope,
covering a range of possible roles for the evolving MOPR in addition to project
management. In the initial stages of the project, it supported the adoption of the BPOG
and verification of beneficiary lists, necessary conditions for the disbursement of funds
under Components 1 and 2.

2.2 Implementation
21.     The most important factor affecting the implementation of the project was the
videotape revelation and associated Level 1 restructuring. The actions taken were
reasonable under the circumstances, although it should be noted that the GON initially
opposed the disallowance of Component 1 payments (and continued to pay them in the
absence of reimbursement by the World Bank). The restructuring substantially changed
the nature of the project, from one focused on maintaining the ceasefire agreement, to one
that supported the longer-term rehabilitation and reintegration of CAPs into society.
However, this change led to delays in the disbursement of funds under the revised
Component 1, which were conditional on the design and contracting of training programs.
22.     Project management capacity at the MOPR was a major constraint, especially
during the project’s early days. While the team involved in preparation was aware of
these limitations, their intention was to build the necessary capacity while at the same
time implementing activities urgently required due to the circumstances described above.
In the 2012 Restructuring Paper it was noted that “up to October June 2011 [sic], the
project suffered from limited capacity and frequent change in project directorship and
Ministry senior management leading to significant delays.” These delays were ultimately
overcome with the appointment of a proactive Joint Secretary to the PMT leadership in
2011, who remained in the position until project closure and substantially improved
progress on the project.
23.     Additional commitments made by the government. As described in Sections 1.6
and 1.7, the restructured project financed additional compensation payments to 2,900
families of conflict victims in support of a GON commitment to raise the compensation
from NPR 100,000 to NPR 300,000 per family. The GON subsequently made a further
commitment to raise the level of compensation, this time to NPR 1 million per family. At
the time of project closure, the additional compensation was yet to be paid to some
beneficiaries. Although the additional compensation was never covered under the project,
beneficiaries were unsurprisingly not aware of these details. Around 45% of respondents
in the second beneficiary satisfaction survey reported dissatisfaction with the payment
process in protest of their outstanding entitlements. In assessing the third outcome
indicator, we disregard this survey result on the basis that it is biased by this exogenous
factor.




                                            8
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
24.     Design. In the original project design, M&E was central to the verification of cash
transfer beneficiaries. Joint verification by the UN and GON was used to identify and
validate ex-combatant beneficiaries. Families of victims were identified by the GON and
verified by local civil society groups. Independent surveys were used to track the
quantitative results indicators.
25.    Social audits and third party monitoring were part of the original project design.
During restructuring, monitoring arrangements were significantly enhanced, comprising:
(i) development of an MIS; (ii) third-party monitoring in the form of beneficiary
assessment surveys and social audits; and (iii) financial management reviews and audits
conducted by the World Bank. These enhancements were reflected in more relevant
outcome indicators, the first three of which were tracked using MIS data and results from
the beneficiary assessments.
26.     Implementation. The M&E processes were generally adequate in scope and rigor,
and were well used for project monitoring. The use of spot checks led to a substantial
reduction in the number of identified beneficiaries versus the original estimates. Opinion
surveys reflected a high degree of beneficiary satisfaction with the cash payment process,
and the existence of such monitoring likely influenced performance of local bodies
delivering the funds as well.
27.    Utilization. The project made ample use of the data collected for refinement of
the outputs. In the case of the ESES program, for example, the beneficiary satisfaction
survey results and trainer reports on job placement of beneficiaries during the pilot phase
were used to refine the contracting procedure and training model.7 Certain aspects of the
M&E system, including the MIS, will have utility for the MOPR beyond the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
28.     There were no deviations or waivers from the Bank safeguards and fiduciary
policies and procedures during the implementation of the project. No safeguard policies
were triggered by the project.
29.     Financial management. The overall financial management (FM) performance of
the project is rated as satisfactory. Initially, the overall risk rating of the project was high,
but this was later mitigated with FM improvement actions. Being a new ministry, the
MOPR took some time to establish FM arrangements. Frequent turnover of accounts staff
also impacted FM compliance at this time. As a result, there were delays in the
submission of trimester financial and audit reports, and this led to a downgrading of the
FM rating to unsatisfactory in June 2010. In the January 2011 ISR, it was noted that
“financial management performance remain[ed] unsatisfactory as trimester reports [were]
overdue, ineligible expenses [had] not been refunded, and [the] overall financial control



7
  An impact evaluation was planned for the final phase of ESES, but could not proceed due to the
cancellation of this component.




                                               9
system [was] weak.” The project was not able to maintain financial records for a long
time, as a result of which the FM rating remained unsatisfactory until 2012.
30.     During FY10 and FY11, disbursements were suspended due to overdue audit
reports. Later, with the change of staff within the PMT and the hiring of FM consultants,
significant improvements were observed. Backlogs of accounts were cleared, and
registers were updated and maintained until project closure, resulting in the timely
submission of financial and audit reports. Monitoring of expenditures at the district level
was also strengthened. As a result of this turnaround, the FM rating was upgraded to
satisfactory.
31.      Procurement. The overall procurement management rating is satisfactory, and
remained so for the duration of the project with one exception. Though the procurement
for the project was burdensome given the need to contract a large number of service
providers to deliver ESES to the CAPs, preparation and implementation of a Field
Implementation Manual (FIM) facilitated the smooth implementation of procurement
activities and the project overall. At the outset of the ESES, activities were delayed due to
a lack of clarity regarding the process and activities to be implemented. However, the
existence of the FIM and the provision of several rounds of orientation programs to
project staff and participating service providers (which covered procurement among other
topics) helped to expedite the implementation process.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
32.    This was an emergency project designed to support the peace process, and the
implementing ministry was not expected to endure beyond the peace process. Thus no
second phase was planned, and many of the key project staff were consultants hired for
the term of the project only. Since all deliverables were either completed or cancelled,
there was no need to provide for maintenance or ongoing monitoring.
33.      For the time being, the MOPR continues to operate. Since the closure of the
project, the MOPR has continued to develop its plans for psychosocial counselling of
CAPs (design of which was funded under the revised Component 1), and is planning to
conduct ESES training in the remaining 19 districts not reached by the project. These
activities are continuing with support from other donors including the NPTF.
34.     The MOPR, and the GON more broadly, have derived residual benefit from the
capacity built through the project, including: (i) a clear framework for the delivery of
basic employment services; (ii) a performance-based contracting model for efficient
delivery of services; (iii) a cadre of NGOs and CSOs with depth of experience as service
providers; and (iv) capacity building of personnel at the DAO and LPC level to monitor
project implementation. The Borrower ICR explicitly mentions the continuous benefits of
the MIS, policy documents, tool and instruments developed and established under the
project, as well as significant benefits of learning from project implementation, which the
Ministry is determined to embed into future activities. All these achievements will
enhance the quality of future government service delivery.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Project at Appraisal
35.      The GON urgently sought international support to fulfil the conditions of the
23PA in a fair and transparent manner. This was crucial to the credibility of the peace
process and the country’s long-term development outlook, and it is important to note that
at appraisal the country was still experiencing significant instability despite the ceasefire.
Moreover, the newly-formed MOPR had been established to deliver on the agreed
programs, and needed technical assistance to establish itself and undertake the task of
restitution and reconstruction. In such an environment, it was reasonable to expect that
the World Bank’s support to the smooth execution of the 23PA would materially
contribute to the peace process. The project’s objectives were fully consistent with the
World Bank’s post-conflict transitional support strategy for Nepal (as outlined in the
Interim Strategy Note, 2007), and resonate with the latest Country Partnership Strategy
(2014-18), which emphasizes the importance of sustaining the peace process.
36.     Although the PDO was appropriate given the fragile political situation and the
need to provide immediate assistance under the 23PA, some of the original PDO and
Component Outcome indicators 8 , though pertinent to the broader peace process, had
limited attribution to the overall project design, and were subject to influences beyond the
scope of the project. Given the project’s lack of direct political capacity or peace building
components, the link in the results chain between the project’s components and these
indicators is tenuous.
37.     On balance, project relevance prior to restructuring is rated as substantial. The
pre-restructuring PDO relevance was high, but design relevance was only modest given
the above shortcomings.
Relevance of Project Following Level 1 Restructuring
38.     The revised results framework was considerably more restrained, reflecting a
more realistic assessment of the implementation capacity of the MOPR. Based on results
of a tracer survey, the funds allocated to the original Component 1 were redirected
towards scaled-up support for the economic reintegration of conflict-affected families,
reflecting an advancement in the peace process from demobilization and immediate
survival of CAPs to the rebuilding of the economy and citizen trust in government. The



8
  Original indicators with dubious relevance to the project include: Participation of parties to the peace
process in agreed upon structures and mechanisms addressing the peace at central and district levels;
Number of specific agreements in the CPA and 23PA adhered to; Reduction in cease fire violations; and
Peace Commission constituted and operational and agreed multi-party mechanism in place pending Peace
Commission formation.




                                                   11
PDO’s relevance remained high, while design relevance increased to substantial. On
balance, the restructured project’s relevance is rated as high.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Outcomes
39.    The efficacy of the original PDO is rated as modest. The original PDO indicators
were on their way to achievement at the time of restructuring, and the peace process has
continued since (albeit slowly) without significant reversal.
40.     The efficacy of the revised PDO, in contrast, is rated as substantial with minor
shortcomings. Supporting this conclusion, four of the revised PDO level results indicators
were met and one was partially met. (i) Cash payments for identified eligible families of
those deceased due to the conflict and widows were delivered to 14,770 out of an
expected 14,800 eligible families (99% coverage against the target of 95%). (ii) The
delivery of skills and employability rehabilitation services to [beneficiaries] who seek
[them]” was technically met in the 61 districts where ESES was offered (pilot phase and
phase 1). (iii) The target beneficiary satisfaction rate for cash payments and rehabilitation
services) of 90% was met for cash benefits (with surveys showing 91% satisfaction), and
also fully achieved for rehabilitation services (79% satisfaction against a target of 80%
following the 2012 restructuring). The target female participation rate of 30% was
substantially exceeded, with half of trainees being female. (iv) At the end of the project,
the MOPR website was fully operational. Records and information of the deceased and
widows were entered on the MIS and available online on the Ministry’s project website.
District disclosure boards were functional and updated quarterly. Finally, (v) the outcome
to have appropriate grievance mechanisms operational had been achieved as well. Two
officers were designated as grievance focal points, and a grievance handling MIS system
with a toll-free hotline was made operational for handling grievances.
41.      It seems reasonable to conclude that the project contributed to advancing the
peace process in Nepal. It is true that, while the peace process has not broken down, it has
taken longer and been less conclusive than was anticipated at the time of appraisal.
However, many factors have had a more significant bearing on this outcome than the
project itself. Given the project’s strategic relevance and delivery of the bulk of
anticipated outputs, the Bank’s decision to support cash payments and employment
services in conflict-affected areas made a real difference to the lives of beneficiaries and
thereby helped promote social inclusion and restore economic activity and confidence in
the GON. This is evidenced by the findings of the beneficiary assessments (see Annex 5).
Moreover, the project contributed to capacity building within the MOPR and at the local
institution level, which has arguably supported sustained peace in Nepal.

3.3 Efficiency
42.     The ICR did not undertake a full economic analysis of the program due to lack of
impact evaluation data and the short-term nature of the project (focused on peace and
rehabilitation). Furthermore, fiscal sustainability of the program is not an issue as it
supported short-term cash transfers to CAPs rather than provision of a permanent safety
net. A basic economic analysis is provided in Annex 3.




                                             12
43.     The basic economic analysis concludes that the efficiency of the project prior to
restructuring was substantial, on both economic and cost grounds. However, the project
took significantly longer than usual for an emergency project (with IDA funds), and
ultimately just under one third of the funds were cancelled due to the dropped ESES
Phase II. These considerations imply a significant amount of money tied up for many
years with no resulting output. Taking this into account, the rating for efficiency after
restructuring is downgraded to modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
44.     Based on the above Table 1. Application of Ratings Formula
assessment, and applying the                        Pre-            Post-
Bank’s guidance on weighted                    restructuring restructuring      Overall

                                  indicator
restructuring. Whereas the
project’s overall rating prior to restructuring was moderately unsatisfactory due to its
modest efficacy, its relevance and efficacy were high and substantial, respectively, after
restructuring, and the rating increased to moderately satisfactory. Constructing weights
based on the share of funds disbursed prior to (US$19.4 million, as of RP, corresponding
to 56%), and post (US$14.7 million, corresponding to 43%) restructuring, out of a total
disbursement of US$ 34.1 million (after cancellation of US$12.3 million) would suggest
a borderline moderately unsatisfactory rating overall (Table 1).9
45.     However, in light of the fact that the project achieved its PDO in a very
challenging environment, and exceeded two of its five outcome indicators, the team
concludes that the project outcome should be rated moderately satisfactory. As an
emergency project that was developed during a time of considerable uncertainty and
political change, the project’s risks were recognized explicitly upfront and discussed
extensively with management. The project was designed with adequate controls to
mitigate these risks, and early restructuring—a response to situations where risks
materialize—is common in emergency projects. The project did not change a lot in terms
of its major activities and PDO following the restructuring, while the revised project
design adapted the project to the needs of beneficiaries in an evolving peace process. The
revised PDO and PDO indicators were achieved for the most part, as shown above. Had
the final cancellation of funds not been necessary, the weighting breakdown above would



9
  The 2012 Restructuring will not be subject of a similar split rating exercise, since only the targets of some
indicators were changed and the overall DO ratings immediately pre and post restructuring (MS), did not
change. Hence another weighted rating calculation would have no effect on the outcome of the previous
exercise.




                                                     13
have been 41% prior to restructuring and 59% post restructuring, resulting in a clear
moderately satisfactory rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
46.     Poverty Impacts. Beneficiary assessments indicate that the compensation
payments and training services provided to CAPs and their families had a substantial
impact on their welfare. Such families are ordinarily considered highly vulnerable to
falling into poverty, especially in the aftermath of a civil war and given the global
economic downturn that coincided with the project’s inception. During a field visit, the
ICR team interviewed a number of beneficiaries who had used the training to find new
employment opportunities. Some beneficiaries were people with disabilities as a result of
the conflict, while others were family members of the deceased or disabled who now
needed to work in order to replace the latter’s lost income. According to the results of the
beneficiary assessments and training provider reports, between 50% and 60% of those
individuals who received training under the program found employment, although it was
not possible to evaluate whether this employment was sustained given the short time span
between conclusion of training and the evaluation.
47.     Gender Aspects. The project was sensitive to gender issues. First, the majority of
cash transfer beneficiaries were women. Additional compensation payments were made
to widows of war victims, typically a highly vulnerable group. Second, the ESES
program set a participation target of 30% female students for the training, but the actual
share was 50%. As a result of the training, 10% of female training beneficiaries migrated
for employment following the training according to the first third-party monitoring
survey.10
48.     Social Development. One of the key objectives of the project was to support the
peace process by reintegrating ex-combatants, CAPs and their families. While the project
ultimately could not support the former group, CAPs and their families received cash
transfers and employment services. Beneficiary assessments indicate that these
interventions had a positive impact on the welfare of a majority, and social standing of a
minority, of beneficiaries. An improvement in social interactions such as participation in
social and cultural functions was reported by 22.5% of respondents. About 8.6% noted
that their neighbors were friendlier after they received the support, 4.9% of respondents
felt happier, and 5.2% felt harassed by their neighbors asking for loans. These impacts
were greater among women than men.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
49.    For a number of reasons, the capacity building component of the project ended up
being used primarily to support implementation. However, the project also contributed to
enhanced capacity and standing of local institutions (DAOs and LPCs); a grievance
redress mechanism was set up for MOPR program beneficiaries; and an MIS was


10
   This survey was conducted in ten program districts, and 20% of beneficiaries in each district were
interviewed. The total sample of training beneficiaries was 292 females and 206 males.


                                                 14
developed for the Ministry. Finally, the project mandated the use of third-party
verification and BPOG for the payment of cash transfers. These practices all set a
precedent for future government programs.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N.A.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
50.    See Annex 5 for a summary of the Beneficiary Assessment findings. No
stakeholder workshops were held.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low or Negligible
51.     The final PDO was “to contribute to the peace process by providing interim cash
transfers and services to eligible conflict affected groups and by increasing transparency
and accountability in the delivery of these benefits.” Since the cash transfers and services
have been delivered (with the exception of Phase II of ESES), and have served their
purpose of contributing to the peace process, there is no risk of future events impacting
this outcome.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
52.    The Bank fielded a team of local experts to advise on political and economic
circumstances, and international experts on social protection and post-conflict
reconstruction. The team drew on the Bank’s extensive international experience with
demobilization and reparation, while remaining sensitive to local circumstances and the
need to honor the 23PA.
53.     Considering the circumstances under which it was written, the PD was
comprehensive in scope. Some flexibility was left in terms of implementation
arrangements, but this was deliberate given the evolving political situation, and the
overall intent of the project was clear. The internal controls put in place to manage the
cash transfers were very effective, and reflected the Bank’s learning in other country
contexts. However, there were shortfalls in the realism of some of the outcome indicators
and their link to the PDO. These precluded a higher rating for quality at entry.
54.     Risks were moderately well anticipated and mitigated. Recognizing the fluidity
and fragility of the political economy at the time of preparation, the project appraisal
team undertook a risk assessment that recognized the potential for risks and proposed
adequate mitigating measures. While a major political risk did materialize, the strong
fiduciary controls built into the project prevented this event from damaging the Bank’s
reputation. On the other hand, the team did not explicitly cite the limited capacity of the
MOPR as a risk to the PDO, and conditioned the project’s disbursements on the rapid
implementation of new procedures in a relatively new ministry and a generally unstable


                                            15
political environment. This slowed down disbursement and ultimately contributed to the
cancellation of project funds.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
55.     Disbursement of funds under the project did not commence for over a year.
However, the supervision team was quick to respond to allegations that payments made
to ex-combatants might be used in a manner inconsistent with the project objectives. The
resulting Level 1 restructuring was serendipitous, since it improved the clarity and
pragmatism of the project design, and arguably strengthened the linkage between the
project’s outputs and the PDO.
56.    Following restructuring, the Bank team focused on helping the MOPR to develop
the operating procedures for the ESES component and to build the capacity of the PMT.
The Bank team and new PMT strengthened their partnership following the mid-term
review, and the results were evident in the rapid scale-up of ESES incorporating learning
from the pilot. In addition to project specific activities, the TTL maintained
communication with the NPTF and shared experiences on a regular basis. A higher rating
was precluded due to the slow rate of disbursement and ultimate cancellation of funds,
which might have been averted had proactive measures been taken.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
57.    Overall Bank Performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. While the team
did well given the emergency context, the original design could have been improved by
more closely conforming the PDO and results framework to the project’s outputs, being
more realistic regarding what was achievable in the emergency context, and by exercising
more attentive supervision regarding the ESES component.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
58.     The performance of the Borrower is rated as moderately satisfactory. Progress
was slow during early stages of project implementation due to lack of capacity within the
MOPR and frequently changing leadership of the PMT. The GON could probably have
done more to ensure that the MOPR was adequately staffed and procedures put in place
to accelerate disbursements. In the later stages of the project, PMT management and
project support improved, although slow fiduciary processes remained a constraint on
project progress and may have contributed to the cancellation of the final phase of ESES.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
59.     Performance of the implementing agency was also mixed. Implementation was
relatively slow during the first few years of the project, reflecting both the project
management arrangements and the capacity limitations of the new ministry. Financial
management was also problematic at times during the project. Following the appointment
of a new Project Coordinator (who remained in the job until the end of the project) and an


                                           16
expanded PMT in November 2011, there was a significant improvement in the pace and
quality of project activities. Outstanding fiduciary issues were resolved. The objectives
and responsibilities of project participants were clearly documented in a FIM. The PMT
organized capacity building workshops for district and local government officers, service
providers, and other project participants, and an MIS was rapidly developed by a team of
consultants.
60.     The performance of the implementing agency after the 2012 extension was only
compromised by the late commencement of contracting for the second phase of ESES.
The remaining phase had to be cancelled as a result, and it is arguable that the PMT could
have anticipated this and started the contracting process earlier to ensure all training was
completed before the project closing date. The PMT argues that they had assumed they
would get another one-year extension on the project, but the ICR team found no evidence
that such a commitment was made by the Bank.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
61.    Overall Borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. Initial project
implementation was weak due to a lack of capacity among the project management and
the MOPR more generally. Following restructuring, there was a gradual improvement in
implementation and development of strong capacity within the PMT due to dedicated and
committed leadership. A higher rating was precluded by the factors leading to
cancellation of Phase II of ESES.
The Borrower prepared a detailed and comprehensive own Project Completion Report,
the executive summary of which is attached in Annex 7.

6. Lessons Learned
62.    Teams preparing emergency operations should be encouraged to be more
conservative with planned outputs than they would for a standard investment
project, especially in a low-capacity setting and with new processes. In this project,
overly ambitious objectives regarding the capacity of a new ministry to roll out a training
program nationwide contributed to the ultimate cancellation of project funds.
Furthermore, the original project objectives were overly ambitious and difficult to
measure. Given the high levels of risk and sensitivity, weak capacity and leadership that
are typically present in emergency project situations, the goals of such projects should
accordingly be more conservative, and more focused on building capacity than on
meeting stretch targets or deadlines. It would be useful to develop special guidance for
the preparation and evaluation of emergency projects that explicitly takes these
constraints into account.
63.     Operations in a post-conflict situation should anticipate a high level of risk
and political sensitivity. The videotape revelation precipitated a restructuring of the
project to avoid misuse of funds and adverse reputational consequences. The risk of this
occurring was acknowledged at preparation and mitigated through the use of BPOG. A
reliable process was put in place to identify genuine beneficiaries, minimizing grievances
and the risk of leakage, while close supervision and a timely response from the Bank
team averted any reputational impact from the videotape revelation. A high level of risk


                                            17
is likely in emergency operations, and this should not be a deterrent to such projects.
Rather, task teams should manage this risk by strengthening borrower capacity for
oversight and fiduciary control, ensuring transparency of processes, and maintaining
close supervision during implementation.
64.     The capacity of the implementing agency and the quality of its leadership can
make or break an operation. Prior to 2011, the project made slow progress, hampered
by the restructuring and the limited capacity of the MOPR. Leadership turnover was
frequent. The appointment of a strong Project Coordinator in 2011, who remained in the
position until the project’s closure, was evidently a factor in the successful completion of
the cash transfer program and implementation of the ESES component. A commitment to
capacity building for project functions also helped. Project teams should be mindful that
even with a well-designed project and government commitment to the PDO, the quality
and processes of the PMT can have a significant bearing on project outcomes. It is
imperative to ensure at the project design stage that the PMT will be well structured,
staffed and skilled for the life of the project.
65.     Good processes strengthen program performance. While the ESES program
was slow to start and had its share of weaknesses, it is notable that a new ministry
managed to design and implement a relatively successful skills training and employment
program in only three years. This can be attributed to the use of strong program processes,
including performance-based contracting and public-private partnerships. Service
providers were required to achieve a minimum 50% post-training employment rate in
order to receive the final contract payment. This mechanism ensured the relevance and
quality of training and improved outcomes. The program also employed a ‘learning from
experience’ model, relying on a small pilot to refine the design for the main phase.
Finally, capacity building was central to the success of ESES, with workshops used to
inform local government officials and interested providers. Combined with a clear
proposal evaluation framework, this enabled the PMT to identify and select competent
service providers. Many of these service providers scaled up as a result of the project,
leaving a residual body of experienced trainers that will serve as a resource for future
programs.
66.     Teams should anticipate delays during implementation, and have a plan to
deal with them. Projects often encounter delays that hamper progress against the PDO,
and this was the case both in the early stages of ESES and immediately following
restructuring. While some of these delays are unavoidable, such as the need to develop
operations manuals before commencing the work, others (such as the delay in
commencing Phase II of ESES) might have been identified and mitigated earlier with
closer supervision and more proactive planning.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1. Employment and Self-Employment Services (ESES) (total actual cost
US$6.24 million)
This component was designed to be implemented in three phases – a pilot phase in 12
districts, followed by two additional phases to cover the remaining 61 conflict-affected
districts. Based on estimated costs of program design and delivery, provision was made
for the delivery of employment services to an estimated 25,000 CAPs.
During the pilot phase, employment-linked training was offered in 19 different trades. A
majority of beneficiaries enrolled in construction-related trades, such as plumbing (15%;
459 beneficiaries); building electrician (14%; 420) and masonry (11%; 319). The
construction trades attracted many candidates because these skills were seen to be of high
demand in the Gulf countries where many Nepalese job seekers aspire to migrate for
work. Although not a contractual requirement, training program graduates were provided
with an opportunity to take a National Skill Board examination, with the cost of the test
being borne by the project. Of the 2,315 beneficiaries who took the test, 1,778 passed.
During the pilot phase, 2,964 beneficiaries completed the respective ESES training
programs and 1,789 (60%) found employment.
Building on outcomes and lessons learned from the pilot phase, Phase I of ESES was
rolled out in 42 districts. Eighteen service providers were selected from 93 applications,
and between them they received 295 contracts for the delivery of training to 11,740
beneficiaries (of whom 11,693 enrolled). Female participation in the ESES program was
encouraged in both phases. In the pilot phase, 40% (1,200) were females, with female
participation reaching 53% (6,147) in Phase I. Accordingly, the PDO indicator of 30%
female participation was substantially exceeded. Female enrolment was encouraged by
the provision of training in female-oriented trades such as tailoring and hand embroidery.
Phase I offered training programs for 27 different trades; 13 new trades were introduced,
while 5 trades were dropped from the pilot phase. Off-season vegetable farming had the
largest number of participants (19%; 2,159) followed by building electrician (14%;
1,596) and tailoring (11%; 1,238). Of the total 295 contracts awarded, the project
received Employment Completion Reports (ECR) for 276 contracts; according to these
reports, 55.3% of trainees in Phase I found employment 6 months or less after completing
the training. Third-party verification confirmed 206 of these ECRs, and found an
employment rate of 56.3%. Of the 11,693 beneficiaries who enrolled in training
services in Phase I of the program, 11,540 completed the training.
Phase II of ESES was intended to cover the remaining 19 districts. The MOPR received
948 proposals from interested training providers, an unexpectedly large number that
overwhelmed the capacity of the bid evaluation team. The situation was worsened by the
secondment of PMT staff at this time to work on the Constituent Assembly elections. The
PMT expected to receive an extension of 5 to 6 months to complete Phase II. Following
notification that further extensions would not be granted, evaluation of proposals was
cancelled and bidders were advised accordingly. Since the closure of the project, the
PMT has submitted a proposal to the NPTF to support the implementation of Phase II.




                                           20
The ESES component also supported the design of a psychosocial counselling program to
CAPs. This program was intended to assist the reintegration of CAPs by helping them
deal with the traumas resulting from the conflict. The design of the counselling was
successfully completed and MOPR is now seeking financing from the NPTF for its
implementation.

Component 2. Cash benefits to families of widows of those killed as a result of the
conflict (total actual cost US$22.31 million).
The objective of Component 2 was to provide interim relief payments to families of those
killed as a result of the conflict. The revised component covered: (i) a NPR 100,000
payment to 14,800 families of conflict victims; (ii) a further NPR 200,000 to 2,900
families; and (iii) an additional NPR 25,000 payment to 4,700 widows of those killed in
the conflict (and not covered by army or police compensation arrangements). Results
from the first Third Party Monitoring survey found high levels of satisfaction with and
impact from the transfers, hence the component exceeded the targets set at the June 2012
restructuring. Payments to families of those killed in the conflict were delivered to 14,309
out of an estimated 14,800 eligible families (97% coverage against the target of 95%).
Payments were received by 4,568 eligible widows against a target of 4,700 (97% against
the target of 95%). At the second Third Party Monitoring, satisfaction was considerably
lower (54%), however as discussed in Section 2.2 we believe this result was biased by an
unrelated grievance regarding other government commitments to CAPs.
Further details on these results are presented in Annex 5.

Component 3. Capacity building of key institutional structures in support of the
peace process and project management support (total actual cost US$3.04 million).
Component 3 provided resources for project management, institutional capacity
development and training. Guidelines were developed for payment and ESES services in
support of Intermediate Outcome (IO) indicators 2 and 3, through a consultative process
involving the NPTF and stakeholders (also supporting achievement of IO indicator 1).
Training, orientation, and information sessions outlining operating procedures, roles and
responsibilities related to the project were conducted for MOPR personnel, LPC and
DAO staff, training service providers, and beneficiaries. These training sessions were
reinforced through media and communication campaigns (supporting achievement of IO
indicator 4). A grievance mechanism was introduced and handled a large number of
grievances about the cash payment and ESES processes (achieving outcome indicator 5
and IO indicator 8). This substantially increased the social accountability of the project,
as did the use of disclosure boards (satisfying outcome indicator 4 and IO indicator 9).
The component supported the development of an M&E plan as described in Section 2.3,
which satisfied IO indicator 11. Beneficiary assessments and social audits were financed
and conducted on an annual basis, satisfying IO indicators 5, 6 and 10.
A key outcome from Component 3 (supporting the achievement of IO indicator 7) was
the development of the MIS, which contained data on all CAPs, the project accounting
system, program budget modules, and all elements of the ESES program. At the time of
project closure, the MIS team was developing additional modules to support the
implementation of other MOPR programs as well. In order to ensure the system was


                                            21
usable at all levels, MIS training was provided to DAO, DDC, and LPC officials. While
the project-supported activities are now completed, the MIS will have ongoing relevance
for the MOPR as it continues with peace-related interventions in ESES, psychosocial
counselling and the payment of remaining obligations to beneficiaries.




                                          22
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A full economic and financial analysis was not done during preparation, and was also not
possible at the ICR stage. This is because the intention of the Emergency Recovery Loan
was to support a peace process and stabilize a very tenuous peace settlement. The overall
economic return of the project is therefore impossible to quantify. While the project did
have outputs with a direct economic benefit, it was not possible at the ICR stage to
measure the direct welfare impact of these outputs, since no impact evaluations were
conducted and data from the beneficiary assessment were inadequate for such an exercise.

However, looking at the outputs, it can be concluded that the project’s components had a
substantial economic benefit:
        First, it can be assumed that the benefit of the targeted cash transfers was
         extremely high, given they were provided to households that had lost family
         members or were caring for people with disabilities.
        The employment and self-employment services were similarly delivered to very
         needy individuals, and employment rates were reasonable (60%) in comparison to
         other training programs in the region.
        Finally, it is important to factor in the social and community-wide impact of
         greater economic and social agency promoted by the project, a factor to which it
         is not possible to assign a precise value.
The project was also relatively cost efficient:
        Analysis of cost data for Phase 1 of the ESES program shows an average program
         cost of NPR 20,825 or NPR 231 per trainee per day (see Tables A3.1, A3.2 and
         A3.3). 11 This is relatively low compared to comparator programs. 12 Factors
         contributing to efficiency include: (i) the utilization of NGOs and CSOs as
         training service providers; (ii) the adoption of competitive, performance-based
         contracting; (iii) the development and delivery of orientation workshops to
         potential bidders; (iv) clarity and transparency of the bid evaluation process; and
         (v) multilevel performance monitoring of training program delivery.
        Component 2 was delivered with a high degree of efficiency. Contributing factors
         included the development of clear BPOG, engagement of LPCs and DAOs in
         program oversight, and the adoption of a broadly based communication campaign.
         Processing of claims was conducted by existing staff as part of their ongoing
         responsibilities thus incurring no incremental salary costs.
On balance, the team therefore concludes that the project’s economic efficiency as
designed was substantial. As described in Section 3.3, eventualities during


11
   Program costs include staff and administrative costs, rental costs for training delivery sites, non-durable
goods and consumables, and depreciation of fixed assets.
12
   In addition to training program delivery costs, this figure includes a beneficiary allowance of NPR 4,600
per month for lodging and meal expenses during the training period, plus NPR 1,500 per month for daily
transport costs to and from the training worksite.


                                                     23
implementation detracted from the overall economic efficiency, which is therefore
downgraded to moderate once these factors are taken into account.

    16.5% said they had difficulty in meeting the VDC secretary.




                                               29
   The average time taken for application processing varied across districts. On average,
    it took about 15 months to receive payments after filing the application. The
    beneficiaries had to visit the district headquarters 11 times on average to follow up on
    the process. 81.5% of respondents stated that the government officials were friendly
    in processing their application once the proper documents had been submitted.
   Only a small number (12%) of respondents thought that the location of the bank was
    suitable. In Morang, only 1.2% of those interviewed said that the bank was close to
    them. In districts like Kailali (81.0%), Bardiya (59.8%) and Dadeldhura (73.7%), a
    significant number of beneficiaries had trouble accessing the banks.
   Among the beneficiaries surveyed, 74.8% were satisfied with the time they had to
    spend to receive the support; 80.0% and 80.7% were satisfied with the process they
    had to go through to deal with DDC/DAO/VDC officials and local political party
    leaders respectively; and 65.8% were satisfied with the ease with which they could
    reach the bank.
   The vast majority of survey participants (85%) said they were satisfied with the
    overall service delivery process. About 2% stated that they were highly satisfied,
    about 8% said they were not satisfied and 6% said they were very dissatisfied. Most
    of those who were not satisfied complained that the service delivery process was too
    long and they had to spend a lot of money (up to NPR 20,000 in Morang, Bardiya and
    Kailali districts) to receive the support funds.
Impact
   The survey asked about the social impacts felt by beneficiaries as a result of receiving
    the payments. About 58% said they did not feel any change, while 22.5% stated that
    social interactions such as participation in social and cultural functions increased.
    About 8.6% felt their neighbors were friendlier after they received the support; 4.9%
    felt happier; and 5.2% felt harassed by their neighbors asking for loans.
   The relief support has helped increase the confidence of many widows and close
    family members. This, in turn, has encouraged them to improve their livelihood by
    purchasing property (11% of males and 9% of females); repaying loans (16% of
    males and 15% of females); and repairing their houses (9% of males and 7% of
    females). 15% of males and 13% of females are saving the relief support for future
    use. 20% of females and 15% of males invested the money in education.

Monitoring
   According to the regulations, the DAO was supposed to conduct a field verification.
    In the sampled 14 districts only 15% respondents said the DAO visited for
    verification.
   A significant number of beneficiaries (48.4%) thought that the government should use
    VDCs to develop prompt and reliable service mechanisms. Similarly, about 43.4%
    beneficiaries felt that the government should develop more simple, prompt and
    reliable systems to support disadvantaged people.

Key Findings
Component 1
Situation before training
   Graduates were asked their geographic location before and after participating in the
    training. Prior to attending the training, about 70% of graduates said they were living
    in rural areas, 21.7% in urban areas, and 6% in semi-urban areas. Their geographic
    location after graduating from the training was 64.3% in rural areas, 9.2% in semi-
    urban areas, 26.3% in urban-areas, and 0.2% overseas.
Impact
   61.6% participants evaluated the training as ‘moderate’, 34.1% as ‘good’, and 4.3%
    as ‘weak’.
   Prior to training, about 75.3% of participants were unemployed (of which 61.8% were
    females and 38.2% males), 16.5% of participants were engaged in other types of
    business, and 7% were engaged in further training.
   After the training, 29.4% of graduates were working in the same trade in which they
    had received training and 16.6% were working in a different trade. 54% were
    unemployed at the time the survey was conducted. The main reason for the low
    observed employment rate (relative to the higher post-training employment rate
    reported in the results indicators) is because this survey was conducted earlier and
    many trainees had only just graduated.
   Participants were asked about the change in their socio-economic conditions after
    participating in the skill training programs. About 50.6% reported an improvement,


                                                31
    and the remaining 49.4% reported no change. In terms of ethnic group, the most
    positive changes were observed among Adivasi/Janajati (25.5%), followed by Chhetri
    (23%) and the lowest amongst the most disadvantaged castes and groups (9.9%).
   Graduates were asked about their overall satisfaction from the training program.
    About 79% said they were satisfied with the training. Major reasons for their
    satisfaction were: expectations fulfilled (32.6%); good facilities provided (17.1%);
    sufficient teaching materials (10.4%); increase of employment opportunities (34.6%);
    and market-oriented training (5.2%).

Component 2
Process and overall satisfaction
   About 99.5% of eligible families received the main payment of NPR 100,000, while
    90.7% received the additional payment of NPR 200,000. 81.9% of widows received
    the cash benefit of NPR 25,000.
   The Beneficiary Satisfaction Survey reported that 54.4% respondents were satisfied
    with the cash distribution process. Major reasons stated were timely receipt of cash
    benefits (54.4%); behavior of staff (27.9%); support from political parties (27.5%);
    and good cooperation from LPC members (19.2%).
   45.6% of beneficiaries were dissatisfied with the payment process, due to the
    following reasons: length of the process (42.9%); effort required to provide
    documentation (39.2%); cost of obtaining documentation (20.9%); insufficient benefit
    amount (52.1%); and other reasons (12.0%).
   31.5% of respondents lodged complaints regarding the cash transfer process. 36.4%
    of males and 28.9% of females lodged complaints.
Impact
   When asked how the beneficiaries spent the cash support, 52.7% said they invested it
    in fixed assets; 50% used it for their children’s education; 38.4% spent it on food;
    17.9% spent it on income generating activities; 36.5% used it to settle debts; and
    6.8% spent it on other activities.
   The majority of the respondents (52.1%) stated that cash benefits helped them
    improve their welfare. About 17.9% of respondents said the support helped them
    increase their social recognition and reintegrate. The figures were higher among
    female beneficiaries: 76.2% of women reported increased social recognition, and
    68.2% reported improved living conditions.

                            Prepared by Government of Nepal
                           Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction

Emergency Peace Support Project (EPSP), a project under the Ministry of Peace and
Reconstruction (MoPR), with the grant support from the World Bank (WB) closed on
30th June, 2014. The project targeted relief and rehabilitation of Conflict Affected
Persons under 3 components namely 1) Rehabilitation support to the conflict-affected
families and individuals; 2) Cash benefits to the families and widows of those killed as a
result of conflict; and 3) Capacity building of key institutional structures in support of
peace process and project management support.
The project aimed at 1) At least 95 % (of estimated eligible 14,800 families of the
deceased and 4,700 widows) receive cash payments, following the operations guidelines;
2) At least 90% of eligible (estimated 25,000) conflict-affected widows, orphans, those
disabled in the conflict, families of those killed in the conflict, families of the disappeared,
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and those abducted during the conflict, who seek
skills and employability rehabilitation services receive them and according to the project
operational guidelines; among which at least 30% are female CAP;
At the end of the Project, records from various districts indicates that 1) 14,375 eligible
families received NPR 100,000.00; 2) 1,882 eligible families received NPR 200,000.00;
3) 4,640 widows of the deceased received NPR 25,000.00 under component I, whereas
14,770 Conflict Affected Persons of different categories received various technical and
vocational education training under component II. Capacity building of the related
stakeholders under component III helped support the procurement of goods, services and
some operating costs to expedite operations under component I and II.
Initial estimated cost of the Project was USD 50 Million which was restructured on Dec 7,
2013 with Reallocated Project cost to be USD 36.5 Million.
The total spending of the project was NPR 5,685,812,048.41 of which NPR
2,912,830,287.25 (i.e. 51.23%) was borne by the Government of Nepal and the rest NPR
2,772,981,048.41 (i.e. 48.77%) by the World Bank under IDA Grant No. H367 Nep.
Component-wise expenditure of IDA Grant indicates NPR 630,797,575.20 under
Component I, NPR 1,782,876,729.00 under Component II A and NPR 74,379,165.33
under Component II B and NPR 284,928,291.63 under Component III.
Piloting of Employment/Self-Employment Service (ESES) was quite successful and its
roll out to additional 42 was excellent. Procurement proceedings for further roll out of the
ESES Services to 19 districts were almost completed but could not operationalized due to



                                              34
insufficient time available to complete the activity cycle after denial of time extension
from the World Bank. Such proceedings were, later, cancelled with the consent of the
Bank.
A robust Management Information System (MIS) is established in the Ministry; tracing
of victim's information in 20 districts completed; capacity building of supporting peace
institutions were operationalised; social audit and third party monitoring and beneficiary
satisfaction surveys were completed are some of the key achievements of the project
though the testing of our efforts through impact evaluation could not be completed.
Several policy documents, tools and instruments like Field Implementation Manual;
Monitoring Guidelines etc. were developed through this project and are in use as policy
documents.
Learning from the project implementation have immense potentials and shall be
materialized to implementing similar service in the remaining 19 districts for
employment/self-employment service and all 75 districts for psychosocial counselling
service. The Ministry is very much convinced to sustainably embedding its learning for
future activities.
Finally, our assessment of the implementation of the project is relatively successful
though project was a bit delayed due to some unavoidable circumstances in the country.
