INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRY OF ROMANIA,
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ROMANIA,
FOR A PIG PRODUCTION AND PROCESSING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry of Romania, with the guarantee
of the Socialist Republic of Romania, for the equivalent of US$71 million, to
finance the foreign costs of a pig production and processing project. The
loan would have a term of 15 years, including three years of grace, with
interest at 8.2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The latest economic memorandum for Romania (818a-RO) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on December 29, 1975, and an agricultural sector
survey (953a-RO) was circulated on November 15, 1976. A basic economic mission
visited Romania in October/November 1976 and its report is under preparation.
Preliminary findings of this mission are incorporated in this report. Country
social and economic data are given in Annex I.
3.        Since the founding in 1947 of the People's Republic of Romania,
which in 1965 was reconstituted as the Socialist Republic of Romania, economic
management has been organized along socialist principles which have included
state and cooperative ownership of almost all productive resources, and the
absence of private enterprise. Economic activity is directed by means of
obligatory development planning, coordinated by the central authorities.
Productive enterprises operate within the framework of the development plan
which defines the scope of their activity, the outlines of their production
and investment goals and their targets for operating efficiency. The plan is
elaborated within a five-year time frame, each year having a separate Annual
Plan. The country began its latest Five-Year Plan in January, 1976.
4.        The technical and functional Ministries are the State's chief agents
for the administration of economic activity. They are assisted by subordinate
units known as Centrals, which coordinate and supervise activities within a
common branch or industry without being directly engaged in production. En-
terprises subordinate to the Centrals are responsible for production which
is controlled through a system of physical production and financial targets.
Production enterprises generally are not authorized to engage directly in
1/   Identical to the corresponding sections of the President's Reports
for the Brasov Bearings, Bucharest Glass Fiber and Cimpulung Polyester
projects distributed to the Executive Directors on May 16, May 23, and
M4ay 25, 1977.

foreign trade and rely on specialized foreign trade enterprises for this
purpose. In agriculture, large State farms and cooperatives are the pre-
dominant units of production.
5.        Economic development is of paramount concern to the Romanian Gov-
ernment. Rapid industrialization is a major objective with priority being
given to heavy industry including steel, engineering products and chemicals.
To achieve their growth objectives, the Romanian authorities have made consid-
erable efforts to mobilize domestic resources for development and to maintain
a high rate of capital formation. In the 1971-75 Five-Year Plan, planned and
actual investment rates of around 30 percent of GNP were the norm. As a
consequence, consumption has been restrained, and the development of the
consumer goods industry has been less strongly emphasized than that of heavy
industry. In 1975, heavy industry (led by engineering and metal working,
chemicals and ferrous metallurgy) accounted for about 61 percent of industrial
production.
6.        As a result of this strategy, a marked change has been achieved in
the structure of Romania's economy. Rapid industrial growth, which over the
last decade has averaged more than 13 percent per annum, has expanded the
share of the labor force employed in industry (including power and construc-
tion) from about 14 percent in 1950 to approximately 40 percent in 1975.
During the same period, the share of labor force engaged in agriculture has
declined from 74 percent to around 38 percent; and while agricultural output
almost tripled, its share in GNP amounted to only 15 percent in 1975.
7.        Notwithstanding the emphasis on industrialization, more than half
of the population (about 57 percent in 1975) still lives in rural areas and
agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. Apart from supplying food,
industrial inputs and the residual labor increment for industrial growth
(which requires an expansion in agricultural productivity), the sector also
supplies about one quarter of the nation's convertible foreign exchange earn-
ings. These earnings, which are largely used to buy imported inputs for in-
dustry, have often been jeopardized as a result of unstable production growth
in agriculture. The maintenance of the industrial development program, there-
fore, is dependent on the performance of the agricultural sector.
8.        Romania's population growth is around one percent per annum.     Thus,
the impact of rapid economic growth on per capita incomes has been only mar-
ginally diluted by the population increase. In the last decade, GNP growth
has averaged nine percent per annum, implying a growth of about eight percent
per annum of per capita GNP. It is estimated that GNP per capita in 1975
was US$1,300 based upon official national income information and using the
World Bank Atlas methodology.
9.        The organization of production in both the urban sector and in agri-
culture is such that all labor is employed and there is no open unemployment.
There is, however, some seasonal labor surplus, mainly in agriculture. Income
distribution is also relatively equal. In 1975, average monthly wages were
1,813 lei (over $90 equivalent) up nine percent over the previous year. About
87 percent of all monthly wages in 1975 were within the range of 1,300-2,500
lei. Four percent were under 1,300 lei and about nine percent were above



- 3 -
2,500 lei. Prices for essential consumer goods and services such as basic
foodstuffs, rents and urban transport are relatively low and most social
services, notably education and health care, are provided without charge.
Standards of living, while still modest, have been increasing because of the
rapid growth of national income. Romania also pursues an active regional
policy which has sought to bring a balanced development of both human and
natural resources to all parts of the country.
10.       The official exchange rate of lei 4.97 per US$1 is used only for
accounting purposes. The rate used for tourist transactions is lei 12 per
US$1, having been revalued from a rate of lei 14.38 per US$1 in October 1974.
Beginning in July 1973, a trading rate of lei 20 per US$1 has been used to
convert the prices of all traded goods; this rate is considered representa-
tive of the average cost of convertible foreign exchange. The rate of lei 20
per US$1 has also been used to convert national income statistics from lei to
dollars. Consequently, this rate has been used as the base rate for calcula-
tion in the appraisal.
Recent Developments
11.       Since the National Party Conference of 1967, which set the stage
for major qualitative advances in Romania's economic and social development,
there have been important new emphases in Romania's economic management.
Measures were taken to improve the institutional basis of planning (e.g. by
creating centrals to assist in plan administration), to increase the effi-
ciency of economic management and to improve the quality of products in
industry. In agriculture efforts were made to raise productivity and
stabilize growth through irrigation, mechanization and the expanded use
of chemical fertilizers. To promote the growth of foreign trade and
technical-economic cooperation the Government has concluded trade and
cooperation agreements with a wide range of countries. In this context,
Romania has also made positive efforts to expand its multilateral external
relations and to pursue full cooperation with international agencies, in-
cluding UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, FAO, UNIDO, GATT and more recently, the IMF
and the Bank.
12.       Measures aimed at continued improvement of the management system
include a reorganization (involving a reduction from 217 to 95 in number)
of industrial centrals and a concentration within the centrals of all plan-
ning, control and research functions. The pursuit of purely physical goals in
production and trade, while still an important element in the system, is being
supplemented by much greater emphasis on production and investment efficiency,
product quality, pricing and foreign competitiveness. To eliminate wasteful
investment and production expenditures, a Superior Court of Financial Control
has been established, among other things, to oversee a new system of financial
control.
13.       Foreign trade has expanded rapidly in recent years both in volume
and in regional diversity. There has also been a tendency to move away from
trade on a bilateral basis toward trade involving multilateral payments.
During 1971-75, total foreign trade grew at approximately 18 percent per



annum in current prices. In 1975, however, after the very rapid growth in
the value of trade of 33 percent in 1974, trade grew by only 6.6 percent,
with exports increasing by 9.6 percent to US$5.34 billion and imports by 3.9
percent also to US$5.34 billion. This slower increase in 1975 was explained
chiefly by the floods of July 1975 which resulted in a smaller exportable
surplus of agricultural goods and necessitated cancellation of some imports.
About 54 percent of 1975 trade was with the convertible currency area. Over-
all current account deficits have generally remained small; in 1975 the
deficit was only US$135 million, while the deficit with the convertible
currency area was US$260 million. In recent years, imports from eastern
European socialist countries have been slightly lower than Romania's exports
to that region. In Romania's trade with western industrialised countries, on
the other hand, exports have typically been considerably less than imports.
These deficits have generally been increased by deficits on the invisibles
account with western countries.
14.       The structure of Romania's trade with the developed market economies
remains essentially unfavorable. Raw materials and agricultural commodities,
both of which are subject to unstable price and production conditions, com-
prise about 60 percent of total exports to these countries. At the same time
imports from these countries are largely of machines and equipment and other
manufactures. Because of the present low level of reserves, any instability
in export earnings, as frequently arises from shortfalls in agriculture (para-
graph 7 above), tends to place the import program in immediate jeopardy.
15.       Preliminary results for 1976 indicate that most major targets of
the 1976 Annual Plan have been met. National income rose by 10.5 percent,
gross industrial production increased by about 11.5 percent, and gross agri-
cultural production was a record, exceeding the flood affected 1975 level by
17.2 percent. These achievements were realized despite a lower than planned
investment growth rate (8.2 rather than 19.4 percent). The volume of trade
increased less than plan targets, but a reported overall trade surplus of
US$40 million was attained because of measures to economize on imports. In
November 1976, Romania's National Assembly approved the country's 1977 Annual
Plan and Budget, which calls for continued high rates of growth. National
income is expected to rise by 11.3 percent and gross industrial production
by 10.5 percent. The Plan provides a range of 1.9-3.6 percent growth for
the gross farm output. This wide range is provided because of the uncertain
impact climatic conditions might have on production. Investments in the
national economy are expected to increase by 16.7 percent and total foreign
trade volume by 15.5 percent. Insufficient information is available to assess
the full impact of the earthquake in March 1977. The Government has announced
that production targets for 1977 will be met and that no revisions of the
annual plan will be made. While it is possible that planned production levels
will be attained, it is likely that replenishment of the damaged capital stock
will take longer and require additional resources and/or diverting of invest-
ment resources from new projects.
16.       A campaign to increase efficiency in the utilization of existing
capacities and to effect significant economies in the consumption of raw
materials and intermediate goods is being implemented throughout the economy.



- 5 -
Targets have been established to reduce by 30 percent the previously antici-
pated construction and erection costs of industrial projects between 1976-80.
Substantial, but as yet unspecified, savings have also been prescribed for
most other industrial inputs during 1976-80, while the global production
targets as set in the Five Year Plan remain unchanged.
External Assistance
17.       The expansion of Romania's trade with the non-socialist industrial
countries has led to an increased need to obtain convertible currencies to
pay for imports from those countries. Romania has met this need both by bor-
rowing abroad and by mounting a major effort to expand exports and tourism.
Gross inflows of convertible currency through medium- and long-term loans
were US$946 million in 1976, consisting mostly of financial and suppliers'
credits with relatively short repayment periods. This gross inflow repre-
sented a net inflow of some $312 million after accounting for the country's
repayment obligations.
18.       As part of its effort to expand its foreign trade and cooperation
relationships, Romania has also taken active steps to attract long-term pri-
vate capital. A regulation passed in 1972 defines the conditions under which
foreign firms can establish joint ventures with domestic enterprises, prefer-
ably in foreign exchange earning or saving industries. As of January 1977,
seven joint venture agreements had been signed. In contrast with the first
six which were of a small scale involving total direct foreign investment of
about US$10-15 million, the seventh agreement which was signed a few months
ago with Citroen, involved a contract of FF 2.5 billion (about US$500 million)
of which 49 percent is direct foreign investment. Romania also receives
medium-term trade credits from U.S. Eximbank and trades under ECGD, COFACE,
and HERMES credit guarantees with the United Kingdom, France and the Federal
Republic of Germany, respectively. Romania succeeded in securing a US$60
million, eight-year loan from Kuwait as part of a general cooperation agree-
ment and more recently a $50 million Eurodollar loan. In addition, Romania
has access to non-convertible currency investment credits from the Interna-
tional Investment Bank, Moscow.
19.       As it stands Romania's access to long-term finance in convertible
currencies is still very restricted. The IBRD is the only major source of
such long-term development finance, though Romania is making efforts to
improve its access to the major financial markets. The Bank's presence on
a significant scale would have a positive influence in this regard and might
serve as a catalyst for involving other lenders in Romania. This could
serve both to increase the total amount of Bank-sponsored funds available to
Romania and to build outside confidence in the country, thereby enhancing in
the long-term its independent access to the world's financial markets.
Prospects
20.       The 1976-80 Five-Year Plan reflects Romania's continued strategy
of rapid growth. Investment rates of some 30 percent of GNP are to be main-
tained, and the major thrust is in industry. The plan targets are impressive.



National income is expected to grow at 10-11 percent per annum and gross in-
dustrial output by 10.2-11.2 percent per annum, with more rapid growth in
heavy industry than in consumer goods. Continued emphasis is to be placed
on foreign trade which is expected to double in real terms, with the aim of
securing a continued transfer of technology needed for the modernization and
diversification of Romanian industry and the raw materials required by indus-
try. Greater emphasis than in the 1971-75 Plan is to be given to developing
the infrastructure in agriculture, particularly with regard to irrigation
and drainage and the plans for fertilizer production envisage an increase
in supply sufficient to double the 1974 application rates by 1980.
21.       Romania has good potential for further economic growth.     Endowed
with important natural resources (fuels, some minerals, timber, rich soils
and sources of irrigation water for agriculture, and a favorable climate for
agriculture and tourism) and located conveniently with respect to its major
international markets in the East and West, the country has built a broad
industrial infrastructure (power, metallurgy, chemicals) which will serve as
a base for the expansion of secondary manufacturing sectors such as machine
building and consumer durables. Above all, Romania has a hard-working and
increasingly skilled population. In order for Romania to attain its growth
objectives, however, it will have to rely on a major expansion of exports
of manufactured goods in order to finance modern foreign technology and an
increasing dependence on imported raw materials and fuel.
22.       Economic growth and structural change call for the introduction of
new technologies, improvements in the quality of products, more efficient use
of materials and factor inputs, and reductions in production costs. The in-
creasing diversity and complexity of Romania's economic structure require
continuing improvements in the efficiency of economic planning and coordina-
tion and further refinements in economic management. To keep up with these
changes and requirements, large programs of education and manpower training
have been mounted, investments in scientific and technological research have
been emphasized, and efforts are being made to strengthen technical coopera-
tion with industrialized countries and international organizations.
Creditworthiness
23.       As of December 1976, Romania's total medium and long-term external
debt amounted to US$3,095 million. Most of these debts (US$3,023 million)
were denominated in convertible currencies, the major creditor countries being
Germany, France, UK and Italy. While the total debt does not appear excessive
in relation to the volume and growth of external trade, average maturities are
relatively short and convertible debt service payments are estimated to be
in the order of US$550 million a year during 1975-76. The convertible debt
service ratio was approximately 14 percent in 1975. The corresponding figure
for 1976 is estimated to have been 19 percent and is expected to be 18 percent
for 1977.
24.       The organization of economic activity in Romania, the pursuit of
a development strategy involving high investment and saving rates, and rapid
income growth ensure the effective use of foreign credits. Moreover, the



- 7 -
country's major efforts to expand exports (particularly to convertible cur-
rency areas) are increasing the foreign exchange available for debt service.
Convertible export earnings rose from US$830 million in 1971 to US$2,839
million in 1975, and are estimated to have been about US$3,250 million in
1976. The preferential trade status accorded to Romania by the European
Communities in June 1973 is facilitating the expansion of such exports as is
the granting of most favored nation status by the U.S. In 1973, the Govern-
ment also restricted the use of short-term credit facilities from western
suppliers in an effort to improve the structure of the country's external
debt. Assuming a continuation of present export and debt management policies,
we estimate that the debt service ratio will remain around 20 percent during
the implementation of the Five-Year Plan 1976-80 and decline thereafter to
about 15 percent by 1985. The country's present outward-looking posture,
the success of both its domestic growth and foreign trade policies, and its
potential for continued development, all support the judgment that Romania
is creditworthy for substantial Bank lending.
25.       When Romania joined the Bank, most pre-war foreign debts of the
country had been settled. Settlements which were still under discussion at
that time concerned claims in the United Kingdom and in the United States.
With regard to the settlement of these claims, the final payments of U.S.
claims began in September 1975 and were completed in October 1976 based upon
agreements reached in May 1975. Settlement of British claims proved more
difficult, but a final agreement was signed in January 1976. The Bank has
also been informed recently of certain Swedish claims concerning public loans
from the pre-war period, nationalized Swedish property and other interests
such as concessions granted to Swedish companies before the Second World War.
The eleventh and most recent meeting to discuss these claims was held in
Bucharest in October 1976. The Romanian and Swedish authorities have also
dealt with this matter in April 1977 in the context of more general dis-
cussions of bilateral trade, and further discussions are planned at a date
to be established through diplomatic channels.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ROMANIA I/
26.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourteenth to Romania and
would bring total Bank commitments to Romania to US$697.3 million. Dis-
bursements under the Bank's initial loans were slow during 1975, but this
situation improved considerably during 1976. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans to Romania and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects as of May 31, 1977.
1/   Substantially the same as the corresponding sections of President's
Reports for the Brasov Bearings, Bucharest Glass Fiber, and Cimpulung
Polyester projects distributed to the Executive Directors on May 16,
May 23 and May 25, 1977.



- 8 -
27.       Foreign exchange, especially in convertible currencies, continues
to be a major constraint and one of the major objectives of Bank lending con-
tinues to be to help alleviate the country's shortage of foreign exchange by
providing long-term external capital and by financing projects which will
expand foreign exchange earnings or savings. Bank lending also aims at
supporting the Government's efforts to introduce new industrial technologies,
to improve the quality of products and production efficiency, to reduce pro-
duction costs and to provide for necessary electric power development. Market
aspects and marketing, especially for export goods, are also emphasized.
Special attention is given to agriculture which is heavily dependent upon
favorable weather and where productivity levels are still comparatively low.
28.       A number of further loans are under consideration.   Projects for
irrigation, poultry production, dairy cattle development, chemical and tire
plants, seamless pipes and lignite mining have been proposed, and further
power projects will also be considered in context of a sector investment
study currently being prepared by the Government. The Government has also
requested that the Bank consider lending for earthquake recovery and a major
canal linking the Danube and Black Sea.
29.       In addition to lending, the Bank (through EDI) has assisted Romania
by conducting industrial and transportation project appraisal training courses
for Romanian officials in Belgrade in October 1973 and in Bucharest in January/
February 1975, November/December 1975, January/February 1976 and October/
November 1976. Additional courses, including one in agricultural project
appraisal, are planned.
30.       The projects, for which assistance has been committed or is being
considered, represent only a small portion of Romania's total need for ex-
ternal financing and of its total disbursed convertible debt. However, they
will provide a substantial net addition to the inflow of convertible currency
finance, and may set a pattern for obtaining longer term convertible finance
from other sources. The disbursed IBRD debt outstanding to the Bank is
expected to constitute about 12 percent of Romania's total projected con-
vertible currency debt in 1980; the Bank's share in Romania's debt service
payments in 1980 would be about 3 percent.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN ROMANIA
Agriculture
31.       Agriculture continues to be a key sector in the Romanian economy,
providing both convertible foreign exchange earnings and industrial raw
materials which contribute to progress in other sectors, especially industry.
In 1975, agriculture accounted for 15 percent of national income and 38
percent of the labor force (compared with 74 percent in 1950). About 14.9
million hectares, or almost two-thirds of the land area, are used for agri-
culture; and of these, 8.5 million hectares are in Wallachia, the region



composed of the southern plains of the Danube Valley. Approximately 63 per-
cent of all arable land is used for grain production (mainly maize and wheat),
while industrial crops (mainly sunflower) are in the next most important.
Vegetables are also produced, predominantly by private farmers and individual
members of cooperatives, but also often in large-scale commercial greenhouses,
for domestic consumption and export. Livestock accounts for a relatively high
43 percent of agricultural production.
32.       Investment in agriculture accounted for 12.7 percent of actual
total investment in the 1966-70 plan period and 14.1 percent in the 1971-75
plan period. The proportion of investment for agriculture in the 1976-80
plan period is expected to be 11.6 percent of the total. However, total
investment in agriculture during the 1976-80 plan period is expected to be
116 billion lei (US$5.8 billion), about 50 percent more than during the
1971-75 plan period. In addition to investment, the Government has also
taken other measures, including institutional reforms, price incentives,
and production targets and delivery schedules to stimulate agricultural
production. Growth achieved in agricultural production has been slower
than in other sectors and has been characterized by year-to-year variations.
The major problems of Romanian agriculture are the instability of its output
and low productivity. A major program of irrigation investment, supported by
three Bank loans, has been undertaken to help address both of these problems.
In addition, a number of other specific measures have been taken to increase
agricultural productivity including upgrading the quality of farm mechaniza-
tion, increases in the supply and utilization of fertilizers, and the promo-
tion of agro-industrial enterprises to provide processing and marketing
facilities for increased farm production.
The Livestock Subsector
33.       Livestock accounted for 43 percent of gross agricultural production
in 1975, and its contribution to overall agricultural production has been
increasing relatively more rapidly than crop production with a 5.8 percent
average annual growth for 1965-75, compared with about 3 percent per annum
for crops. The livestock population at the beginning of 1976 consisted of
6.1 million cattle, 8.8 million pigs, 13.9 million sheep and about 80 million
poultry. Nearly 10 million hectares, or about two-thirds of all agricultural
land, are used for livestock production. Of these, about 4.5 million hectares
of pasture and meadow lands not suitable for cultivation are used for grazing,
about 1.6 million hectares are used for fodder crops, and about 3.8 million
hectares for feedgrains. Other important crops such as wheat, barley, soy
beans, sunflower and sugarbeets provide by-products used for feeding livestock.
34.       Romanian plans for the livestock subsector have emphasized pork which
accounted for half of all meat consumption during the past decade (1965-1975).
Pork, preferred by the Romanian consumer, can be produced relatively more effi-
ciently than beef, and is the major source of high grade protein in a diet
marked by relatively high reliance on vegetable proteins and cereal consump-
tion. The Government has undertaken, as part of the 1976-80 Five-Year Plan, a



- 10 -
major investment program in agro-industrial pig production facilities which are
expected to increase the pig population to 13 million by 1983 (8.8 million at
the beginning of 1976) and would support increased consumption of pork from 23
kilograms in 1975 to 29 kilograms per capita in 1980, and 32.4 kilograms per
capita in 1983. Overall meat consumption in the same period is expected to
increase from 46 kilograms in 1975 to 55 to 60 kilograms per capita in 1980.
By 1983, overall meat consumption could increase to 66.6 kilograms per capita,
or about 20 percent less than the average for the European Communities in
1974, and it has been assumed for purposes of project appraisal that pork will
continue to account for half of Romanian meat consumption. The livestock sub-
sector also has considerable export potential and, to the extent that scarce
convertible foreign exchange is required to support the development plan,
some of the incremental production during the next several years can be
expected to be exported. It is impossible now, however, to predict with
any precision the exact balance of domestic consumption and exports of the
incremental meat production resulting from investments under the current
Five-Year Plan.
Sector Organization
35.       State agricultural units and cooperatives account for the major
portion of agricultural production; individual farmers play a much less sig-
nificant role, except in the production of a few selected commodities. The
current sector organization is primarily a result of collectivization and
increased government participation from 1949 to 1962, when small-scale,
peasant-oriented agriculture was replaced by large state-owned or -controlled
production units. The dominant form of state-owned agricultural unit is the
state enterprise. There are 391 such state farms averaging about 5,300 hec-
tares and about 650 workers each. These large scale, capital intensive farms
have been considered a pilot sector in Romania and, as such have been favored
in terms of land allocation, fertilizer distribution and investments in irriga-
tion and mechanization. About 2.1 million hectares of agricultural land are
cultivated by these farms, which also own substantial grazing and pasture
lands. Workers on the farms are employed on salaries which are fixed by law
but vary according to skill levels. Eighty percent of salaries is paid at
least monthly; the remainder is paid at the end of the crop season provided
planned targets have been met. The state farms are generally well managed
by a director (usually an agricultural engineer) who is appointed by the
Director General for State Farms of the Ministry of Agriculture and is re-
sponsible to a workers' council. The Ministry of Agriculture determines the
production plans for individual state farms; it also has a role in determin-
ing the use of their net income, a portion of which is remitted to the state
treasury. Beginning in 1962, the Government began consolidating pig produc-
tion under specialized enterprises which by 1975 accounted for 24 percent of
pork production. These agroindustrial enterprises generally have no comple-
mentary land and rely on state-operated feedmills for feed requirements.
36.       In 1975 there were 4,400 agricultural production cooperatives with
about 3.4 million member families and cultivating about 9.0 million hectares.
Workers in cooperatives are guaranteed a minimum salary, which is lower than



- 11 -
the salaries of their counterparts on state farms by about 20 percent. Sala-
ries of cooperators may be supplemented with the cooperator's shares of profits
in excess of plan targets. More than one member of a family frequently works
(on a full- or part-time basis) in the cooperative, and some family members
are employed outside of the cooperatives. Cooperators are also allowed to
farm about 0.15 hectares each in and around their villages for their personal
use, and they are allowed to own livestock. Production on personal plots is
always intensive, and produce is either self-consumed or sold to consumption
cooperatives to supplement other income of the cooperators. A cooperative is
managed by a General Assembly of cooperators and its elected President; it
reports to the District Director General for Agriculture, the local represen-
tative of the Minsitry of Agriculture.
37.       Some cooperatives have begun to pool their resources for large-scale
investments in agroindustries and livestock production. These intercooperative
associations (ICA) are operated by state employees paid from ICA revenues. A
central ICA is responsible for pig breeding and raising of young pigs. An ICA
member cooperative is expected to provide feedgrains to the ICA in accordance
with its equity share in the ICA investment. After processing in regional
feedmills, these feeds are used for pig fattening on ICA's and the member
cooperatives. Part of the net income from ICA sales of fattened pigs is
retained for further ICA development; the balance is divided among member
cooperatives in proportion to their contribution to shares in the ICA. In
1975, 15 percent of pork production was generated on such integrated, coopera-
tive complexes.
38.       Individual farmers number only about 150,000 families and own about
10 percent of total agricultural land. Their lands are often located in moun-
tainous regions, and include 19 percent of pasture lands and 21 percent of
orchards. Private farmers own 16 percent of all cattle, 14 percent of sheep,
and 6 percent of pigs. The individual farming subsector has not received
strong government support but is significant in production of potatoes (16 per-
cent of production), meat (13 percent of production), milk (20 percent of pro-
duction), eggs (14 percent of production) and wool (12 percent of production).
39.       At the national level, the state institution in the agricultural sec-
tor is the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry. It plays a major role
in preparing the Five-Year Plan for the sector and is the supervisory institu-
tion for plan implementation. In each district, the Ministry is represented
by a general directorate, which is responsible for all agricultural activity
in the district including both cooperatives and State farms. The Ministry is
also responsible for agricultural research and will review, in consultation
with the Bank, the content and organization of its research programs related
to pig production. Marketing is organized nationally under 13 centrals
accountable to the Ministry and responsible for processing and marketing
specified commodities. Each central obtains produce at the district level
and allocates it among domestic retail, processing, storage and export
channels. A foreign trade company is responsible for the exports of each
central.

The Borrower
40.       The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the Bank for Agriculture
and Food Industry (BAFI), which is the Government's specialized agency for
financing projects in agriculture, irrigation and food processing. BAFI was
established in 1968 as a channel for, and administrator of, all investment
funds provided under the State plan for the agricultural sector. Financing
in agriculture had previously been done by a department of the National Bank
of Romania. BAFI is involved in all phases of project apparaisal, execution
and supervision, and it has a large technical and economic staff located
in Bucharest, in 39 county (judet) branch offices and in 100 sub-branches
throughout the country. One of BAFI's more important functions is that of
fiscal agent administering for the account of the national budget, all gov-
ernment investments in State farms and enterprises. BAFI also receives
interest-free funds from the State budget for investment lending to coopera-
tives (and in some cases State Farms) and repays the Government as it re-
ceives repayments of the sub-loans. BAFI has thorough review and approval
procedures for all investment projects. In addition to BAFI's review, all
agricultural investments for more than Lei 10,000,000 (US$500,000) are re-
viewed and approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and those greater than
Lei 70,000,000 (US$3.5 million) must be approved by the Council of Ministers.
BAFI also provides short-term credit to, and maintains settlement accounts
for all cooperative and state agricultural enterprises; it also acts as
fiscal agent for the Government for collection of state revenues from these
enterprises. As the Government's channel for investment financing in agri-
culture, BAFI's primary source of funds is the State Budget; the Guarantee
Agreement therefore includes a provision (Section 2.02) that the Guarantor
shall provide all necessary funds for the implementation and operation of the
project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
41.       The project was proposed for Bank financing in February 1976.   A
feasibility study was submitted to the Bank in October 1976, and the project
was appraised in November 1976. Negotiations were held in Washington in May,
1977. The Romanian delegation was led by Mr. Ion Rusinaru, President of the
Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) and included representatives of
the Ministry of Agriculture and BAFI.
Project Description
42.       The project would be the first exclusively for livestock to be
supported by the Bank in Romania. It would also be the first agricultural
project in Romania supported by the Bank to be undertaken on a national as
distinct from regional basis. As part of the 1976-80 Plan for livestock devel-
opment, the overall objective of the project would be to increase the supply
of meat available either for domestic consumption or for export, and to in-
crease efficiency and productivity in Romania's pork industry. The objectives



- 13 -
of individual agricultural credit subprojects to be financed under the pro-
posed loan would be: (i) to develop a sufficiently large breeding herd to
support the pork industry; (ii) to maintain animals of high genetic quality
through the use of improved breeding stock and expansion of testing and selec-
tion centers; (iii) to continue reorganization of pig production activities
into specialized agro-industrial complexes to take advantage of managerial and
technical economies of scale, and to facilitate dissemination of technical
know-how throughout the subsector; (iv) to broaden the geographic distribution
of production capacity throughout the country to meet more efficiently the con-
sumption requirements of the population; (v) to provide adequate slaughtering
and processing capacity for anticipated production levels; and (vi) to install
new meat processing units and modernize existing facilities in accordance with
international sanitary standards and with high operational efficiency.
43.       The agricultural credit subprojects to be financed under the pro-
posed loan would include investments to be undertaken in 1977 and 1978 for:
(i) facilities and initial livestock for about 60 pig breeding and fattening
units with an aggregate annual capacity of 1,500,000 animals; (ii) facilities
and initial livestock for about 40 pig breeding farms, with an aggregate annual
production capacity of about 100,000 young sows; (iii) a pig farm modernization
program designed to increase and renovate the production capacities of existing
facilities; (iv) a pig improvement and selection program extending and develop-
ing further the national breeding program involving breeds of high genetic
quality; (v) construction of modern livestock slaughtering and meat processing
facilities, and specialized sausage processing plants; and (vi) a modernization
program for existing slaughterhouses and meat processing plants. Construction
is expected to be completed by December 1981, and the project is expected to
reach full production in 1983.
Project Execution and Operation
44.       The project would be carried out by cooperatives and state enter-
prises under agricultural credit subprojects administered by BAFI, and BAFI's
branch offices would be responsible for direct supervision of the implementa-
tion of subprojects. All subprojects estimated to cost US$2 million equivalent
or more, and 14 representative subprojects estimated to cost between US$1 and
US$2 million equivalent, would be subject to Bank review before disbursements
would be made on account of such subprojects. Technical assistance to the
cooperatives and state enterprises carrying out subprojects would be provided
by units of the Ministry of Agriculture under a well developed program of
assistance to such entities. The Ministry would also have responsibility for
all necessary arrangements for international procurement.
Prolect Cost and Financing
45.       The estimate total cost of the project is US$322.5 million, with an
estimated foreign exchange component of US$71.3 million. The cost estimates
are based on unit rates of work under the Romanian system of administered
prices. The cost of equipment and materials which are likely to be procured
from foreign suppliers, has been estimated at the international prices pre-
vailing at the end of 1976. Physical contingencies have been provided at



- 14 -
an average of 4.8 percent. Price contingencies on foreign exchange cost are
based on annual increases of 8 percent for 1977, 7.5 percent for 1978-79,
and 7 percent thereafter. Due to near-zero inflation under the Romanian
system of administered prices, annual price contingencies on local costs
are one percent.
46.       The proposed Bank loan of US$71 million would finance the foreign
costs of the project. The remaining project costs would be financed by loans
from BAFI (US$212.5 million) and by sub-borrowers (US$38.9 million). 1/ The
proposed loan would be made to BAFI with the guarantee of the Socialist
Republic of Romania, and would be for a term of 15 years, including three
years grace, at an interest rate of 8.2 percent per annum. BAFI would
onlend these funds, together with its own funds, for terms of up to 18 years
to cooperatives at 3 percent per annum and to State enterprises at 2 percent
per annum during the construction period and 4 percent thereafter. As in
the earlier cases of the Sadova-Corabia, Flood Recovery and Rasova-Vederoasa
projects, these are considered real rates of interest because of the near-zero
rate of inflation in Romania. Since BAFI receives most of its funding from
the government budget at very low rates, its overall borrowing cost is below
one percent which allows it to operate profitably despite the negative spread
on the Bank loan.
Audit
47.       BAFI would keep separate accounts for all project expenditures and
its transactions are subject to continuous control by internal auditors
appointed by the Ministry of Finance and to an annual audit by inspectors
from the Court of Superior Control which report directly to the Council of
Ministers and the President. BAFI's accounting system and the audit of its
transactions are satisfactory and BAFI's audited operating and financing
results would be sent to the Bank not later than five months after the end
of BAFI's fiscal year (Sections 6.01(c) and (e) of the Loan Agreement).
Procurement
48.       Although Romanian laws provide, in principle, for international com-
petitive bidding and for joint ventures involving foreign and domestic enter-
prises, all civil works are constructed by Romanian State-owned construction
enterprises who are experienced and familiar with local conditions, methods
and regulations. Installations similar to those proposed under the project
have in the past proved well designed and constructed. These would be widely
dispersed throughout the country, would vary in size from location to location,
and would be constructed over a four-year period. Therefore, construction of
project facilities would be carried out by the Romanian construction enter-
prises under contracts not subject to Bank guidelines. Equipment and material
required for the project are estimated to cost about US$112 million (includ-
ing contingencies). An agreed list of items estimated to cost US$71 million
1/   Discrepancy in total due to rounding.



- 15 -
(including US$4.6 million contingencies) would be procured by Romagrimex under
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. These
items include steel reinforcing rods (US$12 million), electric cable (US$14
million), structural steel (US$9 million), asbestos sheets (US$4 million),
steel pipe (US$2 million), and slaughterhouse and meat processing equipment
(US$30 million). Romanian manufacturers would be allowed a 15 percent
preference margin, or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower.
Romanian manufacturers are highly competitive and it is anticipated that
foreign suppliers would be awarded contracts for only about US$9.4 million
of slaughterhouse and meat processing equipment which are not manufactured
in Romania.
Disbursement
49.       The Bank loan would be disbursed for 25 percent of amounts disbursed
by BAFI for approved subprojects. Up to US$2.5 million would be disbursed
retroactively for 25 percent of disbursements by BAFI under subloans concluded
after April 1, 1977.
Environment
50.       Romania maintains a comprehensive system of standards and controls
to ensure satisfactory waste water treatment. Facilities financed under the
project would be constructed and operated in conformity with this environ-
mental protection code. During construction, each pig production complex
would be required by law to install suitable waste water treatment works as
well as separate well and water pumping facilities. In the manure and waste
disposal system, combined solid and liquid manure would be pumped to concrete
holding tanks for sedimentation and drying. The solid material would be
transported to farms for use as fertilizer. Similarly, slaughtering and meat
processing facilities would be required to construct pre-treatment plants to
bring waste water to a purity level equal to that of local municipal waste
water. Only then could a facility discharge into the municipal sewerage
system. Caution would even be taken to ensure that surface rain water is
removed through a separate system from that handling plant waste. Slaughter-
houses and meat processing plants must pay to discharge pre-treated waste
water into municipal systems for final processing. If a slaughterhouse com-
plex is constructed in a community where it represents the dominant industry,
the slaughter house enterprise would build a sewerage treatment unit for the
entire town and thereafter not be charged for its use. A strict system of
penalties is maintained to ensure compliance with water purity requirements.
Benefits and Risks
51.       The project would contribute to the increased production and produc-
tion efficiency of the livestock development program included in the current
Five-Year Plan. Annual incremental pork production resulting from project
investments is expected to reach about 208,000 tons at full development in
1983. Slaughtering and processing capacities would be increased by 148,000



- 16 -
tons of pork, 32,400 tons beef, and 71,800 tons baby beef. Because data on
historical and projected meat exports were not made available to the Bank by
the Romanian authorities, it has not been possible to analyze adequately the
export potential of the project and no export benefits have been taken into
account in the justification of the project. Similarly, details of domestic
consumption patterns were not made available to the Bank; however, on the
basis of aggregated domestic consumption data and based upon the conservative
assumption that no exports will result from the project, analysis has demon-
strated the need for the project based upon domestic demand for meat. Agree-
ment has been reached with the Romanians for the provision in future of data
on exports and domestic consumption of meat. It is anticipated that incre-
mental pork supplies would make a major contribution toward fulfillment of
planned increases in per capita meat consumption from 46 kilograms (1975)
to 55-60 kilograms by the end of the 1976-80 Plan period. It would also
make possible, if all incremental production were consumed domestically, an
increase of domestic meat consumption to 66 kilograms per capita by 1983 when
the project achieves full production. In addition to the meat output from
project facilities, the project would also produce useful byproducts such as
protein meals and manure. The project would create an estimated 9,000 full-
time jobs in project facilities located throughout the country. The estimated
economic return of the project based upon international prices is 17 percent.
52.       Project risks would be minimal.   Designs of the project components
have been prepared in detail, and the Government has well organized and coor-
dinated plans to supply necessary manpower, materials, and technical expertise
to complete project works on schedule. The project represents a two-year
investment program from the 1976-80 national development plan for which imple-
mentation procedures are prescribed by law. The Government (i) has allocated
sufficient grain to support the project, (ii) stands ready to forego grain
exports, if necessary, to support livestock activities, (iii) is actively pur-
suing programs to expand domestic production of high grade proteins for feed
manufacture, and (iv) supports the importation of protein materials to supple-
ment domestic supplies. Incremental pork production from the project, as well
as projected incremental total meat production under the 1976-80 Plan, could
reasonably be absorbed through internal consumption even if no exports were
possible. It is, however, likely that some portion of project output would be
exported to earn scarce convertible foreign exchange. The technology to be
employed in project facilities is well established in Romania, and levels of
efficiency observed are acceptable. Project construction is usually completed
within the time schedule specified by Government, and cost overruns are rare.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln No. 1020     Bacau Fertilizer Project; US$60 million Loan of
June 28, 1974; Effective Date: December 31, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
By agreement between the Bank and the Borrower, the project site
was changed from Tecuci to Bacau which is more advantageous from the point
of view of controlling effluents. The project is proceeding satisfactorily
and facilities are expected to be commissioned before the end of 1977.
Ln No. 1027     Otelinox Special Steel Project; US$70 million Loan of
July 10, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Execution of the project was delayed several months, primarily be-
cause of the complexity of two large bid packages and because of the Romanians'
lack of familiarity with international competitive bidding procedures under
the Bank's Guidelines. Progress on procurement has been closely monitored by
several Bank supervision missions, and US$50,000 allocated for procurement
consultants but not used has been cancelled. The contracts for the two steel
mills under the loan have been signed and construction has begun.
Ln No. 1028     Turceni Thermal Power Project; US$60 million Loan of
July 10, 1974; Effective Date: November 6, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Delays in construction due to late delivery of equipment are likely
to result in a five month delay in commissioning of the first generating unit.
Project execution is otherwise according to plan and satisfactory. Training
of future operational staff is in hand. Financial performance has been satis-
factory despite a reduction in energy sales growth in response to energy
conservation measures.
Ln No. 1082     Giurgiu-Razmiresti Irrigation Project; US$70 million Loan
of February 6, 1975; Effective Date: May 5, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31. 1978.
Construction of project works is progressing satisfactorily and
about 75 percent of the project has been completed.. Procurement is 93 percent
completed. About half of the project area is expected to be irrigated in 1977.
All remaining works are expected to be completed by December 1977.

Ln No. 1083      Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project; US$30 million
Loan of February 6, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Progress continues to be satisfactory in implementing subprojects.
The Bank has concurred in the award of a contract for technical know-how and
equipment for the premix feedmill. Bids for five contracts to supply
chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides were rejected because of very high
bid prices, and these project inputs will be combined with like items under
bulk contracts being tendered internationally by the Romanians. About 80
percent of loan funds are committed.
Ln No. 1169      Flood Recovery Project (Agricultural Component); US$40 million
Loan of November 12   1975  Effective Date:   December 2   1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Project execution is proceeding well and disbursements are ahead
of schedule. Equipment procured under international competitive bidding has
been delivered and only small quantities of spare parts remain to be procured.
Bids have been received for the early warning system equipment and bid evalua-
tion is in progress.
Ln No. 1170      Flood Recovery Project (Industry, Mining and Transport Com-
ponent); US$20 million Loan of November 12, 1975; Effective
Date: December 2, 1975; Closing Date: September 1, 1977.
After a slow start due to difficulties encountered in Romania in
preparing and assembling documentation on procurement of imported industrial
machinery, disbursements have improved considerably since September 1976. The
closing date has been extended from March 31 to September 1, 1977 to permit
full disbursement of the loan.
Ln No. 1242      Riul Mare Retezat Hydropower Project; $50 million of
April 28, 1976; Effective Date: July 26, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981.
Project execution is according to plan. Civil works for the dam
and underground power station are well underway. Commitments concerning
some 73 percent of the loan amount have been made and although disbursements
are delayed they are expected to catch up by mid 1977.
Ln No. 1247      Rasova-Vederoasa Irrigation and Agriculture Development
Project; $60 million of April 28, 1976; Effective Date:
November 3, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Bids for all contracts were received during March 1977, and the
Bank has received and approved bid evaluation reports for six contracts valued
at about US$25 million. Facilities for four dairy farms have been completed,
and construction of pumping stations, canals, silos and feed mill has begun.

March 2, 1977; Effective Date: June 23, 1977; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982.
Procurement for this project has been consolidated with that for
the Rasova-Vederoasa Project (Ln. 1247) noted above.
Ln No. 1436      Brasov Bearings Project; $38 million of June 15, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Documents were signed June 15, 1977 and the deadline for effective-
ness is August 16, 1977.

ness is September 15, 1977.
