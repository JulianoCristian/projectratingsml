 in Thailand. The objectives of the project were to: (a) meet\n            growth in power demand expected over the medium term at\n            least cost; and (b) strengthen Electricity Generating\n            Authority of Thailand's (EGAT) capabilities in\n            environmental monitoring and evaluation through technical\n            assistance and acquisition of monitoring equipment.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were\n            as follows: (a) certain shortcomings experienced during\n            implementation suggest that management and staff skills need\n            to be continuously updated to compensate for deficiencies in\n            performance levels of contract workers; (b) the concept of\n            time-slice lending has been successful and provides the\n            Borrower with flexibility in arranging financing for its\n            large investment program; (c) involvement of the private\n            sector in mining operations has resulted in cost-effective\n            and efficient operations; and (d) the close relationship\n            between the Bank and EGAT has provided a channel for\n            conducting wide-ranging discussions through which important\n            initiatives have resulted in strengthening the utility."}, "docdt": "1995-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
