MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
FOR A SECOND POWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
for an amount of US$94 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be extended to the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (EGAT) at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a
20-year maturity including a grace period of five years. The Kingdom of
Thailand would guarantee the loan. The proceeds would help finance a
Second Power System Development Project.
2.        Background.  Following Government's program of structural
adjustment to control the fiscal and external imbalances that had developed
in the early 1980s, Thailand for the past three years has been experiencing
a sharp upsurge in economic activity: growth in GDP averaged 8.92 p.a. in
FY87-88 compared to 5.72 p.a. in FY81-85 and 4.3 itn FY86. This turnabout
has been accompanied by a surge in the demand for basic infrastructure. In
particular, the growth in electricity demand in FY87-89 has been
unexpectedly high (142 p.a.) because of both rapid 4.dustrial growth and a
significant increase in tourism. The outlook is for continued high
economic growth at least until the end of the current Five-Year Plan (FY87-
91), with an anticipation of rapid expansion in the electricity demand;
hence, energy geveration is forecast to increase at about 122 p.a. over the
FY89-91 period.
3.        After years of low power investment, the recent increase in
electricity demand has made it imperative for EGAT to accelerate capacity
additions to keep the reliability of the power system at acceptable levels
during the early 1990s. The power development strategy formulated by EGAT
and NESDB, in consultation with the Bank, envisages an outlay of over US$1
billion p.a. in power generation and transmission over the next five years.
Seriously concerned with the magnitude of public sector debt that would
accrue from such massive investments, Government has decided to marshall
the resources of the private sector for power development while formulating
an overall strategy of privatization of state enterprises. Faced on the
one hand with the concerns of EGAT over the effect on system planning and
cost of power from introducing private power generation facilities, and on
the other hand with numerous ad hoc proposals from private power producers,
Government requested the Bank to assist in reviewing the issues and options
concerning privatization in the power industry. Such a review was
accomplished by a Bank mission in August 1989; the Bank's further
involvement with EGAT and Government on these issues is expected to
continue during the tenure of the proposed loan. Government is currently
proposing the introduction of private power producers for Build-Own-Operate
(BOO) or Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) operations through formal
solicitation of proposals, while also reviewing the advantages and
disadvantages of creating a regulatory framework for the corporatization of
EGAT, and a possible eventual sale of EGAT equity on the capital markets.



2
4.        In light of its concern over the rapidly increasing investment
needs of the energy sector, Government has been encouraging energy
conservation. This is being accomplished in part through economically
efficient pricing of resources with energy prices being set at levels above
international prices for traded commodities and economic costs for non-
tradables. Electricity tariffs have been raised regularly and broadly
reflect the marginal cost of power generation. In addition, Government has
specified increased efficiency of state enterprises as a goal, a policy
which was highlighted in a 1988 white paper. In support of this policy, a
study of the operational efficiency of EGAT will be undertaken during the
implementation period of the proposed loan. Further, Government has
outlined the objective of increased reliance on domestic fuels, with
particular emphasis on the large lignite resources. This fuel accounted
for 16Z of EGAT's total generation capability in FY88 and is targeted for
expansion. The expansion of lignite mining and lignite-fired power
stations has environmental implications needing specialized expertise in
monitoring and evaluation. During the implementation period of the
proposed loan, EGAT's environmental capabilities would be substantially
strengthened.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has a close working
relationship with key entities in the energy sector and is often approached
for advice on sectoral issues. A previous joint NESDB/Bank sector study
assisted Government in developing a least-cost investment strategy for the
power sector. A recent Coal Development and Utilization Study (Report No.
7815-TH, June 13, 1989) reviewed the strategy for lignite development by
promoting private sector participation. Government has now requested the
Bank to assist it in its efforts to bring private capital into the
electricity and mining sectors. The Bank's involvement, initiated during
project appraisal and expected to continue over the coming years, would
place it in a position to influence privatization initiatives. Finally, the
Bank's ongoing operational involvement with EGAT, although relatively small
in financial terms, assists the implementation of a least-cost development
program which can be supported by various lenders.
6.        Objectives of the Proposed Bank Loan.  The proposed loan would
complement the Power System Development Loar, (Loan 3027-TH) made to finance
an FY89-90 time-slice of EGAT's investment program. The objective of the
proposed loan is to help meet the rapid growth in power demand expected
over the medium term while (a) assisting EGAT in optimizing its investment
decisions and preparing to pursue the path of privatization; (b)
strengthening EGAT's capabilities in the field of environment through
technical assistance and procurement of environmental monitoring equipment;
(c) reducing Thailand's dependence on imported fuels by supporting the
concomitant development and economic use of domestic lignite and natural
gas; and (d) helping to maintain the sound financial performance of EGAT
and the sector through the monitoring of appropriate financial covenants.
7.        Program Description.  The proposed loan will finance a two-year
(FY90-91) time-slice of EGAT's investment program during the Sixth Five-
Year Plan period (FY87-91). The purpose of the program is to provide
sufficient electric power to meet the forecast growth in demand at least
cost, while maintaining the required reliability of the system. The



3
program involves the construction of new generation capacity, reinforcement
and expansion of transmission systems, expansion of lignite mining
facilities and other miscellaneous works. The investment program is based
on EGAT's Power Development Plan, which was reviewed by the Bank and found
to represent the least cost alternetive for meeting EGAT's needs. The
proposed Bank loan would finance sub-projects selected in accordance with
agreed investment and environmental acceptability criteria.
8.        Total financing required is estimated at about US$2,780 million,
with a foreign component of US$1,484 million (53Z). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and status of Bank Group
operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8051-TH, dated November 7, 1989, is being
distributed separately.
9.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached
with EGAT and Government on the following: (a) the procedures related to
the evaluation of subprojects to determine their eligibility for Bank
financing; (b) measures to strengthen EGAT's capabilities in environmental
monitoring and evaluation; (c) a continuation of previous financial
covenants specifying that both EGAT and the power sector as a whole will
earn a self-financing ratio of not less than 252, based on a three-year
average of capital expenditures; and (d) a debt-to-equity ratio not
exceeding 60:40 and a ratio of short- and medium-term debt to total debt
not exceeding 152 for EGAT.
10.       Benefits and Risks.  In supporting the timely development of the
power sector, the loan would help sustain Thailand's economic growth.
Further, as the bulk of EGAT's proposed investments in power generation is
predicated on the use of domestic lignite and natural gas, the proposed
development path would lead to substantial savings in the import of fuel.
There are no major risks associated with the program. Although EGAT's
Power Development Plan is ambitious, the utility's demonstrated experience
with system expansion and its state of preparedness assure a successful
implementation of the program.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
