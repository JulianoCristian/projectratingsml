 1. Project Context, Development Objective and Design
 1.1 Context at Appraisal

Despite early political commitment and institutional efforts, decentralization in Peru
was - and remains - a challenge. Until 2002, Peru was one of the most centralized
countries in Latin America - sub-national expenditures were totally dependent upon
central decisions and almost 100 percent of tax revenues were collected by the national
government. In this context, the Government took the first steps towards
decentrali~ation based on a gradualist approach. In 2004, one of the major achievements
was the enactment of a legal framework to implement decentralization, including
organic laws of Regional Governments and Municipalities, and laws on Participatory
Budgeting, Fiscal Decentralization, and the Promotion of Decentralized Investment.

By 2005 the implementation of decentralization was facing several challenges -
technical, political and operational. Among the technical ones were the difficulty to
design a sufficiently flexible decentralization model to reflect country's diversity, the
lack of institutional capacities and of information systems at the sub-national levels, and
how to guarantee that the decentralization of expenditure responsibilities did not
compromise the quality of public services and ultimately help improve the efficiency of
public service deli,very. On the political side, some key challenges included the lack of a
clear timetable after the failure of the referendum to conform the regions, the lack of an
institutionalized forum for intergovernmental consensus building, and the potential for
increased inequality in the allocation of resources across the territory reSUlting from the
existing mechanisms to share natural resource revenues (canon). In addition, the legal
framework had significant gaps. For example, the organic laws of Regional
Governments and Municipalities did not help to clarifY the division of responsibilities
among levels of government. 0 perationally, decentralization faced some additional
challenges: what areas to prioritize in terms of transferring functions or how to design a
medium-term fiscal planning framework that safeguarded fiscal responsibility, and how
to establish the needed cooperation and coordination between levels of government.

Within this context, the Bank decided. to support the capacity-building for planning,
monitoring and evaluation in the social sectors and the strengthening of sustainable
fiscal management. A US$8.8 million loan to finance the Fiscal TAL (the Project) was
approved on July 15,2004 and became effective on January 13,2005. The Fiscal TAL
did not operate alone. On the contrary, the Fiscal TAL was designed to provide
complementary support to key aspects related to Peru's decentralization process that
had been previously addressed by the Decentralization and Competitiveness Structural
Adjustment Loans (DEC SAL} and the Fourth Programmatic Social Reform
Development Policy Loan (PSRL IV).I While the DECSAL aimed at protecting fiscal
sustainability through the transition to a more decentralized state and strengthening
regional and local fiscal capacities, the PSRL IV established triggers related to the legal
framework for result-oriented social decentralization. The PSRL IV was also

(P082871) - December 2, 2003 and DECSAL III (P089826) - December 8, 2005. There were four
PSRL between 2001 and 2004. Their approval dates were as follows: PSRL I (10 P071234) - June 19,
2001; PSRL II (P073817) - September 17, 2002; PSRL III (P078951) - November 11,2003; and PSRL
IV (P083968) - December 7, 2004.

accompanied by the Accountability for Decentralization in the Social Sectors Technical
Assistance Project (Social TAL),2 which was seen from the outset as complementary
with the Fiscal TAL. In addition, a recipient executed JSDF Grant "Giving Voice to the
Poor in Influencing, Planning and Evaluating Service Delivery" was also being
implemented during the Project design. It is relevant to mention that the Fiscal TAL was
also aligned to the agendas of bilateral donors and other multilateral organizations. The
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), in collaboration with the World Bank, had
designed programs focusing on decentralization policy framework. Thus, while the
Bank sponsored the Programmatic Decentralization and Competitiveness Structural
Adjustment Loans and the PSRLs, the IADB funded the State Modernization and
Decentralization Program. In November 2006, after the declaration of effectiveness of
the Project, the Bank approved a Fiscal Management and Competitiveness Development
Policy Loan, the first of a series of four Development Policy Loans (DPL) supporting,
among others, the Government's policy for the gradual implementation of Performance-
Based BUdgeting (PBB) throughout the public sector, including sub-national
governments.

At the time of the Project design in 2004, the country was showing consistent economic
growth and a sustained commitment towards implementing economic policy reforms.
Economically, Peru had made significant progress since the early nineties in reforming
its economy and had successfully avoided the effects of major financial crisis in the
Region. The strength of the economy could be attributed to sound fundamentals,
including a sound fiscal policy framework which resulted in primary surpluses. Signs of
the improving economic performance included increasing rates of economic growth,
low inflation and a stable exchange rate, a rising trade surplus, and a declining current
account deficit. Yet poverty levels in the early 2000s remained high despite the growth
seen. The limited effectiveness of antipoverty social programs reflected weak targeting,
limited coordination and widespread effort duplication, as well as input-focused
interventions and insufficient monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. In this context,
using the set of lessons derived mainly from the DEC SAL series, the GOP prioritized
the design and implementation of several social and fiscal reforms. Some of which were
supported through operations funded by the World Bank. Some of them, as it will be
discussed further on in this section, provided support for implementing the reforms in a
decentralized context.

The favorable context that was in place at appraisal, however, did not hold throughout
the Project's cycle. Decentralization fiscal reforms - which were at the core of the
Fiscal TAL - faced several shortcomings in terms of their implementation strategy,
institutional arrangements and external risks, as will be discussed in section 2 of this
leR. These factors had negative effects on Project delivery. Thus, in 2009, the Project
was restructured to reflect the Government's new priorities. Some of the new priorities
resulted from the fact that anew administration took office in 2006. In addition, the
length of time passed between project preparation in 2004 and the launch of activities in
late 2006 meant that the recipient sub-executing agencies had already adapted their
plans and changed some of their capacity building activities. In practice, there were two
distinct phases of the Project. In the first years the Project was overambitious in its
design and relied on several sub-executors and represented only 37 percent of the

institutional context and processes, as well as common strengths, limitations and challenges throughout
design and implementation, as discussed in the Social TAL's ICR (May, 2010).

disbursement. This phase ended in 2009 (prior to Project restructuring). The second
phase one narrowed its support around P BB, it supported basically only one sub-
executor based at MEF and represented around 60 percent of the disbursement (post
Project restructuring), as shown in Chart 1.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The original Project Development Objective (PDO), as stated in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), was to "strengthen public sector capacity for implementing a
sustainable fiscal decentralization and improve institutional effectiveness for adequate
services delivery by sub-national governments.,,3 T 0 achieve the PDO, the Project
provided support in four areas: (i) Safeguarding fiscal sustainability and ensuring
aggregate discipline; (ii) enhancing the quality of public expenditure; (iii) enhancing
strategic planning for public investment and public asset management; and (iv)
supporting the empowerment and expansion of the Integrated Financial Management
System (SlAP). In sum, the Project aimed at providing regional and local governments
with the necessary tools for planning, monitoring and evaluating sustainable finances.

The Key Indicators related to the Project's PDQ were:

•   Regional and local governments are equipped to produce multi-year fiscal planning,
    quarterly fiscal reports, performance management indicators, multi-year expenditure
    frameworks for regional and local governments published; standard quality
    investment projects and improved asset management (Target: SBN training to
    regional governments: 12 (2005); 12-14 (2006) and 14 (2007».

    3 There were several inconsistencies· in the language used to describe the PD~ between the Project Appraisal
    Document and the original Loan Agreement, which stated the PD~ as "to support fIScal sustainability, quality of
    service delivery and enhancement of competitiveness in the context of decentralization in the Borrower's
    territory." This IeR follows the definitions of the PAD. The restructuring in 2009 eliminated those
    inconsistencies and aligned the PD~ in the amended Loan Agreement with that of the Project Paper for the
    restructured Project.


                                                                  3
•   National Government regularly receives the necessary infonnation and produces
    analytical inputs for decision makers regarding fiscal and financial management,
    investment projects and perfonnance management by regional and local
    governments (Target: 28 regions and 24 local governments).


1.3 Revised    PD~   and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

Project restructuring aimed to respond to the Government's updated priorities of
improving results and accountability in the provision of public services. As part of this
effort, the MEF took a leading role through the creation and consolidation of the
Perfonnance-Based Budgeting technical team in 2007.4 Institutionally, the PBB
technical team belongs to the National Public Budget Directorate and was actively
involved in the Project restructuring process.

The revised PD~, as stated in the Restructured Project Paper approved by the Board on
June 23, 2009, was "to strengthen the public sector's capacity for implementing a
sustainable fiscal decentralization in the Borrower's territory and improve institutional
effectiveness for adequate service delivery at all levels ofthe Borrower's Government."
The Key Indicators associated to the Project's revised PD~ were:

•   Sub-national governments use the Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF)
    Budget and Expenditure Modules (Target: 100 percent)

•   Sub-national governments use the new debt recording module in SIAF to allow the
    monitoring of compliance with the fiscal decentralization legal framework (Target:
    100 percent)

•   The central Government monitors regularly compliance with the fiscal
    decentralization legal framework by sub-national governments (Target: Yes)

•   Perfonnance infonnation on public programs is made available to decision makers
    (Target: 10 public programs)

•   Percentage of sub-national governments' public investment projects in the national
    budget that have received SNIP viability prior to their inclusion in the national
    budget (Target: 80 percent)

1.4 Main beneficiaries

The long-tenn ultimate beneficiary of this Project was the civil society and the
population as a whole. This was expected to be achieved through the enhancement of
the quality, transparency and accountability of public expenditure. While it is still early
to document the benefits in tenns of better public service delivery through perfonnance-
based budgeting there are other concrete examples of how the Project has already
contributed to this ultimate goal. For example, the expansion of the integrated financial
management system (SIAF) at the local level has meant that since 2008 the budget

                                                4
 execution of aU municipalities is publicly available on-line in real time (daily updates).
 The extent of information now available to civil society is contributing to holding local
 authorities accountable for public expenditures.

In the short-term, the Project targeted the staff of the central, regional and local
governments. As a result of Project-related activities, it was expected they would count
on better targeted and more efficient, equitable and quality fiscal services based on
improved planning, monitoring and evaluation.

  Operationally, as a technical assistance loan, the Project supported several instances by
. strengthening their fiscal programs and implementation capacity. In particular, the
  Fiscal TAL worked directly with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). Within
  MEF, there were seven sub-executing units which directly benefited from the project:
  General Directorate for Economic and Social Affairs (DGAES), the National
  Directorate of Public Budget (DNPP), the National Directorate of Public Debt (DNEP),
  General Directorate for Multi-annual Programming (DGPM), the Office of Computing
  and Statistics (OFINE) in charge of the Integrated Financial Administration System
  (SIAF), the Superintendency of National Assets (SBN) and the Sectoral Loans
  Coordination Unit (UCPS).

 1.5 Original Components

The Project, as originaUy approved, comprised the following five components: 5

 •     Component 1: Planning and Monitoring Fiscal and Financial Management of
       Regional and Local Governments (USS 2.18 million)

       The first component aimed at providing the tools needed to support the Government
       in attaining a fiscal neutral decentralization process. It had two subcomponents: (i)
       strengthen fiscal discipline at regional and local levels through consolidating the
       medium-term planning frameworks and scaling them to the regional and local
       governments to support accounting, budgeting, reporting and fiscal accounts
       disclosure procedures. In addition, (ii) the second subcomponent contributed to
       preparing legal safeguards for public debt and building capacity for reporting and
       monitoring local and regional debt. In particular, the Project supported the design of
       a new debt module by SIAF. In general, the component financed national and
       international consultancies, workshops, training and dissemination.

•      Component 2: Supporting the Design and Implementation of Tools for
       Enhancement of Public Expenditure Efficiency (USS 0.89 million)

      The second component supported the consolidation of the Government's results-
      based orientation through programmatic and multiannual budgeting and compilation
      of result indicators. In particular, this component supported the design and
      implementation of three types of incentives and/or new mechanisms for enhancing
      public expenditure efficiency with pilot applications at the regional and local levels.
      Among these incentives were: (i) initial sets of (institutional) performance
      management indicators for projects and activities; (ii) Management Results

    Agreements (inc. Convenios de Administracion por Resultados - CARs - or
    performance contracts with local governments); and (iii) Participatory Budgeting.
    The Project supported the implementation and/or consolidation of these
    mechanisms. The component financed national and international consultancies,
    workshops, training, dissemination and equipment.

•   Component 3: Strengthening Strategic Planning for Public Investment and
    Public Assets Management (US$ 2.95 million)

    The purpose of the third component was to upgrade the existing systems and
    processes for public investment planning and public assets management to meet the
    demands that decentralization triggered. In particular, the component aimed at
    consolidating and institutionalizing the National Public Investment System (SNIP)
    and National Assets Superintendency (SBN).

    The component had two sUbcomponents: (i) strengthening and expansion of the
    Government's ability to manage its public investment program with emphasis on
    training investment units at the regional level; and (ii) provide capacity building for
    public assets management by regional governments through creating responsible
    units for asset management within regional government, training regional staff in
    the legal and regulatory framework, strengthening the capacity of the National
    Assets Superintendency for monitoring and supervising regional governments and
    establishing a link under the expected accreditation law with a "graduation" or
    "certification" system for asset management at the regional level. In general, the
    component financed national and international consultancies, workshops, training,
    dissemination and equipment.

•   Component 4. Increasing and Supporting the Use of the Integrated Financial
    Management System (SIAF) at the Local Level. (US$ 4.11 million)

    The Project's fourth component supported the Government's efforts for expanding
    the coverage of its financial management system and its upgrade to provide tools for
    performance monitoring. 111 particular, the component emphasized the following: (i)
    expeditious adoption of SIAF by local governments (i.e., SIAF -GL would expand
    from 1,026 to 1,829 local governments), (ii) the creation of a SIAF debt module
    (i.e., including training all levels of government staff in the use of the debt
    module/system and setting up a permanent support office to handle emergency
    SIAF-related questions), and, (iii) virtual registering of the national and regional
    governments' payroll control system in SIAF. In general, the component financed
    national and international consultancies, workshops, training, dissemination and
    equipment.

•   Component 5. Project Management (US$ 0.76 million)

    The Project's fifth component was twofold. On the one hand, it supported project
    implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The UCPS (Unidad de Coordinacion de
    Prestamos Sectoriales) agreed to operate the Project according to the structure and
    management procedures recommended by the Bank. A capacity assessment was
    carried out to evaluate procurement and financial management processes under the
    responsibility of UCPS and they were deemed satisfactory. The UCPS was

                                            6
    responsible for coordinating and monitoring the yearly Operations Plan, financial
    management of the Project and procurement of goods and services. On the other
    hand, this component supported a two-phase communication strategy, which aimed
    at creating greater support for decentralization-related reforms and enhance the
    sustainability of the Project. Specific actions were expected to include a diagnostic
    assessment and the preparation of a communication strategy. During the first phase
    activities were going to be focused around building consensus among MEF, PCM
    and CND and the second phase would disseminate major guidelines among
    stakeholders (regional and local governments, civil society, Congress, etc.).

1.6 Revised Components

As explained in section 1.3, the Project restructuring aimed at realigning activities to the
new priorities of the Government that emphasized Performance-Based Budgeting as
reflected also in the policy program agreed upon under the series of Fiscal Management
and Competitiveness DPLs. These changes were included in the Project Paper as
follows:

•   Component 1: Planning and Monitoring Fiscal and Financial Management of
    Regional and Local Governments (US$ 0.81 million)

    Given that the nature of the activities originally funded under this components were
    no longer priorities to the Government (i.e., efforts to have sub-national
    governments prepare macroeconomic multiannual frameworks), their scope was
    reduced. Thus, the revised component focused on strengthening fiscal discipline at
    the regional and local levels by developing a basic framework for monitoring and
    managing aggregated public sector debt. The component supported the expansion of
    SIAF module to sub-national debt to enable the central Government to monitor and
    evaluate regional and local government's compliance with the regulatory framework
    for fiscal decentralization.

•   Component 2: Supporting the Design and Implementation of Tools for
    Enhancement of Public Expenditure Efficiency (US$ 2.35 million)

    The revised component provided scaled-up support for the design and
    implementation of tools to improve the quality of public expenditures at all levels of
    government. Strong emphasis was given to the generation and use of performance-
    related information to improve service delivery at all government levels (i.e., as
    opposed to only sub-national governments, as originally planned). These efforts
    were aligned to the Government's commitment around the institutionalization of
    Performance-based Budgeting in the public administration.

•   Component 3: Strengthening Strategic Planning for Public Investment and
    Public Assets Management (US$ 1.5 million)

    This component remained broadly unchanged. Focus remained on enhancing the
    existing systems and processes for public investment planning and public asset
    management, and stressed building capacity at the sub-national level in these areas,
    which were considered essential for the consolidation of the decentralization
    process.

                                            7
•   Component 4. Increasing and Supporting the use of the Integrated Financial
    Management System (SIAF) at the local level (US$ 2.82 million)

    This component was expanded to support the Government's efforts to expand
    SlAP's .coverage at the sub-national levels. New activities supported the increased
    capacity and reliability of the system, and improvements to the quality of service to
    sub-national governments.

•   Component 5. Project Management (US$ 0.76 million)

    The purpose of this component was reduced - at the Government's request - to the
    coordination and execution of the Project.

1.7 Other significant changes

As part of Project's formal restructuring conducted in 2009, the following changes were
also introduced: (i) updating costs of project activities with a reduction in the overall
cost of the Project and a cancellation of the loan by US$2.16 million which resulted
from some activities no longer being included in the Project; (ii) minor changes to the
institutional arrangements readjusting the roles and responsibilities of each of the sub-
executing units (i.e., given that SBN was transferred to the Ministry of Housing, a
formal institutional arrangement between MEF and SBN was expected).

The partial cancellation of the loan by US$2.16 million requested by the authorities in
April 2008 is explained by a number of factors. Given the initial delays in securing a
budget appropriation for this Project, the MEF went ahead with a number of activities
under component 1 with other sources of funding. Moreover, there were a number of
activities no longer envisaged, for example under component 5 as discussed above.
Finally, the activities under components 3 and 4 were scaled down to ensure that the
planned activities could be undertaken prior to the Project closing date.

Furthermore, in order to increase efficiency among Bank-led operations, the evaluation
component that was originally part of the Social TAL was transferred to the Fiscal TAL,
given that this Project already considered supporting a series of program assessments. In
turn, the Social TAL focused on strengthening the public social expenditure tracking
system (i.e., monitoring). This consolidation stressed the nationwide implementation of
the Integrated System of Administrative Management (SIGA) which was initially
developed under PARSaiud I.

The loan's original closing date (June 20, 2008) was extended two times (to December
31,2009 and finally to September 30,2010) resulting in an overall project life span of
almost seven years between appraisal and closing. However, these extensions proved
critical to achieve the Project outcomes,particularly with regard to performance-based
budgeting.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry


                                           8
The design of the original Project was characterized by several strengths and, at the
same time, various shortcomings. Overall, the Project as prepared was complex and too
ambitious, and underestimated the risks that it would face during its implementation.
The following are key strengths and weaknesses on the design of the Project:

    •   Project's purpose was systematically aligned to the Government's fiscal
        decentralization policy agenda. At the time of its design, the Project was meant to
        support the achievement of Government goals and to complement DEC SAL and
        PSRL IV-related efforts. In particular, the Project aimed at serving as a linkage
        among the national, regional and local levels with emphasis on fiscal and
        institutional capacity-strengthening for the implementation of fiscal decentralization
        policies. This was a critical issue in the Government's political agenda. 6

    •   Project's design incorporated previous lessons and research findings. The
        design of the Fiscal TAL built on a sound background analysis of Bank's previous
        operations and international best practices. The Project benefited from substantial
        analytical work undertaken during DEC SAL preparation. In particular, several notes
        were drafted regarding sub-national fiscal policy, public investment, accreditation,
        civil service and participatory budgeting. Moreover, the Project's rationale was
        informed by international practices in Argentina, Brazil, Central America, Chile,
        Colombia and Mexico.

•       Project's design was aligned to CAS. The Country Assistance Strategy for Peru is
        built upon three strategic pillars to support the country's efforts to increase
        economic growth and competitiveness, reduce poverty and inequality, and
        strengthen the country's public institutions. In general, DECSAL and PSRL
        supported some of the key policy changes needed to develop performance
        orientation in the fiscal sector and to support the announced decentralization of
        regional and local governments. The Fiscal TAL, as well as the Social TAL, was
        conceived as a complementary operation that was expected to instill greater results
        orientation and leverage on the support to Government's priorities around efficient
        performance and accountability.

•       Project's design was based on preliminary policy documents, institutional plans
        and staff perceptions on how the decentralization process was to be
        implemented. Prior to its design, Bank staff - in close collaboration with MEF
        professionals - discussed with sub-national representatives and with staff from the
        Prime Ministers Council (PCM) and from the National Council for Decentralization
        (CND) the principles, procedures and potential effects of decentralization at the
        regional and local levels. At the time, the Administration was explicitly enthusiastic
        about the success that the decentralization reforms were about to bring. However, a
        number of setbacks affected the implementation of the decentralization process. The
        Bank overestimated the extent to which the Government had a timely and clear
        operational strategy, especially on the back of the setbacks that affected· the
        decentralization process. In addition, the differences between MEF and the National
        Council for Decentralization were not sufficie~tly grasped. In sum, the Bank

Organic Law of Regional Governments (promulgated on November 19,2002).

                                                   9
    misjudged the Government's operational capacity to timely and effectively
    implement the fiscal decentralization process.

• . Given the complex context of decentralizing proposals in Peru, the Project was
    designed explicitly as a flexible tool. The underlying logic of the Project at design
    was that both aspects of the PD~ (strengthening public sector capacity for
    implementing a sustainable fiscal decentralization and improving institutional
    effectiveness for adequate service delivery by sub-national governments) would
    reinforce each other: fiscal decentralization would help improve sub-national service
    delivery. But the team identified a number of risks to the decentralization scenario -
    and thus built-in enough flexibility to allow the support to the Government on
    improving institutional effectiveness for service delivery in a broader way. In the
    end the risks materialized and fiscal decentralization did not take place as planned
    and the authorities increasingly shifted to the use of performance-based budgeting as
    a tool to improve public service delivery. Thus, the Project naturally moved towards
    the support of performance-based budgeting as an instrument to help improve public
    service delivery but unrelated to fiscal decentralization. While this in-built
    flexibility proved useful it also has to be recognized that performance-based
    budgeting cannot substitute for addressing the core operational challenges of
    decentralization.

•   Project's assessment of risks was not sufficiently accurate. As part of the initial
    design, five major risks were identified (i.e., political, fiscal disarray, limited local
    implementation capacity, anti-performance based culture and dispersed leadership
    and low coordination capacity). The overall risk rating considered in the PAD was
    "high". However, local implementation and coordination capacities (i.e., originally
    rated as "substantial") were quite limited and therefore should have been rated as
    "high". In addition, the highest risk faced by the Project was not properly identified
    - Lack of a Government strategy and operational plan to implement the fiscal
    decentralization at the regional and local levels. As a result, the Bank took time to
    identify and implement the necessary mitigation measures which, at the end, led to
    Project restructuring in 2009.

•   Project placed strong emphasis on "central" MEF Directorates and/or OffICes.
    As part of its design, all components were under the direct responsibility of one of
    MEF's seven units prioritized in this Project. However, the design overestimated
    MEF's central institutional capacity and no formal responsibilities were given to
    sub-national levels. Moreover, as explained above, the strategies and guidelines for
    decentralization were still under a validation process. Thus, before working towards
    fiscal decentralization, MEF needed to become accountable itself, especially in the
    dialogue with regional and local governments.

•   Project's objective and institutional arrangements were overambitious. The
    PD~ aimed at strengthening public sector capacity for implementing a sustainable
    fiscal decentralization and improve institutional effectiveness for adequate service
    delivery by sub-national governments. Thus, this constituted an overambitious
    objective to implement as part of a technical assistance operation. Furthermore,
    given that this was a platform to be mainstreamed into MEF, the design identified
    seven direct counterparts (Le., UCPS-MEF, DGAES-MEF, DNPP-MEF, DGPM-
    MEF, DNEP-MEF, OFINE-MEF and SNB). Although these arrangements were

                                             10
     aligned to the PD~, the operational coordination capacities of each and among were
     overestimated during the Project design.




2.2 Implementation

Prior to restructuring, the Project had a slow implementation rate, especially in some
components, and key counterparts had difficulty in focusing on critical actions.
Underlying reasons for this included:

•   Delay in the Project's initial public budget allocation. The Project was declared
    effective in January 2005. However, the authorities had not included the loan as part
    of the 2005 National Budget. It was expected that the loan was going to be formally
    included in the Budget through a Supplementary Credit Law to be approved by the
    National Congress. This decision, however, took several months before it became
    effective in November 2005. Thus, given that the Project was expected to last 3.5
    years, a one-year delay in the implementation of initial actions caused a serious
    setback (Le., during its first year of implementation, the Project only spent US$
    288,708 which was equivalent to 9 percent of the planned budget). The Bank's team
    could have identified this potential delay as a risk.

•   Lack of an operational strategy for effective decentralization implementation at
    the regional .Ievel. Although decentralization actually materialized through the
    transfer of social programs to the Regions, the process was far from being effective.
    Regions were formally responsible for funding allocation, however, major decisions
    were still being made at the national level and there was a lack of clarity as to which
    level of government was responsible for what functions since many competencies
    were formally shared. In addition, managerial and coordination capacities were not
    sufficiently consolidated prior to program transfer. The Social TAL confronted these
    challenges as well.

•   Readjustment and reorientation of political strategies in the economic fronts.
    The Project witnessed the beginning of a new policy related to the country's new
    focus on achieving results and accountability: Performance-Based Budgeting (PBB).
    PBB was promoted as a planning tool geared towards increasing efficiency and
    improving quality of public expenditure, especially relevant to prioritize results and
    accountability for all financial and social sector outcomes. Though this reform was
    directly aligned to the PD~ of this TAL, the initial definition associated to its
    implementation affected the Project, as follows: (i) institutional arrangements were
    in the process of being established which generated initial tensions between MEF
    and sub-national levels, and, (ii) delivery of 'project-related activities suffered
    postponements and delays.

•   Systematic changes in managerial positions and limited technical capacities at
    sub-national level. Because of the political changes occurring at high level, the
    Project faced high managerial and technical staff rotation in MEF. In addition, the
    Project had to deal with several readjustments of normative and organizational
    frameworks that affected sub-national governments which led to limited technical

                                           11
    capacities. Once the Project was restructured, one of the main counterparts became
    the PBB team based at DNPP.

•   Overlapping priorities affected the attribution and sustain ability of Fiscal TAL
    outcomes. Project funds targeted broad activities under specific components that, in
    some cases, overlapped with other Bank operations. In practice, it became unclear
    which activities were priorities to be addressed by the Fiscal TAL and, as result,
    attributable to it. This strategy resulted in a series of frequent changes to the
    activities to be undertaken and ultimately negatively impacted the sustainability of
    the activities supported by the Project.

•   Rigid system with respect to administrative procedures imposed by the UCPS.
    The UCPS faced high external pressure imposed by the procedures implemented by
    the Comptroller General's Office to guarantee the completion of a detailed protocol
    of administrative steps. Thus, the Unit showed rigidity in how .it related to the
    technical units, both within and outside MEF. Communication and coordination
    mechanisms were not. sufficiently fluid and, occasionally, the PCU team could have
    shown a more active predisposition towards executing actions with celerity.
    Moreover, PCU also showed a moderate staff rotation especially as it concerned
    technical sector assistants.

•    Political commitment was shifting and contributed to delays in the
     decentralization process. In addition to the delays in start-up and the period of
     governmental transition (2006), decentralization was not always at the core of public
    .policy during the past years nor was political support for it consistent. While the
     Government promoted the legal framework, it did not promote the institutional
     mechanisms to create the new regions, strengthen inter-institutional coordination,
     consolidate sub-national capacities or establish the roles and responsibilities of
     regional and local governments. As a result, the implementation of decentralization
     has been substantially delayed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

•   M&E design. The original Project elaborated a Results Framework that was aligned
    to the PDO and based on the limited infonnation that existed in 2004. Thus, the
    Framework included in the PAD did not include PDO targets. It was prepared with
    the expectation of data that, although not available at that time, was supposedly
    going to be generated after appraisal. As part of Project restructuring, a readjusted
    version of the Results Framework - which was directly discussed and agreed upon
    with sub-executing counterparts - was prepared. As opposed to the original one,
    this one was based on already available data and clearly identified reporting
    responsibilities.

•   M&E implementation. Indicators included in the original Results Framework
    faced, at least, three major shortcomings: (i) counterparts were not aware about the
    matrix, (ii) the matrix did not comply with the standard criteria of indicators
    formulation (i.e., specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and/or time-bound), and,
    (iii) there were no data sources available to provide the required infonnation. Once
    the Project was restructured, several of these shortcomings were discussed and a
    revised Results Framework elaborated in collaboration with counterparts. This

                                            12
    facilitated operational monitoring and the periodical discussion of implementation
    progress.

•   M&E utilization. As M&E has been at the core of the Project itself, the use of
    M&E data has been systematically increasing. Analysis, measurement and reporting
    became regular activities promoted by the Project. Staff commitment around these
    issues was remarkable, especially once the Project was restructured and the Results
    Framework effectively reflected their activities and efforts. Moreover, in terms of
    sustainability, several of the indicators have been mainstreamed into the current
    PBB monitoring system and the team has assumed the responsibility of data
    gathering. One factor that might explain these positive results is that, after Project
    restructuring, the PBB team was one of the most critical sub-executors.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Fiscal TAL did not trigger any ofthe Bank's safeguard policies.

On the fiduciary side, UCPS was formally responsible for financial accounting and
periodically reporting to the Bank. Based on Project supervision reports, UCPS's
staffing, record keeping, and fmancial reporting and monitoring were satisfactory.
Specifically, st~ff had adequate academic qualifications' and professional experience,
accounting was up-to-date, reconciled and bank account reconciliations were properly
done and FMRs were submitted on a timely manner with all the required information.
Shortcomings were observed, however, in internal control (Le., accounting policies
procedures) and budgeting systems. For instance, at some point, the exchange rate used
by the Project was not in line with what was required by the Bank guidelines.
Additionally, as UCPS consolidated the information provided by the sub-executing
entities to elaborate the Annual Operation Plans, given that this was not their formal
obligation it was usually the case that such plans were not an effective monitoring tool
because they were not timely updated.

2.5 Post-completion Operation

Though fiscal decentralization is still an ongoing process, several actions have been
implemented to facilitate capacity strengthening to this end. Among them are those
supported through the Programmatic Fiscal Management and Competitiveness DPL
series. Moreover, strategic lines promoted by the Project have been either mainstreamed
into MEF's structure (M&E system and SIAF) or are being supported by
complementary efforts. For instance, PRODEV - an IADB promoted initiative to
strengthen Government effectiveness in achieving developmental outcomes - will
consolidate efforts made, especially at the regional and local levels.

In particular, Fiscal TAL results could be monitored and evaluated in the future using
some of the performance indicators included in the Results Framework - the proportion
of sub-national governments. that have used/are using the'SIAF's budget, expenditure
and debt recording modules, as well as the proportion of them who have public
investment projects that have received SNIP viability prior to their inclusion in the
national budget. To date, the Fiscal TAL has substantially contributed in three aspects:
(i) all municipalities are currently using SIAF modules, (ii) the SNIP residents are

                                           13
currently in place, and, (iii) PBB has been institutionalized (i.e., one example is the
recent creation of the Direction of Public Expenditure Quality that is now part of the
General Directorate of Public Budget).

In terms of transition arrangements for the Project's future operation, appropriate
technical, fmancial and institutional provisions would be needed to ensure effectiveness
and impact. Among them, aside from a timely and adequate budget provision (i.e.,
public funds), complementary staffing and management-related capacities will need to
be put in place to institutionalize measurement tools and the required abilities to
implement them both nationally and regionally. Nonetheless, it is important to note that
an important proportion of consultants that worked under the Fiscal TAL are now part
of MEF's regular staff and, most importantly, some of them are occupying strategic
decision-making positions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

•   Objective. The original main objective of the Project maintained its relevance over
    time to adjust to the Peruvian political changing reality, especially after
    restructuring. Its main chal1enge was not content-related but scope-related: The
    original PD~ explicitly referred to sub~national governments. Based on Project's
    performance assessment, the current Government's political priorities and the role
    MEF plays in implementing PBB at all government levels, PDQ restructuring was
    required to guarantee its achievement. Thus, it was and still is extremely relevant to
    the oountry's current policy agenda (i.e., strengthening public sector capacity for
    implementing a sustainable fiscal decentralization and improving institutional
    effectiveness for adequate service delivery) at al1 government levels - central,
    regional and local. In addition, the objective remains relevant for the Bank's
    Country Assistance Program (CAS) and its current operations (Le., Fiscal
    Management and Competitiveness Devefopment Policy Loan to support, among
    others, the Government's policy for the gradual implementation of PBB throughout
    the public sector and the Results and Accountability Development Policy Loan to
    support the Government in strengthening accountability and improving results in
    health, nutrition and education).

•   Design. The restructured Project design aimed at strengthening institutional
    capacities for the implementation of the PBB (i.e., one of the most relevant and
    innovative public policy reforms the Government has embarked on in recent years),
    with particular emphasis on the capacity-building around planning, budgeting,
    monitoring and evaluating performance indicators within a decentralized fiscal
    context. Moreover, technical assistance provided by the Bank supported the
    generation, consolidation and institutionalization of M&E-related capacities at the
    national but, most importantly, at the regional and local level.

•   Implementation. The Project increased its relevance throughout implementation as
    it addressed crucial aspects for the development, consolidation and mainstreaming
    of fiscal decentralization at all government levels. Project implementation sought to
    guarantee the timely execution of deliverables. Particular pressure was put as PBB
    required strengthened monitoring systems in order to set capacities at the sub-

                                           14
     national levels for budget planning, monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore,
     Bank's implementation assistance was responsive to changing needs and
     circumstances throughout. By financing key activities such as the design of strategic
     budget prograins, the performance of evaluations, or the on-site support for new
     software tools the Project contributed to progress made on three pillars of the
     implementation of performance-based budgeting as shown in Table 1.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objective

•     Overall PDO. The odginal Project aimed at eqUIppmg regional and local·
    . governments to produce multi-year fiscal planning, quarterly fiscal reports and
      performance management indicators; publishing multi-year expenditure frameworks
      for regional and local governments; and promoting standard quality investment
      projects and improved asset management. By June 2009, 100 percent of the regional
      governments were trained in the application of the legal framework for sub-national
      burrowing and strategic debt management. Moreover, the Project also supported that
      the national Government regularly received the necessary information to produce
      analytical inputs for decision makers regarding fiscal and financial management,
      investment projects and performance management by regional and local
      governments. By June 2009, the SIAF's debt recording new module had been
      developed to facilitate reporting by sub-national governments.

    However, by June 2009, there was no information available so as to estimate
    whether Project original targets had been complied with. As explained above, a
    determinant factor for these delays and/or failures was the lack of a sound strategy
    and clear operational plan to implement fiscal decentralization at all government
    levels. These results led, in addition to the reasons described in previous sections, to
    the restructuring of the Project in June 2009.

    Once the Project was restructured, the PDO was satisfactorily achieved in
    collaboration with the PBB strategy. In particular, achievements were observed in
    the progress towards PDO-related indicators and their targets. Specifically, at the
    end of the Project, 100 percent of the sub-national governments were using the
    SIAF-GL's budget and expenditure Modules and 100 percent of the sub-national
    governments were using the new debt recording module in SIAF-GL to allow the

                                            15
         monitoring of compliance with the fiscal decentralization legal framework.
         Moreover, the central Government was regularly monitoring the indebtedness of
         sub-national governments. Finally, performance information on public programs
         was made available to decision makers through four independent evaluations of
         budget programs. Only one PD~ indicator (Le., percentage of sub-national
         governments' public investment projects in the national budget that have received
         SNIP viability prior to their inclusion in the national budget) was not available at
         that time.

         Thus, the ICR finds the achievement ofPDO to be moderately satisfactory.

The specific achievements in capacity-building of fiscal decentralization related-areas at
all government levels,8 which also point to the attainment of the PD~, can be
summarized as follows:

•        Component 1. The Project aimed at strengthening the planning and monitoring of
         fiscal and financial management of regional and local governments. Under the
         original Project, the Project supported the development of prudent legal safeguards


7   HS=6' S=5' MS=4' MU=3' U=2' HU=)
8   The P~ojec;'s Arr~gemen;s for Monitoring were readjusted as part of the restructuring.

                                                     16
    for public debt at all levels of government and the development of a framework for
    accounting and treatment of contingent liabilities· arising from Public-Private
    Partnerships (PPPs). Moreover, local and regional governments were trained on the
    application of the legal framework for public financing forecasts, sub-national
    borrowing and strategic debt management. The SIAF's module for debt recording
    and reporting by sub-national government was developed with Project's support.

    Nonetheless, by June 2009, due to political factors, lack of operational clarity and
    changing policy· priorities, the expected outcomes were not totally achieved. For
    instance there was not any fiscal management multi-annual report published (as
    opposed to the 26 and 22 that were originally targeted in the PAD for regional and
    local governments, respectively).

    Once the Project was restructured, tlie component achieved a satisfactory delivery.
    Thus, 80 percent of sub-national governments had been trained in the application of
    the legal framework for sub-national burrowing and strategic budget management.
    In sum, these results complied with what was originally anticipated and were
    achieved as a consequence of the political endorsement of PBB, .as well as to the
    commitment of regional governments.

•   Component 2. The Fiscal TAL supported the design of incentives and mechanisms
    for enhancing public expenditure efficiency. Under the original Project, given that
    the decentralization process was still being operationalized and that priorities
    changed, there was a high uncertainty level and major outputs were not achieved
    (Le., development of cost indicators, use of proposed sets ofperformance indicators,
    Management Results Agreements).

    By June 2009, no information was available to verify - for instance - whetJter there
    were regional governments using performance indicators to prioritize, monitor· and
    evaluate public expenditure (as opposed to the 5 regional governments that were.
    originally targeted in the PAD). As a result ofthe changing political context, several
    of the activities under this component were adjusted during Project implementation
    to reflect new priorities. Among them was the financial support to carry out the first
    program evaluations under the PBB strategy.

    Once the Project was restructured, output delivery improved. For instance, as
    expected, 100 percent of sub-national government civil servants of Public Budgeting
    and Planning Offices were trained in PBB.     .

•   Component 3. The Project assisted in the strengthening of strategic planning for
    public investment and public asset management. In particular, t~e Project supported
    the training of local and regional governments about SNIP procedures. In addition,
    several SNIP offices were opened in different provinces. On the other hand,
    activities related to public asset management were left in stand-by given the transfer
    of SBN to the Ministry of Housing.

    By June 2009, the performance of this component was moderate. However, once
    the Project was revised and its indicators readjusted, several of its outcomes were
    achieved. For instance, as expected, 26 Technical Assistance Coordinators at the
    sub-national level provided support in investment planning and execution.

                                           17
 •   Component 4. This component supported the expansion of the use of SIAF to sub-
     national governments. Thus, the Project funded the use of SIAF-GL (Le., a system
     to ensure uniform accounting, budgeting and reporting standards, and to provide on-
     line monitoring of contracts and disbursements for local governments). By June
     2009, over 1800 municipalities were using it. Project restructuring consolidated
     these outputs. At the time the Project ended operations, 99 percent of sub-national
     governments were producing timely reports in SIAF of their year-end closing
     accounts balance (as compared to the 100 percent included in the Project Paper).



 3.3 Efficiency

 As the Project was a technical assistance operation, an economic analysis was not
 prepared during preparation against which its efficiency can be measured. Still, the
 Project's efficiency can be inferred on the basis of the expected impacts of the activities
 it supported and the efficiency with which it was implemented.

 The Project was expected to develop institutional capacities for strengthening
 performance-based budgeting, as well as planning, monitoring and evaluation with
 emphasis on fiscal decentralization. The large-scale implementation of the PBB with
 emphasis on priority selected sector programs increased data collection capacities. By
 improving the quality of information available, through data collection, and an
 increased focus on monitoring and evaluation, it is expected that the Government will
 be able to make better-informed decisions regarding the design and targeting of public
 resources and beneficiaries will eventually count on better targeted and more efficient
 services.

 The introduction of PBB mechanisms into Government programs introduces greater
 efficiency into the allocation and use of Government resources, while identifying issues
 with respect to institutional capacity constraints among certain states and municipalities
 that can be and is being addressed through strengthened implementation support aimed
 at· building needed capacity. These efforts are expected to strengthen the effectiveness
 of fiscal decentralization, both through improved equity and improved quality and
 efficiency in their delivery.

 The costs involved in achieving Project objectives were reasonable in comparison to
 both the benefits and recognized norms. The Project was expected to have a positive
 fiscal impact resulting from implementing decentralized fiscal and financial
 mechanisms and increasing institutional capacities to conduct these exercises regularly.
 Although, at present, there is not methodological instrument available to allow
 attributing the effects to the Project itself and/or those of external factors, an actual
 effect on National Budget is anticipated at all government levels.

 3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

  The overall outcome of the loan is rated moderately satisfactory. The overall objective
  of the loan set at the time of its approval (i.e., strengthen public sector capacity for
. implementing a sustainable fiscal decentralization) remained extremely relevant

                                            18
 throughout the operation and was aligned to the Government's commitment around
 promoting efficiency and accountability around public expenditure. This relevance still
 holds in the present. Though the Project was not implemented as planned due to limited
 technical and coordination capacities, outcomes were moderately achieved after
 restructuring, especially under components 2,3 and 4.

 3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 •   Poverty impacts, Gender aspects and Social Development

 Since the Project was directly associated to the promotion of capacities around fiscal
 decentralization, its impact on poverty, gender aspects and social development was not
 expected to be direct. The Project, however, implemented actions to increase
 knowledge, modify attitudes and promote skills for technical staff, at all government
 levels, to carry out fiscal and financial managerial tasks in a more efficient way.

 •   Institutional changes/Strengthening

 The achievement of PDD was directly involved with the promotion of institutional
 changes. The Project made some important contributions to the development of policy
 instruments and capacity leading to improved accountability at all government levels, as
 well as to the strengthening ofPBB which was central to the PO, as part of the Bank's
 technical operations in Peru.

  After restructuring, the Project supported important institutional changes related to the
  most relevant reforms initiated in the country, specifically fiscal and financial
  decentralization and implementation of PBB. In particular, the Project facilitated
  changes in three areas: (i) validating and consolidating "measurement and assessment
, culture", especially as related to fiscal decentralization, (ii) setting up intra-institutional
  coordination mechanisms within MEF headquarters, and (iii) strengthening capacities at
  the national, regional and local levels for the adequate planning, budgeting,
  implementation and scaling up of outcome-oriented management procedures.

 4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The assessment of risk to development outcome is rated moderate. There are several
factors indicative that development outcomes achieved through the Project are likely to
be maintained and justify rating the risk as "moderate". In particular: (i) MEF has
systematically promoted the institutionalization of several of the mechanisms and tools
that were supported through-the Fiscal TAL - SIAF, SNIP and PBB, (ii) MEF's current
organizational structure provides strategic importance to these tools (i.e., creation of
new Directorates and Offices), (iii) increasing availability of regional experts on the
subject matters, and, (iv) systematic increment in public budget allocated to PBB-
focused strategic programs.            -


                                               19
However, there are also a few factors may affect the sustainability of the outcomes of
this Project. Among them are the following:

•   Regional capacities are still weak. Despite progress made through the Fiscal TAL
    and other complementary operations, regional governmental levels still face lack of
    systematic training opportunities and technical assistance to consolidate what has
    been achieved. Among other important issues, high rotation of staff is a major
    shortcoming that impedes the accumulation of a knowledge base in the regions.

•   Decentralization is still "in progress" and ownership is still weak. As discussed
    above, the decentralization process is still far from being completed. Moreover,
    relevant actors at sub-national levels might the current process is a Lima-based
    recommendation that still does reflect their current dynamics. Thus, it might be
    perceived as external.

•   Reversal of the implementation of perforniance-based budgeting. Despite the
    political endorsement of this reform and progress made to date in its
    implementation, PBB still faces some challenges. In particular a challenge may stem
    from the perception that it is currently promoting a "micro-management of inputs"
    rather than on an effective mechanism to focus outcome-based funds allocation at
    the regional level. Thus, PBB has not yet become an instrument for decision-making
    within a decentralization context '

•   Presidential elections 2011. The uncertainty aSsociated to upcoming electoral
    processes might result in an either positive or negative influence on the
    achievements made. The instrument of performance-based budgeting remains far
    from being a fully institutionalized policy tool in Peru and is therefore particularly at
    risk when anew administration takes office.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

•   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The Bank and the Borrower framed the Project design within the overall Bank's CAS
considering, e~pecially, the assumptions, outcomes and lessons achieved through the
DEC SAL series. The Bank brought about its international experience in the design of
technical assistance loans with emphasis on fiscal decentralization programs.
Nonetheless, the Bank overestimated several aspects that were crucial for the Project's
successful implementation later on. Among them, the Bank assumed that the
Government had a sound strategy and a clear operational plan' to implement the
decentralization and departed from there. This assumption led the Bank to propose a
somehow challenging platform conformed by seven sub-executing units based at central
MEF, define an "ideal" Results Framework with unclear target values and
methodological procedures and to underestimate critical risks.

This ICR rates Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry to be moderately
unsatisfactory .

                                            20
 •   Quality of Supervision

Technical and fmanciaI/procurement missions were, most of the time, carried out jointly
which allowed the permanent feedback among Bank teams involved in the operation.
Nonetheless, missions were somehow scattered - while the first mission took place in
May 2005, the second one occurred in June 2006. Similarly, despite the fact that 2008
was a critical year for restructuring and readjusting Project contents and procedures, two
formal missions took place - One in January and the other one in December.

The Project had two Task Team Leaders. For most part of the Project, the TTL was
field-based, providing continuous assistance during implementation and facilitating
inter-institutional coordination. Throughout, the Project had aTTL that was responsible
for other projects related to this Technical Assistance Loan and facilitated coordination
and a holistic view of the overall strategy targeting social programs.

This ICR rates Quality of Supervision to be moderately satisfactory.

•    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

The overall performance of the Bank is rated moderately satisfactory. At the time of
preparation, implementation and supervision, the Bank provided timely technical and
managerial assistance to an ongoing Government priority and facilitated support to
fiscal decentralization and PBB implementation at all government levels. However, the
Bank proceeded based on several critical assumptions about the operational strategy and
political endorsement the Government was going to provide to implementing
decentralization. This overestimation, later on, jeopardized Project implementation
which led to its restructuring in 2009.


5.2 Borrower Performance

•    Government Performance

The Government was responsible for the preparation of the Project throughout the
whole process. Relevant governmental MEF officers expressed high commitment in the
implementation of the Project as it complemented a current policy effort - fiscal and
financial decentralization. Nonetheless,_ commitment around the Project was not
constant. In particular, given that Presidential Elections took place in 2006, the
implementation was characterized by high staff rotation at the managerial and technical
levels. This affected implementation and outcome delivery.

Moreover, in terms of MEF sub-executing units, capacities were not homogenous as
anticipated during Project' preparation especially given that the operationalization of
decentralization was still in progress. Later on, the PBB team became one of the critical
sub-executing units which - given its team experience, strategic vision and commitment
- reflected positively in the delivery of Project outcomes.

This ICR rates Government Performance to be moderately satisfactory..


                                          21
•   Implementing Agency

For purposes of this ICR the implementing agency was the UCPS. In terms ofthis Unit,
as explained above, its rigidity in terms of rules compliance and limited coordination
with sub-executors constrained the timely delivery of outcomes. Moreover, the Unit
exhibited high staff rotation especially as it related to sectoral assistants (sectoristas)
who were directly responsible for providing technical assistance. Additionally, as UCPS
was not directly involved in Project preparation, the Unit's staff did not have sufficient
information as to the rationale, contents or expected outcomes of the Project. This,
somehow, prevented the UCPS team from having a proactive attitude towards results
achievement.

On the other hand, UCPS took a leading active role to facilitate the memorandum
between MEF and Ministry of Housing that allowed the implementation of SBN-related
activities.

Moreover, after Project restructuring, the UCPS improved its control mechanisms
towards expediting implementation and complying with Bank regulations. Thus, at the
end, the Project achieved a satisfactory disbursement (97.7 percent of the restructured
amount as illustrated in the table below).

This ICR rates Implementing Agency to be moderately satisfactory.

•   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

The overall performance of the Borrower is rated moderately satisfactory for the
reasons outlines above. After restructuring, several of the factors threatening the success
of the Project were addressed and implementation took a renewed speed.


6. Lessons Learned
Guaranteeing country's ownership of a realistic Results Framework could
facilitate its use as management tool. In this Project the Results Framework became
an overambitious list of indicators that was subsequently not fully utilized duri ng
implementation. Thus, greater emphasis could have been placed on discussing the
Results Framework with government officials during the design stage. To this end, it
would be advisable that - prior to formal project approval - the country formally
endorses the Results Framework and indicates how would indicators be met and
measured. The issue of how indicators will be measured is critical for the Results
Framework to be a realistic tool. As shown in this Project, the usefulness of the Results
Framework may suffer as a result of including indicators for which there is no clear
methodology on how the data is going to be collected or accountability for the data
                                           22
 collection. As a practical matter, a discussion of the planned Results Framework for
 projects under preparation could take place at the Country Portfolio Performance
 Review (CPPR) meetings.

  This Project highlights the trade-off between having clarity of purpose and
  allowing sufficient flexibility to cope with rapidly changing circumstances." The
  experience from this Project is that a TAL can be useful as a mid-term flexible
  instrument, for example to validate processes that the authorities are piloting. This is
  particularly important in situations, such as this TAL, where the context - as much as
  the content of the Project - shaped the challenges faced during implementation. In this
  case, the context in which the Project. was prepared was characterized by an ambitious
  attempt of the Peruvian authorities to launch decentralization that later proved
  unrealistic. In practice, the activities supported by a TAL can shift over time as new
. realities emerge. Thus, in situations where the context is in flux, it appears advisable to
  design the Project to allow sufficient flexibility at the implementation stage without
  being ambiguous about the development objectives being pursued. This tension between
  clarity of purpose and allowing s~fficient flexibility is one of the key trade-offs that
  teams preparing TALs need to address.

Being realistic about the time required to implement Technical Assistance-related
projects might render better results. The six-month delay between approval and
effectiveness and the almost full-year delay until the Project was given authority to
draw resources from the national budget meant that most of the activities only started to
be implemented in early 2006, close to two years after they had been initially discussed.
Moreover, Presidential elections meant that by mid-2006 there was a new
administration in office. As such it is to be expected that some changes to planned
activities would be necessary. In addition, becoming aware of the differences between
"political timing", ''technical timing" and "project timing" could add a realistic basis for
interventions. Political timing is likely to be focused around short term results and is
also likely to be the determining factor - as in the case of this Project. Yet,
subordinating the technical to the political timing might be detrimental for achieving
results. The challenge is to recognize each of these three dimensions and to articulate
agendas towards common targets.


Validating the assessment of risks throughout the life of the Project might facilitate
implementation. In this Project, a working assumption was that decentralization was to
proceed as it was anticipated in the laws, particularly the Decentralization Framework
Law, at the time of appraisal. However, this proved to be an unrealistic assumption. In
this regard a lesson learned is that it would be adviSable to permanently assess not only
progress made towards the Project Development Objective, indicators, and targets but
also the risks identified in the Project Appraisal Document. An innovative way to do so
would be to conduct participatory exercises involving Bank and Government staff to
make the necessary adjustments along the design and implementation process. An
additional strength of this approach would be to create ownership at the country level
and, consequently, promote political support. Finally, given the usual time gap between
projects' negotiation, approval and implementation, these exercises could allow
revisiting the expected outcomes and making the necessary adjustments to guarantee
conditions for a realistic operation.

Implementing a project with multiple sub-executing units might impose additional
challenges to outcome delivery. In this Project the Bank faced a number of challenges
in dealing with multiple sub-executing units, which contributed to uneven results across
activities supported by the Project. The peu and the Bank played a role as an external
facilitator promoting communication and coordination but the cost-effectiveness of such
efforts is questionable since they turned out to be extremely demanding in terms of time
and resources. A lesson from this experience is that it is difficult to promote inter- or
intra-institutional coordination from a top-down approach. As a result, it may prove
more realistic to deal with a smaller number of sub-executing units. In this regard it is
also noteworthy that the Project dealt directly with central government agencies only.
Based on the lesson drawn here, dealing with sub-national agencies directly would have
complicated implementation much more but this only reinforces the challenge of how to
implement a project aimed at building capacity at the sub-national level through central
government actors.

Addressing actual managerial and technical capacities in Peru remains critical for
a successful decentralization. While the Project has contributed to addressing the gap
in institutional capacity, the assessment of current capacities at the national and sub-
national levels suggests that much remains to be done. Stronger efforts could be placed
on developing an institutional platform for training. promoting and enhancing capacities
that go beyond an externally-funded operation. The introduction of performance-based
budgeting (PBB) makes capacities' strengthening even more challenging, as the ability
to use performance information to transform actions requires extensive capacities to
plan, document, communicate, measure and disseminate results.

   Annex 2. Outputs by Component and Performance by Sub-Executing Agency

This Annex presents a detailed discussion of the achievement of outputs by Project
Components organized into two sections: Prior to restructuring (i.e., until June 2009)
and post-restructuring (i.e., from June 2009). It also provides an assessment of the
performance of each of the sub-executing agencies that had responsibility for
implementing the Project.            '

(a) Outputs by Component prior to restructuring

As shown, by the time of Project restruc~ring, several of the output indicators had been
totally or partially achieved (especially under Components 1 and 4, and partially 3).
This le9 to reformulating and/or dropping some of the indicators in the restructured
Results Framework. In terms of Component 2, since activities were completely revised
and readjusted, the new matrix contained all new indicators.

(c) Assessment of Borrower's. sub-executing units

•    Directorate for Economic and Social Affairs (DGAES). As part of MEF's structure,
     DGAES is responsible for providing guidelines for social and economic policy. In
     particular, DGAES elaborates the Multiannual Macroeconomic Framework which forecasts
     the main macroeconomic variables and sets fiscal ceilings on a three-year horizon for
     revenues, expenditure, investment and public debt. Under the Fiscal TAL, DGAES was
     directly involved under Component 1 with the expectation of scaling-up and consolidating
     mid-term budgeting frameworks in regional and local governments. As part of the
     restructuring process, however, Component 1 was readjusted and the role of DGAES was
     considerably reduced. The main shortcomings it faced were the changing policy priorities
     which affected the terms of their participation in the Project and the ambitious nature of
     their institutional mandate which, at times, imposed several demands on the Directorate's
     staff. In sum, DGAES showed a moderately satisfactory performance throughout the
     Project.


•    Directorate for National Public Budget (DNPP). Aside from its strategic institutional
     mandate, one of DNPP's major responsibilities has been the implementation of the
     Performance Based-Budgeting (PBB) that begun in 2007. As part of the original Fiscal
     TAL, DNPP was supported through Component 2 to develop tools for enhancing public
     expenditure efficiency (i.e., performance indicators, Results Agreements). Once the Project
     was restructured, the Project was centered around the implementation of PBB with

                                                                30
    emphasi~ on methodology, evaluations and CARs. Given that PBB was an innovative
    reform, the DNPP had to invest a considerable amount of time in planning, designing,
    creating awareness and training several other actors involved in the budgeting process at all
    government levels. Considering that the PBB team was rather small and that it took time to
    institutionalize it within MEF, this implied a severe constraint on their time. Despite these
    pressures, this sub-executing agency always had a clear focus on what activities were a
    priority and amply demonstrated the capacity to undertake their plans. In sum, DNPP
    showed a satisfactory performance throughout the Project.

•   Directorate for Multiannual Programming (DGPM). Among several other planning
    responsibilities, DGPM hosts the National System of Public Investment. As part of the
    original and restructured Project, DGPM was supported to train sub-national staff in
    strategic planning for public investment in order to increase the number of regional projects
    that complied with SNIP guidelines. Among the main shortcomings DGPM faced were the
    internal readjustments that SNIP faced and affected implementation and the need to create
    regional and local capacities to comply with the proposed activities. However, there were
    frequent changes to the details of the activities planned resulting in high supervision costs.
    In sum, DGPM showed a moderately satisfactory performance.

•   Directorate of Public Debt (DNEP). The Directorate leads the National Debt System.
    Under the Project DNEP trained sub-national governments in the application of the legal
    framework for sub-national burroWing and strategic debt management. The Project also
    helped develop such legal framework in the early stages. DNEP exceeded the targets set and
    maintained a steady and clear focus on what the Project activities entailed contributing to an
    efficient use of funds. Overall, DNEP's performance was satisfactory.

•   General Office of Informatics and Statistics (OFINE). The Office is responsible for
    providing informatics support and maintenance to SIAF. The Project supported the
    implementation ofSIAF-GL at the sub-national level. OFINE achieved the targets that were
    originally set and, in several cases, exceeded them. Moreover, in addition to SIAF, OFINE
    also provides support to Integrated System for Administrative Management (SIGAl which
    is a complementary tool to SIAF. However, there were frequent changes to the details ofthe
    activities planned resulting in high supervision costs. In sum, OFINE's performance was
    moderately satisfactory

•   Superintendency of National Assets (SBN). Originally, SBN was under the jurisdiction of
    MEF. Later on, it was transferred to the Ministry of Housing which - due to administrative
    constraints - caused a considerable delay in Project implementation. The Fiscal TAL
    centered the support to SBN around training sub-national staff on public asset management
    and the associated legal framework. Overall, SBN's performance was moderately
    satisfactory due to the delays incurred on as a result of institutional and administrative
    changes.

      Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

This annex provides a summary in English of the lessons learned and conclusions
reached in the Project closing report prepared by the PCU              -


Lessons learned

As reported by the sub-executing units, the main lessons learned included:

   A structural reform of public financial administration requires considerable financial
   investment, as well as capacity building at all levels of government;

   The high turnover of sub-national governments' staff, especially when authorities
   change (through election or revocation), makes it even more critical to further
   disseminate the regulations, new funding mechanisms and IT protocols to facilitate
   data management;

   Timely and adequate administrative support is key for achieving the goals of a
   reform project such as the one supported by this Project;

   Technical assistance operations - such as this Project - are instrumental for the
   implementation of strategic reforms such as Performance-based Budgeting;

   It is necessary to institutionalize Project outcomes by consolidating the commitment
   of partner organizations around reforms.

Recommendations

   Articulate t he Management and Monitoring System of the Superintendency of
   National Assets (Superintendencia de Bienes Nacionales) with the Integrated
   Financial Administration System (Sistema Integrado de Administracion Financiera)
   and the Integrated Management Administration System (Sistema Integrado de
   Gestion Administrativa) to ensure consistency in information and to facilitate
   decision making;

   Promote an adequate communication strategy to ensure policy continuity;

   Provide incentives to promote the effective and efficient adoption of performance-
   based budgeting and MEF-Ied evaluations' recommendations;

   Document and disseminate the performance-based budgeting implementation
   process including, among other tools, reports prepared for the President, Congress,
   ministries, regional and local governments, National Comptroller's Office, etc.

   Organize training workshops for the sub-executing units about the Procurement
   Guidelines of the World Bank so their work can be more efficient.
