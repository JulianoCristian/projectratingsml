NB. The original loan amount was US$ 8,800,000. It was reduced in the amount of US$ 2,160,000 as of
April 14, 2008.

2.      Project implementation has progressed satisfactorily. Financial disbursements
have continued in line with the disbursement schedule and fiduciary arrangements also
continue to be satisfactory. In particular, the audit of 2009 accounts raised no issue, the
financial information report of the project for the first semester of 2010 was satisfactorily
completed on September 1, 2010, and an ex post evaluation of procurement completed on
May 19, 2010 was also satisfactory.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary due to a shift to prioritize activities
involving training on results-based budgeting tools and instruments developed by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) under component 2 (supporting the design and
implementation of tools for enhancement of public expenditure efficiency) of the project
in line with what had been agreed during a supervision mission in February 2010. The
authorities in MEF formally submitted the request for this final reallocation of expense
categories in a letter dated September 15, 2010 ahead of the Project closing on September
30, 2010.
