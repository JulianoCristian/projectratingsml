Strengthen public sector capacity for implementing a sustainablefiscal decentralization and
improve institutionaleffectivenessfor adequate service delivery by subnational governments.

Project description :Ref. PAD B.3.a, TechnicalAnnex 4
Component I. Planning and Monitoring Fiscal and Financial Management of Regional and
Local Govemments The first component will focus on providingthe tools neededto support the
GOP's guidingprinciple of afiscally neutral decentralization process andto manageany possible
deviations from its medium-term goals. The project will start by assisting inthe design and
monitoringof medium-termfiscal indicators for all the regions and a selection of the largest
municipalities (with more than 40,000 inhabitants).

Component 2. Toolsfor Enhancement of Public Expenditure EfJiciency. This component will
support the goal of gradually constructing the basis for programmatic and multiannual budgeting,
result indicators and result-informed fiscal budget and financial medium-term indicators. In
particular, this component supports the design and implementation of three types of incentives
and/or new mechanisms for enhancing public expenditure efficiency with special pilot
applications at the regional and local levels.       The first type consists of an initial set of
(institutional) performance management indicators for projects and activities. The second
incentive set will enhance public expenditure quality through the rationalization and
improvement of the existing Management Results Agreements.

Component 3. Strengthening Strategic Planning for Public Investment and Public Assets
Management. The third component builds on existing systems and processes for public
investment planning and public assets management and aims to upgrade them to meet the
demands that decentralization has triggered. It will also contribute to the consolidation and
institutionalization of a permanent support capability of the National Public Investment System
(SNIP) and National Assets Superintendency (SBN), and ensure long-term linkages with
regional and local governments.

Component 4. Empowering and Expanding the Integrated Financial Management System.
Component four will support government efforts to expand the coverage of its financial
management system and upgrade it to provide tools for performance monitoring. Specifically,
this fourth component will be geared to supporting (i)      expeditious adoption of SIAF by local
governments, (ii)  the creation of a SIAF debt module, and (iii) registeringof the national
                                                                   virtual
andregional governments' payroll control system in SIAF.

Component 5. Project Management. The purpose of this component i s twofold. First, it will
support project implementation, monitoring and evaluation. In addition, this component will
provide assistance in the area of communication strategy. The objective is to help create greater
support for reforms and enhancethe sustainability of the project. It aims at strengthening the key
institutions involved in the decentralization process, harmonize their points of view and improve
inter-institutional coordination. In particular, the project will (i)assist in the preparation of a
diagnostic assessment of the current status quo and future vision developed for each of the
project components through workshops and studies; (ii)support the preparation of a
communication strategy to raise support for reforms and address resistance.

A. Strategic Contextand Rationale

1. Country and Sector Issues

1.      ECONOMIC   BACKGROUND. has made significant progress since the early nineties in
                                   Peru
reforming its economy and has successfully avoided contagion from major financial crisis inthe
region. The economy's resilience can be attributed to sound fundamentals, including steady
positive growth, high official international reserves, a well capitalized banking system, low
inflation and a stable exchange rate, bolstered by a rising trade surplus and a declining current
account deficit. Public finances have also improved, supportedby the fiscal consolidation effort
begun in 2001 under the transitional and new administration.
2.      After a slowdown in 1998-2001, growth quickened to 4.9 percent in 2002, a year of deep
recession for some countries inLatin America. The economy remained strong in2003 and the 4
percent GDP growth target set by the government was attained. Growth was mainly driven by
strong export performance and, buoyed by rising prices for Peru's main exports, gold and
copper, the trade surplus reached a record US$731 million in 2003. As a result, the current
account deficit narrowed to an estimated 1.7 percent of GDP.
3.      The economic program, supported by an IMF 2002-03 Stand-by arrangement, has been
consistently on track and international markets have reacted favorably to Peru's economic
stability. Citing favorable a economic performance, with solid growth and low inflation, the
IMFhas approved anew Stand-by-agreementfor 2004 to mid2006. Peruhas not withdrawn any
IMF funds under the previous agreement and is not expected to do so under the new one.
Inflationwas kept low during 2003, and endedthe year at 2.5 percent, well inline with the target
established by the Central Bank.       Similarly, low interest rates led to rapid growth in
consumption. Investment has gradually recovered, but at 18.5 percent of GDP is still far below
1997 levels. Private investment made a strong come-back in 2003, but it has not been broad-
based; indeed, it has mainly focused on one hydrocarbon project.          While macroeconomic
stability has largely been maintained, unemployment has proved intractable. The 4 percent
growth of 2003 was accompaniedby only a 1.7 percent increase inemployment.
4.      Economic growth and tax reforms helped the fiscal deficit to narrow moderately to 1.8
percent of GDPin 2003. Gradual tax reform aims to increaserevenuecollection by widening the
tax base and granting the tax collection agency strengthenedpowers to reduce tax evasion and
introduce some tax rate increases. The reform efforts have led to an improved tax ratio: tax
revenue collection of the central government rose to 12.9 percent of GDP in 2003 from 12.1
percent in 2002. As a result, a small primary surplus was achieved in 2003 for the first time
since 1998.
5.      THEDECENTRALIZATION      PROCESS.The economy i s stable and recovering (from both an
economic slowdown and political turmoil), however, the Government's reform agenda continues
to face some major challenges. Peru has been undergoing rapid reforms for the past two and a
half years. In2002, the Toledo government embarked on a process of decentralization of public
functions and resources to regional and municipal governments as part of a broader reform
program geared to democratization andmodernization of the State.
6.      Until2002, Peru was one of the most centralized countries in Latin America, with more
than 97 percent of the tax revenues collected by the national government. Consequently,



                                                1

regional and local expenditures were heavily dependent on transfers from the national
government. Up to 2002, regional authorities were appointed by the national government, and
only local authorities were elected. Understandably, one of the most deeply felt demands of the
Peruvian population has been to reduce the concentration of power by decentralizing public
functions and resources to lower levels o f government. Toledo's administration has responded to
this demand by undertaking a significant number of reforms, including an amendment of the
Constitution to allow for elected regional governments. Those elections took place in late 2002.
7.      Decentralization affords considerable opportunities for better governance. Inprinciple, it
could improve the local provision of public goods, tailored to local preferences. Moreover,
combined with more efficient taxation and spending, decentralization should bring greater
prosperity to the new regions. However, decentralization also involves risks, such as disruption
of services, fragmentation o f public interventions, uneven distribution of public resources,
disparities in access to public services, and potential over-indebtedness. Peru has been able to
tap the experience of other countries that adopted devolution much earlier. Building on that
experience, it has adopted a program based on three principles:

              1.    Decentralization should be fiscally neutral, meaning that the decentralization
                    process should not create an additional fiscal burden on the public sector,
                    thanks to a pari passu reduction in national government expenditures as
                    responsibilities and resources are transferred to sub-national entities,
                    combined with ceilings on borrowingby regional or local government.
             ..
             11.    Decentralization should be gradual, with transfers of resources and
                    responsibilities taking place b y phases and restrictedto those entities that have
                    demonstrated effective capabilities.
             ...
             111.   Decentralization should enhance economic competitiveness by encouraging
                    local and regional governments            to facilitate and undertake needed
                    investments and mobilize private sector resources.
8.      Peru has already taken important steps with the first generation of reforms for
decentralization (see Box l),    particularly in relation to financial and control measures. So far
special care has been taken to ensure that decentralization i s properly sequenced and phased.
Initial government attention focused on guaranteeing fiscal neutrality and fiscal sustainability.
Once the basic fiscal framework had been worked out, the government moved to safeguard its
implementation by strengthening subnational planning, monitoring and evaluation of fiscal and
financial performance. At the same time, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has
begun to reinforce the principle of gradualism and the proposed certification mechanism with a
number of tools geared to stimulate, monitor and evaluate efficiency in subnational expenditure.
Furthermore, the government i s beginning to take actions towards creation of a favorable
business climate at the regional and local levels
9.       Decentralization has so far not created additional fiscal pressure and all fiscal targets
have been met. The legal framework for decentralization i s advancing, albeit at a slower pace
than planned. Despite progress, a large reform agenda consisting of key programmatic transfers,
the design of a medium-term fiscal planning framework, and monitoring and evaluation systems
for regional and local government investment, borrowing and program spending have yet to be
 implemented.

Box 1. Peru: LegalFramework for Decentralization: Progressand Challenges
The legal framework on decentralization is already largely in place. It includes:
(i) constitutional amendment andaDecentralization FrameworkLaw (passedin2002), whichestablish the
   A
guiding principles o f the decentralization processand provide legal support for regional elections.

(ii) organic laws oftheregionalgovernments andmunicipalities, whichdefinethebroadresponsibilitiesof
    The
these subnational governments.
(iii) lawonparticipatorybudgeting,supplementedbythe by-lawsandotherregulationsenactedbytheBudget
     The
Directorate, to provide a framework for consultations wuth civil society in connection with the assignment of new
projects.

(iv) The Fiscal Decentralization Law (LFD), which specifies the mechanisms to be used for transfers to regions and
identifies the taxes to be collected by regions at a later stage of the decentralization process (described below). It
also reinforces the constraints, established in the revamped fiscal responsibility law, on subnational government
borrowing in order to expand expenditure.

(v) The Law on Promotion of Decentralized Investment, which established a framework for fostering private
investment inthe regions.

However, some important legal measuresare still pending in order to complete the framework for intergovernmental
fiscal arrangements. These include three bills currently being discussed in Congress: (i)   the national accreditation
law, which will regulate the minimum capacity standards needed for the subnational entities to qualify for the
transfer of functions and the corresponding resources; (ii)  the law on programmatic transfers, which will regulate
both social and infrastructure transfers, and (iii) a macro-region incentives law (which stipulates the incentives to
merge regions), designed to create conditions, incentives and instruments for the voluntary merger of regional
governments (via referendum) in order to obtain an optimum number of economically viable regions. Finally,
enabling regulations for the fiscal decentralization law and the revamped fiscal responsibility law are expected to be
enactedsoon.


2. Rationalefor Bank Involvement

 10.      The Bank is currently assistingthe Government of Peru inthe design and implementation
of reforms related to decentralization, primarily through two Programmatic Adjustment Loans.
The social reforms within the decentralization process are being supported by the Programmatic
Social Reform Loans (PSRLs), the fourth of which is currently in preparation, while the broader
decentralization process, including fiscal sustainability, institutional reforms and regional
competitiveness, is supported by the Decentralization and Competitiveness Structural
Adjustment Loans (DECSAL), the secondof which is currently inpreparation.
 11.      The World Bank is also financing other complementary loans including the
Accountability for Decentralization in the Social Sectors Technical Assistance Loan (TAL),
which i s currently in preparation), the Trade Facilitation and Productivity Improvement
Technical Assistance Loans, and a Justice Services Improvement Loan.                             The Japan Social
Development Fund (JSDF) grant "Giving Voice to the Poor in Influencing, Planning, and
Evaluating Service Delivery", which complements activities financed by the proposedproject, is
inthe process of implementation. Inaddition, other organizations are financing various aspects
of the decentralization process (see Annex 2). The teams working on decentralization in Peru
have maintained close coordination with donors throughout the identification and preparation of
proposed operations. Furthermore, co-financing of selected decentralization activities has been
 supportedby the UnitedKingdom's Department for International Development (DFID), and the
 second DECSAL could be co-financed by Germany's Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).


                                                           3

The design of this project has involved careful mapping of all these loans and activities in order
to avoid overlaps and seek synergies.
12.      Of particular relevance to the project is the Accountability for Decentralization in the
Social Sectors TAL,currently inpreparation. This project aims to reducethe risk of deterioration
in the targeting and efficiency of social programs throughout the decentralization process,
especially during the transition from centralized to decentralized management, where service
delivery is most at risk. Thus, the project would contribute to ensuring that targeting and
efficiency of social programs, initially, are maintained and, subsequently, show relative
improvement.       In the case of the education and health sectors, which are expected to be
decentralized in 2006, this loan would contribute to a clear decentralization framework, with
each government level being ready to take on its responsibilities and functions, including a
functioning accountability system to monitor this transfer. The specific objectives for the T A L
supporting decentralization in the social sectors are to: (i)          improve the quality of social policies
and programs in the context of decentralization; (ii)            implement the performance agreements and
accreditation systems for social programs to improve service delivery outcomes, and (iii)
improve the M&E system for social programs in a decentralized context. By focusing on
providingthe government with the tools neededto protect social programs during the transitional
period, these efforts, together with the ones proposed by this project, fit in well with the
government's long term decentralization objective.                     The complementarities of the two
decentralization TALs involved are spelled out in Box 2. The Sectoral Loans Coordination Unit
(UCPS) in the MEF will be responsible for overall project implementation of these two loans,
under the guidanceof the Vice Ministerof Economy.

13.     The proposed project will provide critically needed and timely support to the
implementation of the policy and institutional reforms agreed upon under the DECSAL.
Furthermore, this loan will allow the GOP to tap into the Bank's proven expertise in
decentralization. The strong involvement of the Bank in the area of decentralization, together
with its leading role in key areas of the policy dialogue, underlines the contributions that the
Bank can make, both as a knowledge Bank, offering best practices and lessons learned
worldwide, and as a catalyst by leveraging resources from other projects and other donors in
order to help the GOP more effectively to pursue its goal of minimizing the fiscal risks inherent
indecentralization.

3. Higher Level Objectives to Which the Project Contributes

14.     The government strategy, reflected in the 2002 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
outlines three main priorities to reduce poverty: (i) increasing competitiveness and employment
generation; (ii)improving access to health, education andbasic services; and (iii) strengthening a
public administration that serves the people, including decentralization.        Indeed, the CAS
included a Decentralization and Municipal Development TAL to support the decentralization
process. In line with what was envisaged in the CAS, the proposed Project, under a new name
that responds more closely to the needs of the current phase of decentralization and which takes
into account detailed costing, supports the original objectives of (i)   ensuring an orderly fiscal
decentralization, (ii) strengthening institutional capacity at all levels of government, including
municipalities; and (iii)improving the quality and efficiency of public services delivery.
 15.    The success of the decentralization process will, to a large extent, be measured by a
fiscally sound increased level of development and economic activity in the regions, along with
higher employment and reduced poverty. These benefits, inturn, will contribute to the reduction
 of poverty and will address equity imbalances in Peru, particularly in rural areas where the
 impact of decentralization would be felt most strongly.      Thus, by strengthening institutional
 capacity for   sustainable decentralization, the proposed loan contributes to the higher-level
 objectives of alleviating poverty and meeting the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.

 B. ProjectDescription

 1. Lending Instrument

 16.    The proposed lending instrument i s a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL). This instrument
 was selected as the most appropriate instrument to provide fiscal and institutional capacity-
 strengthening for the implementation of fiscal decentralization policies agreed upon under the
 DECSAL. A Specific Investment Loan was discarded, because of the strong focus on capacity-
 strengthening and institution-building in this project. A Learning and Innovation Loan was also
 considered, but it would not have allowed a broader focus and the total amount o f financing
 requested.
  17.    The Government selected a fixed spread loan as the financial instrument.

2. Project Development Objective and Key Indicators

18.     PROJECT    DEVELOPMENT      OBJECTIVE.  Peru has been gradually maturing its vision of a
decentralized state. However, from the start, that is to say as soon as the congressional
(political) decision to decentralize was taken, the government introduced three key guiding
principles geared to ensuring fiscal sustainability, protecting service quality, and enhancing
competitiveness at the regional level. This project supports progress toward fulfillment of those
three principles, at the strategic pace and sequential order that Peru has chosen for its path
towards the decentralized state (see Box 3). Inparticular, the project (i)reinforces the fiscal and
financial planning, accounting, budgeting, reporting and overall management capacity of
subnational governments.        At the same time, it strengthens the capacity of the national
government to monitor and evaluate fiscal and financial performance in accordance with the
ceilings and targets already established in legislation; (ii)   supports the initial steps towards
incentives for and evaluation of quality of expenditure at subnational levels, and (iii)  provides
technical assistanceto reduce transaction costs, enhance operational efficiency and mobilize idle
resourcesat subnational levels.
19.      Most components and subcomponents of this project are expected to have a direct or
indirect impact on each one of the three guiding principles of Peru's decentralization (see Box 3)
Still, it i s possible to associate each main component or subcomponent with the principle it i s
expected to have the most influence on. The proposed project would seek to build on progress
made to date under the ongoing decentralization process and public sector modernization
program, currently supported by the programmatic DECSAL. While the main beneficiary i s the
MEF, as it has been identified as the counterpart, the loan will support activities that provide
regional and local governments with tools and institutional settings for a more efficient and
transparent management of their finances.
20.      The loan will support government actions in four main areas. As regards safeguarding
fiscal sustainability and ensuring aggregate discipline, it will strengthen (i)        the national
government's capacity vis-&-vis fiscal policy formulation, implementation and monitoring
capacities, and (ii)   strengthen regional and local government's capacity for fiscal and financial
planning. Secondly, it will contribute to enhancing the quality of public expenditure by (i)
assisting in the design of an initial set of institutional performance management indicators for
projects and activities; (ii)   evaluating and improving the existing results-based management
agreements to bring them into line with the newly decentralized system. Third, it will enhance
 strategic planning for public investment and public asset management by consolidating and
expanding the existing systems at all levels of government. Fourth, it will support Peru's public
 sector modernization efforts by empowering and expanding the existing Integrated Financial
Management System (SIAF).             In particular, this loan will provide regional and local
 governments with the necessary tools for planning, monitoring and evaluating sustainable
 finances. Finally, this technical assistance will finance the design and implementation of a
 communication strategy, which will be part of the project's management component. The
 purpose is to assist the government in the process of planning, designing, and implementing the
 reforms neededfor decentralization.

                                     It is expected that by the end                                regional and local
 governments will be equipped to produce fiscal multi-year management reports, which will be
 published, along with quarterly performance management reports (including indicators)' ;

standard quality investment projects; and improved asset management (besides the technical
ability to produce these indicators and tools, the main economic targets established by regional
and local governments must be fully consistent with the national macro targets, as specified in
the Macroeconomic Multiannual Framework), (ii)national government will be regularly
receiving the necessary information and producing analytical inputs for decision makers
regarding fiscal and financial management, investment projects andperformance managementby
regional and localgovernments.

3. Project components

22.      This section provides a summary description of Project Components.                       A detailed
description can be found inAnnex 4.
Project Component1. Planningand Monitoring Fiscaland Financial Managementof
Regionaland LocalGovernments(US$1,744,000)
23.      The first component will focus on providing the tools needed to support the GOP's
guiding principle of a fiscally neutral decentralization process and to manage any possible
deviations from its medium-term goals. The project will start by assisting in the design and
monitoring of medium-term fiscal indicators for all the regions and a selection of the largest
 municipalities (with more than 40,000 inhabitants). These indicators should be adequately
 monitored and controlled in the SIAF, and aligned with budget ceilings, debt ratios, committed
 transfers and regularly adjusted revenue projections and cash availability. They should also be
 communicated through participatory exercises. These indicators will provide key informationto
 the Central Government and civil society for monitoring regional and local public debt on a
 medium-term basis (including floating and contingency debt) and help to ensure that regional
 and local medium-term fiscal and debt policies are in line with limits established in the LFRT
 and the projections contained inthe consolidated Multiannual Macroeconomic Framework.. The
 following two subcomponents are to be supportedby the operation:
 24.      The first subcomponent will strengthen fiscal discipline at regional and local level. It
 will focus on consolidating the existing medium-term planning frameworks and extending them
 to the regional and local governments and support accounting, budgeting, reporting, and fiscal
 accounts disclosure procedures. Regional and local governments will be equipped with standard
 tools to perform strategic planning, accounting, budgeting, and reporting. This in turn, will
 enable the Central Government to better evaluate and monitor regional and local governments'
 compliance with the rules dictated by the LRTFand LDF.2 This component aims to support the
 introduction of basic financial management tools (revenue collection, accounting, budgeting) so
  as to produce data and monitor fiscal performance in accordance with the new legal fiscal
  decentralization framework.
  25.     The second subcomponent will focus on preparing prudential and legal safeguards for
  public debt and building capacity for reporting and monitoring local and regional debt, arising



  2. The LRTFestablishescertain steps to be taken in the event of non-compliance with borrowing and fiscal rules,
    ranging from stopping transfers to the taking over of subnational government functions by the central
    government. The LFD establishes the following fiscal ceilings for subnational governments: non-financial
    expenditure increase, less than 3 percent; debt stocklcurrent revenue ratio, less than 100 percent; and debt
     servicelcurrent revenue ratio, less than 25 percent.



                                                          8

out of credit contracts (direct credit for procurement contracts, et^).^                   Activities under this
component will help complete the existing regulatory framework for public sectorborrowing and
complement it with a framework for adequate debt management, reporting, recording and
indebtednesscapacity evaluation. Although the LFRT and the LDF already contain ceilings,
targets, and sanctions related to regional and local debt, additional norms are required regarding
specific indicators to observe as well as management, reporting, registration and debt
sustainability analysis. Therefore, the design of a new debt module by SIAF will be an essential
tool for managing and monitoring subnational debt (an activity to be covered under component
4).
Project Component 2. Tools for Enhancement of Public Expenditure Efficiency
(US$712,000)
26.      The second component will support the government's move toward greater performance
orientation. It will support the goal of gradually constructing the basis for programmatic and
multiannual budgeting, result indicators and result-informed fiscal budget and financial medium-
term indicators. The design of adequate indicators is essential for a medium-term expenditure
framework. Inparticular, this component supports the design and implementation of three types
of incentives andor new mechanisms for enhancing public expenditure efficiency with special
pilot applications at the regional and local levels. The first type consists of an initial set of
(institutional) performance management indicators for projects and activities. This set will be
supplemented in later years by other sector performance indicators until the country develops
indicators and databases that cover a substantialpart of the administration. The second incentive
 set will enhance public expenditure quality through the rationalization and improvement of the
existing Management Results Agreements (including Convenios de Administracidn por
Resultados, CARS,or performance contractswith local governments).
 27.     The third incentive set seeks to enhance public expenditure quality through participatory
 budgeting. Strengthening and consolidation of participatory policies are objectives of the
 national government.            The National Budget Directorate has published regulations for
 implementing the          Participatory Budget Law, which establish guidelines for civil society
 participation in the decision making process of subnational governments. Despite the efforts of
 the national government, the participatory budgetingprocess has run into some snags related to
 insufficient familiarity with and comprehension of such a process (its purposes, mechanisms,
 methodologies, etc). For the process to work, training and dissemination activities focusing on
 subnational governments and civil society will have to be boosted. The loan will support this
 development and dissemination of participatory budgeting planning.




 3. This subcomponent will not cover, at this stage, all contingent (pension and other labor benefits, judicial), indirect
    (central, regional or local government) guarantees of debt payment by autonomous or semi-autonomous (regional
    or local agencies), or old arrears. These types of local and regional debt will be broadly identified through the
    medium-term fiscal and financial planning supported by the first subcomponent described above. Besides, the
    government expects to take supplementary action regarding the current stock of debt of already over-indebted
    municipalities. Those supplementary actions should further strengthen government capacity to identify, report
    and monitor all sorts of government debt at regional and local levels.

Project Component 3. Strengthening Strategic Planningfor Public Investment and Public
AssetsManagement(US$2,360,000)
28.     The third component builds on existing systems and processes for public investment
planning and public assets management and aims to upgrade them to meet the demands that
decentralization has triggered. It will also contribute to the consolidation and institutionalization
of a permanent support capability of the NationalPublic Investment System (SNIP) and National
Assets Superintendency (SBN), and ensure long-term linkages with regional and local
governments. The first subcomponent will support the strengthening and expansion of the
government's ability to manage its public investment program. Peru already has a well tested
system for national investment planning and ex-ante evaluation. The MEFthe SNIP has trained
personnelfor the investment offices of sector ministries (OPIs). The decentralization processhas
created a demand to extend the current investment system (supplementedby a strategic planning
system) to the regional government level. Since the legal and regulatory framework already
exists, the next step toward the proposed extension of the system i s t training investment units at
the newly created regional level. Consequently, a regional investment culture will be created in
the medium term. Aiming to support gradual development of monitoring and evaluation of
investment and overall spending at regional and local levels, this component will achieve greater
integration between the budget and SNIP.
29.     The second subcomponent will provide capacity building for public assets management
by regional governments. Peru had already startedthe process of strengthening its national level
institutions for asset managementwhen decentralization began. Since then, decentralization has
raised the number of governments and agencies involved in assets management to nearly 1,700,
compounding an already complex challenge. In particular, this loan will assist in creating
responsible units for asset management within regional governments; train regional staff in the
legal and regulatory framework; strengthen the capacity of the National Assets Superintendency
(SBN) for monitoring and supervising regional governments; and establish a link under the
forthcoming accreditation law with a "graduation"                  or "certification"     system for asset
management at regional levels. It will also support a pilot implementation of a monitoring and
management systemfor public asset management.
Project Component4. Empoweringand Expandingthe Integrated Financial Management
System (US$3,288,000)
30.      Component four will support government efforts to expand the coverage of its financial
management system and upgrade it to provide tools for performance monitoring. Specifically,
this fourth component will be geared to supporting (i)            expeditious adoption of SIAF by local
 governments, (ii)    the creation of a SIAF debt module: and (iii) registering of the national
                                                                           virtual
 and regional governments' payroll control systemin SIAF.
 31.     Peru has developed a high-performing integrated financial management system. SIAF
 already covers all national government and most decentralized entities, and was institutionalized
 through the recently approved Public Sector Financial Management Law, which formally
 integrated it into the organizational structure of the MEF. In terms of technical expertise and
 effective use of integrated financial management at regional and local government levels, Peru is
 probably one of the most advanced countries in the region. With the help of international

cooperation over the past ten years, the country has invested substantial resources in developing
an Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) at the national level, and then extending it
to regional and local levels. The SIAF ensures uniform accounting, budgeting and reporting
standards, and on-line monitoring of contracts and disbursements. The SIAF i s also a key
ingredient for transparency inexpenditure; governmental and citizens' monitoringand evaluation
of regional and local public finances; and participatory budgeting and execution of investment
programs. The strength and broad functionality of the SIAF also supports the expansion of the
use of information and communication technologies at the national and decentralized levels of
government to enhance efficiency gains.
32.    This component will finance horizontal and vertical reforms of the SIAF by supporting
new applications (e.g. subnational debt) and new users (e.g. local governments) as part of on-
going government efforts to reform decentralized public finances as well as information and
communication technologies.        The first subcomponent of Component 4 will support the
expeditious adoption of SIAF by local governments. It will support the extension of local
government (SIAF-GL) coverage to 1,026, out of 1,829 local governments. The installation will
include revenue collection, budget formulation and expenditure accounting modules. SIAF
should also deliver budget execution data and budget reports within the fiscal year, along with
quarterly disbursement plans. The second subcomponent will upgrade the fiscal cadaster by
developing a new SIAF module for regional and localdebt that will include contract registration,
reporting and debt classification. It will also provide technical assistance for training all levels of
government staff in the use of the debt modulehystem; and it will assist in the setting up of a
permanentsupport office to handleemergencySIAF-related questions (hotline).
33.    Supported by a module in SIAF, this project will also design a payroll control system in
the public sector SIAF (SIAF-SP), broken down into national and regional governments. This
involves two main activities to be financed by this project: (i)       creation of a central public
servants database, consolidating information from the MEF, SUNAT, Banco de la Nacibn, and
subnational governments, and allowing SIAF executing units to verify and validate the hiringor
dismissal of public employees; and (ii)   design and implementation of a direct deposit electronic
payment system (Abono en Cuenta)for public servants.

Project Component 5. Project Management (US$608,000)

34.    The purpose of this component is twofold. First, it will support project implementation,
monitoring and evaluation. The sectoral loans coordination unit (Unidad de Coordinaci6n de
Prtstamos Sectoriales-UCPS)         in the MEF will operate according to the structure and
management procedures agreed upon with the Bank. A capacity assessment was carried out to
evaluate procurement and financial management procedures under the responsibility of the
UCPS, and they were deemed satisfactory. The UCPS will be responsible for coordinating and
monitoringthe yearly Operations Plan, financial managementof the project, and procuring goods
andservices. Performanceaudits will be carried out to ensurethe quality of project management.
35.     Inaddition, this component will provide assistanceinthe areaof communication strategy.
The objective is to help create greater support for reforms and enhance the sustainability of the
project. It aims at strengthening the key institutions involved in the decentralization process,
harmonize their points of view and improve inter-institutional coordination. In particular, the
project will (i) assist in the preparation of a diagnostic assessment of the current status quo and



                                                  11

future vision developed for each of the project components through workshops and studies; (ii)
support the preparation of a communication strategy to raise support for reforms and address
resistance. The component will consist of two phases. During the first phase activities will
focus on building consensus about the decentralization guidelines among the main institutions of
the National Government (PCM, CND, and MEF). These guidelines will be communicated to
other stakeholders (regional and local governments, civil society, Congress, inter alia) duringthe
secondphase.
4, Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design
36.      The Bank's long experience with programmatic adjustment loans shows that, in addition
to the political commitment to go ahead with the reforms, technical support is also needed in
some critical areas to maximize implementation of the agreements under the adjustment loans.
In particular, the agreements reached on fiscal sustainability, especially subnational debt,
budgeting and reporting, as well as public investment need substantial investment in reforms of
the SIAF and SNIP, if goals are to be met. Such fiscal and institutional reforms need to be
complemented by financial investments for structural changes as well as capacity-strengthening
at different levels of governments, starting with the national government, in order to effectively
implement and monitor the commitment assumed under the LTRF and the LDF to support
subnational governments' efforts to achieve adequate subnational budgeting, reporting and
public investment inline with the consolidated multiannual macroeconomic framework (MMM).
37.      International experience in decentralization also indicates that fiscal decentralization will
fail unless it i s accompanied by the institutional reforms needed to support the fiscal design.
This requires investing in strengtheninginstitutional capacity at both the national and subnational
levels of government to ensure that the fiscal decentralization framework is complemented by
adequate technical, financial and human resources. In the case of Peru, this makes investments
in supporting civil service reform, public investment and accreditation key elements for
 successfulfiscal decentralization.
 38.      Another key lesson i s the importance of monitoring and evaluation of fiscal policy at
 different levels of government. In particular, fiscal transfers to subnational governments and
 subnational debt, particularly floating and contingent debt, need to be monitored closely to avoid
 fiscal risks and inefficiencies resulting from the lack of tight budget constraints. While the legal
 framework in Peru has helped establish certain controls with respect to the intergovernmental
 fiscal system, the capacity to implement andmonitor these controls needs to be strengthened.
 39.      International experience shows that participation by stakeholders and civil society i s
 critical in order to ensure the sustainability of the decentralization process. Consultation with
 other actors at national and subnational government level institutions will be a key factor in
 enhancing a shared vision and effective coordination. Likewise, participation by civil society
 will play a key part in helpingto create and sustain demand for reforms, promote greater support
 for reforms and monitor reform progress.

 5. Alternatives Considered and Reasonsfor Rejection

 40.      During project preparation, several options were considered but rejected. Initially, a
 Project Concept Note covering technical assistanceto support the two programmatic adjustment
 loans (PSRL and DECSAL) was discussed. After consulting lengthily within the Bank and with



                                                   12

the GOP, it was concluded that such a project design led to a wide range of activities under an
objective that lacked focus and clarity, andthus was difficult to measure. In addition, the UCPS
Coordination Unit at the MEFhad expressedits strong preference for having the two projects as
the implementation of the two programmatic loans is carried out by different government
institutions. Second, a technical assistance loan to the main areas of the DECSAL would have
provided support for implementation of all the decentralization, institutional and competitiveness
reforms agreed to under this set of loans, but would have duplicated large parts of the support
already providedunder the Competitiveness Loan. Third, a loan focusing on subnational debt or
subnational adjustment was consideredbut rejected, because, to ensure the fiscal sustainability of
the decentralization process, other fiscal and institutionalreforms at the national and subnational
levels were considered necessary to lay the foundation for subsequent targeted adjustment
interventions at the subnationallevel.

C. Implementation

1. Institutionaland Implementation Arrangements

41.      OVERALLPROJECTCOORDINATION.          The Sectoral Loans Coordination Unit (UCPS) in
the Ministry of Economy and Finance will be responsible for overall project implementation,
under the guidance of the Vice Ministry of Economy. The UCPS will be responsible for
coordinating with beneficiary areas within the MEF as well with National Assets
Superintendency. Each component will be responsible for their technical aspects and will
designate coordinators to work directly with the UCPS. A special coordination committee will
not be necessary because the Government already has coordination mechanismsthat can be used
to solve any project issues.
42.      The UCPS has been the Bank's main counterpart throughout the DECSAL and other
Bank loans. Upon project approval, this unit would act as the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
for the loan. The UCPS will be the day-to-day counterpart to the Bank and will be responsible
for financial management, procurement and contracting procedures, and ensuring compliance
with Bank standards.
43.      The UCPS will designate a Coordinator who will be responsible for overall technical
coordination of the project. The UCPS will prepare and monitor the annual operations plan and
 adjust it as necessary; prepare and /or assist partners in the preparation of terms of reference
 (TOR); maintain a project monitoring system to assess progress; and prepare implementation
reports. The UCPS will also be responsible for coordination with implementation partners to
ensure timely execution of activities and the inclusion of various stakeholders linked to the
project.

 2. Monitoring and Evaluation of OutcomesLResults

 44.     To maximize project impact, monitoring and evaluation will play a key part in project
 management. The MEF (through the UCPS) will be responsible for project monitoring and
 evaluation. Entities responsible for each component will report twice a year to the UCPS about
 project indicators, informationwhich will be usedto prepare the bi-annual FRMs. A monitoring
 system will be inplace at the UCPS to follow-up on results indicators for each component. The
 DGAES will include monitoring results in the project's yearly reports and ensure that M&E



                                                 13

findings will be used to feed into project implementation. The reports will include information
resultingfrom coordinating meetings amongMEF, CND andPCMregarding the decentralization
program. Project evaluation will be carried out through an independent audit during the last
semester of each year.
3. Sustainability
45.    FINANCIAL.The project's financial sustainability is ensuredby the fact that project costs
will be more than offset by improved managerial capacity reflected in fiscal savings and
efficiency gains. The fiscal savings would result from improved fiscal planning; budget and
public investment management; effective debt monitoring; increase transparency in public
spending flows; and fewer inefficiencies caused by duplication of responsibilities and transfers
resulting from unclear responsibilities at different levels of government.
46.     INSTITUTIONAL oftheprojectwillbe
                        SUSTAINABILITY.     The institutional sustainability
supported by the ample legal and institutional decentralization framework that has been created
over the past three years.    The ambitious decentralization agenda launched by the current
administration has advanced quite rapidly thanks to a comprehensive legal framework that
establishes the rules and responsibilities for decentralization, including strong controls for fiscal
decentralization. New institutions such as the NationalDecentralization Council (CND) and new
subnational (regional) governments and institutions, such as Coordination Councils, have been
created. This legal and institutional drive for decentralization is accompanied by strong demand
for decentralization throughout the population, which sees decentralization as the most important
policy achievement of the administration.        The involvement of different actors, including
consultations with CND, the Prime Minister's Office (PCM), line ministries, the Presidency, the
Agencia Peruana de Cooperucidn Internacional (APCI), subnational governments, and civil
society, in project preparation and implementation has contributed to vertical and horizontal
coordination, which will result inenhancedinstitutional sustainability.
47.     SOCIAL.    Social sustainability in the implementation of the project will be achieved
through a participatory approach that cuts across all its components. Project preparation has
benefited from consultations with civil society, based on the close dialogue established during
the DECSAL, which has helpedshape project design. This participatory approach will enhance
ownership of the project by all involved stakeholders, including civil society organizations, and
thereby contribute to its sustainability. Social sustainability will also be reinforced by support
for participatory budgetingas a strong entry point and demonstrations of the participatory nature
of the project.
48.     Finally, the design and implementation of a communication strategy for all components,
will be a key strategy for achieving sustainability of the project in all its aspects. It will help
lower resistance and ensure support for proposed reforms by building a shared vision, engaging
stakeholders, managing and reducing risks and institutionalizingdemand for reforms.

o Other (specify)

49.      The economic and financial impact has been broadly analyzed and it will be mainly
reflected in effectiveness gains. The financial impact can be measuredby improved managerial
capacity reflected in fiscal savings and efficiency gains. These will result from (i)    widespread
implementation of an upgraded and timely financial management system-SIAF-by
subnational governments, which will permit better budget allocation decisions and more
effective monitoring, control and auditing of financial flows; (ii)    sounder fiscal management,
resulting inreducedfiscal vulnerability; (iii)  strengthenedstrategic planning and inter-ministerial
policy design capabilities; and (vi) closer scrutiny of public performance from civil society
groups resulting ina more transparent and results-oriented managementof public resources.
50.       The project's financial impact has also been analyzed and considered sustainable. It i s
estimated that the project costs will be more than offset by improved managerial capacity,
reflected in fiscal savings and efficiency gains. A well functioning monitoring and evaluation
system will allow greater accountability of government agencies. A broad assessment of the
efficiency and social gains is attachedinAnnex 9.
51.       FISCALIMPACT.    See Annex 9.
52.       PROJECT   COSTS.   Total project costs are estimated at US$11 million, of which US$8.8
million would be financed by the Bank and US$2.2 million would be financed by the
Government.
 53.      PROJECTBENEFITS.The project will have a complete fiscal impact over time. However,
 it i s expectedthat: (i)sufficient fiscal information will be submitted by subnational governments
 for monitoring and control purposes and to enable decisions to be taken regarding public
 finances, and (ii)   management capacities at subnational levels will be developed, resulting in
 improved administration of public resources. Achievement of these two objectives will lead to a
 more efficient, effective, and transparent public sector and facilitate control over the public debt
 and payroll. They will also encourage ethical behavior, reflected in lower prices of procured
 goods and greater commitment to public service. The public policy reforms supported by the

project will promote social investment and key priority public programs at all levels of
government.

2. Technical

54.     The project is based on international best practices and lessons learned in the course of
supporting the design and implementation of policies to strengthen institutional capacity for
fiscal decentralization. In particular, the project benefits from experiences in Argentina, Brazil,
Central America, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, where similar projects have been carried out.
Specific projects, such as the Guatemalan SIAF 111, will play a key part in bringinginternational
best practice to particular project components.
55.     The project also benefits from substantial analytical work-undertaken                during
preparation of the DECSAG-on issues to be addressed in this project.               As part of the
preparation of this project, several notes regarding subnational fiscal policy, public investment,
accreditation, civil service and participatory budgeting have been drafted.          A number of
workshops have also been held, including a workshop on fiscal decentralization with Bank and
IDB staff, a workshop with the CND on decentralization goals, and a workshop on participatory
budgeting. There have also been consultations with civil society and subnational governments.
Other project preparation workshops on subnational debt and expenditure evaluation are still
pending.
56.     The counterpart's project team has previously demonstrated its expertise with respect to
the design and implementation of Bank projects.            Appointment of coordinators for each
component of the project and partnership arrangements are built into the project design, to ensure
that there i s an appropriate division of responsibilities, regional and local participation, and a
 steady transfer of knowledge.

 performed in order to evaluate the proposed financial management arrangements and the
 implementing entity's capacity to provide the Bank with accurate and timely information
 regarding resources and expenditures. The assessment (performed jointly with the Procurement
 Capacity Assessment) was conducted in accordance with OP/BP 10.02 and the Guidelines for
 Assessment of Financial Management Arrangements in World Bank Financed Projects and the
 key findings are included in Annex 7 of this report. The UCPS has maintained a satisfactory
 record during implementation of the Accountability for Decentralization in the Social Sectors
 project preparation fund (PPF) and overall, the proposed project financial management
 arrangements are satisfactory to the Bank. A financial management risk o f Medium (composite
 of inherent and control risks) has been assigned, in order to reflect the following strengths and
 capacity constraints: The UCPS i s adequately staffed with key professional personnel;
  accounting and financial reporting functions will observe national standards; and there are
  adequate arrangements for internal audit, to be performed by staff of the Comptroller General's
  Office. The key constraints include the lack of (i)  an integrated information system to support
  adequate monitoring and control during implementation and (ii)       an Operations Manual with
  procedures that include the Bank's requirements for financial management. As a result of the

to the procurement procedures, the standardbidding documents to be used in each case, as well
as contracts to be awarded on the basis of quotations. Where no relevant standard contracts
exist, other standardforms acceptable to the Bank will be used.
59.      A procurement capacity assessment was carried out for the UCPS aimed at reviewing its
current capacity and assigning a level of risk to its ability to administer procurement functions
and other administrative tasks. Its overall procurement risk level was deemed to be average..
Two procurement supervision missions per year will be carried out, including one special
procurement supervision mission for ex-post review/audit.

4. Social

60.      The project is considered to have a positive social impact. The proposed reforms (e.g.
medium-term budgeting at the subnational level, SIAF and SNIP) will enhance the quality and
transparency of expenditure and at the same time ensure greater accountability, as called for by
civil society and the population as a whole. Support of participatory budgeting will increase
participation and monitoringby civil society. Inparticular, a participatory approach is adopted
 in all the componentsof the project and a dialogue with key national civil society organizations
 has been part of the preparation phase of the project. The project concept was consulted with
 national leaders of the Multistakeholder Roundtables Against Poverty (Mesas de Concertucion
 de Lucha Contra la Pobreza), the National NGO Network (ANC), RED Peru, and Propuestu
 Ciudadana, a national consortium of NGOs which has been monitoring the process of
 decentralization. Their feedback has been incorporated inthe proposal.

 5. Environment

 61.      The project is rated as category "C" as no environmental impacts are expected.

 6. Safeguard policies

 62.      The project does not trigger any of the safeguardpolicies.

 INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR SUSTAINABLE FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION

A. PoliticalContext

1.1     After a decade of the Fujimori regime and a short transitional government, President
Toledo was elected to office amid an economic recession. Beginning its term in July 2001, the
new government received support from the international community at the Madrid Consultative
Group Meeting in October 2001 and signed a two-year Stand-by Agreement with the LMF in
February 2002.
1.2     Though the economy is stable and growing, the government's agenda continues to face
major political challenges. The government lacks a majority in Congress, and there have been
five cabinets in less than three years, including a recent reshuffling of half of the ministers in
February with Carlos Ferrero continuing as Prime Minister and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski returning
as Minister of Economy and Finance.
1.3     A National Agreement ("Acuerdo Nucional") to catalyze consensus between the major
political parties, unions and civil society was signed in July 2002. The National Agreement is a
joint statement adopted in July 2002 by the current government and representativesof the major
political parties, religious groups and civil society.         It contains 29 policies aimed at
accomplishing four objectives: (i)    Democracy and the Rule of Law; (ii) and Social
                                                                                 Equity
Justice; (iii)Competitiveness; (iv) Efficiency, Transparency and Decentralization. After a period
in which the activity and effectiveness of the Acuerdo Nucional as a forum for consensus
building waned, the new Ferrero cabinet has revived it and the main opposition political party,
APRA, has rejoinedthis forum.
 1.4     In seeking support for keeping the reform program on track, the present Prime Minister
put forward a road map (Hoju de Rutu) to highlight the government's policy objectives and
 agenda for the next two years.         This document comprises about 180 new or existing
 governmental programs, including actions, standards and regulations, and projects aligned with
 eight major policies. Those eight policies are: (i)     safeguarding macroeconomic stability and
 increasing national production and employment; (ii)encouraging private investment and
 competitiveness; (iii)encouraging State reform through decentralization, tax reform, and
 enhancement of the quality of public expenditure ;(iv) fighting corruption; (v) supporting Free
 Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations; (vi) overcoming poverty by enhancing the quality of
 public social expenditure, particularly on health, education, employment, housing, and basic
 sanitation; (vi) giving priority to education, agriculture, and public safety; and (viii) reinforcing
 democratic institutions andthe rule of law.
 1.5     These aggressive and comprehensive short-term plans were not well received by the
 public and opposition political parties due mainly to their lack of detail regarding the
 implementation of the programs. Thus far, little progress has been achieved on these new
 actions and projects announced in the Road Map. However, it i s still too early to fully assess
 their effects.

B. EconomicBackground

1.6     Peru has made significant progress since the early 1990s in reforming its economy and it
has successfully avoided contagion from major financial crises in the region. The economy's
resilience can be attributed to sound fundamentals, including high official reserves, a well
capitalized banking system, low inflation and a stable exchange rate, bolstered by a rising trade
surplus and a declining current account deficit. Public finances have also improved, supported
by the fiscal consolidation effort beguninmid-2001 under the new administration.
1.7     After a slowdown in 2001, growth quickened to 4.9 percent in 2002, a year of deep
recessionfor some countries inLatin America. The economy remained strong in 2003 and the 4
percent GDP growth target set by the government will most likely be met. Growth has been led
mainly by mining and construction, the two most dynamic sectors. On the demand side, growth
was driven by exports which rose over 25 percent in 2003. Supported by increasing prices for
gold and copper, Peru's main exports, the trade surplus reached a record US$644 million in
2003. As a result, the current account deficit narrowedto an estimated 1.9 percent of GDP.
1.8     The economic program, supported by an IMF Stand-by arrangement, has been
consistently on track and international markets have reacted favorably to Peru's economic
stability. Inflation was kept low during 2003 and ended the year at 2.5 percent, well in line with
the target set by the Central Bank.       Similarly, low interest rates led to rapid growth in
consumption. Investment has gradually recovered, but at 17 percent of GDP is still far below
1997 levels. Private investment made a strong come-back in 2003, but it has not been broad-
based; indeed, it has mainly focused on miningandhydrocarbons.
1.9     Sustained economic growth and fiscal consolidation helped the fiscal deficit to narrow
moderately to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2003. The improvement of fiscal balances in 2003 was
based on two pillars: tax reform and austere fiscal policies. The gradual tax reform aims to
increase revenue collection by widening the tax base and granting the tax collection agency
strengthenedpowers to reducetax evasion. The reformefforts have led to an improvedtax ratio:
tax revenue collection rose to 12.9 percent of GDP in 2003 from 12.1 percent in 2002. As a
result, a small fiscal surplus was achieved in2003 for the first time since 1998.
 1.10    Despite all these achievements, the Peruvian economy i s exposedto some vulnerabilities.
Key vulnerabilities are the still high level of dollarization in the banking system, a moderate to
high public debt to GDP ratio (47 percent), and an unstable political environment. In addition,
the sustained growth experienced over the past two years has not yet translated into lower
 unemployment. Despite annual growth of 4 percent and macroeconomic stability, the estimated
job loss for 2003 was as highas 40,000.
 1.11 Prospectsfor the coming years are good, assuming a favorable external environment and
 the continuation of sound economic policies. The expansion of the Camisea natural gas natural
 project planned for 2004 should support investment, along with the potential free trade
 arrangement with the United States that would make permanent the existing preferential access
 through the ATPDEA benefits permanent. The pace of economic growth will most likely
 continue in 2004, with GDP growth again projected at 4 percent. The rapid expansion of exports
 will continue in 2004 as a result of the improving prospects for world growth and rising prices
 for gold and copper.

1.12    Intandem with arapidrecovery after the slowdown of 2001, Peruhasbeen going through
rapid reforms over the past two and a half years. In2002, the Toledo government embarked on a
gradual process of decentralization of public functions and resources to regional and municipal
governments and a number of reforms are now underway. The guiding principles of this
process of decentralization can be summarized under three headings: fiscal neutrality,
gradualism, and a focus on competitiveness enhancement. In this respect, Peru faces a dual
challenge of pursuing a fiscally neutral decentralization program while ensuring that adequate
social provisions for the poor are in place. While Peru should continue to promote private
participation in productive and infrastructure sectors, the government still has a critical role to
play inachieving its long-termpoverty reduction.

C. The Decentralization Process

1.13    Since 2002, Peru has embarked upon an ambitious process of decentralization, as part of
a broader reform agenda on democratization and modernization of the State. Important steps
have already beentaken, and a sound economic and legal framework hasbeenestablished, laying
out the broad fiscal rules, functional assignments, and a calendar for sequenced sectoral
decentralization.   The Decentralization Framework Law sets out the principles for: (i)         the
assignment of services and competencies (shared, exclusive and delegated) to different levels of
government; (ii)  the development of fiscal rules and transfer mechanisms; (iii) sequencingof
                                                                                  the
decentralization, starting with anti-poverty programs, to be followed by other sectoral transfers.
Implementation of the institutional framework for decentralization has also advanced
substantially, with the creation of the National Decentralization Council to coordinate the
decentralization process and the setting-up of regional and local government institutions,
including the consultative bodies with civil society representation. Other key decentralization
laws have also been passed, including one for regional governments and another for municipal
governments, broadly defining their institutions, roles and resources.
1.14     Peru's vision of decentralization i s unique in the region as it focuses on three guiding
principles: (i) neutrality, (ii)
                fiscal                 gradualism, and (iii)enhancement of national and regional
competitiveness. Building on lessons learned from earlier regional experiences where ill-
designedfiscal decentralization attempts led to macroeconomic instability, Peru's focus on fiscal
neutrality aims at ensuringthat the process of decentralization does not create an additional fiscal
burden on the public sector.         The principle of gradualism-as       opposed to a big bang
decentralization-implies   that the transfer of resources and responsibilities will be carried out in
a piecemeal fashion based on a predetermined transfer calendar and on conditional proof of
effective managerial capabilities by regional and local governments. Peru has also chosen to
include a focus on competitiveness-unparalleled         when compared to other decentralization
schemes in the region-to    ensure that decentralization will lead to efficiency gains especially at
the regional levelby spurring private sector development. Finally, Peruhas createda remarkably
wide-ranging framework for participatory planning and budgeting, as well as new regional and
local institutions with substantial civil society representation through participation in, and
monitoringof, decentralization.
 1.15    Fiscal decentralization i s currently proceeding in a cautious and fiscally-sound manner,
and the intergovernmental fiscal system i s being reformed accordingly to guarantee the
sustainability of the process. After the regional and local elections of November 2002, new
institutions were created with potentially substantial-yet     not fully clarified-functions.   The

legal framework for decentralization is advancing, albeit at a slower pace than planned. Despite
progress, an extensive reform agenda consisting of key programmatic transfers, the design of a
medium-term fiscal planning framework, and monitoring and evaluation systems for regional
and local investment, borrowingand program spending has yet to be implemented.
1.16    On January of 2004 the Government enacted the Fiscal Decentralization Law (LFD).
This law outlines the mechanisms for transfers to regions; identifies the taxes to be collected by
regions and which in the later phase of the decentralization process will be received by those
governments (50 percent of VAT, the excise tax, and personal income tax will be kept by the
macro regions, when these are created); and reinforces the constraints imposed on the regional
and local governments with respect to borrowing in order to expand their expenditures. The
enabling regulations for this and the revamped fiscal responsibility law are pending (they are
likely to be enacted in the upcoming months). Regulations regarding the definition of national,
regional and local State assets (Decreto Supremo sobre jerarquizacidn de Zos bienes del Estado
por su alcance nacional, regional y local en el marco del proceso de descentralizacidn) have
also been enacted. This Decree establishes the main definitions of State assets to be taken into
account during the decentralization process, and in the Annual Transfer Plans and National
Accreditation System.
 1.17   A draft "Programmatic Transfers'' law (establishing conditions for earmarkedtransfers of
 government competencies as well as the schedule to be followed) has been submitted to
 Congress. Discussion of this draft i s still pending and i s unlikely to take place in the coming
 weeks. However, competencies are still being transferred through annual plans (the PATCS).
 This year, the Central Government plans to transfer only a small subset of competencies due to
 the poor performance by accreditedgovernments last year. Programs inthe education andhealth
 sectors are unlikely to be transferred. The National Accreditation Law (Ley del Sistema de
 Acreditacidn de Zos Gobiernos Regionales y Locales) is currently also being discussed in
 Congress. This law will regulate the minimum capacity standards required for the subnational
 entities to receive the transfers of functions and their corresponding resources. Because of the
 controversial nature of this issue, several draft accreditation system designs have been presented
 to Congress-ranging     from an extensive sector-by-sector evaluation to an ex-ante system whose
 only clause is the regional and local governments' commitment to meeting requirements in the
 mid-termtargets. The outcome of this debate remains unclear.

 INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITYFORSUSTAINABLEFISCALDECENTRALIZATION

A. Background

2.1      State modernization and decentralization processesare strongly supported by a numberof
multi- and bilateral development agencies that provide assistance to the Central Government,
regional and local governments, and civil society. Cooperation agencies aim to support the
implementation of a gradual and sustainable political, fiscal and administrative decentralization
process. This involves (i)   supporting reforms of the legal framework, (ii) the planning
                                                                              boosting
and administrative capacity of local governments, (iii)strengthening central government
supervisory bodies, (iv) supporting the gradual transfer of competencies; and (v) assuring the
sustainability of the processthrough an appropriate communication strategy.
2.2      As cooperation agencies, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank
have designed programs focusing on the decentralization policy framework, such as the State
Modernization and Decentralization Program (IDB), the Programmatic Decentralization and
Competitiveness Structural Adjustment Loans, and the Programmatic Social Reform Loans
(WB).     These programs support gradual and fiscally neutral decentralization, through the
redefinition of institutional regulations and public administrative structures and an increaseinthe
quality and accountability of public services provided by national, regional and local
governments.

B. Summary of Key Projects

2.3      BANK-FINANCED     PROJECTS.The Bank has financed programs to help governments to
strengthen decentralization both directly-by      supporting government decentralization strategy
built on the three pillars of fiscal neutrality, gradualism, and enhanced competitiveness-and
indirectly, through programs focusing on rural areas where the bulk of the poor population lives.
 2.4     The Bank has supported the Government of Peru's decentralization strategy through the
 DECSAL and the PSRL IV. The DECSAL aims at protecting fiscal sustainability during Peru's
 transition to a more decentralized state, and at strengthening the managementand fiscal capacity
 of regional and local governments, with a view to their gradually taking responsibility for service
 delivery. The social reform loan established triggers related to the legal framework for social
 sector decentralization and to participatory, transparent monitoring and evaluation in the context
 of decentralization, with a focus on results. The Accountability for Decentralization TAL i s
 being preparedto provide technical assistancefor the decentralization of social programs and to
 establish a monitoring and evaluation framework for the social sectors in the context of
 decentralization, with a focus on the Ministry of Women and Social Development (MIMDES).
 Finally, a recipient managed JSDF Grant "Giving Voice to the Poor in Influencing, Planning,
 and Evaluating Service Delivery" i s under implementation. This grant is supporting the capacity
 strengtheningof the national and local governments and civil society organizations to effectively
 engage in processes of social accountability to improve public planning and budgeting, enhance
 the transparency and integrity of social spending, and increasequality of service delivery.

 INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR SUSTAINABLE FISCALDECENTRALIZATION

4.1     The proposed project will provide technical assistanceto carry out fiscal and institutional
reforms for decentralization supportedby the programmatic DECSALs. Inparticular, within the
overall objectives of strengthening fiscal sustainability and improving institutional effectiveness
for result-oriented service delivery by regional and local governments, this operation seeks to
support reforms aiming at (i)strengthening fiscal sustainability by enhancing financial
management capacity to comply with fiscal rules and enforce prudent management of regional
and local government debt; (ii)      building regional and local capacity to plan and monitor
compliance with medium-term targets included in multi-annual budgeting by regional and local
governments; and (iii)    expanding and consolidating the financial management system at the
regional andlocal level.
Component 1. Planning and Monitoring Fiscal and Financial Management of Regional
and LocalGovernments (US$1,744,000)
4.2     The first component will focus on preserving a decentralization process that i s fiscally
neutral in the medium-term.        So far Peru has succeeded in achieving fiscal neutrality and
transfers have been accompaniedby corresponding cuts at the national level. This outcome has
not only preservedfiscal sustainability, but vertical fiscal balances as well. Inthe medium-term,
fiscal sustainability is expectedto be preservedby the application of two key laws: the LRTF and
the LFD. The first component aims to support the introduction of basic financial management
tools (tax collection, accounting, budgeting) so as to produce data and monitor fiscal
performance in accordance with the new legal fiscal decentralization framework.                This
component has two subcomponents: the first one covering monitoring of the overall fiscal
performance by regional and local governments, and the second one covering management of
local and regional debt.
4.3     The Project will start by assisting in the design and monitoring of medium-term fiscal
indicators for all the regions and selected largest municipalities. These indicators should be
adequately monitored and controlled through the SIAF, and aligned with budget ceilings, debt
ratios, committed transfers and regularly adjusted revenue projections and cash availability, and
conveyed through participatory exercises. These indicators will also provide key informationto
the National Government and civil society for monitoring floating and contingency regional and
 local debt on a medium-term basis, so that regional and local medium-term fiscal and debt
 policies are in line with the limits of the LFRT and the projections contained inthe consolidated
 MultiannualMacroeconomic Framework.
 Subcomponent1. ApplicationandMonitoringof the FiscalDecentralizationLegal
 Framework at the Regionaland LocalLevel
 4.4    The first subcomponent will strengthen fiscal discipline at the regional and local level.
 Supported by the Integrated Financial Management System or Sistema Integrado de
Administracidn Financiera (known as SIAF), this component will assist regional and local
 governments to organize, maintain and disclose their fiscal accounts in compliance with the
 provisions of the Law of Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency (LFRT) and the Law of Fiscal
 Decentralization (LFD),and with the financial and reporting and disclosure requirements of the



                                                  37

                                                                                                             Annex 4


National Government (primarily MEF-DGAES, Central Bank, the Accounts Department
(Contaduriu), and the Office of the Comptroller General (Contruloriu). Consequently, this
component will support effective application of the fiscal rules that have already been itemized
in the LRTF and the LFD9and the accreditation requirements that are about to be approvedby
Congress.
4.5     This subcomponent will finance the following activities in all regional and a number of
pilot local governments: (i)      design of standardizedfiscal indicators for quarterly reporting and
the medium-term macroeconomic framework for regional and local governments, compatible
with accounting and budgeting standards; (ii)             design and testing of reporting and disclosure
formats," ensuring connectivity with SIAF-SP; (iii)            training infiscal accounts and indicators and
multi-annual fiscal and financial programming, and installation of supplementary software when
needed for initial pilot implementation in all regions and the 24 largest municipalities; and (iv)
evaluation of fiscal and financial indicators as well as adequate reporting and disclosure
standardsfor regional and local governments.
4.6     The MEF publishes a Macroeconomic Multiannual Framework (MMF), which forecasts
the main macroeconomic variables and sets fiscal ceilings on a three-year horizon for revenue,
expenditure, investment, and public debt. This subcomponent will also support the expansion
and consolidation of the existing medium-term budgeting frameworks and their extension to
regional and local governments. This subcomponent will support compliance by regional and
local governments with the requirement to monitor and report on financial management
indicators andmedium-term fiscal projections inaccordancewith the LFD.

Subcomponent2. Monitoringand Managing the Debt of the ConsolidatedPublic Sector

4.7      This subcomponent will focus on preparing prudential and legal safeguards for public
debt and building capacity for reporting and monitoring local and regional debt, stemming from
credit or from procurement contracts."               Although the LFRT and the LFD already contain
ceilings, targets, and sanctions related to regional and local debt, additional laws and regulations
are required regarding specific early warning indicators, as well as adequate management,
reporting, registration and indebtedness capacity evaluation. When the regulatory framework i s
completed and adequately implemented, Peru should have a strictly regulated and monitored yet
 solid framework for regional and local government access to capital markets. For all levels of
government, new debt contracts will be identified in a timely manner and their impact on debt
 sustainability and debt servicing capacity will be evaluated. Corresponding provisions will be


 9.  The new legal framework defines fiscal rules for regional and local governments. It includes four quantitative
     fiscal criteria to be complied by regional and local governments: (a) annual primary spending increase should
     be lower than 3 percent (in real terms); (b) no fiscal deficits are allowed; (c) debt service/total debt should be
     lower than 25 percent; and (d) current revenueltotal debt should be lower than 100 percent.              Issuing a
     Reglamento for the LFD and approving a legal framework for accreditation is still pending. .
 10. As required by Chapter IV of the LDF.
 11. This subcomponent will not cover contingent (pension and other labor benefits, judicial), indirect (central
     regional or local government guarantee o f debt payment by autonomous or semi-autonomous regional or local
     agencies) or floating (short term) debt. These types of local and regional debt will be broadly identified
     through the medium term fiscal and financial planning supported by the first subcomponent described above.
     Besides, the government expects to take supplementary action regarding current stock of debt of already over-
     indebted municipalities.    Those supplementary actions should further strengthen government capacity to
     identify, report and monitoring all sorts of government debt at regional and local levels.



                                                         38

                                                                                             Annex 4


introduced in the SIAF system for programming disbursement calendars and budget provisions.
Therefore, the design of a new debt module by SIAF will be an essential tool for managing and
monitoringregional and localdebt.
4.8     This subcomponent will provide the authorities with the necessary tools for formulating
debt management policies at all levels of government. Inparticular, it will finance the following
activities: (i)preparation of a framework law and supplementary laws on regional and local debt;
(ii) of indicators andprocessesfor regular consolidated public debt monitoringand
     design
analysis at the national level; (iii) training aimed at enhancing regional and local government
debt management capacity, so as to ensure that financing needs are met at the lowest possible
cost over the mediumterm and that debt levels are sustainable; (iv) development and testing by
SIAF of a new regional and local debt module, which includes modules on debt classification,
contract registration, reporting and disclosure; and (v) providing capacity building and
installation of supplementary SIAF packages at regional and local levels for debt classification,
contract registration, reporting anddisclosure through the SIAF system

Component 2. Tools for the Enhancement of Public ExpenditureEfficiency (US$712,000)

4.9      This component supports three types of incentives and/or new mechanisms aimed at
enhancement of public expenditure efficiency with special pilot applications at the regional and
local levels. For further details on the GOP's goals regarding its project for moving toward
greater performance orientation, see Annex 4B.
4.10     The first group of incentives consists of the application of expenditure indicators. The
project supports construction of an initial set of (institutional) performance management
indicators for projects and activities. This initial set will be supplemented in later years by other
sector performance indicators until the country develops indicators and data bases that cover a
substantialpart of the administration. Indicators supportedby this project will be primarily input
(cost/product) ratios geared to strengthening resource allocation decisions at agency level and
providingcost-basedstandards for budget preparation purposes. These indicators are applicable
at national, regional and local levels. As demonstratedby the successful experience of countries
like Australia, Canada or Chile, performance indicators are a sine qua non first step towards
programmatic budgeting, result indicators andresult-informedbudgets.
4.11 The second set of incentives aims to enhancepublic expenditure quality through Results-
basedManagement Agreements (or Convenios de Administracidn por Resultudos, CARs). Peru
has acquired nearly six years' experience with performance agreements between central
 ministries and decentralized national level agencies. The country increasingly uses inter-
 government (national-regional      or local) performance agreements to support decentralization.
 For the purpose of improving procedures at all levels of government (including regional and
 local levels), this project will support the CARs. InPeru's pursuit of enhanced competitiveness
 at the regional and local level, process rationalization is essential to reduce transaction costs and
 create abetter businessenvironment.
 4.12    The third set of incentives seeks to enhance public expenditure quality through a
 participatory budget exercise. Peru's decentralization follows the good practices of Spain and
 Brazil and other LAC countries, where ordinary citizens participate in planning, allocating and
 monitoring regional and local budget allocations and budget execution. Although the legal
 framework was essentially completed in 2003, initial participatory exercises in the 2004 budget


                                                   39

                                                                                                              Annex 4


demonstratedthat citizens andcommunity organizations were not yet preparedto take advantage
of this participatory opportunity. Public commentary and input was not restricted to the typical
items where citizens' preferences can be directly incorporated in the budget. As a result,
citizens' demands considerably exceeded budget ceilings.                        In an attempt to funnel citizen
demands in accordance with fiscal discipline and sound budget principles, the national
government issueda Regulation (Directiva) inFebruary 2004 that clarified the scope of citizens'
intervention in regional and local budgeting. This regulation needs to be further disseminated
and-in    some cases-needs        to be supplementedby further training on participatory budgeting at
the regional and local levels. This project will support preparation of dissemination and training
materials on participatory budgeting as well as training programs and other forms of national
government technical assistance to communities and regional and local governments with respect
to participatory budgeting

Component3. StrengtheningStrategicPlanningfor PublicInvestmentandPublicAssets
Management(US$2,360,000)

4.13     This component builds on existing systems and processes for public investment and
public assets management. A first subcomponent will build and develop a public investment
 systemfor the consolidated government. A second subcomponent will strengthen local capacity
for managingpublic assets.

 Subcomponent1. Strengtheninga NationalPublicInvestmentSystem

 4.14    This subcomponent will upgradethe national public investment system. Peru already has
 a well tested system for national investment planning and ex-ante evaluation. The National
 Investment System (Sistema Nucional de Inversidn Ptiblicu, SNIP) at the MEF has already
 trained personnel for the investment offices of sector ministries (OPIs). Decentralization has
 created demand for an extension of the Investment System (supplemented by the Strategic
 Planning System) to the regional level of government.I2                         Since the legal and regulatory
 framework already exists, the next step towards the proposed extension of the system is the
 training of the investment units at the newly created regional level. Consequently, a regional
 investment culture will be createdinthe medium term.
 4.15    Regional and local capacity-strengthening will focus on identification, formulation and
 ex-ante evaluation and managementof investment projects and strategic planning. It will include
 a strengthening of MEF staff and systems designed to oversee such a capacity-strengthening
 program at the regional level. The program design will include implementation, management
 and systematization of lessons learned. Aimed at supporting gradual development of M&E at
 regional and local levels of investment and overall spending, this component will strengthen
 integration betweenthe budget, SIAF, and SNIP.
 4.16    Specifically, this project will finance four national activities: (i)               design of the training
 program, including preparation of materials and M&E at the central level; (ii)                             training of
 trainers-to   be selected from residents of each region involved; (iii) training for each of the
                                                                                       field

  12. The Ministry of Finance is planning to supplement the current ex-ante evaluation with an ex-post investment
     evaluation system. Since the latter i s still in its development phase, it would be premature to anticipate how and
     when it would be applied to regional and local investment.



                                                              40

                                                                                                        Annex 4


25 regional governments. This third element will essentially consist of on-the-job training
during the preparation of regional government investment projects or strategic plans; and (iv)
macro-regional training events led by a smaller, inter-regional group of expert trainers that
ensure quality control and reinforce the training program ledby local experts.

Subcomponent2. Strengthening Capacity for the Management of Public Assets at the
Regional Levels

4.17      This subcomponent will increase the capacities of regionalgovernments through transfers
of know-how and technological support. Peru had already started the process of strengthening
i t s national level institutions for asset management when decentralization began. Since then,
decentralization has raised the number of governments and agencies involved in assets
management to nearly 1,700, compounding an already complex challenge. One of the -legally
established-guiding          principles of Peru's decentralization i s that each service responsibility
transferred to regional or local governments needs to be accompanied by the transfer of
corresponding assets and resources allocated to the provision of such service. The government
also issued a Supreme Decree (D.S.) on distribution of real estate assets among levels of
government, specifying which assets (and revenues) correspond to regional and local
governments. Though regional and local governments need to comply with national laws and
regulations on asset management, they also enjoy considerable autonomy with respect to asset
management decisions.             Besides, the necessary (national) legal framework has not been
~ompleted'~-and current laws and regulations are not always known or understood at the local
 and regional levels. Besides, in terms of registering assets, the national government appears to
be more advanced than regional governments, because the Superintendency o f National Assets
 (SBN) has a database that includes movable assets (securities), .i.e. state shares in public or
 public-private corporations, as well as real estate assets. Consequently, there i s an urgent need to
 consolidate institutions capable of efficiently completing the ongoing process of asset
 identification, valuation, regularization and registration, determination of potential uses,
 formulation of criteria for rational utilization, use-management including management, and
 policy eva1uati0n.l~ Inthe long run, the country envisions an integrated territorial information
 system that will serve as the basis for patrimonial accounting, asset management and
 competitiveness enhancement at local and regional levels.
 4.18      The revenue potential of rational asset management remains to be determined-though
  there i s enough evidence to argue that it i s largely untapped.              The SBN i s responsible for
  regulation and supervision of asset management standards and processes, fostering the
  enhancement of asset management capacity, and providing technical assistance to regional
  governments. The SBN has already promoted the establishment of the Comitks de Gestidn
  Patrimonial (asset management committees) responsible for identification and regularization of




  13. The LFD already includes some references to the National Public Assets System (Sistema de Bienes
       Nacionales). The Organic Law of the Executive Branch (Ley Orgdnica del Poder Ejecutivo-LOPE),     currently
       in preparation, will also include specific references to the SBN and the national system. Still, further
       consolidation of the National Public Assets System-created by a Ministerial regulation (Reso1ucidn)-will
       require issuanceof the proposed Law on the Public Assets System.
   14. The SBN has already registered 45,000 pieces of real estate (universe: 100 000 pieces) in the SINABIP, the
       national state property geographical information system.



                                                           41

                                                                                                          Annex 4


its own assets at every government executing agency, including regional 1e~els.l~The SIAF is
already registering and providinginformationon the status of assets at every executing agency.
4.19    Although a modern asset managementculture and corresponding institutional capacity at
all levels of government will take many years, there is an urgent need to complete the regulatory
framework, disseminate national standards and processes, consolidate capacity at the national
level, and develop linkages between national and regional and local authorities for the provision
of technical assistance, or otherwise strengthen capacity at regional and local levels. The SBN
needs to further disseminatethe regulatory framework and alert regional governments about their
responsibilities-and       the most effective ways to comply with them. They will then have to
transfer this information to local governments. More specifically, this project will support
activities under the SBN's extension programs for regional and local governments that are
gearedto:l6 creating
               (i) unitsresponsibleforassetmanagementwithinregionalgovernments;(ii)
training regional staff in the legal.and regulatory framework; (iii)            strengthening the capacity of
the SBN for monitoring and supervision of regional government^;'^ (iv) establishing a link
through the forthcoming accreditation law with a "graduation" or "certification" systemfor asset
management at regional levels", and (v) improving the technological tools (information system,
equipment)of regional governmentsfor assets administration.

Component 4. Empowering and Expanding the Integrated FinancialManagement System
 (US$3,288,000)

4.20     Peru has developed a well-performing integrated financial management national system,
 Sistema Zntegrado de Administracio'n Financiera, SIAF.                      The system covers all Central
 Government and most decentralized entities, and was institutionalized through the recently
 approved Ley SAFZ, which formally integrated it into the MEF's organizational structure. In
 terms of technical expertise andeffective use of integrated financial management at regional and
 local government levels, Peru is probably one of the most advanced countries in the region.
 With the help of international cooperation over the past ten years, the country invested
 substantial resources in developing the SIAF at the national level, and then extended it to
 regional and local levels. The SIAF ensures uniform accounting, budgeting and reporting
 standards, and on-line monitoring of contracts and disbursements. The SIAF is also a key
 ingredient for transparency in expenditure; governmental and citizens' monitoring of regional
 and local public finances; monitoring and evaluation; participatory budgeting and execution of
 investment programs.
 Subcomponent 1.Extending SIAF to Local Governments
 4.21    Two tailored-made software versions are being installed by regional and local
 governments: an extended one for regional governments and selected large local governments,


  15. 350 such committees have already been established.
  16. The SBN is already implementing a pilot project for training and otherwise developing such capacity at the
      Regional Government o f Piura.
  17. Connectivity will be based on the already established SIAF network. The SBN already has legal authority to
      monitor and supervise asset management at the regional level. It is expected that the proposed LOPE and the
      announced Law on the National Public Assets System will extend the SBN monitoring and supervision
      capacity to municipal governments.
  18. In the case of Peru, the SBN needs to coordinate the institutional building process in order to ensure effective
      and efficient monitoring and supervision.



                                                        42

                                                                                                      Annex 4



called SIAF-SP (SP for Public Sector) and a shortened one for local governments, called SIAF-
GL (GL for local government)."The proposed component will support government efforts to
expand the coverage of its financial management system. In particular, the project will: (i)
extend SIAF-GL coverage to 1,026, out of 1829, local governments. That installation includes
revenue collection, budget formulation and accounting modules. SIAF should also (i)                    deliver
budget execution data and budget reports within the fiscal year, along with quarterly
disbursement plans; (ii) a fiscal cadaster ,and develop a new SIAF module for regional
                           update
and local debt that will include contract registration; (iii)       provide technical assistancefor training
regional and local staff in the use of the system; and (iv) assist in the settingup of a permanent
support office to handle emergency SIAF-related questions (hotline).
Subcomponent2. Payroll Control System
4.22    This subcomponent will finance a virtual registering of the payment control system in
SIAF. Peru's civil service reform needs are multiple. The evasion for more than a decade of a
comprehensive reform of the public civil service has left many issues unsolved in the public
sector: (i) unsustainable rigid trend toward a rapid increase of the wage bill; (ii)
            an                                                                                         limited
transparency with respect to myriad salaries and benefits; (iii)           phantom (i.e. nonexistent) public
servants; and (iv) a largely ineffective and inefficient bureaucracy. Solving such issues in
subnational governments i s essential to promote regional growth and investment for poverty
reduction, andto deal with pressing fiscal pressures from decentralization in the near term. The
GOP i s currently reforming the legal framework for the civil service and a Government
Employment Framework Law (Ley Marco de Empleo PLibZico) i s expectedto be approved soon.
This bill will promote a unifiednational civil service. The GOP has also conducted a census of
public servants, covering the national and regional governments. Further actions are needed at
the subnational level.
4.23    Supported by a module in the SIAF, this project will design a consolidated national
payroll control system in SIAF-SP, broken down into national and regional governments. This
involves two main activities to be financed by this project: (i)creation of a central public
servants database, consolidating information from the MEF, SUNAT, Banco de la Nacidn, and
subnational governments, and allowing SIAF executing units to verify and validate the hiring or
dismissal of public employees; and (ii)       design and implementation of a direct deposit electronic
payment system (Abono en Cuenta) for public servants. Starting with teachers' payroll, no less
than 579 regional and municipal governments are expected to be covered by this system by the
endof 2004.

 Component 5. Project Management (US$608,000)

4.24    The purpose of this component is to support project implementation, monitoring and
 evaluation.   The sectoral loans coordination unit (Unidad de Coordinacidn de Prdstamos
 Sectoriales-UCPS)       in the MEF will operate according to the structure and management
 procedures agreed upon with the Bank. A capacity assessment was carried out to evaluate
 procurement and financial management procedures under the responsibility of the UCPS, and
 they were deemed satisfactory. The UCPS will be responsible for coordinating and monitoring



 19. SIAF-GLuses three modules: budget formulation, accounting and revenue collection. SIAF-SP adds modules
     on Treasury, budget execution, public credit and a special external website known as VentanaAmigable.

the yearly Operations Plan, financial management of the project, and procuring goods and

4.25   This component will finance operating costs including: (i) and per diem expenses
                                                                  travel

and consultants; and (iii) project monitoring and evaluation. Some cost sharing i s expectedwith
the Social TAL.
4.26    Actions to ensure medium and long-term sustainability of results are needed if Peru is to
attain this project's final goals as well as the broad decentralization it is pursuing. Project
management will include actions designed to induce ownership and commitment by key
government units, Congress, subnational governments, political parties and civil society.
Actions will be targeted to overcoming potential resistance and strengthening consensus among
key stakeholders.     Activities proposed will include a communication strategy, including
consultations with stakeholders, workshops, town hall meetings, dissemination notes.

   Medium-Term Fiscal Planningfor Enhanced Monitoringof Regional and Local Levels

                                               A POLICY NOTE

4.27    BACKGROUND.         Maintainingthe SIAF for all the regions and the progress made with the
local-level SIAF (SIAF-Local) has been a highly positive first step toward standardized
accounting, budgeting and inter-government information-sharing and control of fiscal
performance across levels of government. Although the SIAF was initially used mainly as an
accounting tool for disbursement programming;'              it now has budget modules for regional and
local governments. It also includes modules for monitoring and control of payroll names,
contractual commitments?l and direct debt. It could potentially provide data for estimating
indirect, floating and contingency22debt. Above all, SIAF-Regional or SIAF-Local enables
governments to control the major public finance variables, such as their own                   revenue^:^    federal
transfers, public spending, and debt policy.24 This note elaborates on how to realize and
capitalize on this potential. It also proposes a pilot for large regional and municipal governments
to develop their capacity to quickly switch from unified cash management (disbursement)
measures to quarterly, annual, and medium-term fiscal planning geared to re-establishing fiscal
sustainability.      This note tries to demonstrate that regional and local governments with
indebtednesscapacity can usethe SIAF to develop medium-term, multi-annual fiscal policies. In
a more austere fiscal context, these same regional and local governments will have the capacity
to quickly adjust project andoperational program planning.
4.28     Peru's fiscal policy at the national level is already guided by the Medium-term
Macroeconomic Framework. This is not true of the regional or local governments-even the
 large ones.      Regional and local finance secretariats are usually overwhelmed with tasks
 associated with making cash management (disbursement) decisions, designing the next year's
budget, fixing limits on projected spending, negotiating additional transfers with the national
 government, incorporating participatory budget priorities, discussing the budget with the sectors,
 and providingpay-as-you go funds to pay government commitments.




 20. Essentially linking commitments, liabilities, disbursements and payments.
 21. The SIAD module for registration of contracts and debt to providers is about to be added to the SIAF. When
     installed (in all regional governments and 54 municipalities in 2005), it will register all contracts that include
     provider financing (typically public works contracts). The contract itself, disbursements and payments will be
     registered by SIAD. As such, this module will provide some of the necessary inputs for project monitoring as
     well as medium-term commitment and disbursement planning. SIAD is supplemented by another module for
     registration and selection of bidders. The two modules put together will provide some of the data needed to
     estimate floating debt.
 22. SIAF can potentially provide data on contributions to reserves and/or payments to pension funds. B y default, it
     could be used to detect cases of new under-provisioning or the absence of provisioning . It cannot, however,
     reflect the old debt stock or the contingency debt.
 23. SIAF collects local tax data for the property tax, fees, vehicle tax and the alcabala (transfer) tax. It also
     provides municipal tax authorities with cadaster systems.
 24. SIAF already provides the format, and collects initial budget information, for all regions and all district and
     provincial municipalities. All regions and nearly 700 municipalities (including 194 provincial municipalities
     and the most important urban centers, with the sole exception of some Lima districts) will also provide SIAF
     with budget execution data as of 2005, including commitments, accruals, disbursement program and effective
     payments. Armed with these data, SIAF automatically produces the monthly expenditure program for regions
     and municipalities.

4.29     As Peru moves at the regional and local levelto a greater participatory approachfor fiscal
management and as the country pursues result-informed budgets, it will probably direct most
government expenditure toward reaching "final" goals. Both civil society and private capital
have been mobilized for demonstrable public-private partnership. However, reconciling realistic
budget goals (discounting budget rigidities and includingperformance and result indicators) with
the ambitious set of social and economic goals demanded by the participatory budget or the
incipient result-informed budget remains far beyond regional and local governments' grasp.
Spending is still ruled by the inertia of past expenditures and does not appear to respond flexibly
to local or regional priorities or budget goals. There are so many rigidities intransfers andinthe
budget that spending cannot adequately adjust to changing needs or revenue shortfalls. A large
amount of expenditures are rigidly pre-determined-particularly                   in small and medium-sized
regions and municipalities. Other negative factors exist as well. Financial management and
control appear to be weak in autonomous or semi-autonomous agencies.                               This creates
opportunities for moral hazard, bailouts, and corruption. Because the recording of regional and
local government expenditures is usually made on a cash basis which temporarily disguises
arrears, an accurate statement of the debt position of the regional and local governments i s not
reflected inthe official estimates.

         The prevailing cash management approach is insufficient to guarantee tough budget constraints at regional
and local levels.    Cash management is only effective for future disbursements, and it can scarcely correct
commitments and accruals if they are based on over-optimistic revenue projections (as has been typical in Peru). As
a rule, cash management leads to a somewhat narrow fiscal perspective that favors short-term commitments at the
expense of medium-term investment and debt planning. Under cash management, even large municipalities can
neither meet decentralization expectations for medium-term planning within resource constraints nor can they
effectively install performance budgeting and achieve higher expenditure flexibility in sector spending. These
forces have thus restricted regional and local fiscal management to focus mainly on the short term.

                                                                ~~      ~       ~




4.30     THEPROBLEM. Local and regional governments lack an early alert system based on
revenue and expenditure forecasting (including provisions for contingency and floating debt).
Consequently, at the end of a given year, the annual deficit can easily balloon beyond
expectations unless timely information i s provided to government and civil society. Under
present arrangements, unexpected reductions in revenues25and/or shortages in provisioning for
 contingency or floating debt will likely have two results. (i)            The capacity of regional and local
 governments to react to lower than expected revenues consists essentially of reductions (or
 elimination) of investment spending. Current expenditures are taken to be fairly rigid, and the
 governments will have no menu of possible (tax policy or tax administration) revenue reforms of
 their own. (ii)     Cash adjustment decisions are not connected with annual expenditure results,
 medium-term (multi-annual plan and budget) goals or the final, ambitious social goals pursued
 through participatory budgeting. Accordingly, budget results are disconnected from actual
 disbursement, thereby weakening governmenthector accountability and further debilitating the
 credibility of budget results (inaddition to expectedincreasesincosts due to lack of security and
 frequent stops and goes).
 4.31    Recent changes in the fiscal and financial context reinforce the need for distinct changes
 in the management of local and regional public finances. Furthermore, the new legislative
 framework (Law of Fiscal Decentralization) requires local and regional governments to prepare


 25. Under present inter-government fiscal arrangements, own regional revenues stem primarily from mining and
      gas operations and are therefore highly vulnerable to depletion, commodity price shocks or economic cycles.

 multi-annual fiscal and financial reports. It i s now necessary to put together all those instruments
 to produce an early warning system, ensure Government fiscal discipline in a context of clearer
 fiscal separation from the federal government, reduce moral hazard, and effectively enforce strict
 fiscal responsibility targets and/or ceiling.
 4.32      THECHALLENGE. In recent years, building fiscal institutional capacity at regional and
 local levels has rightfully focused on developing tools for standardized accounting, budgeting
 and reporting, all in the context of the SIAF. Specific budget indicators, specialized reporting
 and M&E indicators have yet to be developed. It is now necessary to supplement those reforms
 inorder to ensure fiscal sustainability andraise the quality of state expenditure. Completing the
 process of fiscal institutional reform at regional and local levels could be accomplished in two
 phases:-first,    by institutionalizing procedures for harmoniously combining short- and medium-
 term considerations,26 and then by sending signals to encourage expenditure flexibility and
 additional tax effort.
 4.33      Treasury management,           expenditure planning,           budget execution,          contracts and
 commitments, and debt policy need to be adjusted in a flexible way. The local or regional
 Comite' de            needs to send budget restriction signals to line secretariats. Budget results
 need to be adjusted correspondingly. The medium-term plan and the annual budget must be
 transformed into a dynamic document that i s regularly adjusted during and in between fiscal
 years. The final social and economic goals must be clarified in terms of intermediate goals that
 can be influenced through state action financed by annual expenditure budgets. Only then will it
 be possible to e perform effective monitoring and evaluation on the basis of uniform accounting,
 information andreporting procedures.
I                                                                                                                       1
           The reform required at this point is essentially supplementary to the recent capacity building exercises in
 accounting and budgeting. What is needed now i s completion of the reform process through measures that are
 initially pragmatic and process-oriented and then, later on, structural and personnel-oriented. Initial supplementary
 reforms should be focused on the linkages that could enlarge the operational capacity of regional and local
 governments for planning, monitoring and evaluating sustainable finances and efficiency in expenditure allocation
 and production. Completion of the reform process would entail boosting planning and evaluation links between
 spending, revenue and financing units. Medium-term targets would enable regional and local governments to tackle
 macro-economic challenges with better informed, more flexible, and more widely shared macro-policy instruments.
 Process integration will also strengthen relations with other government agencies and external clients (national
 government, regional or local assemblies, the private sector and civil society).          Institutionalization of new
 procedures, process simplification, and higher productivity should free up resources o f the core secretariats for more
 medium-term management of fiscal and financial problems, instead of relying on ad hoc information for ad hoc
 decisions. Fiscal medium-term planning formats and controls need to be built into the SIAF-Regional and SIAF-
 Local systems.

 4.34      To ensure fiscal discipline by governments in a context of clearer fiscal separation from
 national government, the elimination o f bailouts and the lack o f fiscal stabilization funds, it i s


 26. The recently issued law (decree) on fiscal decentralization requires local and regional governments to produce
       multi-annual macroeconomic outlook papers..
 27. Or Comite' de Gusto [Expenditure Committee].            Since this Committee is composed of budget, treasury
       (revenues) and administration staff, it provides the necessary forum for integrated fiscal policy monitoring and
       decision-making. Among other things, the Committee prepares the monthly disbursement program. I t could
       potentially reconcile short-term revenue projections with the calendar o f commitments, accruals and
       disbursements. Two pilot programs need to be conducted in municipalities with investment and borrowing
       capacity.

now necessary to supplement the SIAF at the regional and local levels, in such a way that it can
address the now more intense public demands for greater transparency in government,
accountability, strengthened decentralization, and higher quality public expenditure. Above all,
it is necessary to develop the ability to anticipate short and medium-term fluctuations innational
government transfers.        The growing tendency to postpone regional and local investment
programs runs directly counter to growth requirements. .
4.35    Larger regional and local governments need to reduce fiscal dependency as projections
indicate that substantially increased central transfers are unlikely. Little effort i s made at the
local level to raise effective tax revenue (revenue less tax incentives and tax evasion). Tax
administration continues to under-perform and debt management i s practically nonexistent. Tax
administration and tax policy need to have a stock o f costhevenue and tax/growth analyses that
open up options for revenue growth inthe short and medium term.
4.36    A WIDE RANGEOF POTENTIAL ACTIONS. A broad range of actions are neededto achieve
higher quality and greater efficiency. The first institutional reform required i s the creation of a
technical (finance) unit, which could build on the existing Comite' de Cuju, to produce analysis
and short and medium-term policy options with respect to revenues, expenditures and debt, and
then incorporate these parameters in the SIAF system (mainly to support decisions on overall
levels of commitment and accrual expenditure.                 Subsequent measures may address other
organizational structures and personnel management, along with their idiosyncrasies and
cultures.   These measures can only be tested on a pilot basis, starting with two large
municipalities and two o f the most developed regions in 2005.
4.37    Several internal changes appear to be necessary:
        a. Shifting regional and local governments' current focus away from the issue o f
            adjustments and control of detailed inputs aimed at complying with cash
            disbursement and budget execution constraints, toward delivery of outputs and
            results in line with intermediate results that are, in turn, conducive to the medium-
            term andfinal goals actively pursued by departments or municipalities.
        b. Bridgingthe current differences inthe ways inwhich individual units of regional and
            local governments function. Some of their secretariats appear to be functionally self-
             sufficient or isolated. They are isolated from one another in several respects. For
             instance    they   share neither       methodologies        nor databases on          a regular
             (institutionalized) basis. The uses of integratedfinancial andprogram information for
             management decisions and policy making have not been clearly established.
             Therefore, little use appears to be made o f the wealth of potentially highly valuable
             information producedby the interconnected accounting and information management
             systems. As a result, fiscal policy and monitoring can be accurately described as
             "fragmented" (both between-and         within-the      major functional areas of revenue and
             expenditure), when what is needed i s a single revenue, budget and debt policy.28
         c. Reducing central, rigid controls over allocated budget amounts and their composition,
             and replacing them with greater flexibility for spending agencies intheir assignments
             of these resources.



 28. Based upon observation of the Lima administration. Smaller municipalities, such as Trujillo, appear to have
      muchbetter information sharingand a high degree of internal coordination.

       d. The Comite' de Caja of each regional and local government needs to enhance their
           capabilities for evaluating and negotiating, from a sectoral policy standpoint, the
           volume of resourcestheir executing secretariats seek in order to meet their objectives
           andpolicies.
       e. Refining monitoring and evaluation systems to make their findings on cost factors,
           achievement of planned results and socioeconomic impacts more useful to the
           members of the Comite' de Caja,managers and other key government policy makers,
           legislators, andrelevant private sector leaders.
       f. Establishing a technical (finance) secretariat where it does not already exist. This
           technical unit should be capable of providing comprehensive (revenue, expenditure,
           debt) policy options and policy assessment for the short- and medium-term.
4.38   The new technical unit should ensure regular production and submission to the Comite'de
Caja of at least the following documents (bulleted below). These documents are intended to
strengthenthe capacity of the Comisidn: to produce andregularly update medium-term fiscal and
financial policy. As such, they are supplementary to the weekly and quarterly treasury reports
and other cash flow informationthat currently support disbursement decisions:

           Since projections of GNP and regional product growth, inreal terms, are not available
           on a timely and reliable bask, the unit has to produce revenue forecasts based on
           historical and sample data ( for principal enterprises of the region or municipality).
           Presently, the national government (and central bank personnel) appear to be in the
           best position either to feed inthese data or provide the raw material for them.

       lower revenues or other contingencies caused, for example, by floods or earthquakes
       should also be simulated.

  Enhancing Quality of Public Expenditure through PerformanceManagement Indicators:

    A Policy Note on Long-term Vision and Short and Medium-termSupporting Actions2'

 4.40     BACKGROUND.           The National Budget Office (Direccidn Nacional de Presupuesto
 Phblico-DNPP)         at the Peruvian Ministry of Economic and Finance, MEF, has announced its
 plan to develop budget performance management indicators over the next few years. Inthe case
 of Peru, budget indicators are part of a larger series of mechanismsgearedto enhancethe quality
 of public expenditure. Such a list includes, inter alia, inter-government performance and result
 agreements and participatory budgeting. This note is restricted to the analysis of performance
 management indicators as a self-standing product, that also provides the basis for building more
 sophisticated indicators over time.              In particular, the note elaborates on the Peruvian
 government's goal of gradually constructing the basis for: (i)              programmatic budgeting, result
 indicators andresult-informed budgets; and (ii)           strategic program indicators. Basedon the good
 practices of Australia, Canada and Chile, the note concurs with the Peruvian authorities that
 performance indicators are a sine qua non first step towards result-informed budgets. On the
 other hand, the note argues that Peru could move sooner to strategic indicators. Following the
 recent experience of Mexico, strategic indicators couldbe introduced as soon as Peruvian regions
 andmunicipalities develop the strategic plansthat are now requiredby law.

          Peru envisions moving towards programmatic planning and evaluation of results. As a first step in this
 direction, the country will introduce performance management indicators over the next few years. The country
 also envisions the development of strategic indicators for key government plans, at a later time yet to be specified.
 Examples of good international practices support Peru's selected path of gradually building result indicators. B y
 way of example, it took nearly six years for Chile to move from performance management indicators to result-
 basedprogrammatic indicators (see Appendix). On the other hand, the recent experience of Mexico would support
 the view that Peru might adopt strategic indicators for regional and local public expenditure as soon as regional
 and local governments have adequately prepared strategic plans. It would not be necessary to wait until the
1country has fully developed performance management indicators-or      result indicators-for    introducing strategic
 indicators.

 4.41      This note is intended to supplement the analytical basis for the World Bank Technical
 Assistance Project to support the process of fiscal decentralization in Peru. The project will
  support construction of an initial set of (institutional) performance management indicators for
 projects and activities. This initial set will be supplemented in later years by other sector
  performance indicators untilreaching the point at which the country develops indicators and data
  bases that cover a substantial part of the administration. Indicators supportedby this project will
  be primarily input (cost/product) ratios geared to strengthening resource allocation decisions at
  agency level and providing cost-based standards for budget preparation purposes. These
  indicators are applicable at national, regional and local levels.
  4.42     PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT INDICATORS AS A NECESSARY FIRST STEP TOWARDS
  MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF REGIONAL AND LOCAL EXPENDlTURES. The World Bank TAL
  project in support of fiscal decentralization supports the efforts of the Peruvian National


  29. This note is based on recent Bank experience with expenditure evaluation indicators, particularly Bank support
      for Mexico, Chile and CearA (Brazil). The note draws heavily on the work of Bank teams for each of those
      countries-particularly   Phil Joyce's recommendations for Mexico. Appendix to this annex presents the
      "Characteristics of the Chilean Evaluation System" for reference.

Government to gradually consolidate abudget processfocused on results. The Peruvian program
includes a phased-in design that starts with improving the production of performance indicators
and then incorporating those indicators in the budget process. This section discusses a specific
strategy that would increase the possibility of successfully implementing this reform, both for
short and medium-term performance indicators and for the long-term construction of result
indicators. The World Bank team believes that the performance-based budgeting initiative is
very important, and that it should continue. The MEF is to be congratulated on its efforts in
joining many countries around the world in developing such a reform. Further, the Ministry
should also be proud of its significant efforts to draw lessons from international good practices
that can serve as referencepoint at this early stage of the reformprocess.
4.43     CHANGE MANAGEMENTFOR STAKEHOLDERS' OWNERSHIP. The World Bank team shares
the MEF's view that the ultimate test of the success of this reform program will be the extent to
which budgeting decisions become informed by program performance considerations. This
necessitates more than just the development of better performance measures. It requires the
capacity of various institutions in the government to develop and evaluate performance
measures, and it requires that decision-makers have the incentives to use those measures when
resource allocation decisions are made. Decision-makers' ownership-based                      on the benefits of
performance measurement-is               at least as important as good technical design and properly
constructed databases.

         The development of an effective measurement system requires that many parts of the government work
together. Sector ministries and regional and local governments must have the capacity to develop appropriate
indicators, the Ministry of Economy and Finance must be able to analyze the appropriateness of those indicators,
the President and Congress must consider the indicators when allocating resources, and audit agencies must be
 able to evaluate both the appropriateness o f the indicators and the actual performance o f ministries, regions or
 municipalities relative to those indicators.

 4.44    PHASED-INAPPROACH.For the reform to move to the next (results) level, MEF has
 identified two concurrent and complementary goals. The first goal is the development of better
 performance measures and better capacity to produce the intended results throughout the
 government. The second is to take actions that are comprehensive-involving                          all important
 actors inthe government-and sustainableover time.
 4.45    TRAINING NEEDS.With reforms at such an embryonic stage, substantial capacity-
 building i s necessary to produce better, more appropriate, indicators. Current indicators vary
 widely among ministries intheir quality and inthe appropriateness of their goals. For example,
 the Ministry of Economy and Finance has a few staff who have worked diligently to improve the
 quality of its indicators. However, more trained staff are needed to continue this expansion of
 knowledge beyond MEF to other ministries and-subsequently-to                          the regional and local
 governments. This training might follow the model established by the MEF to support the
 training of investment experts in sector ministries. The Director of Budget and his staff have
 made the development of performance indicators a priority, but it is not yet clear to what extent
 reliable information is available as a basis for funding decisions. Over the next few years, Peru
 must invest in the development of performance indicators on a sustained basis. Identification,
 pilot testing, and evaluation will be needed. Historically, Congress has had neither the staffing
 capacity, the time, nor the interest to review performance indicators.                      The Office of the
 Comptroller General(Contraloria) and the Accounts Department (Contaduria) have traditionally
 focused on numerical budget control and financial audits and do not currently have the capacity

                                                                                            Annex 4B



to do performance audits. In contrast, Peru's Integrated Financial Management System might
gradually incorporate performance indicators for transparency, electronic filing, and continuity
purposes.
4.46     The capacity to produce and to analyze performance measure i s a crucial next step. For
the reform program to succeed and to be sustainable, better indicators must be sought and a
performance-based "culture" established in line ministries and, eventually, regional and local
governments. Specifically, it is important that both the MEF and the line ministries develop
more technical expertise in developing performance indicators, from the identification of key
mission statements and goals to the development of measurableperformance indicators. Several
key actions are recommended by the World Bank in the interest of developing better indicators
inthe short runandincreasingthe probability of a sustainable systeminthe longrun.
4.47     ACTIONSDESIGNEDTO CONSTRUCT QUALITY INDICATORSINl?HE SHORT RUN. While the
development of a long-run evaluation culture will (as it has in every other country that has
implemented such a system) take time, there are actions that can and should be taken inthe short
runto improve the quality of the measures, which is itself an important factor inthe development
of long-run capacity.
4.48     FOCUS ON IMPROVING MEASURES PORTION OF THE GOVERNMENT
                                             INA                                    EACHYEAR. In
order to continue the momentum that has already begun, it i s important that the MEF convey to
line ministries and regional and local governments the continued importance of improving their
measurement systems. Considering the limited resources that the MEF has to review these
indicators, however, we would recommend that internal resources be initially devoted to
concentrating on a portion of sector ministries and regional governments each year, starting with
those that have made the most progressto date. If the MEFcan focus attention on a portion each
year (we would recommend one-third over each of the next three years), it can target its limited
resources to greatest effect. In working with sector ministries and regional governments, the
MEF should focus on rationalizing the relationships between each agency's mission and its
 institutional activities, and developing more appropriate measures to gauge progress in meeting
 goals for each of these activities. Further, the initial set of ministries can be used a resource for
 later implementers, and can serve as concrete examples of the success of the program. In this
 connection, the Bank TAL project will support production of an initial set of indicators that can
 establishprecedent for other activities.
 4.49     HOLD  WORKSHOPS ON THE DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCEMEASUREMENT
                                                       OF A                                  SYSTEM.
 The development of greater capacity among the ministries, regional governments and the MEF
 involves training in the development of an appropriate measurement system. To this end, the
 World Bank recommends a one-and-a-half day workshop to: (i)                introduce staff from the
 ministries or regional governments and the MEF to the principles of performance measurement
 systems; (ii)provide hands-on training in the development of mission statements, measurable
 goals, and performance indicators; and (iii)discuss other countries' experience in developing
 similar systems. The current goals and measures for the ministries and regional governments
 will be used as examples in the workshops. The plan would be to divide the ministries and/or
 regional governments into three separate groups, and hold three separate workshops. At each of
 these workshops, individuals from the ministries would be matched with staff from the MEFthat
 are responsible for the review of that ministry's budget. The MEF and the Bank team have
 tentatively agreed on having the first of these workshops inApril, 2004, with other workshops to
 beheldinJune or July, 2004.

4.50   ADDITIONAL TRAININGFOR MEFSTAFF. Inaddition to these workshops, further training
sessions should be scheduled in June or July 2004 for MEF staff. This training would be
designed to help staff inthe MEFreview the performance indicators initially proposedby sectors
or included in the budget proposals of ministries or regional governments. This will include,
among other things, training on comparative metrics, such as benchmarking against other
governments, against international standards, or againstpastperformance.
4.51   PUBLISHING AND EMPHASIZINGPERFORMANCEINDICATORS FOR THE FISCALYEAR 2005
BUDGET.The previous actions are designedto improve the quality of measures and the logical
connection between missions and measures in time for the unveiling of the President's budget in
mid-November. We would recommend that, beginning FY05, the budget highlights the progress
that has been made, as a way of building momentum for the future. Inaddition, at least twice a
year (and probably more frequently in the future), we would recommend that key indicators be
highlighted in a report prepared for the President, Congress, the rest of government, and the
public. It might be convenient to differentiate the contents of the proposed reports according to
the particular interest of the target group.
4.52    MEDIUM-TERM ACTIONS GEAREDTO CONSTRUCTINGAND INCREASINGTHESUSTAINABILITY
OF A RESULT-FOCUSED SYSTEM.            While the development of better indicators is clearly an
important factor in developing long-run capacity, the development of a long-run sustainable
system requires other actions that are designed both to broaden the mandate for such a system
and to increase the incentives for other parts of the government to develop "ownership" of the
system and use performance measures to makedecisions.
4.53    REACH OUT TO OTHER PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. Perhaps the most crucial
determinant of long-term success for the reform program will be the development of a "culture"
of performance across the government. If this culture i s to be developed, it is important that the
system be perceived as not just a MEF system, but as part of a comprehensive reform program
for the Peruvian government. To that end, it is important for the MEFto reach out to other parts
of the government, particularly those whose support is most important, including Congress, the
Office of the President, the audit and control agencies, Central Bank, the statistical agencies, the
line ministries, the regional governmentsand the local governments. One of the key goals of this
outreach is to develop a system of producing reliable and verifiable indicators on a routine basis,
as well as a systemfor reporting those indicators. This outreach should occur as soon as possible,
and concurrently with the development of better indicators for this year's budget process.
Certainly one of the key steps here would be to review the system of indicators being prepared
and/or used by some sector ministries or regional governments with an eye to reconciling them
with the indicators usedfor the budget system.
4.54    DRAFT A PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TO BE PASSED BY CONGRESS.
                                                   LAW                                       A key
determinant of sustainability has been codificationof the requirements to develop strategic plans
andperformance measures. This would seem to be a desirable step for Peru, to guardagainst the
system being perceived as either a) solely an executive branch system, or b) a system that is
associatedonly with the MEF. This law need not be terribly detailed, as its main purpose is to
serve as a "motivator" of continued effort. Furthermore, the law proposal should be prepared
after at least one year of experimentation with the new system. In this way, the law will reflect
the lessons from pilot testing.

4.55    THINK ABOUTNECESSARY          INCENTIVES FOR THE USE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES.
While certainly some part of the government may make greater use of performance measures
becauseit is "the right thing to do", experience inother governments shows that it is important to
think through incentives for the use of measures. For example, the line ministries may view
either additional managerial flexibility or additional resources as a "reward" for being heldmore
accountable for results. Similar questions concerning incentives need to be asked of Congress
and control agencies, amongothers.
4.56    Ifthegoalofthe reformprogram,asnotedattheoutset, istheestablishmentof asystem
that institutionalizes the use of performance information throughout the budget process, it i s
important that both capacity and sustainability be pursued and developed concurrently.          In
particular, it seems prudent for the MEF to place itself in a position where it can make a greater
substantive contribution to the debate about government performance by the time the next
Presidenttakes office in 2006. Each of the actions outlined above would be consistent with that
intermediate goal, as well as the long-term goal of resource allocations basedon performance.
4.57    FROM PERFORMANCETO PROGRAM (RESULTS) INDICATORS. Looking two or three years
ahead, Peru might begin moving from performance to program-result indicators. The essential
first step towards this level of indicators i s to structure the expenditure budget in terms of
programs rather than institutions.        Perhaps the easiest transition from institutional to
programmatic budgeting is to take the current budget and examine to what extent there are
programs or potential programs, and how those identifiable programs fit requirements for
program evaluation (log frame, indicators, etc.). International experience suggests that some
caution is required in respect of the following, when examining the traditional budget
presentation:

    0   The budget and the SIAF already classify the budget in terms of ministries (more
        specifically a portfolio) and other government agencies. The budget and the SIAF are
        also organized by spendingunits (unidadesejecutoras).
        "Programs" are generally a set of expenditures attached to an agency. However, these
        "programs" do not fit the concept of program for evaluation purposes. Besides, the
        numberof classification digits can also bemisleading (sometimes the concept of program
        appears to be better expressedat, say, 4 digits, some other times at 6 digits).


4.58    STRATEGIC INDICATORS. Peru also seeks to develop strategic indicators that measure
progress or achievements of key government programs. This is a new notion of "program".
Under this heading, "programs" ordinarily correspond to a few ideals or-at         best-goals that
identify each government's policy emphasis.         Typical examples are specific employment,
housing, or health goals. "Programs" so defined tend to involve a number of government
 agencies. Since these government programs are not formulated with all the conceptual and
empirical rigor of a logical framework, their evaluation can be undertaken while simultaneously
 advancing the performance managementindicators.

                   CharacteristicFeatures of the Chilean Evaluation System3'
4.59    The set of evaluation tools developed in Chile covers each of the three levels of public
administration: the macro-level (performance of public policies and programs); the intermediate
level (organizational performance); andthe micro-level (individual civil servant's or government
employee's performance). However, the different tools are not formally interlinked, so that they
do not amount to an integrated evaluation system.
4.60    The Government ProgramMonitoring System (Sistema de Seguimiento de Programacidn
Gubernamental) was created in 2000, to replace the Ministerial Targets system in effect from
1990 to1998.       The Monitoring System establishes three main areas-infrastructure,         social
programs, and economic programs-each of which has a related set of policies, with their
respective line ministries and government agencies responsible for their execution. The System
encompasses all 17 ministries and 105 agencies or departments attached to them. Each ministry
defines the objectives, actions, and specific outcomes, which are periodically monitored by the
Ministry of the General Secretariat of the Presidency. According to interviews with people who
took part indesigning and administering this System, it still needs to be more closely tied inwith
ministry and agency decision-making and coordinated with other government evaluation tools.
4.61    Government Program Evaluation got underway in 1997, designed to provide information
on the effectiveness and impact of government programs: aspects that could not be gauged with
the methodologies used to evaluate government agencies' performance. Its own methodology i s
based on the logical framework and the assessment is carried out by experts from civil society.
They analyze program design, organization, management, overall performance and results, come
up with an evaluation and, if necessary, put forward recommendations as to how to improve the
program concerned. Unlike other tools, Government Program Evaluation was to a large extent
shaped by models developed by international organizations, such as the Inter-American
Development Bank and the World Bank and its implementation was better funded. Between
 1997 and2001, approximately 25 percent of eligible public sector programs were evaluated.
4.62    In-depth Evaluations of Government Programs began in 2001. Their purpose is to delve
into aspects that the Government Program Evaluation methodology does not elucidate. These
evaluations are carried out by outside institutions, such as universities and consulting firms, and
require more on-site research, primary data gathering, and the processing and analysis of a larger
volume of information. As a result, they tend to be more time-consuming and expensive. In
2001, three programs were evaluatedinthis way.
4.63    Management Improvement Programs (Programas de Mejoramiento de Gesti6n-PMG)
came on stream in 1998, geared mainly to enhancing managementby introducing links between
degree of fulfillment of targets to which the organization committed itself and a series of
incentives. Thus, dependingon the success of their institution in achieving its objectives, civil
 servants may qualify for a wage increase the following year. The idea of using institutional
 incentives further down the road is currently being studied. These could include the elimination
 of certain operational and financial controls for organizations that meet the overall targets. The
 methodology usedby eachdepartmentto draft the PMGis framed by a whole set of management
 improvement areas common to all public sector institutions. A network of experts i s responsible

for supporting the Budget Directorate in the Ministry of Finance (DIPRES) in the design and
formulation of the institutions' PMG. The Government's General Internal Audit Council is
responsible for verifying compliance with the PMG.
4.64   Following a two-year period in which they were not applied, performance indicators
resurfaced in 2001.      Their principal purpose is to provide reliable information on the
performance of the different agencies for drawing up the National Budget and internal decision-
making within government bodies. The indicators focus on four aspects of an organization's
performance-efficiency, effectiveness, quality, and cost-and       are initially proposed by the
Ministry of Finance, then discussed with the institutions concerned. Once they have been
established, the indicators form part of the information attached to the draft Budget Law, which
specifies for each indicator the institutional outcome, how it i s calculated, past results or
amounts, the budget appropriations involved, and means of verification of outcomes. However,
judging by the interviews conducted, in practice very little attention is paid to performance
indicators for budget allocation purposes.
4.65    The Comprehensive Management Assessment (Balance de Gesti6n Integral) appeared in
 1997. It i s the vehicle used by each institution to convey its annual results to the National
Congress. The information provided includes a breakdown of the organization's targets, goals
and results, and draws on other evaluation tools, such as the PMG, the Government Program
Monitoring System, the Performance Indicators, and the Government Program Evaluations,
thereby serving in practice as one of the few instruments linking evaluation tools.          The
Comprehensive ManagementAssessments are publishedon the DIPRES website.
4.66    Two new evaluation tools were added to the kit in 2001. Still incipient in terms of their
 implementation, these are: the Central Resources Fund for Government Priorities and the
 Comprehensive Evaluation of Expenditure.

Rationalization of Asset Management for Transparency, Efficiency and Fiscal
Sustainability at Regional and Local Levels


4.67    ASSET   MANAGEMENT. "Asset management" refers to the rules, regulations, systems, and
practices with which the government manages its existing assets, both fixed assets of high value
(especially real estate) and other lesser assets that are part of the public sector's capital
Improper asset management can impose significant rigidities and inefficiencies in public
financial management. On the expenditure side, the public sector often needs to make additional
investments because of its inability to use existing assets due to improper titling, incomplete
inventory, or other reasons. On the revenue side, unproductive or unnecessary public sector
assets constitute a potential source of capital income, and they should be liquidated.
4.68     The Peruvian government and the Contaduria keep proper accounting records of State
shares in public or mixed corporations. The State maintains good inventory and control of its
movable assets. Therefore, the challenge ahead-and                 the focus of attention of this note-lies
with the State's real estate assets.
4.69     THE CHALLENGES AT THE NATIONAL                LEVEL.Good asset management requires asset
identification, registration, titling, valuation, patrimonial accounting, maintenance, control and
capacity to identify the best possible uses of the State's fixed assets and make decisions on their
uses and the allocation of proceeds. As a whole, the Peruvian government (and by extension
regional and local governments) lack a culture of modern asset management that (i)                      conceives
asset management as an essential component of fiscal responsibility and service delivery; (ii)
unifies objectives and criteria for the management of the State's fixed assets; and (iii)                 nurtures
reforms inprocesses, structures andpersonnel.
4.70     The first challenge in Peru is the institutionalization of responsibility and expertise for
asset management. Decentralization interrupted Peru's process of strengthening its national level
institutions for asset management. InPeru, the government's management of real estate assets
lags behind its more advanced management of movable assets, which include state shares in
public or public-private corporations. For its real estate assets, Peru still needs to consolidate
institutions capable of efficiently completing the ongoing process of asset identification,
valuation, regularization and registration, determination of potential uses, formulation of criteria
for rational utilization, including management and policy eval~ation.~~                    In the long-run, the
country envisions an integrated territorial information system that serves as the basis for
patrimonial accounting, asset management, and competitiveness enhancement at local and
regional levels.
4.71     The government i s focusing on the Superintendency of National Assets (SBN), whose
responsibilities include asset management regulation and supervision of standards and processes.
Previously, no single agency was given the lead role, and no single agency was given incentives
to develop a strategic vision on how to approach the subject of asset management. The


 31. Public corporations or mixed (public-private) corporations are often included under state assets. Peru has yet to
     define  the share and degree of intervention o f regional and local governments with respect to public
     corporations.
 32. The SBN has already registered 45,000 pieces of real estate (universe: 100,000 pieces) at the SINABIP,
     geographical location information system.

strengthening of the SBN and making it accountable for regulation and supervision addresses
these issues. The SBN is now preparing a comprehensive policy that would be enshrined in a
new law. Though the SBN stil1concentrates on real estate identification and regularization, the
                      -
challenges of valuation, maintenance, and/or the selection of assets that are worthy investments
still remain.         Additionally, the revenue potential of rational asset management remains
undetermined, and there i s enoughevidence to argue that it is largely untapped or usedillegally.
4.72      The SBN also fosters asset management capacity and otherwise provides technical
assistance to regional governments. The SBN has already promoted the establishment of the
ComitCs de Gesti6n Patrimonial (asset management committees) responsible for identification
and regularization of own assets at every government executing agency, including regional
levels.33 The SIAF i s already registering and providing information on the status of assets at
every executing agency.

Box 1. The CurrentState of PublicAssets inPeru
State allocationanduse of real estate appear to have beenimplicitly guided by the criteriaof necessaryuse. Those assets that are
needed at one point in time, for one or other state program, are either acquired, regularized, used, or liquidated. Some assets
gamer little or no attention. As a result,govemments have accumulateda varied array of properties andother assets, which, with
unclearlegalstatus andeconomic value, incompleteregistration,and irregularcontrol,constitute no solidbasison which to begin
applyingprofessionalmanagementcriteria. As a resultof all these factors, there is a substantialaccumulation of idle assets.

The complexlegal framework i s an additionalburden as it does not recognize market principles, nor does it provide adequately
for discretionarymanagerialactions. Needlessto say, the proceeds from asset management representonly anegligiblefractionof
state revenues.

Moving from the inventory phase to the asset management phase will require legal regularization of many idle assets. This
additional step is usually slower and more costly than the initial construction of the inventory-thereby,     it demands higher
capacity to select assets that are worth the necessaryinvestmentfor legalization. Movingto more selective-fiscal-criteria  will
oftenrequirelegalreform.

4.73      THECHALLENGES AT REGIONALAND LOCALLEVELS.                                   Decentralization increased the
number of governments and agencies involved to nearly 1,700. Similarly, the complexity and
challenge of institutional development as well as government andprivate sector mobilization has
also multiplied many times.                  One of the-legally        established-guiding           principles of Peru's
decentralization is that each service responsibility transferred to regional or local governments
needs to be accompaniedby the transfer of corresponding assets and resources allocated to the
provision of such service. The government issued a Supreme Decree (D.S.) for distribution of
real estate assets among levels of government. This D.S. supplements the organic laws for
regional and for local governments that already indicated which assets (and which revenues)
correspondto regional and local governments.
4.74      Though regional and local governments must comply with national laws and regulations
on asset management, they also enjoy considerable autonomy regarding asset management
decisions. The necessary (national) legal framework has not been completed,34and current laws
andregulations are not always known or understood at the local and regional levels. Though it is
evident that developing a modern asset management culture and corresponding institutional

33.    350 such committees have already beenestablished
34. The LFD already includes some references to the National System of Public Assets (Sistema de Bienes
       Nacionales). The Organic Law of the Executive Branch (Ley Orga'nica del Poder Ejecutivo- LOPE), currently
       in preparation, will also include specific references to the SBN and the national system. Still, further
       consolidation of the National System of Public Assets-created by a ministerial regulation (Reso1ucidn)-will
       require issuanceof the proposed Law on the System of Public Assets.

capacity at all levels of government will take many years, there i s an urgent needto complete the
regulatory framework, disseminate national standards and processes, consolidate capacity at the
national level, and develop linkages between national and regional and local authorities for the
provision of technical assistance, or otherwise strengthen capacity at regional and local levels. It
i s necessary that the SBN alert regional and local governments about their responsibilities,
further disseminate the regulatory framework, and provide guidance on the most effective ways
to comply with them.
4.75      THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REFORM. Cultural changes are medium to long-term projects.
However, there now appears to be a good opportunity to place asset management reform on the
agenda of government and civil society of Peru. Current pressures to finance regional and local
governments have ledthe government to look at the proceedsfrom proper asset managementas a
potential source of revenues for regional investment and competitiveness. Such proceeds could
also contribute to the creation of regional and local emergency funds. As regional and local
governments move into credit markets, marketable assets can be used as collateral to improve
borrowing terms. Last but not least, the proceeds of asset management might finance the
necessaryreserves for regional or local stabilization funds-particularly                          for years of lower-than-
expectedfiscal transfers.

Box 2. PublicAssetsManagement: Progress to Date
Due to lack of patrimonial accounting, adequate policy and effective control, public government agencies maintainuseless assets
or give them suboptimal uses and poor maintenance. The MEF has already identified the lack of credible, publicly known
information on public assets as a priority problem for responsible asset and overall fiscal management. It has also selected the
 transformation of traditional asset tenancy into modem asset management as one of the key challengesthe country has to meet in
order to alleviate fiscal pressure in the short run and ensure fiscal sustainability for the medium and long term. Moreover, the
 government i s aware of the fact that the introduction of modem asset managementi s a cultural issue that needs to involve private
 firms and communities. Therefore, the Govemment has a great interest in the generation of an institutional environment that
 stimulates good public asset management.

 4.76     REFORMPROPOSALS.                    With reforms either in their infancy, challenges for asset
 management are numerous. Three major challenges are to be addressed over the next few years.
 First, progress needs to be made on an inventory of real estate assets. This should be done
 promptly so that the part of the inventory that has already been completed does not become
 totally out of date. The second challenge is to effectively design and execute new policies based
 on criteria encouraging the keeping of useful and productive assets and mandating the release
 from state ownership of unproductive assets which have no direct connection with governmental
 missions. Third, all state-owned assets have to be managed according to strict parameters of
 efficiency and transparency.
 4.77      The final goal of the reform is to build capacity and institutional culture in public
 agencies responsible for managing public assets in an efficient and effective way.                                            By
 strengtheninggovernment capacity to rationalize tenancy and the use of public assets, this policy
 will contribute to enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of public finance.
 4.78      KEYPOLICY ACTIONS. The key actions for Peru's formulation and implementation of
  asset managementpolicy may be divided into the short andmedium-term:

    0      Short-term policy actions.
                o Develop a framework for asset management which defines the scope of
                      government action and policy. This i s crucial since at present no entity in the
                      national government is incharge of asset management, and strategy, policies, and


                                                                 61

                                                                                                       Annex 4C


                 procedures have to be developed almost from scratch. The scope of this initial
                 work also includes operational planning for maintaining the real estate property
                 cadaster (with verification of title, possession, value and accounting registration).
            o Implement apilot programconducive to quickresults with positive fiscal impact.
            o Strengthenregional committees with the technical assistance of alimitedgroup of
                 external consultants, for the dual purpose of executing certain actions pertaining
                 to this first stage, and coordinating the execution of other actions by government
                 agencies and betweennational, regional and local governments.


  0     Medium-termpolicv actions. Subsequentactions include: (i) SBNdevelopsManuals
                                                                                 The
        of Policies and Procedures, provides technical assistance and overall guidance to other
        participating agencies, and is responsible for the centralized management of a Database
        system; and (ii)Development of a more flexible and open-minded approach to
        concessions, leasing, privatization, outsourcing, etc., and the publication of the inventory
        of assets owned by each agency, thereby increasing transparency and accountability.
4.79    TAL PROJECT        SUPPORT.      The above goals correspond to a short and medium-term
comprehensive policy for asset management. This project's support for asset managementi s part
of a larger program for strengthening capacity and advances asset identification, valuation, and
regularization at all levels of government. This includes the design of a strategic plan to create
the necessary institutional framework and organizational capacity to implement reforms geared
to attaining consistent, updated and standardizedasset information and efficient management by
andamong public agencies.
4.80    A substantial part of this larger rogram is geared towards installing capacity similar to
the SBN in each regional government?' More specifically, the Bank TAL project will support
the SBN's extension programs for regional and local governments geared to: (i)creating
responsible units for asset management within regional or local governments; (ii)                        training
regional staff in the legal and regulatory framework; (iii)         strengthening the capacity of the SBN
for monitoring and supervision of regional and local government^;^^ and (iv) establishing a link
to the forthcoming accreditation law with a "graduation" or "certification" system for asset
managementat regional andlocal levels.37




35. The SBN is already implementing a pilot project for training and otherwise developing such a capacity at the
    Regional Government of Piura.
36. Connectivity will be based on the already established SIAF network. The SBN already has legal authority to
    monitor and supervise asset management at the regional level. It is expected that the proposed LOPE and the
    announced Law on the National System of Public Assets will extend the SBN monitoring and supervision
    capacity to municipal governments.
31. In the case of Peru, the SBN needs to coordinate the institutional building process in order to ensure effective
    and efficient monitoring and supervision.

Summary of FinancialManagement Assessment
7.1     A Financial Management (FM) Assessment was performed in order to evaluate the
proposed financial management arrangements and the implementing entity's capacity to provide
the Bank with accurate and timely information regarding resources and expenditures. The
assessment (performed jointly with the Procurement Capacity Assessment) was conducted on
March 26,2004 in accordancewith OPBP 10.02 andthe Guidelines for Assessment of Financial
Management Arrangements inWorld Bank Financed Projects. The full text of the assessment is
available in the project files. The assessment encompassed a review of the organizational
structure and staffing of the UCPS, flow of funds arrangements, accounting policies and
procedures, budgeting, information systems, internal controls, internal audit, reporting and
monitoring, external audit and the impact of procurement arrangements.
OverallSummary and Conclusion
7.2     The USPS has maintained a satisfactory record during the implementation of the
Accountability for Decentralization in the Social Sectors PPF and, overall, the proposed project
financial management arrangementsare satisfactory to the Bank. The Financial Managementrisk
rating of Medium(a composite of inherent andcontrolrisks) has been assignedinorder to reflect
the following strengths and capacity constraints. The UCPS is adequately staffed with key
professional personnel; Accounting and Financial Reporting functions will abide by national
standards and will be executed through the mandatory national financial management system
(SIAF); there are adequatearrangementsfor internal audit, to be performedby staff of the Office
of the Comptroller General. The key constraints include (i) lack an Integrated Information
                                                              the
Systemto support adequatemonitoringand controlduring implementation and (ii)the lack of an
Operations Manual with procedures that include the Bank's requirements for financial
management.
CountryFinancialManagementCapacity
7.3      The Government has been committed to improving transparency and access to
information and to promoting better governance and administration of public finances. The
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted in 2001 concluded that the
financial tools at the disposal of Congress and Executive Branch comprised (i) financial
                                                                                   robust
administration legislation (ii) highly dedicated staff and (iii) effective integrated financial
                                                                 an
management system (SIAF). The major recommendations of the CFAA concerned (i)                 more
effective oversight by Congress of the budget process and review of the allocations of available
funding (ii)more detailed and frequent reporting on expenditures to Congress and (iii)  unfettered
 surveillance andreporting by the Controller General of the acts and reports of the executive.
7.4      Three indispensable elements of a sound fiduciary framework were built into the CAS
 andpolicy framework for the PSRL11: (i)   strengtheningof congressional oversight of the use of
public funds; (ii) increased independence of the Comptroller General; and (iii)   expansion of the
 scope and coverage of the integratedfinancial management system (SIAF).

related to expenditures and revenues for the national budget. SIAF is a powerful repository of
details on financial transactions.     At central government level, there are four modules:
Treasurymudget       Execution,  Accounting,     Financial Statements Generation and Debt
Management. Budget classifications are integrated into the chart of accounts. Information
generated is put to good use by the MEF and spending agencies. The implementation of the
system has promoted effective control, optimum cash management and informed decision
making.
7.6     SIAF has included a loan module for use by projects which manage funds from
multilateral institutions. However, the module in its present form has some constraints. The
Financial Management Team has been working with the MEF Information Systems Team to
recommend enhancements to the SZAF that would provide more complete and integrated
informationon the use of project and counterpart funds andwould obviate the use of parallel and
duplicate information systems. The project has been advised to contact the MEF IT Team in
order to initiatethe processof implementation of the revised module, within the UCPS.

Mitigationof Capacity Constraints

7.7      In order to mitigate the identified risks, the following activities are considered crucial:
prior to negotiations: (i)Submission of pro-forma Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) to
facilitate monitoring and project execution and (ii)    Submission of a Draft Outline Operations
Manual for review by the Bank.
7.8      In addition, the following activities were identified as conditions for effectiveness: (i)
adoption of the Operations Manual and the annual operations plan for the first year of the
Project, once reviewed by the Bank; (ii)       the general coordinator for the Project has been
appointed under terms of reference, qualification and experience satisfactory to the Bank; and,
(iii) UCPShasadoptedfinancialandprocurementmanagementsystems,satisfactorytothe
     the
Bank.
7.9      Supervision during implementation. The project should be monitored on a semi-
annual basis during the first two (2) years of implementation and thereafter through at least one
supervision visit each year. Furthermore, the audit reports will be relied upon and the Annual
Audit Report Review will highlight the adequacy of internal controls, integrity of financial
reporting and efficiency in the use of projects funds. Desk Reviews will also be performed on
the semi-annual FMRs, prepared in form and substance in a manner acceptable to the Bank.
These would be submitted no later than 45 days after the end of each six- monthperiod.
7.10     Audit Arrangements.        The annual audit reports, covering the project financial
statements will be prepared in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and
will be furnished to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each year. The terms of
reference will be prepared in accordance with current regional guidelines.          The process of
 selection and contracting will be overseenby the Comptroller General of the Republic, who will
coordinate to ensure selection of eligible audit firms, delivery of acceptable reports within the
time frames set out inthe legal agreement and adequate quality control.

7.11 Disbursement Arrangements. Disbursements will be transaction-based (Le., against
statements of expenditure (SOEs), full documentation, direct payments or special commitments).
The Special Account will be maintained and operated by the project in Banco de la Nucidn in
UnitedStates dollars. Deposits into the Special Account andreplenishmentsup to the authorized
allocation set out in the legal agreement would be made on the basis of applications for
withdrawals prepared by the project and accompanied by supporting documentation in
accordancewith Bank disbursementprocedures.
7.12    Special Account. As described previously, the project will have access to funds
advanced by the Bank to the Special Account for processing disbursements to beneficiaries for
those eligible expenditures under the project activities. The Bank will deposit, upon borrower's
request, an amount of $ 700,000 as authorized allocation. This amount should be limited to the
amount of $500,000 untilthe disbursementsfrom the loan account exceed $2,000,000.
7.13    Use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). Withdrawal from the loan account couldbe
made on the basis of SOEs for the following expenditures: (i)        goods under contracts not
exceeding $500,000 equivalent; (ii)consulting services from individuals and firms under
contracts not exceeding $50,000 and $100,000 equivalent respectively; and (iii)  operating costs.
All supporting documents for which withdrawal applications from the loan account are made on
the basis of SOEs, the borrower will retain full documentation (including contracts, purchase
orders, invoices, receipts and any other documents evidencing such expenditures) and make them
available for review and examination by Bank staff in supervision missions and by the external
auditors when performing the audit of the project accounts.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implement procurement

8.8     Procurement activities will be carried out by the UCPS (the Spanishacronym for Unidud
de Coordinacibn de Progrumas Especiales), the Project Unit designated by MEF to be
responsiblefor implementation andoverall project coordination.
8.9     The Project Unit is staffed with 17 professionals and procurement functions will be
performed by the UCPS's Sector Specialists assignedto the project, in coordination with project
beneficiary agencies.
8.10    In addition to describe implementation and institutional arrangements, administrative
procedures for preparation of POAs, budget, procurement arrangements and procurement plan
that will govern project implementation, the Manual will incorporate standard procurement
documents, as agreed upon with the Bank, as an Annex to it. A draft POM will be submitted to
the Bank for review and comments prior to loan negotiations, and a final version submitted and
agreednot later than loan effectiveness.

8.11 An assessment of the capacity of MEF's UCPS to implement procurement actions for the
project was carried out by Keisgner Alfaro, Sr. Procurement Specialist, on September 2, 2002,
and updated later on March 24, 2004. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for
implementing the project and the interaction between the project's sector specialists incharge of
project procurement functions and tasks andproject beneficiary agencies.
8.12   Among relevant risks identified at the UCPS are the lack of an integrated Management
and Information System (MIS) which could be otherwise helpful in monitoring and control
project performance, decision making andprogressreporting.
8.13    In order to manage this shortcoming, the UCPS will submit a plan to the Bank team for
adoption, adjustment, and gradual incorporation of a procurement informationmodule developed
already within the integrated financial administration system (SIAF) that will enable recording,
monitoring and reporting of procurement transactions / actions even at the contract execution
stage. Integration of both information modules within SIAF is expected to strengthen the
UCPS's capacity to manage procurement and FM tasks.               In addition to building national
capacity, successful implementation use of SIAF as an integrated managementtool in these two
project fiduciary areas is expectedto provide a good ground for the use of localcountry systems.
8.14    The Bank fiduciary team met with the MEF's ITteam and get its confirmation inorder to
start implementingthe procurement module developed within SIAF for the UCPS team. Inorder
to mitigate the above-identified risk the following activities are considered crucial.
8.15    The UCPS will submit to the Bank before loan negotiations: (i)           an action plan to
gradually incorporate the SIAF system into the project as official monitoring and reporting tool.
The action plan will provide an estimated date to start submitting project progress reports on
Procurement and FMwith SIAF; (ii)      a Draft Outline Operations Manual for review by the Bank
and; (iii)a formal organizational chart and related staffing in order to accurately define
employment of consultants to be financed with Bank proceeds from either the Social TAL or
DECSAL TAL.
8.16    Before effectiveness the Procurement Specialist will continue to work with the project
unit to ensure: (i)implementation of the procurement module into SIAF; and (ii)       completion of
and Bank approval to the Operations Manuals. This latter tasks will be included as a condition
for loan effectiveness.
 8.17   The overall project riskfor procurement is AVERAGE.

 C. ProcurementPlan

 8.18   During the appraisal mission, the Government implementing agency submitted to the
Bank the procurement plan for the project lifetime and the first year of project implementation.
 Both plans were preparedfollowing guidelines and sample formats providedby the Bank. Upon
 Bank review of the plan and discussion with project staff team, it received procurement
 clearance subjected to the incorporation of minor changes later as a condition for project
 implementation.    Both plans are available at the PIU and the Bank Offices in Lima and
 Washington DC.

D. Prior review thresholds

8.19   Proposed thresholds for prior review are based primarily on the findings of the capacity
assessment exercises carried out at each implementingunit during project appraisal mission and
in past performance of the PIU unit to be involved in project implementation. They have been
summarized in Table A attached below per each type of procurement contract. Thresholds
correspond to those assignedto high risk agencies, consistent with thresholds issuedby the RPA
Office for LAC Countries, per e-mail dated as of 12/ 27/2002.

E. Frequency ofProcurementSupervision

8.20    As provided inthe reports of findings and actions concerning the performance of Agency
Capacity Assessment exercises at PCU, each agency has been assigned a risk level to administer
procurement functions indicated as follows.      The Bank supervision team shall conduct two
procurement supervision missions per year, including a special procurement supervision for ex-
post review/audits, pursuant to the risk level assignedto each agency.

9.3       Effectiveness gains are perceived operational achievements in the prompt attainment of
key goals (outcomes). As explained above, these are a result from previous and on-going
reforms on budget, cash management, accounting and public credit and investment. SIAF, has
allowed to (i)        enter financial transactions only once and without delays; (ii)                      improve the
allocation of budget approved resources by function, program, sub-program, project, activities
and region; (iii)a dramatic increase in budget execution by some ministries; and (iv) an
improved targeting of public investment on poorest populations. Supported by a poverty map,
the SIAF also allows making incidence analysis of all social programs and intergovernmental
transfers. Under the TAL, addedeffectiveness gains will result.
Table A9.2 Some Effectiveness and Efficiency Gainsfrom SIAF




Source: MEFISIAF.

9.4       Efficiency gains are reduced administrative costs (or additional revenue) incurred for
obtaining a given unit of output. The SIAF has essentially introduced an overhaul in the
combination of resources (inputs) by the main financial management systems leading to a
reduction in the unit-costs of obtaining specific outputs. These include (i)                        a reduction in the
 amount of cash shortages of counterpart funds to external projects, a major bottleneck in the
PRE-SIAF era that prolonged the project execution period and augmented the loan commitment
fees associated to it; (ii) enhanced registry and use of extra-budgetary accounts and donor
                                   an
 grants, so as to make an optimal and complementary use of them in project execution; (iii)
proper cross-checking of taxpayers statements registered by the SRI with payments done to state
 suppliers of public goods and services, thus increasing tax revenue; and (iv) an increased
 flexibility in the management of budget reallocations, thus increasing the efficiency in their use.
 Table A9.2 summarizes other effectiveness and efficiency gains from introducing SIAF in Peru.

Under the TAL, introducing a system of monitoring indicators should lead to further efficiency
gains.
9.5      Overall Economic and Financial Impact of the TAL: Under the TAL, expected
additional sources of fiscal savings, and efficiency and effectiveness gains can be summarized
per component as follows (see Table A9.3 below)
