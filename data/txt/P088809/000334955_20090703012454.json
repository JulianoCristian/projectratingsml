to introduce\n            the following changes in the project and any accompanying\n            amendments to the legal documents: (i) an adjustment of the\n            scope of the project following a partial cancellation\n            request of $2.16 million received from the Borrower on April\n            14, 2008; (ii) a consequent revision of the outcome\n            indicators and the monitoring and evaluation framework as\n            well as a slight revision of the project development\n            objective (PDO) to include the central Government within the\n            activities of the project; (iii) a project closing date\n            extension to September 30, 2010 to allow the completion of\n            the activities supported by the loan; and (iv) adjustments\n            to the institutional arrangements in the project's\n            operational manual to take into consideration organizational\n            changes in one of the six sub-executing units. The\n            restructuring aims to respond to the evolving\n            Borrower's needs and priorities in the area of fiscal\n            decentralization. The project has suffered significant\n            implementation delays, due in part to the change in\n            administration shortly after the project was approved, and\n            specifically to the process of adjusting the project\n            activities to the priorities of the new administration."}, "docdt": "2009-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
