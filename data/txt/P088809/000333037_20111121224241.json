for Peru were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: guaranteeing country's\n            ownership of a realistic results framework could facilitate\n            its use as management tool. This project highlights the\n            trade-off between having clarity of purpose and allowing\n            sufficient flexibility to cope with rapidly changing\n            circumstances. Being realistic about the time required to\n            implement technical assistance-related projects might render\n            better results. Validating the assessment of risks\n            throughout the life of the project might facilitate\n            implementation. Implementing a project with multiple\n            sub-executing units might impose additional challenges to\n            outcome delivery. Addressing actual managerial and technical\n            capacities in Peru remains critical for a successful decentralization."}, "docdt": "2011-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
