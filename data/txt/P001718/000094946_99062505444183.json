levels. Regardless of success, the key lessons convey\n            that: 1) on policy matters, sector reforms produce major\n            impacts when complemented by adequate sector investments,\n            proven by the ample effect of price and trade measures, and,\n            enhanced by investments in agriculture and irrigation.\n            Investments and sector reforms should be placed within a\n            conducive macro framework, i.e., proper currency valuation\n            in a low inflationary environment; 2) on institutional\n            matters, the creation of a special commission, which can\n            prove effective with difficult institutional reforms,\n            particularly when it involves more that one entity, should\n            preferably be headed by an independent agency. Community\n            involvement ensures the sustainability of irrigation\n            investments, since their presence at different management\n            levels may contribute to greater water fee recovery. This\n            water fee should be set through an independent process, free\n            from government interference; 3) on implementation matters,\n            adequate coordination is essential for its synergy and\n            complementarity, successfully impacts both sector policy and\n            investments; and 4) on technical matters, canal design needs\n            to conform to the maintenance system; and thorough technical\n            monitoring is required for quality assurance."}, "docdt": "1999-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
