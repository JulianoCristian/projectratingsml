                          THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
                SECOND COMMUNITY LIVING STANDARDS GRANT (CLSG-2)

Borrower              The Republic of Rwanda
Implementing          Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Local Government, and Ministry of
Agencies              Health
Financing Data        Type: IDA grant. Terms: Single tranche to be released on
                      effectiveness of the operation. Amount: SDR 3.9 million (US$6
                      million equivalent).
Operation Type        CLSG-2 is the second of three programmatic development policy
                      grant operations of similar size, approximately one year apart.
Main Policy           Social Protection and Community Health, Nutrition, and Population.
Areas
Key Outcome           Social Protection: After three years, the Vision 2020 Umurenge
Indicators            Program (VUP)1 supported by this grant will be assessed with
                      reference to (i) of those households eligible for support, the
                      percentage that are granted public works in a sample of VUP pilot
                      Sectors (2008: 35%; 2009: 35%; 2011: 35%); (ii) of those households
                      eligible for support, the percentage that are granted direct support in a
                      sample of VUP pilot Sectors (2008: 0%; 2009: 60%; 2011: 80%); and
                      (iii) the proportion of households in the bottom two categories of
                      extreme poverty in a sample of VUP pilot Sectors (2008: 28.7%;
                      2009:< 28.7%; 2011: < 28.7%).
                      Community Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP): At the end of
                      three years, HNP policy reforms will be assessed with reference to (iv)
                      increase in the proportion of married women aged 15-49 years using
                      modern contraceptives (2008: 27%; 2011: 38%); (v) increase in the
                      proportion of children under-five with diarrhea who receive oral
                      rehydration therapy (2008: 30%; 2011: 50%); (vi) increase in the
                      proportion of births that are cared for in an accredited health facility
                      (2008: 45%; 2011: 50%); and (vii) increase in the annual per capita
                      allocation to performance-based financing (PBF) for health facilities
                      and community health cooperatives (2008: US$1.45; 2011:
                      US$2.25).
                      With one exception, these indicators are part of the Common
                      Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF), which governs general
                      budget support for the Government of Rwanda (GoR).2 All indicators
                      are agreed between GoR and development partners.
Program               The Program Development Objective is to support the GoR's social
Development           protection and health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme

  The exception is "Utilization of oral rehydration therapy', which is an intermediate outcome indicator relating
to both child mortality and nutritional status, key outcomes of the Second Health Sector Strategy Plan (HSSP-II).

Strategy (CAS)        The operation will support GoR's poverty reduction objectives,
                      consistent with the country's fiscal framework and the second
                      strategic theme of the CAS, which is to reduce social vulnerability and
                      "to ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans also benefit from
                      growth and to help Rwanda make further progress in building a more
                      stable society. A smaller program will support the Flagship Vision
                      2020 Umurenge initiative; help Rwanda get on track on child and
                      mortality goals..."3
Risks and Risk        The main risks to the program arise from: (i) continued global
Mitigation            economic slowdown; (ii) continued instability in the Great Lakes sub-
                      region and its effects on economic stability and donor support; and
                      (iii) implementation challenges (including capacity challenges and the
                      use of SACCOs4 to make payments to beneficiaries). The first two
                      risks are mitigated by increasing the predictability of aid flows--
                      specifically, by applying a higher proportion of international
                      assistance on-budget and allocating more predictable financing
                      towards the highest-priority activities. The GoR is also working
                      closely with IMF to assess policy measures to help mitigate the impact
                      of the global financial crisis. Related efforts include a Memorandum
                      of Understanding (MoU) and Common Performance Assessment
                      Framework (CPAF) agreed between GoR and donors to harmonize
                      support and govern the provision of direct budget support for
                      implementation of Rwanda's Economic Development and Poverty
                      Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). In the health sector, the risk to
                      implementation due to capacity constraints is mitigated by support to
                      the GoR by the Bank, UNICEF, USAID and other donors. On the
                      social protection side, the risk evolving from the use of SACCOs to
                      make payments to beneficiaries under the VUP program is being
                      raised with GoR. Implementation risks under the CLSG operation
                      will be further addressed through the provision of support to assess the
                      VUP pilots and their impact on targeted households, and to increase
                      the sustainability of program activities within budget constraints.

          PROPOSED SECOND COMMUNITY LIVING STANDARDS GRANT
                             TO RWANDA


                                           INTRODUCTION


1.      Rwanda is one of Africa's most densely populated countries, with its modest
geographical size accommodating an estimated population of 9.6 million.5 It is also
among the poorest, despite having made significant progress in the past decade. The
proportion of the population that national household surveys identified as poor decreased
slightly from 60 percent in 2000-01 to 57 percent in 2005-06. However, because of relatively
rapid population growth estimated at 2.7 percent per year and an increase in income
inequality, the estimated total number of people living in poverty rose from 4.8 million in
2000-01 to 5.4 million in 2005-06. More than 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas, and
poverty remains deep and pervasive.

2.      Despite strong economic growth, progress towards the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) is uneven. Rwanda is on track to achieve the MDGs in access to primary
education, gender parity, malaria incidence, and HIV prevalence.6 However, with a poverty
rate of 57 percent, considerable effort will be needed to meet the MDGs to reduce poverty and
hunger, maternal mortality, and child mortality.

3.      Rwanda's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) for
2008-12 "builds on strong achievements in human capital development and promotes
three flagship programs" to accelerate growth and reduce poverty. These flagship
programs focus on (a) encouraging a pattern of growth that creates jobs and increases exports;
(b) strengthening governance; and (c) accelerating poverty reduction "by promoting pro-poor
components of the national growth agenda" and "releasing the productive capacity of the poor
in rural areas through a combination of public works, direct support and credit packages."7
The Vision 2020 Umurenge8 Program (VUP), announced in March 2007 and subsequently
incorporated in EDPRS, constitutes the flagship poverty reduction program. A pilot that
served as a precursor to VUP was also included in the Bank's Third Poverty Reduction
Support Grant operation in FY2007. Additional complementary interventions to achieve
EDPRS objectives include improving health status and slowing down population growth by
increasing access to basic Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP) services. In support of

  The Government has progressively devolved responsibilities and transferred resources to decentralized levels
of the administration--Province, District, Sector (Umurenge), Cell (Akagari), and Village (Umudugudu). Of
these, the last three are subordinate tiers of the district governments. The VUP and community health reforms
are being implemented through this newly restructured, decentralized local government system. Also see Annex

these objectives, the Government has initiated a set of policy reforms to expand access to
basic health services at the community level.

4.      The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda has, as its second
strategic theme, a reduction in social vulnerability by ensuring that the most vulnerable
Rwandans also benefit from growth and by helping Rwanda make further progress in
building a more stable society.9 The proposed operation is the second phase of a three-year
Community Living Standards Grant (CLSG) development policy operation that is consistent
with the second CAS theme. It supports policy reforms in the public works and direct support
components of the VUP and will also help Rwanda get on track with child and maternal
mortality goals. It aims to achieve quick results in the areas of poverty reduction and
improved health outcomes, even in the midst of the ongoing global economic and financial
crisis. The operation's Program Development Objective is to support GoR's social
protection and health policy reforms designed (i) to reduce extreme poverty, initially in
30 pilot Sectors, and (ii) to expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and
population interventions at the community level.

5.    Under the First Community Living Standards Grant (CLSG-1), implemented
during the first year of the EDPRS (2008-2009), policy actions were focused on ensuring
that:

·    Reforms followed international good practice in the domain of social protection policies,
     including the adoption of a non-distortionary wage policy for public works, direct
     payment of workers without intermediaries,10 and determination of direct support benefits
     to poor families with no adult labor based on the household as a unit; and

·    Health policies expanded poor households' access at the community level to high-impact
     HNP interventions,11 through the adoption of a community HNP service package, a
     community health policy implementation plan, a community performance-based financing
     strategy, and a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).

6.     The proposed Second Community Living Standards Grant (CLSG-2) continues
support in these areas over 2010-2011. On the social protection side, policy actions will
focus on ensuring that the Government's reforms include voluntary savings, and a process for
determining eligibility that is clear and transparent to all potential recipients and non-

   Since December 2008, Rwandan policy has required that all wage payments and other payments made by the
government to individuals and other private entities be made by direct deposit into an account for the individual
or entity in a bank or financial institution. An individual entitled to receive such payments must have or create
an account in a bank or financial institution into which the payment can be made. In the context of this
operation, and within the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP), payment of wages under the public works
program and of household benefits under the direct support program will be into such an account. Furthermore,
the policy requires that private contractors are neither involved in making payments to VUP workers or
beneficiaries nor in selecting the participants in the VUP public works or direct support programs, nor in
determining their wage payments. However, private contractors can be used within the VUP for other purposes
such as providing technical advice or supervising specific activities.
11
   "High-impact" interventions are those that have had high impact on reducing disease burden in developing
countries. Examples include: use of insecticide-treated bed-nets (ITN), integrated management of childhood
illnesses, and the expanded program on immunization.
                                                       2
recipients because it makes program policy and procedures widely known and selection
outcomes publicly available. On the HNP side, policy actions will focus on the creation of an
incentive strategy to encourage demand for maternal health services, skills development for
community health workers (CHWs), and design of a randomized evaluation to assess the
impact of these reforms.

7.     The second single-tranche development policy operation (DPO) is proposed to
total SDR 3.9 million IDA financing. Co-financing of the program is expected from the
Health Results Innovation Trust Fund. The first operation was SDR 4 million IDA financing,
with co-financing from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund. The proposed series of
three operations is estimated to total SDR 12 million (of the order of US$18 million) IDA
financing and potentially US$10 to 12 million from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN RWANDA

8.     Rwanda's US$4.5 billion economy has remained resilient over the last five years,
sustaining macroeconomic stability and real GDP growth despite the global economic
slowdown and exogenous shocks that affected agricultural productivity. However,
compared to other countries in the region, and Sub-Saharan Africa on average, Rwanda has
experienced a relatively more severe reduction in growth trends in 2009, which poses a
serious threat to poverty reduction. The 3 to 4 percentage point reduction in GDP growth,
from 5-year historical trends to levels estimated for 2009, is due both to the global crisis and
to domestic liquidity issues. Lower projected growth between 2008 and 2009 results from
lower growth in agriculture and a substantial stagnation in the industry and services sector.

9.      Overall, the global financial crisis, has led to lower export performance, GDP
growth and revenues. The impact of the global economic and financial crisis is expected to
be manifested through three main channels: (a) declining external demand for Rwandan
goods and services (mainly for tourism and mineral exports); (b) slumping commodity prices,
particularly for minerals; and (c) scarcer financial inflows, including foreign direct
investment.

10.     Prudent implementation of macro-economic policies and protection of priority
spending have enabled the Government to manage the impact of the crisis. Inflationary
pressures are expected to decrease in the rest of 2009 as international commodity and food
prices fall and government manages the exchange rate, leading to its improved flexibility
while increasing the coordination between monetary and fiscal policies. Import growth
exceeded the increase in exports, leading to a deterioration of the balance of payments in 2008
and 2009. The current account deficit widened in 2009 compared to 2008 due, in part, to a
worsening in the terms of trade. (For further information about recent economic developments
in Rwanda, please refer to Annex 5).

  This section draws heavily from the program document for Rwanda's Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Grant
(PRSG-6) and is consistent with its macro framework.

11.     The expansionary fiscal stance of the past year or two has moderated in 2009. A
gradual reduction in resources was planned for the period 2009/10, based on anticipated lower
levels of revenues and external resources (compared to disbursements in 2008). In the
financial sector, aside from the liquidity ratio, financial indicators remained within their
prudential benchmarks; and the stability of the banking sector has at present not been
adversely affected by the global financial situation. Rwanda's financial sector moved from a
situation of structural excess liquidity to a potential structural liquidity deficit, partly due to
efficiency gains from ongoing reforms in the sector as well as National Bank of Rwanda's
(NBR) low interest rate policy. The liquidity shortages exposed weaknesses in risk
management and governance of commercial banks, i.e. a mismatch in credit maturities (for
bank borrowing and lending). In response to the tightening liquidity situation, the NBR
injected liquidity of approximately 1.5 percent of GDP into the economy. Reserve money
remains the anchor of the monetary program.

12.     Poor people have grown in number and live mostly in rural areas. The country's
original target for MDG 1 was to reduce the proportion of the population living under the
poverty line to 30 percent by 2015. The GoR's more recent EDPRS aims to lower the share of
the population living under the upper poverty line to 46 percent, and those living in extreme
poverty to 24 percent by 2012 (see Table 1). Based on the latest available household survey
(EICV2, 2005-06), which preceded recent policy initiatives, only modest improvements in
poverty levels were achieved in the period 2001-2005.

Defined as per capita consumption equivalent to less             Defined at RWF 250 equivalent (around US$0.45)
than RWF 175 (around US$0.29) per day13. This                    daily consumption per adult14. This indicates that
represents the level of expenditure needed to provide            some 57 percent of the population, or 5.4 million
minimum food requirements of 2,100 kilocalories per              people, were under this line in 2005-06, of whom 92
adult per day. In 2005-06, one-third of the population,          percent lived in rural areas. Poverty has been
or about 3.5 million people, (93 percent of them living          modestly reduced from 60.4 percent of the population
in rural areas), did not reach this level of average daily       under the upper poverty line in 2000-01 to 56.9
consumption.                                                     percent in 2005-06.

13.    Of Rwanda's estimated population of 9.6 million in mid-2008, 44 percent are
below the age of 15. With a current population growth rate estimated at 2.7 percent per year,
leading to a doubling of the population in 26 years,15 and with the second-highest population
density in the Africa Region, Rwanda is facing increasing pressure to address challenges of
poverty, nutrition, health and population in an increasingly youthful population that
contributes to population momentum.

14.     Child mortality and other health indicators have improved significantly since
2000, although malnutrition, maternal mortality, and socio-economic disparities in
health outcomes remain concerns. Rwanda has made considerable progress in a number of
health indicators in recent years, including under-five mortality, which declined from 196 per

1,000 live births in 2000 to 103 per 1,000 in 2008. Considerable progress is particularly
evident in malaria control, with a reported two-thirds decrease in incidence since 2000. The
use of modern contraceptives increased dramatically, from 4 percent to 27 percent, between
2000 and 2008, and the proportion of deliveries in health facilities rose from 27 percent to 45
percent in the same period. Maternal mortality for the period 2000-04 is estimated at 750 per
100,000 live births. Rates of both child and maternal mortality are still high. Consistent with
poverty estimates, malnutrition rates are significant, with the prevalence of stunting among
under-five children at 45 percent in 2005-06. Socio-economic disparities also remain an
important concern, with 55 percent of under-five children in the lowest quintile showing
stunting in 2005-06, compared to 30 percent in the highest quintile.16


MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

15.     The GoR's medium term outlook for real GDP growth has been revised
downward slightly to around 5 percent (see Table 2). A projected annual GDP growth
of between 5 and 6 percent would be sustained through increased public and private
sector investments to improve agricultural productivity and address infrastructure
constraints to growth. The share of priority spending is expected to increase annually by
about 2 percent of GDP, depending on the availability of sufficient resources. More resources
will be dedicated to public infrastructure, agriculture, education, health and water. In the
health sector, focus will be on financing programs to improve primary health care, financing
of the mutuelle scheme17 and the purchase of drugs. At the decentralized level, transfers to
Districts are projected to increase as the Government implements its fiscal decentralization
policy. Beyond the allocation of funds for poverty-related expenditures, improving the
efficiency and targeting of such spending remains a significant challenge. The GoR is
therefore focusing on strengthening the institutional framework for the public investment
program on the prioritization process within sectors, and on increasing the accountability of
line ministries.

16.     Consistent with the medium-term policy objective of maintaining macroeconomic
stability, the Central Bank is expected to contain inflationary pressures from any fiscal
expansion and scaled-up external assistance. Whereas the consumer price index grew by
22.3 percent during 2008, it is expected to grow during 2009 and 2010 at 6 and 5 percent,
respectively. The medium-term outlook assumes that Rwanda will continue to be able to
cushion itself from the adverse impacts of economic shocks. The impact of the recent global
slowdown over the medium term will depend on how strongly the drivers of growth are
impacted. These include large-scale investments funded by external borrowing. All of this
could potentially lead to stronger adverse growth effects in the medium to longer term, should
the global economic slowdown persist and external resources become increasingly scarce.

17.     The most recent debt sustainability analysis, dated December 2008, concludes
that Rwanda is now at a moderate risk of debt distress owing to recent debt relief and its
narrow export base. The amount of domestic debt is small and expected to decline further
as the BNR limits the use of domestic debt instruments and instead relies mainly on foreign
exchange sales for sterilization so as to increase exchange rate flexibility. GoR has taken
steps to prevent the reemergence of unsustainable debt by preparing a debt management
strategy with limits for loans, government guarantees and contingent liabilities that will guide
future borrowing. Annex 5 contains a detailed discussion of the macroeconomic outlook and
debt sustainability.

18.    Overall, the medium-term macro-economic framework is sound and adequate to
support the Government's program. As noted in the completed sixth review of the IMF's
Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF),18 the medium-term outlook for inflation,
economic growth, and financing remains favorable. GoR will continue with policies to
mitigate the negative impacts of global and external shocks. It will exercise prudence in
implementing macro-economic policy, with a focus on ensuring coordinated fiscal and
monetary policies. The GoR will also continue with policies that support private sector-led
growth. Investments are planned to improve agricultural productivity, reduce soil erosion and
improve irrigation. Investments in the energy sector aimed at reducing the dependence on
thermal and hydro-power are showing evidence of paying off. As well, a strategic plan for
post-basic education is being developed to address the issue of skills development. These
measures should help to expand productivity and establish the foundation for long-term
sustainable growth.


                             THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY (EDPRS)

19.     The 2008-12 Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy emphasizes
economic growth and poverty alleviation that continue to build on achievements in
human development and basic social services (including progress toward the MDGs),
while also focusing on decentralization, greater community involvement, and a greater
role for the private sector. The EDPRS encompasses, inter alia, the hard-to-reach MDG 1
(reducing poverty and malnutrition), MDG 5 (reducing maternal mortality), MDG 4 (reducing
child mortality), and three flagship programs: (a) sustainable growth for jobs and exports; (b)
governance, including expanding decentralization and enhancing accountability; and (c) the
Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP). It also includes complementary interventions in a
variety of sectors designed to alleviate rural poverty and improve productivity. These include
labor-intensive public works, direct financial support for the most needy and vulnerable
households, microcredit initiatives, water and sanitation, and HNP services.

VISION 2020 UMURENGE PROGRAM

20.     The Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) aims to ensure that economic growth
is pro-poor and that the majority of the population could benefit from the improvements
in living standards that the country as a whole is experiencing. The VUP is managed by
MINALOC and is implemented through the newly restructured system of decentralized local
government. The VUP is organized around the following: (i) labor-intensive public works
that will provide support to extremely poor landless families and encourage saving and
development of productive activities; (ii) support to the most vulnerable households that is

intended to alleviate poverty, and (iii) micro-credit and financial service initiatives intended to
facilitate investment in income-generation and entrepreneurial activities.19 The overarching
aims of all VUP program elements are to raise living standards sustainably, encourage saving,
and promote movement from dependency to self-sufficiency.

21.     A key VUP policy reform has been the institutionalization of the Ubudehe20
process of village-level community decision-making. Ubudehe incorporates what is
essentially a "poverty-mapping" process, which has a systematic methodology and allocates
each household to one of six ordinal income and poverty-related categories differentiated by
well-defined qualitative criteria. The maps have become the basis for community decision-
making under the VUP program about income support in cash or in kind to ultra-poor
households from local and donor sources, as well as a guide to which households should
receive subsidies for health insurance. Consistent with the GoR's significant push toward
decentralization, implementation of the VUP is being planned and coordinated by the Sector
administrations with participation at the local level and with the Districts responsible for
technical support and supervision. 21

22.     VUP complements the delivery of basic health and education services, which is
now a responsibility of local government. Local governments are now playing an
expanding role in coordinating the delivery of various services. Community-based
participatory processes have played important roles in the identification of VUP beneficiaries
and in the selection and implementation of local public works pilots that are currently being
implemented to varying degrees in all 30 original pilot Sectors. In addition, since July 2009,
30 additional pilots have been added as part of scaling up the VUP, leading to pilots that are
currently being implemented in 60 Sectors. Lessons learned (see Section IV below) will be
applied to national scaling up of the program.


HEALTH SECTOR REFORM

23.     In the area of health, the EDPRS aims to maximize preventive health measures
and build the capacity for pro-poor delivery of high-quality and accessible health
services and population interventions. Since 2004, there has been significant progress in
implementing a variety of programmatic and health financing reforms to improve the equity
and efficiency of health financing and programmatic effectiveness. This has helped to
translate increased funding into improved health outcomes. Under the first Health Sector
Strategy Plan (HSSP-I),22 there was substantial progress in facility-level performance-based
financing (PBF) reforms. The GoR is now expanding the PBF to preventive and community-
based services, in the form of the Community PBF. This is a demand- and supply-side
incentive-based program targeting women and community health workers (CHW), respectively,
for improved health behaviors and health service utilization. The Community PBF is a key

   The HSSP-I was adopted in 2005 and covered the period 2005-2009.

feature of HSSP-II.23 A key remaining challenge is whether resource allocation under HSSP-
II will reflect the increased prioritization of PBF.

24.     In addition to health-related reforms, the GoR has prepared a new National
Population Policy (superseding the 2003 policy), which is informed by the 2006 Family
Planning Promotion Policy. The new policy has four priorities: to reduce the levels of
infant, child, and maternal mortality; to promote education, especially for girls; to promote
long-term family planning methods and make access universal; and to focus on the needs of
youth. The new policy also addresses gender issues, centrally linked to population and
reproductive health outcomes. In support of these policies, the CLSG has identified family
planning as one of the priority policy areas.

25.     Nutrition is a key part of the Ministry of Health's (MOH) community health
activities, integrated with maternal and child health interventions. Chronic malnutrition
among children under-five is one of five indicators to track progress toward the HSSP-II's
objectives. Through the CLSG support to community health policy reforms, which includes
strengthening delivery of nutrition-related interventions such as breastfeeding promotion and
oral rehydration therapy, the program addresses in part the country's nutrition challenges.


                  BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS

26.   The operation will support both the GoR's poverty reduction objectives and the
CAS objective of reducing social vulnerability, consistent with the country's fiscal
framework. A program in the CAS was specifically earmarked to support the GoR's Vision
2020 Umurenge initiative.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

27.      The operation is closely aligned with the ongoing Poverty Reduction Support
Grant (PRSG) series, which continues to be prepared in parallel with the IMF's Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) review. The IMF leads the macroeconomic
dialogue in Rwanda and in August 2009 completed its sixth and final review of Rwanda's
economic performance under its PRGF arrangements. The completion of the sixth review
brings total disbursements under the arrangement to a total of SDR8.01 million (about
US$12.4 million). The IMF's work complements the PRSG's focus on structural and
institutional reforms. The proposed CLSG will work closely to align objectives, resources
and dialogue with the IMF, primarily through its close collaboration with the Bank's PRSG 6
operation.




23
  The HSSP-II covers the period 2009-2012 and has 7 strategic areas: (i) institutional capacity; (ii) human
resources; (iii) financial access to health services; (iv) geographical access to health services; (v) drugs, vaccines
and consumables; (vi) quality assurance; and (vii) specialized services, national referral hospitals and research
centers.
                                                          9
28.     The Bank's portfolio of support has been coordinated with that of other donors.
The first PRSC/G series contributed to strengthening the framework for harmonized budget
support in Rwanda, which currently includes five development partners: Africa Development
Bank (AfDB), Department for International Development (DFID), European Commission
(EC), Germany, and the World Bank. In the health sector, three partners are providing sector-
specific budget support - Belgium, DFID, and Germany. Over the last few years, the overall
dialogue among donors, and between donors and the GoR, has been strengthened and trust
has been built. In September 2008 all budget support donors and GoR signed a Memorandum
of Understanding governing the provision of budget support in the implementation of
Rwanda's EDPRS (replacing the Partnership Framework of November 2003). The CLSG
operation has been prepared to ensure that there is close collaboration and consultation with
the donors involved in these critical sectors and to ensure country ownership of the program's
objectives, policy actions and outcomes. Recently, DFID announced a firm commitment to
provide support of approximately $US31.8 million24 (£19.7 million) to the VUP program over
four years (2009-2012) covering the remaining EDPRS period. This, coupled with additional
funding from EC of approximately $US 14.5 million25 (10 million) over a 2-year period
(starting with fiscal year 2011-12), will provide additional financing to facilitate
implementation of the VUP. In addition, UNICEF has provided computers for Sector staff
and there is an agreement for UNICEF to fund a consultant to work on the beneficiary
training and sensitization component of the VUP. UNICEF is also likely to undertake an
impact assessment of the VUP program in ten Sectors, in addition to providing technical
assistance to ensure that the interests of orphans, vulnerable children (OVCs) and women are
considered under the VUP. Following a competitive process, Rwanda has received a grant
from the multi-donor Health Results Innovation Trust Fund to finance the community health
reforms supported by the CLSG, with particular focus on results-based financing and impact
evaluation.26 Several other partners finance on- and off-budget support to the community
health policies supported by the CLSG, in particular the Global Fund, UNICEF, and USAID.


RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

29.    The CLSG series strongly complements the PRSG series. The first PRSC/G series
(PRSG 1-3) supported health sector reforms, including expansion of community health
insurance, decentralization and autonomy of health service management, and performance-
based financing. It also supported a pilot social protection initiative that was a forerunner of
the VUP. Through broad policy measures, the new PRSG series, now in its second year, will
further strengthen investment in human capital and skills for growth; improve water
resources, supply and sanitation; complement investments under the recently approved
Transport Sector Development Project; and raise agricultural productivity and value-added
through exports. The proposed CLSG has complementary policy objectives, including
support for policy development in the domain of targeted social assistance (direct support),
public works, incentive-driven voluntary savings to move people out of poverty, clear and

26
   This is part of a global initiative in nine countries that is being supported by the multi-donor financed Health
Results Innovation Trust Fund. Significant technical assistance for the impact evaluation of the Community PBF
is financed by an additional US$1 million from the trust fund over the three-year period of the CLSG series.
                                                        10
transparent eligibility determination processes, and community-based HNP programs. All of
these objectives complement PRSG goals, but are much more specifically focused on helping
GoR to create the basis for a sound safety net and to attain its hard-to-reach MDGs.

30.     In addition to complementing the Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG)
series, the proposed operation complements other IDA financial assistance for Rwanda.
That includes the Decentralization and Community Development Program (DCDP), and the
recently closed Multi-Country Action HIV/AIDS Program (MAP).

31.      The Bank-supported Decentralization and Community Development Program
(DCDP) has built an important foundation for the VUP, this proposed operation, and
the first CLSG. In addition to various community-driven development initiatives that
resulted in the creation of social infrastructure assets (mainly class-rooms and health
facilities), and the country-wide capacity building at the District levels to support deepening
of decentralization, from which VUP has drawn lessons, DCDP is also specifically supporting
local technical assistance to manage and support VUP implementation on the ground.

32.     IDA support in the health sector has been channeled through the PRSG series of
budget support operations, grant financing for HIV/AIDS, and analytical work and
technical assistance. Incentive-based mechanisms have been a common theme across
these different instruments. Examples include performance-based contracts, retention
strategies for human resources, a results-oriented MTEF27 (supported by the PRSG series),
piloting of performance-based financing strategies (under the MAP), and analytical work on
the impact and achievements of the sector's performance-based mechanisms. PBF-related
reforms supported through CLSG were directly informed by the latter two analytical products.

LESSONS LEARNED

33.     The Bank's experience with budget support for Rwanda has demonstrated that
substantial outcomes can be achieved with strong Government commitment and with
capacity building for implementation. Key lessons drawn from the first PRSC/G series
highlighted the importance of: (a) cross-sectoral linkages and synergies; (b) strong
stakeholder commitment; (c) sound joint analytical work to inform policy dialogue and
reforms; and (d) a common harmonized accountability framework aligned around policy
objectives to lessen transaction costs and enhance ownership.

34.        Specific lessons for social protection reforms include the following.

·      The change to direct support as an entitlement is very important but also
presents multiple challenges. Six months is too short for extremely poor households to
graduate, as longer support and exposure to sensitization are needed for households to be able
to save, invest and become self-reliant after having met their basic needs. Some direct
support households may not be able to graduate. Financial systems for social protection
programs need to have timely, predictable and accurate payments to beneficiaries as their
primary objective. As a result, policy and procedural adjustments have been, and will
continue to be, made to streamline existing systems (such as the change to quarterly direct

support disbursements and payments direct to sector accounts). Although Sectors are the
primary focus of the VUP, Districts play a critical role in program delivery and their need for
empowerment and support has been recognized and strengthened.

·      There has previously been relatively little systematic policy development in the
area of social protection. As a consequence, numerous programs have been launched by
various line ministries, some with donor assistance. A diverse range of civil society activities
also address social protection objectives. Data on these activities, if available, are often non-
comparable. A myriad of programs by various ministries and other organizations renders
coordination a difficult and time-consuming job, with specific implications for MINALOC.
At the recipients' end, it is hard to assess who is accessing which programs, the level and
appropriateness of multiple-program participation, and inclusion and exclusion errors.

·      Rwanda has successfully established a number of unique features within its
governance structure that are effective, nationally operative, and well-owned by the
population. Two key examples are the Ubudehe system of community decision-making and
program management and the Imihigo system of holding national and local government
accountable. Notwithstanding these unique governance features, the design, planning and
management of VUP budgetary processes in an evolving decentralized budgetary framework
(discussed further in Section V) remain a challenge. In particular, efforts need to be made to
design budget allocation criteria, distributional rules between programs and Sectors (within
each District), and processes that disburse funds accurately and in a timely way to those
deemed eligible, while protecting the position of poor households and using evolving data to
improve the overall distribution of program funding.

·       The method of selection under the current Ubudehe process is helpful in
identifying potential beneficiaries for public works and direct support programs within
communities but may not treat similarly placed households across communities equally,
which may result in horizontal inequity. Moreover, to improve targeting outcomes within
and across communities, over the long term, objective criteria may need to be developed,
pilot-tested, and supplemented with ongoing community selection processes.

35.        Specific lessons for health policy reforms include the following.

·      Monitoring and evaluation of the policy reforms is facilitated by linking policy
actions and outcome indicators in the policy matrix and making explicit the
intermediate outcomes that will be tracked. In development policy operations, there is a
tendency to focus primarily on policy actions, with less emphasis on tracking achievement of
the monitoring framework indicators (formally part of the policy matrix) for which the
program is held accountable. Intermediate indicators, available with more frequency, may
also need to be monitored to show progress towards the program's outcomes. This is critical
to monitoring the development effectiveness of the operation, and was also a key conclusion
of the 2009 review of development policy lending by the Operations Policy and Country
Services Network of the World Bank.28

·       In a country with low capacity, the MOH and donors need to budget
complementary inputs (e.g., training, technical assistance, materials and supplies) to
ensure successful policy reform and achievement of program outcomes. A program
suffers serious programmatic risk if there is not full budgeting for the implementation of
policy actions and realization of the monitoring framework indicators.

·       The community health policy reforms supported by CLSG receive substantial
support from other partners. However, because much of this support is off-budget, MOH
needs to continue to ensure strong coordination and planning for effective implementation of
the policy reforms.

·       Budget support provides important advantages with regard to ownership,
sustainability, and use of country systems for innovative policy reforms, but also poses
challenges. The Health Results Innovation Trust Fund is intended to support results-based
financing innovations and randomized impact evaluation of these innovations. Achieving
these objectives through the instrument of budget support has entailed challenges but also
significant advantages. The GoR's proposal to the trust fund, which was approved after a
competitive process, provided considerable detail on the results-based financing interventions.
The GoR's own tools for implementation - notably budgets, implementation plans, and
manuals of procedures - allow for monitoring of the extent to which the GoR is translating
reform into action and implementing what it proposed to the trust fund. However, this
strategy greatly depends on GoR's commitment and capacity. At the same time, underlining
the benefits of budget support, implementation of policy reforms has progressed with
financing from the GoR budget, independent of disbursement from the trust fund. Similarly,
policy implementation occurs fully through country systems, enhancing ownership and
sustainability. The reforms and related programs put in place by the GoR will continue after
the end of the CLSG series.


ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

36.     The Bank and the GoR have undertaken substantial analytical work in the last
few years that has been used in preparing this operation. That work has also helped
inform both the Bank's most recent CAS and GoR's EDPRS and VUP program, to which the
proposed operation is closely aligned. Discrete but complementary strands within the body of
analytical work underlying the proposed operation include public expenditure reviews (PERs)
completed in social protection, agriculture, and water and sanitation, a series of analytical
studies of the health sector, analyses of national household survey data, and syntheses of
relevant international policy and programmatic experience. This analytical work is
summarized in Table 3 below.

37.     The poverty assessment has provided important insights on poverty and
vulnerability, geographic distribution of poverty, households characteristics that
contribute to a deepening poverty gap, and potential routes out of poverty. This
operation makes full use of these findings, and builds on an understanding of past failures and
promising approaches to poverty reduction in Rwanda. Of particular relevance are findings
pertaining to income shortfall from the poverty line by deciles, which is very high for the
poorest decile. These findings confirm the vast distance the poorest groups have to traverse to
                                              13
escape poverty, which evidently is caused by a combination of lack of assets and lack of
gainful employment (see Annex 8). This operation helps address these specific facets of
poverty.

38.     One question raised by some studies is whether more efficient or sustainable
ways could be developed to deliver social protection assistance. The number of people
reached by the programs examined was extremely limited, with expenditures fragmented and
poorly aligned with aid policies. There was no systematic monitoring of the programs'
poverty impact and no coordination across interventions. Consequently, the poverty impact
of the expenditures was unknown. Moreover, social protection interventions in the past were
poorly coordinated. VUP is attempting to correct this by setting up architecture for effective
coordination of all social protection interventions at the Sector (Umurenge) level.29 In
addition, under the VUP, previously missed vulnerable groups will be reached by public
works and direct support.

39.   Health sector analytical work guided the selection of policy areas included in the
CLSG.

·    A series of high-quality Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS; 2000, 2005-06, and
     2007-08) provided trend data on key service delivery and outcome indicators. The
     surveys showed substantial improvements in a variety of areas, including child mortality,
     but also highlighted large challenges in addressing key determinants of maternal and child
     health (such as facility-based deliveries, and community-level preventive and curative
     interventions). These challenges are the focus of policy actions in this operation.

·    Through the 2009 Country Status Report on Health and Poverty - in particular,
     technical work on community health insurance and performance-based financing
     (PBF) - the Bank has supported GoR with analysis of the health system's
     performance and its financing. Together with the impact evaluation of the facility-
     based PBF, the analyses validated the use of incentives to improve health worker
     performance, and led to the inclusion of the incentive-based approach to encourage
     desired behaviors by community health workers (CHW) and community members,
     particularly pregnant women and mothers. The literature on the design of incentive
     strategies is evolving. Under the CLSG series, the MOH will experiment with and
     rigorously evaluate various interventions, taking into account their programmatic
     effectiveness, efficiency, and distributional considerations.30

·    In the area of population, the analysis points to the fact that, in recent years, annual
     increases in contraceptive use in Rwanda have far exceeded the Sub-Saharan
     African average. As Rwanda appears to be at the tipping point with respect to starting its
     fertility transition, the analysis pointed to the importance of continued support and
     emphasis in the Bank's policy dialogue on expanding modern contraceptive coverage.

    THE PROPOSED RWANDA SECOND COMMUNITY LIVING STANDARDS
                              GRANT

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

40.     The Program Development Objective is to support GoR's social protection and
health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme poverty, initially in 30 pilot Sectors,
and to expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and population interventions at
the community level. The grant will help Rwanda to integrate international good practice
within its poverty-reducing policies under the EDPRS flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge
Program (VUP). The grant will help ensure the GoR's policy reforms follow international
good practice in two areas: assisting extremely poor, landless households through public-
works employment or, where such households are also labor-poor, through cash transfers; and
delivering high-impact HNP interventions at the community level using performance-based

                                                  15
financing (PBF) strategies. These policy actions are consistent with the Bank's CAS
objectives and with the fiscal sustainability and effectiveness of public resource allocation as
reflected in the EDPRS. GoR has scaled up its VUP program to an additional 30 pilot
Sectors, in addition to the initial 30 pilot Sectors.

41.     Expected benefits on the social protection policy side include a VUP policy
framework and MTEF that are closely aligned with the PRSG, EDPRS, and CAS goals,
while at the same time incorporating international good practice. GoR's social protection
policies supported by this operation are expected to contribute to (a) reduction in the poverty-
income gaps in pilot Sectors over a three-year period and (b) greater opportunities for
beneficiaries to seek self-reliance and to graduate into income-generating activities from
public works and in some cases from direct supports programs. The operation is thus closely
linked with GoR's program, but enhances its quality, transparency, and outcomes.

42.      Similarly, expected benefits on the health policy side include policy reform to
improve community HNP services, in support of the EDPRS objective to "improve
health status and slow down population growth." EDPRS targets for Rwanda include
expanding access to basic health services to improve hard-to-reach MDGs for reducing
fertility, malnutrition, and maternal and child mortality, as well as combating infectious
diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Building on substantial progress
in improving facility-based services, this operation will support reforms in GoR's community
HNP policies that complement the VUP, including a strategy to deliver high-impact
interventions to households by a network of CHW, and thereby to contribute to improved
access to services by poor rural households.

43.     As poverty affects health and poor health contributes to poverty, the policy
reforms in social protection and health supported by this operation are strongly
complementary. Under the VUP, the social protection policies are aimed at providing
income support to the poorest households in the poorest areas of the country, while the
community health policies focus on improving access to services and health outcomes among
poor households in rural areas. The results-based financing innovations supported by the
operation are being piloted first in the 30 VUP Sectors before their nationwide scale-up. It is
anticipated that support from the social protection and health interventions may provide multi-
sectoral synergies that enhance cumulative benefits to poor households. Achieving progress
on MDG 1 (poverty and nutrition) in particular is dependent on improvements in a broad
range of socio-economic factors, while child and maternal mortality are similarly affected by
numerous determinants outside the health sector. This is most immediately evident with
regard to child nutrition, which is strongly influenced by both household poverty level and
access to basic health services.

44.    During CLSG-1, several key actions were completed by GoR by end-January,
2009. The following policies were the focus of the first year of operation.

·   Social Protection Policy: Public-works wage rates were adopted that were no higher than
    the relevant market rates so as to promote self-selection of the poorest into the program
    and to avoid labor-market distortions; and payment of wages to workers was done directly
    without intermediaries. In this regard, MINALOC has collected public and market wage


                                              16
     rates in VUP sectors, showing that public work wage rates are not higher than the
     prevailing market rates for each of the pilot sectors.31 Also, the ministry has monitored
     the practice of paying workers in its public works program directly, without
     intermediaries. During the CLSG-1, 6,655 and 9,666 households participated in the direct
     supports program during January through June, and July through December 2009,
     respectively. Similarly, 17,886 and 21,937 households participated in the public works
     program during the same two periods, respectively. A bank account was opened in each
     participant's name, and the wages or direct support payments were deposited directly into
     their accounts, thus completely eliminating intermediaries from the payment process in
     the public works program. In the one case that was found to have used an intermediary,
     the situation was corrected. In the area of direct support, the household was adopted as
     the unit for determining the level of benefit. The operational manual sets out a
     household's base entitlement, which is monitored by regularly collecting data from
     Sectors and Districts. All Sectors use the household as a unit when determining eligibility
     under the direct supports program.

·    Health, Nutrition, and Population Policy: Through a joint planning process, the MOH
     developed a community health service package to address family-planning, health, and
     nutrition goals, along with an implementation plan and budget that integrate support
     financed by GoR with programs supported by partners. A community health worker
     training program started in early 2009 and, to date, 9,500 CHW have received training.
     The program targets 30,000 CHW, one male and one female elected by each community,
     and an additional 30,000 community-level health workers who are currently working
     under disease-specific programs. The community health package is part of the larger
     National Community Health Policy. Furthermore, a PBF strategy for community health
     services was developed and training and implementation have started. Out of the planned
     total of around 400, 160 CHW cooperatives and community PBF steering committees
     have been formed, and 2,000 steering committee members have been trained in
     community PBF. Two rounds of funds transfers have been made to the District
     administrations to finance the incentive system. MOH has decided to incentivize quality
     reporting, as well, to make changes in service provision indicators. MOH has committed
     to start implementation by end-2009 in the 30 VUP Sectors, expanding to at least 100
     sectors during the first part of 2010. A health-sector MTEF was approved by the Ministry
     of Finance, including budget lines for the community health policy reforms. Budget
     execution of the MOH recurrent budget is close to 100 percent. 32

45.   The following table summarizes the prior policy actions and triggers for CLSG-2
and CLSG-3. Details are provided in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2). As noted in Table 4, the
GoR has progressed as agreed for the second year of the operation. It has completed all
CLSG-2 policy prior actions.




31
   In any cases where monitoring has found public work wages to be higher than the prevailing market wage,
action has been taken to investigate and correct this practice.

                                                  Baseline data collection is planned
                                                  for the beginning of 2010. The
                                                  evaluation will measure and

                                                  indicators of the following policies:
                                                  (i) Community PBF whereby
                                                  incentives are tied to changes in
                                                  health service indicators in 50
                                                  Sectors; (ii) In-kind incentives for
                                                  maternal health in 50 Sectors; and
                                                  (iii) Combination of Community
                                                  PBF and In-kind incentives for
                                                  maternal health in 50 Sectors.



46.    To ensure that the operation is successful and that there is strong ownership of
supported policy actions, the operation is applying good practice principles, on
conditionality, as outlined in the box below.

47.     In addition, this operation has benefited from continuous interaction and
collaboration with donor partners. The social protection policy framework has evolved
over time with significant, regular interaction and feedback from donor partners and bilateral
donors ((WB, UNDP, WFP, UNICEF, DFID, GTZ, EC, the Netherlands). The CLSG series
has benefited a great deal from continuing consultations with donor partners. Bank missions
to Rwanda routinely meet with other donors, and the Bank participates both in a VUP core
donors group and a social protection sector working group co-chaired by DFID, which has
also funded an international consultant team to support VUP management.

48.     Similarly, coordination of partners in the health sector is in line with that in
other sectors. It includes annual joint sector reviews, centered on assessing progress towards
the EDPRS and sector strategy objectives, and health sector input into the Common
Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF). In the policy areas covered by the CLSG, the
Bank has worked closely with UNICEF and USAID in supporting the GoR's community
health policy reforms, with particular focus on results-based financing innovations

Box 1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1. Reinforce Ownership
Ensure that the GoR has a strong track record in committing to and implementing reforms. The second CLSG
grant continues support for EDPRS, which was developed in a participatory manner involving extensive
consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. The process was led by a National Steering Committee,
comprised of Ministers and Governors, providing high level guidance. The Bank has actively supported GoR in
this process. The GoR has completed a formal Aid Policy that articulates its vision for improved aid
management and policies. In September 2008, GoR and all budget support donors signed a new Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) governing the provision of direct budget support in the implementation of the EDPRS.
These actions underscore the strong commitment by GoR to implement prior policy actions and accomplish the
triggers of this operation.

Principle 2. Agree up front with GoR and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework
GoR and budget support donors have agreed on a common assessment framework for public expenditure and
financial accountability (PEFA). In a further step, GoR and donors have elaborated a common performance
assessment framework (CPAF) that is aligned with the EDPRS. The CPAF framework is also identified as one
of the three complementary monitoring and performance management frameworks under the Memorandum of
Understanding between budget support donors and GoR. Sector-specific mechanisms, including a sector-wide
approach (SWAp) MoU and a sector strategy governing budget support have been agreed between government
and partners in the health sector. The GoR also passed an Accountants Bill in December 2007 and adopted and
appointed the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) in March, 2008. Rwanda is widely recognized in
the region for its low levels of corruption.

Principle 3. Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The CLSG series is fully aligned with the EDPRS' overall objectives to accelerate progress towards the MDGs,
including poverty alleviation and improvements in basic social services. The CLSG should be seen as the
overall umbrella for Bank support and policy dialogue in the area of social protection and community HNP
policy areas, complemented both by the second PRSG series and by specific investment projects.

Principle 4. Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
The CLSG focuses on a few selected triggers and prior actions, which represent critical steps for implementing
GoR's program. These triggers and prior actions have evolved from extensive discussion with GoR and other
relevant stakeholders and are aligned with EDPRS objectives, the CPAF, and sector-specific frameworks related
to social protection and community HNP.

Principle 5. Carry out transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support
A full review of the program will take place in line with the review agreed in the MOU governing the provision
of budget support in the implementation of Rwanda's EDPRS. Joint budget reviews and joint sector reviews
take place twice a year, aligned with the budget cycle.

49.   For performance and monitoring indicators and pertinent quantitative
benchmarks for the proposed operation, please refer to Section VI under
implementation, monitoring and evaluation.


POLICY AREAS

50.    Although the prior actions under the CLSG-1 development policy grant were
successfully completed, further policy reforms need to be undertaken to address
implementation challenges in both the social protection and health sectors. Details of


                                                     20
policy challenges, policy reform measures being undertaken, and their expected results are
outlined below.

Policy Area: Social Protection

51.    Description: GoR's innovative VUP flagship program is aimed at addressing the
challenges of deep and pervasive poverty. The CLSG series will support and facilitate the
GoR's efforts, incorporating global good practices.

52.    Challenges: Building on the CLSG-1 reforms, the following additional key policy
challenges will be addressed in CLSG-2 and CLSG-3.

Public Works and Direct Support

·   The need to ensure that saving is voluntary rather than mandatory. Originally, the GoR
    advocated mandatory savings for beneficiaries under the VUP to inculcate a saving habit
    and, at least for some households, create the possibility of launching small-scale income-
    generating activities. However, this policy intention in some areas led to wage rates for
    public works being set above market wages, in contradiction to the other policy intention
    of ensuring that the public works wages would not distort the private market (which is
    also a good practice policy objective supported under CLSG-1). Furthermore, mandatory
    saving limits the ability of extremely poor households to meet their immediate and basic
    needs, a key objective of the VUP.

·   The need to establish an eligibility process that is both clear and transparent to all
    potential recipients and non-recipients and is open to public question and review, in
    accordance with good international practice. Such a policy would establish program
    policy and procedures that are widely known and would make selection outcomes publicly
    available. This policy challenge is being addressed under CLSG-2.

·   The need for a framework to handle appeals and complaints by beneficiaries and non-
    beneficiaries. Maintaining public confidence in the Ubudehe selection process requires
    that the public fully understands and accepts the system, and that there is a process by
    which the public can complain. This challenge will be addressed under CLSG-2 and
    CLSG-3.

Operationalizing the VUP

·   The need to improve targeting and reduce potential inclusion and exclusion errors under
    the current system. When the VUP under the EDPRS was originally developed by the
    GoR, the GoR decided that Ubudehe, the traditional Rwandan process of village-level
    community decision-making, would be used as basis for the program's targeting
    mechanism (see Section III; paragraph 21 and Annex 6) together with additional land and
    labor availability criteria. While this is considered a solid targeting mechanism with
    strong community-based ownership, and as such highly desirable as VUP is scaled up,
    household baseline survey data from December 2008 suggest that there are divergences
    between the intended targeting of poor households under the current Ubudehe structure
    and the actual patterns of inclusion and exclusion of households found in the analysis of
    relevant data. Although this is not surprising in a new program for which implementation
                                             21
    systems are still under development, it does suggest that serious efforts to improve the
    targeting efficiency of VUP are warranted. Given plans to scale up the program quickly
    with a view to achieving national coverage within a few years, it is particularly important
    to address these issues while the program is still in its pilot phase.

·   The need to strengthen the design, planning and management of VUP budgetary processes
    in an evolving decentralized budgetary framework. Implementation challenges have
    emerged as MINALOC seeks to implement the coordinated but disparate elements of
    public works, direct supports and financial services. The challenges involve (a) managing
    budgets across and within Districts and Sectors, reflecting population size and local
    poverty rates in the geographic distribution of expenditures; and (b) managing local area
    outlays so that the entitlement character of direct support expenditures is respected and the
    intention of allocating 50 percent of total VUP funding to public works is realized.
    Underlying these implementation challenges are multiple and conflicting government
    strategies. One is to devolve budgets to the District and Sector level and to pay all
    benefits through Districts and Sectors, rather than paying beneficiaries directly from the
    national level. Another is to implement a notional 50-20-30 percent split of the overall
    VUP budget between public works, direct support and financial services, respectively. A
    third is to respect these sub-programs' different budget implications. Only direct support
    is an entitlement, but it could potentially crowd out public works by reducing its share to
    less than 50 percent of the overall VUP budget. Financial services are open to many, but
    the program promises nothing specific. Moreover, poverty rates and population size
    affect local demand but not budgets, inducing horizontal inequities across Sectors.
    Scaling up VUP will intensify these problems, as more Sectors per District must share the
    District's budget. So efforts are needed (a) to design budget allocation criteria, inter-
    program and inter-sector distributional rules, and processes that accurately disburse funds
    to those deemed eligible, while protecting the position of poor households; and (b) to
    improve the consistency between the distributions of poverty and program funding, using
    evolving data.

53.    Actions to Date/Supported Measures: Given the policy challenges highlighted
above, the CLSG continues to ensure good international practices by addressing these
challenges in the following way.

Public Works and Direct Support

·   The adoption of a clear national policy for voluntary (as opposed to mandatory) saving
    under the VUP. With support under the CLSG-2 operation, this policy has been
    incorporated into GoR's revised public works and direct support manuals. In addition,
    discussions of the content of these manuals at workshops, training programs, and
    community forums and through publicized public documents are all helping to ensure that
    private sector market wages are not distorted; that poor households have options for
    consumption to meet their basic needs; and that the GoR's overall social protection policy
    intentions are in line with international good practice and are widely understood.

·   Adoption of a clear national policy for making the eligibility determination process clear
    and transparent. With support from the CLSG-2 operation, the eligibility policy has been
    incorporated into the GoR's revised public works and direct supports manuals making
    program policy, procedures and selection outcomes publicly available to all potential
                                             22
    recipients and non-recipients. In addition, clear and simple descriptions of eligibility
    processes and selections outcomes are being disclosed publicly at local government
    centers, adapted for publication in newspapers and discussed at local community-
    meetings.

·   Adoption of an appeals and complaints mechanism, to be piloted in 5 Sectors, that relies
    on a number of steps that are open to public meetings and therefore public debate and
    question. With the ongoing support of CLSG-2, the individual's right to question
    decisions will be extended by providing a more formalized complaint mechanism under
    CLSG-3. That would allow a household to seek a review of the decision not to include
    them in direct support or public works. Under CLSG-2, a mechanism will be developed
    to allow for a review conducted independently of the direct Ubudehe process and at a
    higher level. In line with international good practice, it is envisaged that, under CLSG-3,
    this mechanism will be further developed into a more formal appeals procedure, at least
    for the entitlement-based direct support.

Operationalizing the VUP

·   Improve targeting under the two VUP components (direct support and public works) to
    ensure that VUP interventions reach the intended beneficiaries. Emerging statistical
    analysis suggests that further fine-tuning of the Ubudehe process is necessary to ensure
    that targeting is considerably enhanced and inclusion and exclusion errors are reduced as
    the program is scaled up to more Sectors. Measures have already been taken during
    CLSG-1 to improve targeting and minimize errors, including sensitization on the policy
    and procedures, development of detailed targeting guidelines and formats, targeting
    training (for Sector and village-level staff and facilitators), all of which underpinned the
    most recent targeting exercise in July 2009. CLSG-2 is supporting the GoR to ensure that
    statistical and administrative processes and tools for identifying, listing, validating and
    enrolling eligible beneficiaries are reviewed, streamlined and made familiar to
    implementers, so that the VUP scale-up meets its VUP objectives. The proposed improved
    targeting mechanism under CLSG-3 will be based on lessons learned from the use of the
    existing Ubudehe process and on analysis of data collected over the course of pilot
    implementation, supported by the two previous CLSG operations, and from the findings
    of the planned household surveys when they become available.

·   Strengthening financial management of VUP, including budgetary processes, at
    decentralized levels of GoR.        As discussed above, the underlying budgetary
    implementation challenges that MINALOC faces, combined with multiple and conflicting
    government strategies, necessitate careful consideration of how budget allocations are
    managed, disbursed, and monitored to ensure that Sectors receive the funds they require to
    successfully implement the VUP program. A key indicator of success would be Rwanda's
    adoption of a budget allocation mechanism for fiscal year 2010/11 that describes how
    funds will be distributed among administrative Districts or Sectors, and among the three
    main program components.

54.     Expected Results: Implementation of social protection good practice policies in
Rwanda should ensure that programs are better administered and that assistance is delivered
on time to intended beneficiaries, thus contributing to the overall policy goal of reducing the
poverty gap over a three-year horizon. The emphasis in this second operation on
                                              23
incorporating transparent processes in the VUP will be complemented by analysis to ascertain
whether the people included in, excluded from, or assisted by the VUP program conform with
the intention of the policy and thus whether further refinement of targeting criteria and
processes is required. Good practice in dissemination would involve transparent disclosure of
eligibility criteria and the list of selected beneficiaries at the community level, and an upward
feedback of the results of the adoption of the policy. Such a transparent dissemination will
also make it possible to assess whether the targeting criteria are being implemented on the
ground, the nature of any errors in targeting, and what kinds of improvement in targeting
policy are needed.

Policy Area: Community Health, Nutrition and Population

55.     Description: Community HNP policy reforms address key challenges to making
progress on the hard-to-reach MDGs. The operation supports a series of policy reforms
that complement the VUP, including strategies to deliver high-impact interventions to
households through a network of CHW and to incentivize demand for maternal health
services. There is progression in the policy actions between the CLSG-1, 2 and 3. The
CLSG-1 policy actions focused on the Community PBF strategy development, the CLSG-2
triggers focus on development of the reproductive and maternal health strategy and the
community health worker training strategy; and the CLSG-3 triggers focus on consolidation
and implementation of these policy reforms.

56.    Challenges: Implementation of policy reforms in order to maintain progress
towards the hard-to-reach MDGs remains a challenge. The challenges to be addressed
under the second CLSG operation involve the following.

·   The need to improve demand for reproductive and maternal health services. Rwanda has
    made substantial progress in improving reproductive health services and outcomes in
    recent years. Modern contraceptive prevalence has increased from 4 percent in 2000 to 27
    percent in 2008, while the total fertility rate has declined slightly from 5.8 in 2000 to 5.5
    in 2008. In 2008, more than 95 percent of pregnant women had at least one antenatal care
    visit and 66 percent had at least two visits. Although the proportion of deliveries done in
    health facilities rose from 27 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2008, this level of utilization
    remains low. As part of its strategy to reduce fertility and maternal mortality, the
    government is continuing to pursue improvements on the supply side in the quality of
    services, as well as in extending coverage through the community health program. A
    remaining challenge is low demand for reproductive and maternal services. To this end,
    an incentive strategy is being devised that targets women of reproductive age (to stimulate
    demand for family planning) and pregnant women (to stimulate demand for antenatal and
    delivery care). The development of the incentive strategy is advanced but implementation
    poses important challenges to MOH.

·   The need to expand coverage of basic health services to poor and rural populations. To
    continue its progress towards the health-related MDGs, the government is committed to
    addressing urban-rural and socio-economic inequalities in access to health services. The
    community health program, designed to improve health services in poor and rural areas,
    involves basic training of CHW, the establishment of technical supervision and support by
    health centers, and performance-based incentives for community health worker
    cooperatives. MOH has started implementation through training of trainers, focusing on
                                             24
     familiarizing CHW with the package of services they are to deliver. Further improvement
     in community health worker training, as well as the elaboration of a skills-development
     strategy to improve quality of service provision, are among the challenges faced by
     MOH33.

·    The need for community-based action to complement facility-based efforts to achieve the
     hard-to-reach MDGs. The outreach model of the community PBF is particularly well
     suited to address behaviors by pregnant women and mothers that critically determine child
     health and nutrition outcomes. For example, precisely because the first well-baby visit at
     a health facility is too late to promote behaviors such as exclusive breastfeeding and use of
     colostrums, this outreach model is uniquely suited to bring messages to these women at
     the community-level.

·    The need to support and motivate CHW through performance-based payments tied to
     improved health indicators. Rwanda has successfully implemented nationwide a PBF
     system to improve the supply and quality of facility-based health services. In recognition
     of the fact that CHW require both technical support and adequate incentives to deliver
     services effectively, MOH is extending this approach to community-based services.
     Implementing the community PBF system, and effectively tying incentive payments to
     changes in key health indicators, present considerable technical and organizational
     challenges.     As discussed in the CPAF review (April 2009), the expected level of
     financing for the facility and community PBF schemes (US$1.45 per capita) was not
     achieved in 2008 and substantial additional resources are needed from MINECOFIN to
     ensure that the target for 2011 (US$2.25) will be met.

·    The need to rigorously evaluate policy innovations to ensure that they are cost effective in
     achieving improvements in health services and outcomes. Rwanda successfully undertook
     a randomized impact evaluation of the facility-based PBF system which definitively
     showed that the strategy leads to improved quality and utilization of basic health services.
     The evaluation also made a significant contribution to the international literature and
     evidence base in this area. A similar rigorous evaluation will be done to assess the
     effectiveness and impact of extending the PBF strategy to community-based services, and
     of using in-kind incentives on a large scale to encourage demand for reproductive and
     maternal health services. Given the scale of the evaluation, whereby four groups of 50
     Sectors will be randomized into a control and several intervention groups, the
     implementation challenges are significant.

57.     Actions to Date/Supported Measures: With the support of the CLSG-1, the GoR
achieved significant policy reforms to improve the provision of basic health services at
the community level. Progress to date on policy reforms, as well as further actions to be
supported under CLSG-2, are described below.




33
  For example, in 2008 it was found that in rural areas, 42 percent of deliveries are in a health facility, while in
urban areas, the proportion is 62 percent. Among children in the lowest socio-economic quintile who suffer
from diarrhea, 32 percent receive oral rehydration therapy, while the proportion among the highest quintile is 49
percent.
                                                        25
·   Policy on demand-side incentives for reproductive and maternal health. In line with its
    proposal to the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund, MOH has decided the broad
    parameters of a policy to incentivize utilization of maternal family planning and antenatal
    and delivery care. However, in order to achieve the desired outcomes, including the
    relevant program indicators relating to delivery care in health facilities and contraceptive
    prevalence, these policy decisions need to be operationalized.

·   Training policy to improve the delivery of basic services at the community level in poor
    rural areas. MOH has developed a community health service package and is currently
    implementing a basic training program for CHW. The requirements for community health
    worker competencies and the current training strategy have been evaluated to inform
    further development of the CHW management and training strategy. On the basis of this
    evaluation, MOH will take decisions on its community health worker training policy and
    operationalize the policy through an implementation plan and budget.

·   Performance-based financing (PBF) strategy to incentivize the delivery of basic health
    services at the community level. In the context of its community health program, MOH
    has taken the necessary policy decisions to begin implementation of a strategy to
    incentivize CHW based on their performance. These building blocks include the legal
    establishment of community health worker cooperatives and Sector-level steering
    committees, design of the payment system, selection of indicators, and transfers to District
    administrations for funding of the scheme. Community health worker incentives will be
    linked to quality reporting on a set of indicators, as well as to changes in specific service
    indicators. MOH will implement this initially in the first 30 VUP Sectors and then in a
    further 100 randomly selected Sectors.

·   Evidence base for policy decisions on the most cost-effective strategies to expand basic
    health services to achieve progress towards the MDGs. In line with its proposal to the
    Health Results Innovation Trust Fund, and consistent with its commitment to evidence-
    based policy-making, MOH is undertaking policy reforms in such a way that their
    effectiveness and impact can be rigorously evaluated through a randomized design. The
    reforms to be assessed (community PBF and in-kind maternal health incentives) have
    been determined by MOH, as have the design and methodology of the impact evaluation,
    for which baseline data collection is planned in the beginning of 2010.

58.    The triggers for CLSG-3 include: (a) a trigger that ensures that the MOH budget and
implementation plan sufficiently reflects the Community PBF; (b) a trigger that captures the
implementation of the maternal health (demand-side incentive) strategy and (c) a trigger that
captures implementation of the performance-based (supply-side incentive) contracts with the
CHW cooperatives.

59.     Expected Results: Improved coverage of high-impact HNP interventions at the
community level is expected to respond to the health needs of poor households. The
transfer of knowledge and health services to communities will help households better manage
their own health care, which will contribute to improved productivity and higher income-
earning potential. The program is expected to contribute to: (a) improved outcomes such as
use of modern contraceptives and ultimately reductions in fertility and population growth; (b)
improved child health and nutrition outcomes (for example, reduced dehydration from

                                               26
diarrhea, and improved referral for malnourished children); and (c) improved maternal health
outcomes through expanded use of facility-based deliveries.

                            OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

60.    In line with GoR's overall objective under the EDPRS of alleviating poverty, the
VUP social protection program and the policy reforms to be supported under this
operation aim to reduce extreme poverty among Rwandan households and to expand
access to high-impact health, nutrition and population (HNP) interventions at the
community level.

61.     The social protection policies supported by this operation are expected to
contribute to (a) a reduction in the income-poverty gaps in pilot Sectors over a three-year
period; and (b) greater opportunities for beneficiaries to seek self-reliance and to graduate into
income-generating activities from public works and in some cases from direct support
programs.

62.   Community HNP policies are intended to improve access to high-impact services by
poor households, particularly in rural areas, contributing to addressing persistent socio-
economic disparities in utilization of health services and in health outcomes. The expected
outcomes will be closely monitored by specific indicators and rigorous impact evaluation of
the VUP will be undertaken with support from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund.


ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

63.    Under Operational Policy (OP) 8.60, on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is
required to determine whether specific country policies supported under the operation
are likely to cause significant effects on the country's environment, and, in the event of
such likely effects, to assess the country systems for reducing such adverse effects and
enhancing such positive effects. In the event of significant gaps in the analysis, or
shortcomings in the country systems, the Bank is required to identify how such gaps or
shortcomings would be addressed before or during program implementation, as appropriate.
Following these policy requirements, specific country policies supported by the CLSG in the
form of budget support are not likely to cause significant positive or negative effects on
Rwanda's environment, forests and other natural resources.

64.    While GoR's social protection policies relating to the CLSG-2 operation are, in
themselves, not likely to cause significant effects on the country's environment, forests,
or natural resources, MINALOC has sought to facilitate cooperation in this area by
incorporating prevailing environmental and technical assistance guidelines in the
operational manual for its public works program (see Annex 17).             Environmental
challenges are being addressed through the environmental framework of the GoR's Strategic
Plan for Agricultural Transformation for marshland development (see Annex 17).



                                               27
65.     In the area of health policy, MOH adopted an Environmental Health Policy in
2008, which provides the overall context for a more specific "Policy on Injection Safety,
Prevention of Transmission of Nosocomial Infections and Healthcare Waste
Management," approved in 2009. The policy aims to put in place mechanisms, systems,
and practices to prevent transmission of infection through injections and other medical
procedures, and ensure that medical waste is disposed in a safe manner that does not pose any
risk to health personnel, patients, or the community. The implementation details are spelled
out in the "National Standards and Guidelines for Injection Safety, Prevention of
Transmission of Hospital Infections and Medical Waste Management," developed by MOH's
Epidemiology and Public Hygiene Unit.34 Both policies are intended to address the risk of
HIV transmission, but also to comprehensively respond to other infectious blood-borne
diseases such as hepatitis and Ebola. Based on analysis of HIV transmission routes, there is
no evidence in Rwanda that infectious waste is a major source of HIV transmission.

66.     In sum, the country systems have adequate capacity to mitigate the potentially
small negative effects, if any. The framework for environmental management has evolved in
the last decade, resulting in noticeable improvements in institutional capacity. Arrangements
have been made to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to address any minor effects
that might arise under the GoRs's VUP and health sector programs. The operation therefore
complies fully with the requirements of OP 8.60.


IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

67.     In September 2008, GoR and all budget support donors signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) governing the provision of direct budget support for
implementation of the EDPRS. The MoU, which replaces the 2003 Partnership Framework,
outlines monitoring and performance management responsibilities and guidelines.

68.    In line with the MoU, the CLSG-1 was aligned with the CPAF, with the exception
of one health indicator that, by mutual agreement, is an intermediate indicator relating
to child mortality and malnutrition. This alignment was achieved through close
collaboration between the GoR and budget support donors. The CLSG-2 operation will
continue this dialogue and will support the ongoing evolution of the CPAF.

69.     The Policy Matrix (Annex 2) for the proposed operation provides a results
framework that describes expected immediate and short-term outcomes as well as
indicators to measure progress during the annual operations, and identifies agencies
accountable for reporting. The matrix and indicators are consistent with the CPAF and
sector-specific frameworks. Benchmarks will be regularly evaluated and interim steps taken
by GoR will be monitored.35



34
   In addition to specifying guidelines and standards, it also specifies the roles and responsibilities with regard to
medical waste management at the central and district levels (as well as for the private sector), and their
respective roles in: waste management at the facility level and in waste production, storage, collection,
transportation, and disposal, with special emphasis on guidelines for infected waste.
35
   GoR's detailed monitoring framework for the VUP program is described in Annex 13.
                                                         28
Social Protection M&E framework

70.     Monitoring of the VUP program and policy actions under CLSG-2 will draw on
data and findings from a range of sources. The VUP monitoring system is now well-
developed. From each Sector (and District), program-relevant data are transmitted on a
regular basis to the VUP program management unit, housed within MINALOC's Community
Development Fund (CDF). Data include number of workers participating in public works
programs, the number of days of employment generated, the number of households under the
direct support program, and the amounts disbursed.

71.    The established baseline values and determined targets are presented in Table 5.
These indicators have been discussed with MINALOC and MINECOFIN and are consistent
with the CPAF.

assessed with reference to the proportion of
households in the bottom two categories of extreme
poverty (as identified by the Ubudehe process). This
exercise is expected to be done in a sample of pilot
Sectors37

72.    To learn from experience and to modify the design of the program accordingly,
an impact evaluation will be undertaken three years after the inception of the operation.
This evaluation will examine the impact of the VUP program and the modified policy
framework underlying this program on households' socioeconomic status, and health and
education outcomes.

Community Health, Nutrition and Population M&E framework

73.    The main indicators and targets for the community HNP policy relate to
increased financing and coverage of high-impact interventions on maternal and child
health, and family planning. The indicators in the policy matrix are among those that have
been agreed between GoR and partners within the Common Performance Assessment
Framework (CPAF) or by separate agreement in the case of indicator 2 (see Table 6). The
MOH annually tracks the progress toward these (and other) CPAF and EDPRS indicators.
The 2008 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) provides baseline estimates; follow-up
measures will be provided by routine reporting systems, including the reporting system being


36
   To ensure that the proportion of eligible households will not be reduced due to any intervening factor, such as
budget constraints, this key monitoring indicator has been fixed at a minimum of 35% throughout the period of
this operation.

set up as part of the performance-based payment mechanism. Another DHS is planned for
2010. In the years between the two DHS surveys, the project will track intermediate outcome
indicators, which will be used to ensure that MOH is on track to achieve the outcome
indicators that have been set for the project. While not formally part of the Monitoring
Framework, these intermediate outcome indicators will assist with supervision and mitigate
the programmatic risk posed by the long interval (2-3 years) between formal surveys (see
Table 7)39. Because the implementation is to be scaled up in selected Sectors, the indicators
will be disaggregated by geographic area. The indicators from DHS will also be
disaggregated by income quintile to track progress among the poorest quintiles.

74.     Performance-based financing (PBF) has special data requirements, and an
information system has been developed in support of Community PBF that builds on the
existing health information system capacity in health centers (see Annex 16). The system
is currently being streamlined to ensure data quality and address some practical issues that
arose during its initial implementation. Innovative data collection strategies are also being
explored, such as the use of cell phones by CHW to upload data from the field.

75.    Key indicators for monitoring progress are shown in Table 6. The responsible
agency is MoH.

   The choice of intermediate indicators was informed by the HNP Results Chain developed through an extensive
consultation process under the leadership of the Bank's Africa Human Development (AFTHD) and Results
Learning (AFTRL) departments.
40
   This is the only health CPAF indicator that was not met as reported in the 2009 Budget Support Review. This
raises doubts as to whether the target for 2011 is realistic. However, the target is not formally changed here in
order to be consistent with the targets in CPAF.

   Indicators (2) to (4) require household survey data and no new data will be available before the 2010 DHS.

76.     A rigorous impact evaluation is a key part of the evaluation framework to assess
the impact of the community HNP policy reforms. The randomized design entails data
collection through baseline and follow-up household surveys of target and control Sectors.
The follow-up surveys will collect data on service quality and utilization by socio-economic
status in order to assess the extent to which the community health reforms are helping the
poor. The factorial design of the impact evaluation is illustrated by Table 8. Baseline survey
is expected to begin in January of 2010.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

77.     The public financial management system is reasonably adequate to support the
CLSG. In addition, a key focus of the complementary PRSG operation is providing
continuing support to strengthening the GoR's 5-year Public Financial Management (PFM)
Reform Strategy 2008-2012 in its second year of implementation. The strategy was prepared
on the basis of the 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) outcomes
which provided a strong foundation for a better understanding of the PFM environment.
Assessments of the fiduciary aspects are largely based on results of several diagnostics.
These include the Country Financial Accountability Assessment of 2005 and the PEFA of
2007. They indicate that public financial management and procurement systems have been
improving steadily, in line with government commitment to reform (as outlined in its
Financial Accountability Review and Action Plan), and that the dialogue between the
Government and donors has been constructive. GoR has also recently completed a Public
Financial Management (PFM) Action Plan to ensure comprehensiveness and consistency of
reforms. This plan has been endorsed by key donors engaged in supporting the GoR's reform
agenda. Fiduciary assessments are also based on results from recently completed Public
Expenditure Reviews (PER) in the education, health, agriculture, and water sectors, as well
as from the 2004 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Assessment and the 2005 Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). In addition, the most recent safeguards
assessment of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) was completed by the IMF in the context
of the PRGF arrangement approved on June 12, 2006. The updated assessment proposed
recommendations to address continuing vulnerabilities in the external audit and financial
reporting areas. The implementation of these measures is being monitored under the Fund
program. Finally, the Bank is undertaking a policy-driven technical assistance PER to
provide capacity building support to Government in expenditure analysis and monitoring.
GoR has also committed to a second PEFA in 2010.


DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

78.     The IDA grant will be disbursed as a single tranche of SDR 3.9 million (US$6
million equivalent) upon effectiveness. The proposed grant will follow the Bank's
disbursement procedures for development policy operations. The grant will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation of the development policy and not tied to any specific
purchases. Subsequent to Bank Board approval and grant effectiveness, the Bank will
disburse the proceeds of the grant into an account designated by the Recipient at the central
bank of Rwanda (National Bank of Rwanda) and forming part of Rwanda's foreign exchange
reserves. The Recipient will ensure that upon deposit of the grant proceeds into said account,
an equivalent amount is credited in the Recipient's budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to IDA, with an indication of the exchange rate applied, where applicable. IDA
reserves the right to request an audit of such account. If the proceeds of the grant are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, the Recipient will be requested to
refund to IDA an amount equal to the amount of said payment, promptly upon notice from
IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration
of this grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.


                                               32
79.     Within two business days, the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) will credit the
Rwanda Franc equivalent of the grant proceeds to the consolidated account maintained
on behalf of GoR which finances budgeted expenditures. The Director of Treasury will be
notified accordingly. The NBR will not impose any charges or commissions on GoR for these
transactions. The conversion from US$ to Rwanda Franc will be based on the prevailing
exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the consolidated account. GoR,
through the MINECOFIN, will ­ (i) provide written confirmation within 30 days to the Bank
that an amount equivalent to the grant proceeds from the Bank has been credited to the
consolidated account, with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (ii) provide evidence
that the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the grant proceeds was recorded as financing for GoR
budget; and (iii) ensure that the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the grant proceeds are subject to
controls to ensure its use for eligible budgeted public expenditures only.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

80.     There are four main potential risks associated with the program: (a)
macroeconomic and financial sector risk; (b) regional/country risk; (c) program risk; and (d)
fiduciary risk.

81.     Macroeconomic and Financial Risk. Given GoR's strong record in macroeconomic
management and its overall satisfactory rating, as evidenced by reviews under the PRGF, the
recent economic reforms, and experience with budget support under the first PRSC/G series,
the macroeconomic and financial risk is low. Nonetheless, with high aid dependency and a
low tax base, managing injections of liquidity into the economy may present dilemmas. To
mitigate these risks, the Bank and the IMF will continue to provide support for
macroeconomic reforms and a commitment to use market-based instruments to contain
inflation and exchange rate appreciations.

82.     Country and Regional Risk. Currently, Rwanda's internal security and political
situation remains stable but continued effort is needed to address the remaining political
effects of the 1994 genocide and the recent flare-ups of violence in Eastern DRC in late 2008.
International and regional efforts have been made to mitigate instability in the Great Lakes
sub-region, and the Bank supports efforts aimed at fostering peace and security between
Rwanda and its neighbors. In January 2009, the governments of GoR and DRC signed a joint
military agreement to disarm the Rwandan Democratic Liberation Forces44 (FDLR). The
joint efforts could mark an important breakthrough in achieving greater peace and stability in
the region.

83.     Program Risk. Given Rwanda's high dependency on international assistance,
particularly in the areas of social protection and health, there is a significant risk that
unpredictable donor aid flows could hinder the implementation of GoR policies. While
Rwanda managed to cushion delays in donor funding in 2009 - partially related to withdrawal
of budget support by SIDA and the Netherlands following flare-ups in Eastern Congo (see
above) - by strong revenues, accumulated deposits, and increased budget spending, the GoR's
programs remain vulnerable to the unpredictability of donor aid. However, there are strong

     Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda
                                                    33
signs of efforts by GoR to prioritize on-budget resources towards the most effective services,
and of improved coordination between GoR and donors to mitigate this risk. Budget support
donors and GoR demonstrated their commitment by signing a Memorandum of
Understanding in September 2008 governing provision of direct budget support for the
implementation of the EDPRS. Rwanda also explicitly states in its EDPRS that it seeks to
decrease its aid dependency.

84.     More specific risks to implementation of the VUP and health sector policies involve
challenges in local governments. The DCDP project (see Section IV and related paragraphs),
which plays a key role in addressing capacity-constraints at decentralized levels, is helping to
strengthen overall implementation mechanisms at local levels. Ensuring the sustainability of
technical support is critical to maintaining current implementation levels and to the ambitious
scale-up of VUP. There is a risk that DCDP, now in its final phase of implementation, will
not be continued, leading to challenges of program management at central levels,
implementation, and regular monitoring and evaluation. Options to mitigate this risk include:
(a) a follow-up program to the DCDP program scheduled to formally close in December
2010, and (b) encouraging other donor support, particular from those already involved in the
VUP, such as DFID.

85.     On the social protection side, particular risks revolve around the use of SACCOs45 to
make payments to beneficiaries under the VUP. While the GoR is developing a new SACCO
structure to cover all Sectors, it is essential that the interests of poor households are fully
considered, excessive charges and transaction costs are reduced if not removed, and the full
inclusion and equal rights of such households are ensured within the SACCO structure.
Under the CLSG-2 operation, dialogue with the GoR is ongoing to address this key aspect of
payments under the VUP. Further support to address implementation risks under the CLSG
operation includes providing ongoing support to the GoR to assess the impact of pilots on
targeted households, as well as to address challenges on the ground to making the
implementation of social protection policies sustainable within budget constraints. Similar
capacity constraints pose a risk to implementation of the health sector policy reforms, and
these are being mitigated by support to the government by the Bank and other partners,
particularly UNICEF and USAID, on technical and implementation issues.

86.    Fiduciary Risks. The rapid decentralization undertaken by GoR has heightened
potential procurement and public financial management (PFM) risks. GoR has committed to
accelerating its efforts to address these risks and progress has been made in recent years. This
includes the recent passage of the procurement law and the Accountants Bill and completion
of Rwanda's first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) in

areas still need strengthening. GoR is addressing these issues with the help of development
donors, including the Bank. To further address fiduciary risks, particularly those related to
rapid decentralization, both the Bank and other donors are providing ongoing support and

Recent Decentralization Reform).

 PROSPECTS46
 A.        RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

 Recent Growth Performance

 1.      Rwanda's US $4.547 billion economy has remained resilient over the last five
 years, sustaining macroeconomic stability and real GDP growth despite the global
 economic slowdown and exogenous shocks that affected agricultural productivity. The
 economy grew by 11.2 percent in 2008. The high growth rate in 2008 was mainly due to the
 strong recovery in agriculture, which grew by nearly 15 percent, as a result of the expansion
 of the crop intensification program (CIP). This has contributed to an estimated average
 annual GDP growth for the period 2005-09 of 7.8 percent, which exceeds the EDPRS target
 of 7 percent.

 2.      However, compared to other countries in the region, and Sub-Saharan Africa on
 average, Rwanda has experienced a relatively more severe reduction in growth trends in
 2009, which pose a serious threat to poverty reduction. The World Economic Outlook
 estimates a 4 percentage point decrease in growth for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) on average
 to an estimated level of around 1 percent growth in 2009. In the Great Lakes region, growth
 is expected to slow from 5.8 to 4.3 percent, or a reduction of 1.5 percentage points. In Kenya,
 Tanzania and Uganda, growth is expected to slow down by roughly 2 percentage points for
 each country, leading to estimated growth levels in 2009 of 2, 5 and 7 percent, respectively.
 These trends contrast with the severe reduction in growth for Rwanda from 11.2 percent in
 2008 to an estimated 3.3 percent growth rate in 2009. This represents a 7.9 percentage point
 reduction in growth between 2008 and 2009, or is close to a 4 percentage point lower level of
 growth in 2009 compared to the average growth of 7.5 percent between 2005 and 2008.
 These trends raise substantial risks to meeting the target of halving poverty by 2020 since the
 EDPRS estimates that GDP will need to growth by at least 8 percent per annum to achieve
 this target.

 3.      The 3 to 4 percentage point reduction in GDP growth, from 5-year historical
 trends, to levels estimated for 2009 is due both to the global crisis and domestic liquidity

      The estimate shown is consistent with the latest Bank/IMF analysis. The GoR's LDP cites a lower figure.

issues. Lower estimated growth between 2008 and 2009 results principally from stagnation in
the industry and services sector (as shown in Table 5.1). Estimated agricultural growth during
2009 reflected both lower commodity export growth and sustained high growth in the food
crop sector. Continued investment under the Government's Crop Intensification program
helped to raise productivity and mitigate the effects of the global crisis.

4.      Overall, the global financial crisis, has led to lower export performance, GDP
growth and revenues. The impact of the global economic and financial crisis is expected to
manifest through three main channels: (a) declining external demand for Rwandan goods and
services (mainly for tourism and mineral exports); (b) slumping commodity prices,
particularly for minerals; and (c) scarcer financial inflows, including Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI). To date, the global crisis has had a limited effect on FDI, tourism and
remittance receipts. The situation for these areas will continue to be closely monitored, as
there are likely to be larger lagged effects. However, there has been a substantial impact on
export receipts which dropped by 32 percent in the first six months of 2009, while exports of
goods and services are projected to decrease by 25 percent (f.o.b., US Dollar terms) in 2009
compared to 2008. Lower export growth as well as the stagnation in the industry and services
sectors stems both from the liquidity constraints that arose in the latter part of 2008 due to
structural issues in the banking sector coupled with the effect of the global financial crisis on
domestic expectations. Credit to the private sector dropped by as much as 24 percent or from
RwF 94.4 billion in the first half of 2008 to RwF 71.7 billion over the same period in 2009.
The details of the issues that contributed to tight domestic liquidity are outlined below (under
the section that provides an overview of financial and monetary performance).

5.      Prudent implementation of macro-economic policies and protection of priority
spending has enabled the Government to manage the impacts of the crisis. Government
adopted various measures in order to protect priority spending and limit the extent of the
growth slowdown: (i) it reduced spending in non-priority areas (while maintaining priority
spending); (ii) it drew down foreign reserves; and (iii) it allowed the fiscal deficit to widen.
Policies aimed to reduce inflation and improve the liquidity situation were also adopted and
are discussed in further detail below.

6.      Inflationary pressures decreased in 2009 Figure 5.1: Trend in Inflation
as international commodity and food prices fell
and government managed the exchange rate
leading to its improved flexibility while
increasing the coordination between monetary
and fiscal policies. Slow growth in housing and
food prices led to a decline in inflation by July
2009 to 5.8 percent, down from the high level of
22.3 percent in December 2008. Finally, both the
global slowdown as well as government policies to
contain prices contributed to the reduction in
inflation.    Government policies included: (i)
controlling pump prices by offering taxation
subsidies to importers; (ii) tightening monetary policy to reduce broad money growth from 30
percent in 2008 to around 11 percent in 2009; and (iii) tightening fiscal policy by reducing
expenditures. As a result, the annual average and end of period (December 2009) inflation
rates are projected at 12.0 percent and 6.0 percent respectively.
                                               59
External Balance

7.     Import growth exceeded the increase in exports leading to a deterioration of the
balance of payments in 2008 and 2009. The growth in imports is primarily led by public
investment which drove imports of machinery and equipment in 2007 and 2008. The fall in
exports in 2009 is due to slowing global demand and will be partially offset by a 6 percent
reduction in imports. Due to the slight decline in coffee and tea prices, it is projected that the
value of their exports (coffee and tea) will increase moderately from US$ 46.9 million and
US$ 40 million respectively in 2008, to US$ 50.6 million and US$ 47.9 million respectively
in 2009. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and other capital inflows are also estimated to be
lower in 2009, resulting in the deterioration of the overall balance of payments, which is
estimated to be in a deficit of US$ 27.4 million in 2009, compared to a surplus of $64.7
million in 2008.

8.      There will be a widening current account deficit in 2009 compared to 2008,
resulting in part from a worsening in the terms of trade. The current account deficit
(including official transfers) is estimated to have worsened from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008
to about 6.6 percent of GDP in 2009, driven by the continued slowdown in global demand.
Accrual of the special SDR allocation from the IMF helped to reconstitute foreign reserves
from a level of 4.7 months of imports at end-2008 to 5.5 months of imports by end-2009.
Current projections are that over the fiscal year 2010/11, (beginning in July 2010), the
ongoing global financial crisis will lead to lower donor commitments, lower export receipts
and a projected financing gap. Therefore, a widening of the current account deficit could be
compounded by the projected decrease in donor grants should there be a delayed recovery
from the global financial crisis. This would pose significant risks to the Government's
program, making it difficult to continue to protect priority spending.

9.      To ensure Government's ability to protect priority spending, additional funds
from the Crisis Response Window of $29.8 million will be disbursed under PRSG-6,
bringing the total amount of the operation to $115.8 million. These funds will be used to
maintain poverty reducing spending in education, agriculture, and infrastructure. In
education, funds will go toward accelerating the 9-year basic education program for the
payment of teachers' salaries, capitation grants, books and other materials and feeding costs.
In agriculture, funds will help maintain the Government's planned activities under the Crop
Intensification program to improve agriculture productivity with an emphasis on capacity
support to farmers in the use of improved inputs and access to rural finance. As shown above,

                                                           61
Government interventions to improve agriculture productivity and access to markets have
been instrumental in mitigating the effects of the crisis and improving Rwanda's resilience to
external shocks. In the infrastructure sector, funds will support investments to improve the
road network with an emphasis on road maintenance, particularly in rural areas. The Crisis
Response Window funds will therefore ensure that ongoing efforts in these areas are not
compromised, particularly if the global slowdown persists.

Fiscal Performance

10.     The expansionary fiscal stance of the past year or two has slowed down in 2009.
Total expenditure and net lending remained more or less at the same level in 2009 as in 2008.
Spending increases in priority sectors (i.e., education, health, agriculture and transport) that
occurred in 2008 have been maintained in 2009 (see Table 5.3) with the exception of
education. (However, Crisis Response Window funds will be used to fill the financing gap for
the 9-year basic education program and help protect priority spending in agriculture and
roads)48. Government has also continued to support increasing transfer of funds to the
Districts and to maintain investments (as shown by the trend in transfers in Figure 5.3).
However, slowing growth and lower inflation will lead to a decline in revenues to historical
levels (from 14.9 percent of GDP in 2008 to an estimated 12.5 percent in 2009). This will
result in a widening of the fiscal deficit before grants from 11 to 13.8 percent.




48
  Specifically, receipt of these funds will enable GoR to accelerate the 9-year basic education program,
including the one child one computer project. Funds will be used for the payment of teachers' salaries,
capitation grants, provisions of books and other materials and feeding costs. The implementation of these
programs has resulted in scaling up of education sector expenditures considerably and the Fast Track Initiative
funds are not enough to carter for these outlays.

11.     A gradual reduction in resources was planned for the period 2009/10, based on
anticipated lower levels of revenues and external resources (compared to disbursements
in 2008). The 2009/2010 budget submitted to Parliament envisaged a reduction in spending of
around 0.4 percent of GDP (or 1 percent of GDP during the period January to June 2009). In
addition, to maintain priority spending, Government drew down foreign reserves. Looking
beyond 2010/11, projected lower levels of donor grants currently imply a financing gap of
around 2 percent of GDP. Additional funds will therefore be needed to ensure continued
protection of priority spending in line with the EDPRS priorities and to provide a buffer
against potential future shocks. In response to this additional need, the Bank has applied to
the Crisis Response Window (CRW), to receive an additional US $29.8 million, to be
disbursed through the PRSG-6 operation.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies and Performance

12.     In the financial sector, aside from the liquidity ratio, financial indicators
remained within their prudential benchmarks; and the stability of the banking sector
has at present not been adversely affected by the global financial situation. All 8
commercial banks have been in compliance with the minimum capital requirements of
approximately US $9.2 million.         Reported foreign exchange exposure ratios have been
within the prudential BNR benchmarks; and the quality of the loan portfolio has improved.
However, the current liquidity shortage in the banking sector could be exacerbated by the
impact of the global financial crisis leading to a reduction in the availability of credit. This
effect coupled with the real effective appreciation of the exchange rate in 2008 by 22 percent
(due to high domestic inflation), would increase the demand for foreign exchange and
imports, and undermine Rwanda's competitiveness.

13.   Rwanda's financial sector moved from a situation of a structural excess liquidity
to a potential structural liquidity deficit partly due to efficiency gains from ongoing

                                                   63
reforms in the sector as well as NBR's low interest rate policy. The past policy of low
interest rates led to strong credit growth in 2007-08 while discouraging savings. As a result,
credit to the private sector increased above 30 percent in late-2008. The global financial
situation also contributed to these trends. Low nominal interest rates combined with high
inflation encouraged depositors to look for better yielding investments, which resulted in
partial withdrawal of deposits from the banking system.

14.    The liquidity shortages exposed weaknesses in risk management and governance
of commercial banks, i.e. a mismatch in credit maturities (for bank borrowing and
lending). This prompted the banks to tighten credit standards leading to a decline in credit
growth. The liquidity problems in the banking sector became apparent in the fourth quarter of
2008, as the loan-to-deposit ratios increased and banks reduced their purchases of NBR and
government's financial instruments.

15.     In response to the tightening liquidity situation, the BNR injected liquidity of
approximately 1.5 percent of GDP in the economy. This was aimed at providing
immediate liquidity, sustaining credit expansion, and boosting economic growth in 2009.
Government repaid RwF 18 billion worth of T-bills by end-2008 and reduced the reserve
requirements from 8 to 5 percent. Also, during the first part of 2009, government eased its low
interest rate policy. This caused the average real interest rate for deposits to increase,
although it remained negative. The stock of private sector credit increased to RwF 7.1 billion
in June 2009, and remained above its mid-2008 level (of RwF 5.1 billion).

16.    Despite the injection, broad money supply (M2) growth slowed and is projected
to be negative in 2009. Growth of broad money (M2) is projected to have slowed from a
level of 24.2 percent in 2008 to 2.6 percent in 2009. This contrasts with growth of 30.8
percent in 2007, and reflects the tighter monetary policy and reduction in the monetary
overhang.

17.     Reserve money remains the anchor of the monetary program. GoR's reserve
money objective consists of an active use of interest rate policy supported by a proper
communication strategy to help anchor interest rate expectations, reduce volatility, and
strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The quantitative targets for reserve
money were rebased to reflect the reduction of the reserve requirement and to accommodate a
buffer of excess reserves (RwF 4 to 5 billion) that would support the efficient operations of
the payments system and the inter-bank market for short-term liquidity.

Debt Sustainability

18.     The most recent DSA dated December 2008, concludes that Rwanda is now at a
moderate risk of debt distress owing to recent debt relief and its narrow export base.
With the exception of the net present value of exports to debt which breaches the threshold of
150 under extreme stress tests, all debt indicators remain below their respective thresholds.
Exogenous shocks to exports or imprudent borrowing on non-concessional terms could cause
a rapid deterioration in the medium-term outlook. A more recent and preliminary assessment
presented in the sixth review of the PRGF indicated that the medium-term external debt
sustainability has improved since the December 2008 assessment, and that the non-
concessional borrowing, for upgrading and rehabilitation of roads in and around Kigali, would
not significantly worsen the debt outlook (see Box 5.1).
                                              64
19.     The amount of domestic debt is small and expected to decline further as the BNR
limits the use of domestic debt instruments and instead relies mainly on foreign
exchange sales for sterilization so as to increase exchange rate flexibility. Greater
flexibility of the nominal exchange rate will be essential to ensure the adherence to
quantitative monetary targets while containing excessive real appreciation of the Rwandan
franc. In addition, the GoR remains committed to limiting external debt and keeping to a
minimum 50 percent grant element.

20.     GoR has taken steps to prevent the reemergence of unsustainable debt by
preparing a debt management strategy with limits for loans, government guarantees and
contingent liabilities that will guide future borrowing. The Government continues to take
strong steps to improve debt management practices. In 2008, the GoR developed and
published a Debt Policy and Medium Term Debt Strategy. This ensures conformity to the best
practice in public debt and the associated management of risk(s) to reduce the possibility of
falling into an unsustainable debt position. The Bank is providing technical support in the
implementation of the strategy. In addition, Government has undertaken complementary
reforms to ensure that public spending is effective and sustains growth. Specifically, a Public
Financial Management (PFM) action plan was recently adopted which aims to consolidate
and strengthen reforms to improve the implementation of the MTEF and the budget
monitoring system. A framework for implementing a Public Investment Program (PIP) was
also recently elaborated and adopted in February 2009. The aim is to ensure good
coordination of investment across and within sectors, establish an analytical and information
base for prioritizing investments and support the strengthening of capacity in this area.

Box 5.1: Rwanda: Update of Selected DSA Indicators
 The ratio of the PV of external public and publicly guaranteed debt to exports of goods and services
 (traditionally the weakest DSA indicator for Rwanda) has improved considerably. Part of this improvement is
 attributable to the change in estimation methodology for tourism receipts. The old methodology yields lower
 receipts compared to the recently adopted methodology. There has been some concern expressed by the
 authorities and staffs of both the Bank and the Fund on the potential over-estimation of tourism receipts. The
 Bank and Fund staffs support the authorities' efforts to refine these estimates. Nevertheless, whether the new
 or old methodology for estimating tourist receipts is employed, Rwanda remains at a moderate risk of debt
 distress.

B.   MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS

21.     The GoR's medium term outlook for real GDP growth has been revised
downward slightly to roughly 5 percent. Growth will continue to be based on increased
productivity in the agricultural and mining sectors, and strong public and private sector
investment activity. This outlook is contingent on favorable weather conditions in the next
few years, continued implementation of policies to promote commodity export and successful
implementation of the medium-term policy agenda as outlined in the EDPRS on five fronts:
(i) carrying out Government's planned investments in infrastructure; (ii) improving
agricultural yields, supported by actions in the new fertilizer strategy; (iii) sustaining progress
on the private sector development program; (iv) accelerating overall export growth and
diversifying the export base; and (v) taking actions aimed at enhancing the efficiency of
investment as outlined in the new Public Investment Policy.

22.     A projected annual GDP growth of between 5 and 6 percent would be sustained
through increased public and private sector investments to improve agriculture
productivity and address infrastructure constraints to growth. Reflecting the strong
emphasis that GoR is placing on public infrastructure investment, overall investment rates are
projected to rise fairly steadily from about 21 percent of GDP in 2007, to about 24 percent of
GDP by 2011. Public investment will increase from 8.6 percent in 2007 to close to 10 percent
of GDP by 2011. With the private sector's engagement in the social sectors and also in
infrastructure expected to be strengthened, private investment would also trend upward
gradually to about 12 percent of GDP per year, in the medium-term.

23.     Strong import growth stemming from higher capital imports associated with the
expanding public investment program, is expected to outpace moderate expansion in
exports, resulting in a higher current account deficit. Export volumes led by receipts from
traditional exports and tourism, are forecasted to increase at a relatively slower rate as the
GoR implements its export promotion strategy. This is expected to widen the external current
account deficit considerably from about 5 percent of GDP (including grants) in 2007, to about
9 percent of GDP (including grants) by 2011.

24.     Government capital spending would increase strongly over the medium term, in
line with the need for increased investment to accelerate and sustain growth, causing the
overall fiscal balance to remain in deficit. The deficit (including grants) would widen to
about 3.2 percent of GDP by 2011, up significantly from under 1.5 percent in 2007. This
increase would be due to higher investments.

25.     The share of priority spending will increase annually by about 2 percent of GDP
depending on the availability of sufficient resources. More resources will be dedicated to
public infrastructure, agriculture, education, health and water. Increased spending in the
education sector will go towards improving delivery of primary and post-basic education and
vocational training and skills development. In the heath sector, focus will be on financing
programs to improve primary health care, financing of the mutuelle scheme and purchase of
drugs. Infrastructure spending will be geared towards addressing the issue of limited and
insufficient energy through construction of the hydro power dams, the generation of power
from the Lake Kivu Methane gas power plant, and rehabilitation of infrastructure, including in
the water and transport sectors. At the decentralized level, transfers to Districts are projected
to increase as the Government implements its fiscal decentralization policy, with increases in
                                              66
capitation grants in education and performance based financing in the health sector, feeder
roads financing in the transport sector and funds to cover District overhead costs.

26.     Beyond the allocation of funds for poverty related expenditure, improving the
efficiency of such spending and its targeting to the poor remains a significant challenge.
The GoR is therefore focusing on improving the prioritization and efficiency of expenditures.
Efforts are being made to strengthen the institutional framework for the Public Investment
Program. To date, a public investment policy has been adopted and guidelines for identifying
investment selection criteria and project prioritization that maximize the returns on
investment, and safeguards public debt sustainability are being developed. The Government
has also embarked on the process to institutionalize public expenditure reviews with the aim
of strengthening public expenditure management and monitoring of spending. The intent is to
strengthen the expenditure prioritization process within sectors and improve accountability of
line ministries.

27.      Over the medium term,
budgetary grants will continue to be Table 5.4: Donor Budget Support Commitments,

Rwanda joint security operation.

28.     Consistent with the medium-term policy objective of maintaining macroeconomic
stability, the Central Bank is expected to contain inflationary pressures from any fiscal
expansion and scaled-up external assistance. Average inflation is expected to decline from
around 15 percent in 2008, due to rising food, transport and energy prices, to single digits by
2009-10. The reduction in inflation reflects the price pass through from declining
international food prices and domestic policy.           Projections are that with strong
implementation of monetary policy, inflation could decline to about 5.2 percent per annum
during 2009-12.

Adequacy of the Macro-Economic Policy Framework

29.     Overall, the medium term macro-economic framework is assessed to be sound
and adequate to support the Government's program. As noted in the completed sixth
review of the IMF's PRGF, the medium-term outlook, including inflation, economic growth
and financing remains favorable. GoR will continue with policies to mitigate the negative
impacts of global and external shocks. It will exercise prudence in implementation of macro-
economic policy with a focus on ensuring coordinated fiscal and monetary policies.
Government will also continue to pursue policies that support private sector led growth
through the development of a Public Investment Program, implementation of the Financial
Sector Development Plan and the Rural Development Program. Investments are planned to
improve agriculture productivity, reduce soil erosion and improve irrigation. There is also
evidence that the investments in the energy sector aimed at reducing the dependence on
thermal power is paying off with the progress made in power generation in the Lake Kivu
electricity project. This along with investments in the Nyaborongo hydro-power project will
help reduce the cost of energy to firms and households. GoR is also now in the process of
developing a strategic plan for post-basic education to address the issue of skills development.
These measures should help to expand productivity and establish the foundation for long-term
sustainable growth.

ANNEX 6: OVERVIEW OF UBUDEHE

1. An important, relatively early aspect of SP development within Rwanda was the re-
establishment of Ubudehe, a traditional Rwandan process of village-level community
decision-making based on discussion, gathering of systematic information, and decision-
making through community meetings in which all villagers participate.

2. "Ubudehe is a traditional practice and culture of collective action to solve community
problems. It has been adopted by GoR as an approach to fight poverty. It is present at
9,000 cells all over the country. The 2006 Ubudehe survey results suggest it should be a core
method of GoR's approach to fighting poverty because it is embedded in Rwandan mind sets,
is seen as an approach that benefits the poor, primarily through increasing access to livestock,
promotes social capital and unification, increases participation in planning and decision
making, and empowers the poor and women." 49

3. Under Ubudehe, two village committees are elected: one to oversee implementation
of communal decisions, and the other to function as a sentinel or oversight committee
that activates itself only if concerns arise about the functioning of the first committee.
These community-driven processes have been used in all villages for multiple purposes,
including identifying and overseeing projects to address community problems, identifying
village priorities as part of local government planning processes, and identifying the poorest
households in the village that would receive community-managed income support. The last
of these functions entails a systematic process through which each village has created its own
geographic and social map of the villages which shows physical features and structures, each
household's home, and codes for relevant socioeconomic characteristics of each family. This
"poverty-mapping" process, which has a systematic methodology, allocates each household to
one of six ordinal income and poverty-related categories differentiated by well-defined
qualitative criteria. The maps have become the basis for community decision-making about
income support in cash or in kind to ultra-poor households from local and donor sources, and
about which households should receive subsidies for health insurance. More recently, similar
processes have been used to identify community priorities for consideration within District
government plans for public works programs. Similar approaches will be used, at least in the
initial phases of the pilot VUP programs, to select households to receive assistance and,
separately, to select community assets to be created through the VUP public works
component.

4. Development partners played a significant role in the redevelopment of Ubudehe by
providing technical support for development of related skills within local communities (e.g.,
DFID) and by offering operational funding (e.g., European Union) for each village
community to select, design, and oversee the contractual implementation of a substantial
locally selected investment project to address what each village perceived to be its most
challenging solvable problem. Resulting projects included modern market premises, road-
building, new primary health care or education facilities or their foundations, and even a
small, hydroelectric system powered by a local stream.

ANNEX 7: DECENTRALIZATION REFORMS IN RWANDA

1.     GoR's economic reforms have focused on improving public financial
management, deepening the financial sector and removing constraints in key economic
sectors such as agriculture, power, transport and water. Attention has also been given to
improving the legal and regulatory environment for business as well as to strengthening the
public service and building its capacity. Several measures have been taken, including
introduction and increased application of the MTEF.

2.      GoR adopted a National Decentralization policy in May 2000 to achieve three
main goals: (i) good governance, (ii) pro-poor service delivery, and (iii) sustainable
development. More generally, the reforms sought to boost community participation,
accountability and transparency, sensitivity and responsiveness of public administration,
sustainable capacities at local levels, and effective, efficient planning, monitoring and service
delivery. This resulted in the restructuring of local governments into 5 provinces, 30
Districts, 416 Sectors and 2,148 cells, covering an estimated total of 15,000 villages across
the country. The provinces serve as the coordinating arm of the central GoR while the
Districts have their own selected councils and mayors and prepare their own budgets,
implying that Districts have their own taxing powers and are responsible for service delivery,
economic development coordination, and planning. Sectors and cells, through elected
representation, serve as constituencies within Districts and hence provide an important vehicle
for the citizens' voices. Although Sectors are assigned more fiscal and service delivery
responsibilities, including administration of basic services, management of community
development, and collection of statistical data and tax revenue collection (of which 50 percent
is handed over to the Districts), the cells' main responsibility remains community
mobilization50. To support decentralization reforms, GoR is strengthening monitoring and
appropriate oversight of transfers to the Districts to ensure accountability and performance
and to align these transfers with monetary and fiscal policies.

3.      Implementation has occurred in three phases. Phase one (2000-03) established
democratic and community development structures and enhanced their capacities
through legal, institutional, and policy reforms. These covered roles and responsibilities,
financing of services, and mechanisms to ensure accountability. Phase two (2004-08)
consolidated and expanded decentralization by emphasizing local service delivery through
well-integrated, accountable networks that empower communities to participate more fully in
planning and managing local affairs. Phase three (post-2008) will continue to improve,
support and sustain the efforts of phases one and two.

4.      A key component of Rwandan decentralization is the introduction of IMIHIGO, a
performance management tool for reform introduced in 2006. Borrowed from Rwanda's
traditional culture and values, the term now designates a written one-year performance
management contract between the President and each District mayor on behalf of local
constituents and extending to all levels of local government from State, to Provinces, to
Districts, to Sectors, and culminating in a series of pledges made by households to their
communities or villages (imidugudu). The contract is recorded publicly and presents a set of
development targets backed by specific, measurable performance indicators, creating visible
accountability mechanisms and incentives for local officials and communities to ensure
implementation of decentralization policies so as to meet regional and national development
targets such as those set out in the EDPRS and VUP. IMIHIGO contracts are now an integral
part of GoR's governance and decentralization reforms and are important in the context of the
VUP program as it provides a basis for mainstreaming the development of behavioral changes
needed to make the VUP program a success, including commitment to a savings culture and
commitment to undergo needed training.

5.     Empowerment of local government and citizens' rights down to village level is a
key objective of both decentralization and VUP implementation. The Government has
progressively devolved responsibilities and transferred resources to decentralized levels of the
administration--Province, District, Sector (Umurenge), Cell (Akagari), and Village
(Umudugudu). Of these, the last three are subordinate tiers of the District governments.
Rwanda uses the term "local government" to encompass the District through village levels.

6.      The second phase of decentralization has highlighted the urgent need to put in
place reporting mechanisms and elaborate a framework for oversight. To this end, GoR
developed the Rwanda Decentralization Strategic Framework (RSDF) in 2007 that provides a
framework for the coordination of technical and financial resources in support of
decentralization. This builds on key national strategies, the MDGs, EDPRS, VUP, and the Aid
Development Strategy. Its Decentralization Implementation Program (DIP) serves as a road
map toward phasing out the provincial level of Government.

7.      The current system of intergovernmental transfers is based largely on a
recurrent block grant to finance administrative costs (including salaries), and a
development grant through the Common Development Fund (CDF) to fund capital
projects. In addition to these flows, a significant level of international funding contributes to
local development priorities on either an on- or off-budget basis. The Fiscal and Financial
Decentralization Policy, adopted by GoR in 2006, sets the objectives and guiding principles
for the future reform work. This transferred to Districts 30 percent of budget resources and
associated implementation and reporting responsibilities.

                                               72
8.      When the MTEF was introduced in the central administration, GoR decided to
extend the approach simultaneously to local governments. Progress has been in the
development of local government budgets and the incorporation into the MTEF process.
Ministry of Finance is drafting new planning and budgeting guidelines that will cover the
various phases in the local planning and budgeting process to streamline and strengthen
District financial management. Local governments are required to submit monthly reporting
of financial transactions that meet transaction requirements to ensure receipt of
intergovernmental transfers, which remain the main source of revenues for Districts.

9.       Decentralization has devolved decision-making and budget implementation to
District-level authorities, and responsibility for service delivery to the Sectors. As weak
administrative capacity has been a major challenge to decentralization and implementation of
GoR's reform agenda, efforts in the area of capacity building and civil service reform have
been, and remain, critical. Donors are providing support for capacity building, including the
Decentralization and Community Development Project (DCDP) and the PRSC/G companion
Public Sector Capacity Building Project which supports Rwanda's Human Resources and
Institutional Capacity Development Agency (HIDA). HIDA is GoR's institution to
coordinate all capacity building interventions, though its role is one of facilitator and not
implementer.

10.     The implementation of the VUP and of the delivery of basic health services
through results-based financing will play a key role in operationalizing the roles,
functions, and services at Sector levels. These administrative structures require additional
support in capacity building and technical assistance beyond that already provided by the
Districts. The VUP implementation will be coordinated by Sector administrations with
participation at the Umudugudu level with technical support and supervision from the
Districts; results-based financing of community health, nutrition and population services will
rely on administrative capacity in health centers at the Sector level, which has been
strengthened by the reforms and improved financing of recent years. The community-based
participatory processes, Ubudehe, will play an important role within the VUP program, while
also strengthening governance and accountability at Sector level.


11.    Key initiatives that complement the decentralization reform include the public
service reform strategy (2004), the territorial reform (2006), and ongoing civil service
reform program. The last of these reforms incorporated the autonomization of service
providers, the block-granting of schools and health facilities, the introduction of performance-
based incentives, the delinking of all health workers from the civil service and the possibility
given to service providers to hire and fire.

ANNEX 8: SOCIAL PROTECTION ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

1.      The poverty assessment has provided important insights on poverty and
vulnerability, geographic poverty, households' characteristics that contribute to
deepening poverty gap, and potential escape routes out of poverty. This operation makes
full use of these findings, and builds on an understanding of past failures and future promising
approaches to poverty reduction in Rwanda. Of particular relevance are the findings
pertaining to the absolute level of the poverty gap by decile group (Table 8.1) confirming the
vast distance the poorest groups have to traverse, evidently caused by a combination of a lack
of assets and of gainful employment. This operation helps address these very facets of
poverty.

ANNEX 9: VUP IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS FOR RWANDA's NEW SP
POLICIES

1.     The social protection (SP) policy changes that the CLSG series supports incorporate
good international practice within the Public Works (PW) and Direct Support (DS) elements
of Rwanda's new Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP). VUP is one of three flagship
programs under Rwanda's new five-year EDPRS.


2.      Identifying Those Eligible. While other aspects of EDPRS assist poor agricultural
households that own land, the PW and DS elements of VUP are directed at households that
are both landless and extremely poor. In addition, for PW eligibility, all adults in the
household who are capable of working must lack employment opportunities. "Landless" is
defined as owning less than 0.25 hectares. "Extremely poor" households are those identified
as falling within the two poorest of six household categories that are ranked ordinally by
living standards through Rwanda's community-based decision-making process known as
Ubudehe. (See Ubudehe overview in Annex 6). Potential VUP recipients will be identified
through the poverty-map process, which covers all extremely poor households in the village.
The VUP targeting at village level is a two step process (carried out in one day at village
level):

   ·   Step 1: The information is taken from the existing Ubudehe social/poverty map on the
       morning of the targeting day and filled in the targeting format.
   ·   Step 2: A community meeting in the afternoon to which the Umudugudu (village)
       population is invited. At the meeting, the social map information is validated ­ each
       household's Ubudehe category is updated, and information required to apply the VUP
       eligibility criteria is collected and added to the targeting format (household land and
       labor availability).

The completed targeting formats are then sent up to Sector level. The DS and PW eligible
households are then extracted from the village targeting lists and discussed and validated at
the Sector Joint Action Development Forum (a forum including different partners, including
civil society). The lists of mutually exclusive households eligible for direct support and
public works are then sent back down to cells and villages for validation. These lists serve as
the gate-keeping mechanism to identify and rank eligible households in each community.
Each community specifies the criteria that distinguish the characteristics of the Ubudehe
household categories based on living standards that are identified in the community mapping
process. These are similar, but not identical, across the country. Some local observers
consider that lower-income communities tend to set more stringent standards than higher-
income communities when defining poverty levels.

3.       Assistance Offered ­ Public Works. For eligible households, the PW element of VUP
will offer paid, intensive work under the pilot program to one member of the household for an
initial (potentially renewable) period of six months. Where possible, to facilitate female
participation, work-sites will be kept within an hour's walk of the community's center.
Employment will be subject to project and funding availability and may be concentrated
during slack agricultural seasons when private employment is less available. If the number of
positions available is less than the number of eligible household members, priority will be

                                              75
given to employing workers from the poorest categories of households. The PW element will
be managed by staff from the Sector and cell tiers of local government. Payment mechanisms
available for public works include direct deposit to workers' bank accounts every two weeks,
where feasible without any third-party involvement. Plans are in place for the provision of
banking services at least on a part-time basis at locations convenient to most villages.
Financial controls covering transparent payment mechanisms and accounting have been
formulated. The majority of projects will be selected by the local communities through
Ubudehe processes and incorporated within their Sector or District plans. Technical support
will be arranged by program managers under established arrangements with local
governments and national ministries. Environmental and technical matters will be handled in
conformity with national policies and procedures. These have been incorporated within the
VUP public works and financial management program manuals.


4.     Assistance Offered ­ Direct Support. The level of each eligible household's direct
support payment will be based on the number of adults and children in the family, using a
national scale, and will reflect economies of scale in larger families. Support available from
other sources will be offset against this amount. Eligibility lists will be updated every six
months. Monthly direct support will build on the payment process for public works
Payments will be made by direct bank transfer. A list of clients and amounts received will be
disclosed publicly at village, cell and Umurenge levels. Direct support recipients will have
the option of saving a small part of their monthly allowance. Policy incentives for such
personal saving are being considered.

ANNEX 10: INTERNATIONAL GOOD PRACTICE IN PUBLIC WORKS
PROGRAMS

Public Works Programs: Some Good Practice Design Features Drawn from
International Experience52

1.      A number of countries placed in diverse socio-economic circumstances ­ countries
emerging from long periods of conflict, or serious macro economic collapse, or serious
natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods ­ have introduced public works programs.
There is much international experience that enables one to delineate some good practices in
the management of such programs. In particular, five design features are critical for the
success of any public works program. These are: the level of the wage rate, labor intensity,
seasonality of operation, project selection procedures, and monitoring and evaluation. Box
10.1 provides a summary of these five and other good-practice design features based on the
experience of various countries that launched such a program.

                Box 10.1. What are the Key Design Features of a Good Public Works Program?
 To realize the full potential of a public works program as a poverty-reducing and risk-coping instrument, it is
 recommended that:
 ·         The wage rate should be set at a level which is no higher than the prevailing market wage for
 unskilled manual labor in the setting in which the scheme is introduced.
 ·         Restrictions on eligibility should be avoided; the fact that one wants work at this wage rate should
 ideally be the only requirement for eligibility.
 ·         If rationing is required (because demand for work exceeds the budget available at the wage set) then
 the program should be targeted to poor areas, as indicated by a credible "poverty map". However, flexibility
 should be allowed in future budget allocations across areas, to reflect differences in demand for the scheme. If
 further rationing is required within a community, it is best to identify some critical, easily observable,
 household characteristics that best predict an individual or household's vulnerability, and select such
 individuals for participation.
 ·         The labor intensity (share of wage bill in total cost) should be as high as possible, but not too high at
 100 percent. No public works activity of some quality can be done with labor alone. The level of labor
 intensity will depend on the relative importance attached to immediate income gains versus (income and other)
 gains to the poor from the assets created. This will vary from setting to setting.
 ·         The projects should be targeted to poor areas, and try to assure that the assets created are of
 maximum value to poor people in those areas. Any exceptions -- in which the assets largely benefit the non-
 poor -- should require co-financing from the beneficiaries, and this money should go back into the budget of
 the scheme. Communities must be consulted in project selection.
 ·         Public works should be synchronized to the timing of agricultural slack seasons.
 ·         In order to encourage female participation, the appropriate form of wages is important -- for
 example, women can benefit from piece rates or task-based wages; sometimes wage in the form of food has
 attracted more women to work sites. Also, provision of childcare or preschool services can improve
 participation by women.
 ·         Transaction costs to the poor are kept low -- one important means to accomplish this is through
 locating project sites close to villages. It is also necessary to ensure appropriate mediation of NGOs for
 protecting the rights of the poor vis-à-vis program managers.
 ·         The program should include an asset maintenance component.

2.     Wage rate. To promote self-selection of participants into the program, it is best to fix
the wage rate at a level equal to, or lower than, the prevailing market wage for unskilled labor.

International experience suggests that in countries where public works programs enabled pro-
poor targeting (such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, India before 1988, and Republic of Korea), the
public works program wage was maintained at a level lower than the prevailing market wage
for unskilled labor (Table 10.1).

3.      Labor intensity. Depending upon the nature of the asset created and various other
factors, there is much variation in the proportion of non-labor inputs needed to run a public
works program. In general, a non-labor share of 40 percent appears to be the norm reached in
most low income countries (Table 10.2).

4.      Seasonality of operation. Ideally public works programs should operate at times of the
year when the opportunity cost of labor is low. Experience with public works programs
around the world suggests that indeed in most countries the program is operating intensively
in agricultural slack seasons. However, in most countries the program is available throughout
the year so it acts as a proxy program of "unemployment insurance" in countries where formal
unemployment insurance systems have not developed. In other words, whenever an individual
is unemployed for a short period of time, the program is available for him/her to seek work at
the going market wage for unskilled labor. The maximum number of days a single individual
could be employed is either left open-ended, or restricted (to, say 50 days or 75 days).

                                                78
5.      Targeting effectiveness. In general, in comparison with other safety net programs,
public works programs around the world seem to reach ultra poor households better than other
programs, provided the above mentioned design features are incorporated. Of these design
features, the most critical one is of course the level of the wage rate. A relatively low wage
rate seems to ensure that the poorest benefit from the program more than the rest, though it is
possible that near-poor households can also be expected to participate in the program. Box
10.2 provides a summary of available international experience with respect to targeting
effectiveness of public works programs.

          Box 10.2: Targeting Effectiveness of Public Works Programs: International Experience
While there is a need to keep in mind the ultimate objectives of static and dynamic poverty reduction, targeting
effectiveness clearly remains an important factor in assessing cost effectiveness of public works programs. In
general, targeting performance has been good relative to other targeted public interventions.

·   In Chile, almost 100 percent of participating households were poor.
· In Argentina's Trabajar program, around 80 percent of households were from the poorest quintile, and 60
percent from the poorest decile. In addition to the low program wage rate, this outcome was achieved by
including the local level poverty rate in the scoring formula for determining program allocations.
· Various researchers have found positive targeting outcomes on the India's Maharashtra Employment
Guarantee Scheme (MEGS), at least prior to the 1988 increase in minimum (and hence program) wages. A
dedicated survey of MEGS participants from 1978-79 found 90 percent of workers living below poverty line,
even including EGS earnings in the calculation, at a time when the poverty headcount similarly calculated was
49 percent. A later survey in 1985-86 found mean incomes of participating MEGS households to be around 20
percent below the poverty line. The positive targeting outcomes are confirmed by other analysis for 1979-85.
There is also evidence that the scheme's targeting performance deteriorated when the wage rate rose
substantially in 1988.
· In Bangladesh, targeting of the Food-for-Work Program was also found to be good, with program
participants coming from poorer households than the rural population as a whole, and the total number of person
days of work created even more pro-poor. While around 25 percent of all rural households had incomes below
1500 taka in 1981-82, around 60 percent of FFWP participants had incomes below this level. Equally, around 70
percent of program employment went to the 25 percent of rural households with income below this level.
· Under the Bolivia Social Investment Fund, 77 percent of participants came from the poorest 40 percent of
the population. Assessments of other SIFs in Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru have also found pro-poor incidence
of SIF benefits.
· In Philippines, most public works participants were from marginally poor and non-poor households rather
than the very poor. This outcome was largely driven by program compensation which provided for official MW
in cash plus in-kind benefits which took the total compensation package above the market wage.
· In Indonesia, assessment of safety net programs introduced after the Asian crisis found that public works
schemes which relied on self-targeting were much more likely to reach households which had suffered large
shocks than programs which relied on administrative targeting methods, including subsidized rice, scholarships
and health subsidies.
· Analysis from all-India NSS data on public works schemes for 1993-94 indicates pro-poor targeting
performance, but that inclusion errors remained significant. Targeting performance was also better in comparison
to both PDS (then untargeted) and micro finance program (IRDP).

6.     The reviewed experience suggests that it is important to bear in mind the good practice
design features prior to introduction of a public works program. Failure to pay attention to the
design features may render public work-fare programs both inefficient and expensive.

                                                      79
7.      Project selection procedures. There is much cross-country variation in the actual
selection of projects. Some good practices are worth noting. In Korea, for example, a
combination of community selection, and the line Ministry selection, was followed. 50
percent of projects were selected by communities, and 50 percent by line Ministries. The
Government was keen to ensure a igh labor intensity. To accomplish this goal, the
Government estimated labor coefficients for various types of activities such as soil
conservation, afforestation, garbage disposal, etc. and gave a list of potential candidates
(projects) to communities. Communities selected projects from this list of labor-intensive
activities that are most needed by communities. International experience suggests that local
governments (and communities) are capable of selecting and implementing small projects
(with a penchant for maintaining quality), but lack capacity to implement larger and more
complicated projects. (Subbarao 2003). Even when projects are selected by communities, it
is useful to ensure that these projects are well integrated with the overall rural development
plans of local communities. While community selection of projects is generally the good
practice, care needs to be taken that project benefits are not captured by local elites.


8.      Monitoring and evaluation. By far the most critical missing link in the experience of
public works programs is the presence of a credible monitoring and evaluation framework.
Though over 40 countries, both developed and developing, have implemented public works
projects at various stages in their development, only three or four countries have documented
their performance with rigorous monitoring and impact evaluations. Two countries with
extensive evaluation experience of public works programs are India and Argentina. Several
ongoing programs in countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya now have incorporated an
extensive monitoring and evaluation framework.


9.      Important indicators for monitoring of public works programs include, on the inputs
side, budget expenditures and/or available food (to be used as wage), program staff
composition and number etc. and, on the outcome side, number of projects by type and labor
intensity, wages paid and periodicity and regularity of payments and/or amount of food
distributed as wages, number of workers participating in programs and their key
characteristics (by gender, age, previous economic activity) and beneficiaries of any potential
training or other incentives offered to escape from poverty. Impact evaluation would require
a good baseline on a random sample of households gathering information on all household
characteristics of both participating and nonparticipating households.

ANNEX 11: INTERNATIONAL GOOD PRACTICE IN DIRECT SUPPORTS
PROGRAMS


Some Good Practice Design Features for Social Assistance (Direct Support) Drawn from
International experience53

1.      This note provides a brief summary of good practices in the design of social assistance
(direct support) programs, drawn from a few select countries. The note addresses four design
features: (a) selection of households for direct support; (b) determination of the level of
benefits; (c) the mode of payments and selection of the delivery mechanism; and (d)
monitoring and feedback and mid-course correction.

A. Selection of households for direct support.

2.      It is common knowledge that the more generous the definition of eligibility, the larger
will be the pool of applicants for social assistance and the cost of the program. The cost of
the program also depends on the level and duration of benefits (discussed in the section
below). For example, for the old age social assistance pension program, Nepal defined the
cut-off age limit for eligibility as 75. This undoubtedly restricted the pool of beneficiaries and
kept the program within the limits set by the available budget, but the program could not
reach some of the critical vulnerable groups even slightly below the age 75. On the other
hand, some countries set the limit for eligibility low at 60 (or even lower), leading to the
opposite effect of too many beneficiaries and a very large budget. To overcome difficulties of
this kind, many countries now resort to limiting the cash transfer social assistance to, say, the
poorest 10 percent of the population. One such example is the Kalomo District Pilot Social
Cash Transfer Program in Zambia, which limited the outreach to the bottom 10 percent of the
population.

3.      Determining the eligibility and selection of eligible beneficiaries has varied a great
deal from one country to another, depending upon (a) administrative feasibility, and (b) the
available information. Where both these sets of conditions are weak, countries (such as
Rwanda) have resorted to community targeting approaches. However, good practice dictates
validation of such selections via a transparent communication system. For example, in
Mexico's Oportunidades program (a conditional cash transfer program), beneficiary lists are
presented at community meetings which has given communities a chance to pick both
exclusion and inclusion errors. In all cases, a complaints mechanism is critical for ensuring
community satisfaction with the targeting approach.

4.      Where the information constraint is less severe, countries have adopted a proxy means
test (PMT). This is a targeting method by which a score for each applicant is generated based
on household characteristics that are fairly easy-to-observe ­ usually non-income
characteristics) such as the location and quality of housing unit, ownership of durable assets,
number of children, level of education, etc. A threshold score level is set below which a

Protection and Promotion. World Bank, 2008.
                                                     81
household becomes eligible for the benefit. When a community targeting approach such as
the one described in paragraph 3 above is adopted, it is still possible to move gradually to a
PMT method, short-list households for the benefit, and then use community meetings to
ensure transparency and avoid exclusion and inclusion errors. Many low income countries are
resorting to this combination of a PMT and community validation as a means to select
beneficiaries for safety net programs generally. A recent example is Bangladesh, which is
now sponsoring a safety net program using a combination of PMT and community validation.

B. Determining Benefit Levels

5.      Determining the size of social assistance direct support is a tricky issue in all
countries. It is hard to provide clear-cut policy advice based on international experience, but
some guiding principles can be offered. Typically, in last resort programs such as the one
proposed for Rwanda, which aims to reduce extreme poverty, the benefit levels are set as a
fraction of the income gap of target beneficiaries. How high or low that fraction should be
depends on the available budget and the number of people in extreme poverty. Using a proxy
means test, Armenia and Georgia have used this principle.

6.      In this regard, some number crunching might be helpful with the available household
level information. For example, information on the number of extremely poor households can
be combined with information on their income (poverty) gap and, from both these sets of
information, one can derive the financial requirements for a given level of benefit. One can
then see the feasibility (affordability) of alternative benefit levels and decide on the level that
can be defended within the available budget envelope.

7.      Benefit levels need not be fixed at a flat level for all types of households. Instead, the
levels can be varied. Variable benefit formulas are often the norm in many countries, mainly
because such formulas allow for variation in household circumstances (such as number of
children, presence of a disabled child or person, long term sickness of a household head, etc).
A very good (successful) example of such a variable benefit formula is that of Brazil's Bolsa
Familia Program. This program provides two types of benefits: a base benefit to all families
in extreme poverty, and a variable benefit that depends on family composition and income.

8.      Whatever method is adopted to determine the benefit level, it is useful to assess the
level of benefit as a percentage of the consumption expenditure of extremely poor households.
How generous the program is can be assessed from this proportion. The higher the benefit
level as a percentage of the household's consumption expenditure, the more generous the
program. Maintaining a generous benefit level is likely to impact on labor supply through
adverse disincentive effects: i.e., households, even when provided with opportunities to work
in the labor market, may opt to stay in the "generous" program. While this concern for the
impact of benefit levels on work disincentives is theoretically valid, it does not apply to
programs that target extremely poor households with no adult labor to participate in the labor
market, or the disabled, or the elderly.

C. Delivery Mechanisms and Payment modalities

9.      Four principles generally guide the delivery mechanism: (a) ensuring reliability and
regularity of payments; (b) maintaining accountability (governance issues) and prevention of
                                                82
fraud; (c) reducing transaction costs to the beneficiaries; and (d) minimizing the
administrative cost of delivery. While a number of delivery agencies or routes are available ­
bank branches, mobile banks, post offices, decentralized government agencies, NGOs ­ the
selection of the delivery mode eventually must satisfy the above four principles, and be
available and suitable for a given country situation. Not surprisingly, countries have varied a
great deal in this regard. If contractors or a specific agency is selected, performance-based
incentive contracts can be developed as was done in the Brazil's Bolsa Familia program.
Kenya has tried a pilot program for a cash transfer to orphans and vulnerable children through
a bidding process to select a lowest-cost service agency. The advantage of these contract-
based service agencies is that the contracts can be revised based on performance. In countries
with somewhat developed IT infrastructure, debit cards and smart cards are being used to
transfer cash assistance. In the state of Gujarat in India, a pilot program is being tried to use
smart cards to transfer in-kind social assistance. It is hard to recommend one specific option
or delivery mechanism: the main challenge is to adapt any one reliable mechanism to country
circumstances, and avoid any unintended adverse effects.

D. Monitoring and Evaluation of Cash Transfer programs

10.    Program monitoring is extremely important for any safety net program and especially
for cash transfer programs. Systematic monitoring helps one to assess how well the program
is being implemented at all levels, and helps mid-course correction in the event of poor
implementation. Evaluation complements the monitoring system, inasmuch as it allows an
assessment of the distributive effects of cash transfer programs. Despite the critical
importance of monitoring and evaluation, unfortunately most safety net programs lack a
credible M&E system in place.

11.     Monitoring is a continuous activity, and is typically done at all levels ­ village, district
and at the national levels. Its main role is to assess whether or not the program is being
implemented in accordance with its design with outcomes as expected. Its annual cost must
be factored into the program costs and it must become an integral part of the programmatic
framework. A good monitoring system must collect information on the program's key
outcomes. A good practice procedure is that monitoring should be done by an independent
agency, outside of the agency or institution implementing the program. A well-documented
international experience of good monitoring is from Zambia. The Kalmo District Pilot Social
Cash Transfer program (which operated with technical assistance from Germany)
implemented third-party monitoring that focused on the quality of program management, the
effectiveness of targeting, regularity of transfer payments, and even beneficiaries' use of the
transfers.

12.     It is not enough to know the program's outcomes; it is important also to know the
impact of the program on household welfare, which is the ultimate goal of a cash transfer
program. Several techniques are available to do an impact evaluation. Two approaches can
be distinguished. One is a quantitative approach that collects information on a random sample
of households belonging to both the treatment group and the control group, both at the launch
of the program and after a given period of time (say, one year). Econometric techniques are




                                                83
then used to assess the impact of the program.54 A complementary approach is qualitative
evaluation, which is based on focus group interviews, key informant interviews, and direct
observation. Though qualitative evaluations are not representative, they do offer rich
information on the program's functioning, its merits, and shortcomings.

13.     A variant of descriptive evaluation is "process evaluation", which is probably the most
common evaluation technique followed in many countries. Its approach is to assess and
document how each of the processes underlying a cash transfer program is being
implemented. It helps address the question: what is happening through the program. Process
evaluation strongly complements, but does not substitute for, an internal monitoring system
and other evaluations mentioned above. For example, the Zambia example is worth
repeating: it included a process evaluation by external evaluators in addition to other
evaluations which helped improve the monitoring capacity as it revealed specific flaws in
specific processes underlying the program's implementation.

14.     The short review above is not meant to be a substitute for the vast literature that exists
on cross-country experience of cash transfer programs. Readers requiring further information
are advised to refer to the World Bank's most recent publication, viz., M. Grosh et. al. "For
Protection and Promotion: The Design and Implementation of Safety Net Programs" (World
Bank, 2008).

ANNEX 12: SUMMARY OF VUP PUBLIC AWARENESS PROGRAM

Summary of Ministry of Local Government's Efforts to Ensure Transparency of the
VUP Policy and Procedures, Eligibility Determination Process and Criteria for
Ensuring Transparency of the Selection Outcomes of Eligible and Non-Eligible

1.     The Ministry of Local Government is continuing to pursue international best practice
of both its Public Works and Direct Supports program under the VUP to ensure total
transparency of all program policy and procedures.

2.      The main outlet for ensuring that the VUP eligibility determination process is both
clear and transparent to all potential beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries by making program
policy and procedures widely known and to ensure that selection outcomes are publicly
available is the use of traditional community meetings.

3.       The targeting process uses the home-grown and traditional Ubudehe process (see
Annex 6). This helps ensure community input into beneficiary selection as well as
transparency. The process is conducted at Umudugudu (village) level. It is a two-step
operation which involves taking information from the existing Ubudehe social map followed
by a community meeting to which the Umudugudu population is invited. At the meeting the
social map information is validated, each household's Ubudehe category is updated, and
information required to apply the VUP eligibility criteria is added (the process is detailed in
the "VUP Targeting List Training Manual, May 2006"). At the community meetings the
facilitators present the meeting objectives, the VUP program, and explain each step in the
process as they go along.

4.       The targeting data is used to determine eligibility lists. Once Direct Support lists are
approved by the Sector Joint Action Development Forum (JADF) they are posted publically at
Sector offices. A meeting is then held with eligible households to explain the policy,
procedures and next steps (why they are eligible, what they will be paid, when, the need to
opening bank accounts etc.). For Public Works, once recipients are selected from the
eligibility list to work on a specific project, before work starts, a meeting is held with them to
explain the policy, procedures and next steps (how they were selected, how work will be
organized (the need to make groups and nominate a supervisor), how long they will work,
wage rate etc.).

5.     In future, there is a plan for eligibility lists to be publically posted at Cell level and to
be read by Imidugudu Coordinators at community work days (Umuganda).

6.      Local government officials are also responsible for sharing and explaining the VUP
program broadly with all the communities under their mandate. This includes non-recipient
households in VUP operational sectors. Furthermore, the VUP team, as part of its monitoring
activities, takes the opportunity to ask questions and share information with direct support and
public works recipients and when visiting work-sites during field visits.

7.    The Ministry of Local Government is also pursuing other ways of sharing the VUP
program's objectives, policy and procedures and the need for transparency in sharing

                                                85
selection outcomes. The list below provides some examples currently being pursued by the
Ministry for this purpose:

·   Live radio and television interactive shows where representatives of local government,
    central government and beneficiaries explain the VUP program and answer questions.
    Live, interactive events took place on national television and on radio in April 2009 and
    on radio in June 2009. Radio and television programs offer toll-free numbers for listeners
    to call in.

·   Workshops with mayors, vice-mayors, and District and Sector executive secretaries are
    being organized to present the VUP program and provide guidance on how to
    communicate the VUP program effectively and accurately to community members.

·    "Change agents" are being trained through an organization called Itorero to go out in
    communities and provide information of the VUP program. These `change agents' are
    covering the entire country, not only the VUP sectors.

·   Leaflets have been prepared in Kinyarwanda, the local language, and 16,000 copies are
    being printed and will be distributed to every village (approximately 15,000 across the
    country).

·   VUP program information posted on the MINALOC website.

·   Articles are published in national newspapers on the VUP program and progress. An
    electronic newsletter was distributed in November 2009 and it is planned to be produced
    every 2 months.

·   A documentary film is in the process of being made to further share the message of the
    VUP program, and will be shown on the national TV channel (Rwanda Television).
    Districts are encouraged to prepare a proposal and receive financing from the Ministry to
    help promote the VUP program on local radio and television. As of October 2009, the
    Districts of Gasabo and Huye (Maraba Sector) have submitted proposals for this purpose.
8.     Additional plans for the coming year to further share the program's policy and
procedures and enhance transparency are:

·   Development of a communication strategy. Terms of Reference have already been drafted
    to hire a consultant to assist with this.

·   User-friendly poster on targeting and eligibility to the different program sub-components
    to be posted at community level.

·   A more technical booklet that further explains the VUP program and selection process, in
    the local level, to be disseminated to District and Sector levels

·   Sensitisation and training activities to include opinion leaders within sectors (such as
    teachers, change agents, health post managers, Cell coordinators, Cell executive
    coordinators, local bank/MFI staff, members of sector CDCs, local cooperative
    representatives ) for even broader dissemination of messages


                                             86
·   Live interactive radio shows on regional community radio (Rubavu, Ngoma, Huye and
    Rusizi)
9.      In addition to promoting transparency of the VUP policy, procedures and eligibility
determination process and criteria for ensuring transparency of the selection outcomes of
eligible and non-eligible beneficiaries, the Ministry of Local Government is using the above
media outlets to ensure that the policy of encouraging voluntary savings is well understood
and being implemented across sectors.

10.     Also, as part of the promotion of the VUP program, the Ministry is working to ensure
that the policy under VUP of ensuring community input into the selection of VUP projects
under its Public Works program is maintained. The main process for this is through
community participation in the development of Sector Development Plans, and this is being
monitored by local governments. VUP will continue to raise awareness on the importance of
community participation in sector plans (and improvements to existing plans, and
development of new plans) through forum like the JADFs.

2.4 Beyond tile income poverty rabonal, the rno<e global ooootation 01 tile EDPRS
and its flagship VU P progr:lmme are clearly supported by a human poverty concern
ecOODm>C gro'NIIl and income must materia lize into meeting basic human needs in
different domains: health, education, wate<i5anitation, nutrition and food security ,
housing cond itions, social integr:ltion (participation), etc.? This concern Os taken into
account in two mon itoring tools: again the Community Based Human Poverty
Household Ques~onmJire, section 1 (demography), sections 2 and 4 (education),
section 3 (health), sectioo 5, (labou r force), section 6 (income) section 7 (rnltrition),
section 8 (main expend~ures & investments), sections 9, to and tl (agricultural
production), section t2 (habitat and accommodation ), section 13 (durables and
productive assets ), section 14 (access 10 infr:lstructure and markets), section 15
(participation); second , the Cell DevekJpment Infra structure Ouestionnaire . Ind icators
gene.-ated by these tools are ' sted in Part II, section 4, Indicators Methodologies.
Their precise location and role in the M&E architecture are given in section 2 .t,
Dynamic Archilecture. The Ce" Development In frastruc ture Ques60nnaire is tound in
Anne.. E. Among its specific teatu res, it can already be observed that ~ incllKle s a
roste< of the lmidugudu incllKled in the Cell, analogous 10 the household members
roster usually tound in household level questionnaires. It allows to locate the different
infrastructures at the umudugudu level and to measure accessibi lity at this lev," also.

2.5 The different monilofing tools introduced aoove , all interlinked to measure
multid imensiona l poverty at different levels, are the key elements suWOrling the main
components of the M& E a rchitecture

2.1 Dyn3mic 3rchitecture: Mo nitoring Cycle

2.6 The word accelerate used in the fOflllulabon of the VU P purpose requires that
tile dimensions of lime. and movement be emphasized across the M&E design. The
dYmJrr.-c side of too VU P thus appears as a centra l architectural component To
mon~or thOs acceleration means mon iloring closely tile path of extreme poverty
reduction, in the context ot a two-level targebng .lTategy aiming precisely 10 K1en~fy
and to tackle this poverty wherever ~ exists more intensively: a first tarye~ng at the
sector level, expressed in a poverty ordering of too sectors with in each district,
determming the priority a ccess to VUP services. and tile annual budget allocation
bety,'oon VU P sectors; a second targeting at the OOusehold level, specific 10 each
component and relying on the UBUDEHE social mob4lizalion system

2.7 The structure of this dynamic mon~oring refers primarily 10 the scaling up
strategy. The assumption oore is that every year, starting in the financial year 2OIJ9.-
2010, in each ot the 30 districts, a new group of sectors joins the VU P program . Such
a group of seclors is na med here a Cohort. The thirty 2008-00 pilot sectors fOflll
Coho<t If f, the 2009- 10 new coming sectors Cohort /f2 , and so on. The size of these
cohorts is determined by the level of financial resources available. To each cohort Iii
of sectors eo<responds the sea li ng up date T', defined as the 1" day of the month
woore VU P operations and spending begins . Too dynamic structure of the M&E is
tIlen expressed tIlroug h the Monitoring Cycle summarized in Figu re t below . Some
boxes in Figure 1 are ma rked with 3 X: it means that they are specifically involYed
and critical in the impact e valuation scheme.

refening to five sectors cohorts defined by the annu3J scaling up strategy. Com ments
are needed to cl;IIify the rofes of the different statistica l operations associated to the
moo~oring toos . First, from bot!om to top, there are two parts separated by the time
axis. Too upper part, in es 1 to 5, refers to the household level mon ~oring toofs: the
Targeting imland the Community Based HUrmJ" Poverty Household Oue3tioonaire
The "'... er part, lines - 1 10 -5, refer to the cell and umud"9udu level monitoring toof

defined by a symtx> T in reference to months, too superscript idootitying the cohorl

2.9 The moniloring cycle is n<Ni described by refening to whal should be the oormaf
process for cohorl N2, the one comin9 in the f,rst scaling up operation foflowing the
30 p<lot sectors identified with cohorl Nl. It appears in Figure I, date T J_ = T'.,,, that

before scali r.g up with a new cohort of sectors, a one- yea, (13 months) preparation
period is needed. First, acCOfding to column A, li nes -1 to -5, a coosus of all ce lls in
the country, using the UBUDEHE system and the Ceil Development Infrastruduro
Questionnaire, allows to rank all sectors, within each district, according to the
popu lation size (/I hlds) and socioecooomic infrastructure ava ilabfe (see more in
§.j.13 et seq. Pari II). Then a scaling up prog ram can be defined according to the
targetir.g cri!erilm of the poorest sectors comir.g in first In addition, every year, th is
eel questionnaire can pro,,;oo an important input for the alocation of VUP budget
according to seclor poverty level . This ce l census is completed, in each sector of the
new cohorl cell "'2, with a Needs Asses:smenf Household Survey, using the
Community Based Human Poverty Household Que3fionnaire . This survey is done
on a sample of households representative of the whofe popolation in the secto<, 001

profile which, combined w~h the ce ll developmoot infrastructure coosus, should
inform the sector developmenf plan, a key component o f the decootralization p<'ocess
(see priflaple 111 ). Finaly, this Needs Asse3Smenl Survey constitutes one of the
pilars for sourod impact e valuation, by provid ing a cootrof group at the same time, T' _
" the previous cohorl is conducting a baseline survey just before VUP operations.

using the UBUDEHE p<'ocess arod the Targeting List toof (cell C2) . This operation
covers all households in each umlJduglJdu, and thus provides an update of the

2.16 PU!ROSe and expected effects         The pU'POOe of VUP, already referred to in
section 2.1, is:

       To accelerate the reduction of em-erne poverty

This e "l're ssion re ' es {)f1 the rational justifying VUP as expressed in two offIcial
policy docume nts: Economic Development and Poverty Reduction strategy, 2008-
2()12 {2007}, and Vision 202() Umurenge, EDPRS FlafF'hip Program Document
{August 2007}. Iv1 outcome is expected from this purpose:
       Ovtl;ome . 1: Extreme ly poor OOusehokl a re K1entified by VUP. taryeted and
       ra pidly taken oul of this poverty status.

Three ind icators are used to measure the degree of achievement of th is outcome
n",y are:

                     : Share of population living in e xtre me poverty in VUP sec10rs
                     : Poverty depth ifl VUP sectors.
                                     01 OOuseholds in too bottom tNO UBUD EHE


The flrsl tNO indicators are primarily defined relatively to ';"come poverty, in relerence
to iflcome poverty lines give n in §2.2 . The first ind icator is the standard extreme
pove rty incide nce indicator, !he percentage of population in households below the
extreme poverty line. The second ind icator measures , ifl terms of percentage, !he
average gap betNeen the pove rty line and the income of OOuseOOlds below !he
pove rty line . Through a compw~e indica/Of of human poverty, a nalogous ind icators
will be compute d for huma n pove rty.
The lIlird ind icator refers 10 the social assessment 01 the relative poverty status with in
lIle umudugudu . Since these tNO bottom categories are at the core of the targeting
process, the percentage is expected to decrease significantly

       Indicator . Gl Share of population hving in extreme ""verty

All three indicators are moneymelric ind icators_ All three require a methodology for
measuring houseOOld income_ Two of them, Gland G3, use the income ""verty li oos
given in §2_2_ The second one, G2, is the most we l~k oown iooqua.ty index oomputed
from the lorenz CU<Ve li nking income shares to the pop<llation distribution across
income leve l. This iooqua . ty index thus requ ires that households samples be
representative of the whole population, not only of VU P targeted categories for OS
and PW_ The measurement of these ind icators, at the national level, is not the VUP
responsibility, OOtthe NISR responsibi lity_ Neverthe less , our PI indicalof above is in
lact the same than G3, in VUP sectors on~ . Th"", a dialog"" is oocessary on income

AccOfd i ng~, programme outputs are first grouped accOfd ing to this five component
structure_ But all outputs are not oocessarily specific to one of these five components
Some oot;>uts, Cfoss-cu1ting all components, are resuks expected from the s)'ll"'llY
bet",een activities run in al components_ It should be remembered that VU P,
articu lated w ithin the de centralization process, intends precisely to coord inate all
developmen t ope.-ations happening in a given sector so that the overall efficiency is
en hanced_

226 To define graduation, tHO approaches a re proposed, relative in fact 10 the two
concepts of extreme pove rty (§ 1.6, principle 117, a oo §2 16, purpose iooicatorn).

227 From the Ubudehe re lative poverty con<:ept, a s <>perationalize d in the VUP
largeting process, a beneficiary hoosehold can be cooside<ed of "having graduated
ffOm OS" d, afler some time. ~ is no more eligible to OS. In a similar way, a
beooficiary OOusehoid can be considered of "having graduated from PW" rt, afte r
some time, it is no more eligible to PW and is 001 elig ible to OS. Thi,; approach is ve ry
";mple 10 im plement since ~ re lies on the very clealty de fined elig i b~ity criteria 1m

lIlus the regular remion pmcess would give an immed iate measurement of
graduation . But ~ must be ob-noos lIlat this approach w~1 genera lly mean that !he
umoougoou population COflfinns that the household has moved from catego<y 1 Of 2
at least 10 category 3 (u mukene ).

2.28 A second approach has been recentty proposed , in line with the ab""uie
poverty concept, income based and objective. Thts proposibon ts reproduced here in
Annex G. Since monetary income and cash transfer is rea l ~ the core of the VU P as
a Social Protectioo program, it is suggested, in view of developing an objective
criterium fo.- graduation, to focus on income poverty and Of! potential cash Of in kind
Income. Thus, ~ is P"'l"'sed to define graduation as f<>~:

              A household receiving 01) a monthly basis an amoulll of X
              FRW, frOlI) PWor DS, is considered as having graduated if it
              effectively generates, in a sustainable way, an equivalent
              monthly net income of X FRW, additiOlwl to its income level
              previous to its participaliOll to PW or to DS
Ob-noosiy, this approach requ ires 10 mon~Of closely the new income generating
activities and the net income that they generate. Thts type of mon~oring ts precisely
lIle core of the M&E as presented above in the d)'flamK: arcMecture.

2.29 Whatever be the definition of "g raduation", five ind icalors are proposed to
captu re the level of graduation achieved IIlrough the programme.

log Frame numerical baseline values and targets_ These va lues, regularly revised

log Frame Table concentrates on Objectives, Indicators, Means of Verification . These
Means of Verifi<:ation are themselves the ma in subject of Part If of this ma nual,

log Frame includes 1 goal, 1 purJ>OSe, 9 outputs and 38 indicators . The development
of the financial Services and Training components will generate new outputs and

ANNEX 14: UMURENGE SACCO STRATEGY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Executive Summary

1.      Credit Unions and SACCOs are nothing new to Rwanda where diverse small SACCOs
and "Banque Populaire du Rwanda" (BPR), the most important credit union, have operated
for many years. However despite a long history behind, SACCOs coverage remain very
limited, with only 3 percent of the population saving with all MFIs in general, SACCOs
included.

2.      To address this issue analyzed as a major factor hindering economic development, a
recent National Dialogue Meeting held in December 2008 recommended the creation of at
least one SACCO at the level of each Administrative Sector (Umurenge).

3.       In line with this a task force composed of representatives from diverse Government
institutions, especially from MINECOFIN, MINICOM, MINALOC, and BNR was formed
and was assigned to propose a strategy to implement this policy directive. The strategy
proposed in this document is in line with the National Micro Finance Policy, the National
Microfinance Policy Implementation Strategy, and the recently validated National Savings
Mobilization Strategy. Towards this aim, the structure of this document is designed as
follows: the first step is to explain what is a SACCO, what are its major characteristics and
roles, related advantages and specific challenges.

4.      Then after having analyzed the current level of development of SACCOs which cover
18 percent of adult Rwandan population, the document highlights the specific major
challenges hampering their development which are a little education on them; poor
governance and little human resource capacity, little information on bad clients of;
inappropriate legal framework and taxes; lack of adequate infrastructure (energy, roads,
offices, equipments...; real return on deposits little or negative.

5.      To address the issues analyzed, the strategy recommends to develop a successful
SACCO Model in line with national policies and international best practices; the strategy
proposes a number of actions to be implemented in three phases: phase one is related to
preliminary actions which will pave the way for next phases; phase two is related to creation
of SACCOs and making them operational, and phase three is the development phase once
SACCOs will be created and effectively operational. Detailed action plan for all those steps,
as well as related time frame, budget and responsibilities, are proposed. The major item in the
proposed budget is related to a subsidy to cover in a digressive way the operating costs of
starting SACCOs until they reach self-sustainability. This would cost around four billion RwF
for the first three years of the plan.

6.     To be effective and successful, this strategy requires a conducive macroeconomic
environment. The strategy also needs total involvement of all players: Central Government,
Local Governments, Central Bank, community based organizations, and the concerned
population. This general mobilization for a radical revolution requires total political
involvement at all levels.

ANNEX 15: RISKS OF USING SACCOS AS A CASH PAYMENT MECHANISM

Background

1.      The GoR, in an attempt to reduce fraud and corruption, has mandated that all
payments of public funds to private-sector entities (including individuals) should be made
directly into accounts these entities have established in financial institutions and that no
government payments to be made in cash. Payments under the direct support (DS) and public
works (PW) programs fall into this category and therefore have to be delivered to a secure
personal bank account and cannot be delivered in cash. As far as the VUP is concerned, this
is beneficial for it provides an opportunity for the poor to access Financial Services (FS).
However, this presents the VUP administration with two challenges. First, most recipients of
DS and PW have never had a personal bank account. Second, because most DS and PW
recipients live in the more remote villages, there are no convenient bank offices where they
could access their accounts and withdraw cash.

2.     SACCO's grew up as cooperatives formed by small numbers of people at village level
who act together to find a secure mechanism to pool their savings and earn interest, or to
provide small credits. As such, they appear to offer an ideal mechanism to channel DS and
PW payments to the local recipients.

3.     The GoR has encouraged financial institutions (such as Bank Populaire and micro-
financing institutions (MFIs) including the private SACCO's) to take on the role of providing
the mechanism to pay benefits by allowing DS and PW recipients to open accounts and save
or withdraw their cash at the local village level.

Risks

4.     SACCO's as currently structured, and in the future as structured under the new
SACCO strategy (see Annex 14), do offer a good option to deliver DS and PW benefits
through a secure banking personal account system at local level.

5.     However the use of SACCO's for this function is not without risk. For the DS and
PW recipients, there are two risks. First, as for all members of SACCO's, there are the
general risks of a small scale financial cooperative. Second, there are additional risks specific
to DS and PW recipients because of their status within the SACCO.

General risks

6.      The general risks, common to DS and PW recipients and non-recipients alike, are
associated with cooperatives of this type and are spelt out in the new SACCO strategy.
Generally weak governance ­ inadequate regulation ­ limited range of products, and above all
the fact that the SACCO is likely to be set up and run by a combination of the local elite (the
non-poor) and people who are likely to be net borrowers who have specific personal interests
in how the SACCO is run. These groups have a great incentive to control the operation and
rules of the SACCO and their priorities would not necessarily be pro-poor. The strategy
identifies these risks and attempts to address them with a combination of better regulation and
governance. However, the great advantage of SACCOs is that they are set up and managed
                                              103
by a group of local people who (a) have a common bond, possibly as a group of workers from
the same industry or just a geographical bond from a small village, and (b) they are monitored
and governed by the members who have a direct interest in how the rules and management
affect their personal financial interest in the SACCO.

7.      Increased regulation and a move to greater external governance, would reduce the risk
of SACCOs being run by a small group of self-interested people, but could undermine one of
the main advantages of a SACCO, which is self-governance by the people with a vested
interest.

Specific Risks to DS and PW Recipients

8.      The structure of current private SACCOs allows a DS or PW recipient, as a matter of
choice, to become a full member. However the cost of becoming a member is too high for
most DS and PW recipients to pay and therefore SACCOs are dealing with these people by
treating them as clients rather than members. Although some private SACCOs reportedly
achieve considerably higher membership rates, particularly among PW beneficiaries, in some
of the existing SACCO MFIs operating in the VUP Sectors we have observed, only a
negligible proportion of DS and PW recipients have become members. As clients, they avoid
the start up cost of purchasing a share in the SACCO. However, PW beneficiaries still have to
pay the setup cost of opening an account, and both PW and DS beneficiaries have to pay
monthly charges for operating the SACCO. Also, as clients, who are non-members as
opposed to members, they have no voting rights and therefore no control over how the MFI
(private SACCO) is run. In consequence, the rules surrounding the payment of interest are set
by members in a way that makes it almost impossible for a client ever to be able to save in an
interest bearing account. In practice, therefore, DS and PW recipients who are dealt with as
clients rather than members of SACCOs are likely to face risks related to the following:

    ·   No voting rights and no influence on how the SACCO is run.
    ·   Pay setup costs that can be of the order of 4-5 days benefit for a household.
    ·   Pay monthly service charges that that can be in the order of 6% of benefit costs.
    ·   Receive no interest on any of their savings, unless they can lock in a significant
        amount of savings for a fixed period.

9.      To address these risks, and to deal with the problems specific to the DS and PW
recipients, the implementation of the Umurenge SACCO strategy needs to be accelerated so
as to provide a mechanism whereby these individuals can become full members, have some
control over how individual SACCO's are run, and receive the full value of their benefits
without monthly administration charges.

10.     Umurenge SACCOs seek to address a number of the drawbacks and risks associated
with existing private SACCOs and other MFIs through (i) greater membership of PW and DS
beneficiaries; (ii) sensitization and training on the management of Umurenge SACCOs; and
(iii) members roles and responsibilities in decisions that affect their transactions, with the
result that they seek to provide greater rights and benefits.

ANNEX 16: COMMUNITY PERFORMANCE-BASED FINANCING OF HEALTH56

1.      The impetus for performance-based financing (PBF) in Rwanda came from the
experience of NGOs who paid health workers salary bonuses, yet the outputs of the health
services were stagnating and even deteriorating. The NGOs' efforts at improving service
delivery yielded various models, and from these the National PBF was developed.57 PBF
became a major pillar within the Ministry's first Health Sector Strategic Plan and it was
implemented in order to provide incentives to health workers to improve efficiency and
outcomes, and provide additional income to health workers. Nationwide roll-out of the
National PBF took place in April 2008. The National PBF is divided into two main models:
(i) the PBF model for health centers and hospitals, called the Facility-based PBF (or the
Facility PBF), and (ii) the PBF model for community health, called the Community-based
PBF (or the Community PBF).

Facility PBF

2.      In the Facility PBF, payments for performance are based on the quantity of outputs
(through case-based remuneration) conditional on the quality of services delivered. The
quantity of outputs are measured monthly while the quality is measured quarterly through the
use of an elaborate supervisory checklist. Health facility staff can increase their performance,
and hence their earnings, by increasing the quantity of outputs, increasing the quality of
services delivered, or both. The health center PBF model is based on contracts between
different levels: (i) contract between the CAAC and the Steering Committee (Comité de
Pilotage); (ii) contract between the Steering Committee and health facilities; and (iii) contract
between health facilities and individual health workers. In-depth verification activities are
done by one focal point per administrative District for quantitative evaluation and by hospital
for qualitative evaluation.58

Community PBF

3.      The Community PBF was embedded in the National Community Health Policy, and
through this policy the Ministry of Health provides the policy direction, while implementation
is by the Ministry of Local Administration. Initial implementation was in January 2006 in 23
experimental Districts following a broad consultative process and based on 6 community-
level PBF indicators: (i) mutuelle enrollment; (ii) deliveries at health center; (iii) use of
insecticide treated nets; (iv) management of dehydration due to diarrhea among under-fives;
(v) personal hygiene; and (vi) reporting. The model was based on experience gained during
the implementation of the health center and hospital PBF models, and benefits from a close fit
with these models. However, although the Ministry of Local Administration transferred a

   Examples of the NGO models are: Ville de Kigali model; the Cyangugu model and the Butare model
58
   The hospital PBF model for use in district hospitals consists of 52 indicators, 27 of which are singular output
measures or binary variables and 25 are composite indicators with 99 composite variables in all. Fifteen
indicators assess administration and represent 20 percent of the total performance score; 19 indicators assess
quality assurance and represent 30 percent of the total performance score, and 18 indicators assess clinical
activities and represent 50 percent of the total performance score.

budget related to community PBF, there have been delays in implementation. This is due to
the fact that, unlike the health center and hospital models, the community PBF model did not
succeed in linking payment to changes in outcomes (as opposed to submission of reports) and
suffered from a weak incentives to report reliable and timely data from the community-level.
Following these initial experiences the Community PBF has been redesigned to address the
design weaknesses while learning from the initial experiences.

Box 16.1: Development of the National PBF Model
 The national PBF model for health centers was designed during the first quarter of 2006 through an extensive consultative
 process involving various key stakeholders. The model is predominantly based on the Butare model--it has steering
 committees with representation of health authorities, health facilities, donors and civil society and contracts between each
 of these entities. It also has key quality elements of the Cyangugu model, such monthly control at the health center level
 and incorporation of the quality supervisory tool as a performance measure. A complicating factor during the introductory
 phase of the National PBF was the parallel implementation of the decentralization reforms at the time. These reforms
 included far-reaching administrative reforms, decentralized decision-making power and budgetary control, making the
 Mayor the decentralized authority on sector budgets. In the health sector there were also significant reforms--for example,
 the former District Health Teams (headed by the District Director of Health who was also the hospital Director) were
 disbanded, and merged with the hospital teams. A new district health department called Unité Santé et Famille et
 Protection des Droits de l'Enfant (USF) was created, with a new staffing, new District Director of Health and under direct
 authority of the Mayor s office (Ministry of Local Administration). Figure presents the purchaser-provider split as
 defined in the national model between the quality controllers, the purchasers and the service providers.

 Figure 1. National PBF model




 During the second and third quarters of 2006, the national model was rolled-out through the 23 PBF districts. The
 implementation of the national model is guided through a rigorous intervention study, and a the roll-out plan. There were
 three phases of the PBF roll-out plan. Phase 0 districts corresponds to the three PBF pilot projects (2002-2005): (i)
 Nyamasheke and Rusizi, the "Cyangugu Pilot"; (ii) Huye and Gisagara, the "Butare Pilot"; and (iii) the BTC "Ville de
 Kigali" Pilot. Phase 1 districts are districts in which PBF was started since January 2006. Finally, Phase 2 districts are the
 seven control districts in which PBF was implemented in April 2008.



4.       Figure 16.1 presents the purchaser-provider split that is proposed for the Community
PBF: Purchasers: the Health Center Management on behalf of all Donors; Provider: the CHW
Cooperative; Controllers: the Sector PBF Steering Committee comprising the Sector
administrative officials responsible for health, the health center management, and other public
institutions or members like teachers, representatives of civil society organizations (local
NGOs, faith-based organizations, etc.).

5.     The Community Health Desk of the MoH provides overall policy guidance and support to
the national Community PBF. The implementation of the Community PBF reflects a
decentralized control and decision making model (see Figure 16.2 and
6.     Figure 16.3).
   · The Local Sector Administration signs a contract with the Community Health Worker
       Cooperative detailing the Community PBF performance indicators and the content of the
       reports that need to be submitted before a certain date.
   · The Community Health Worker Cooperative reports to the Sector PBF Steering
       Committee as per the contract.
   · The District health department and District hospital provide support to the PBF Sector
       Steering Committee: (i) general support and capacity building in the institutional
       mechanisms governing the Community PBF system; and (ii) support organizing data input
       using the Web application.
   · The PBF Sector Steering Committee decides on the level of achievement: (i) discusses the
       quarterly sector community performance report and validates it; (ii) discusses any
       observations brought to the table by the Health Center; and (iii) approves the payment
       after determining successful performance based on the key performance indicators.
   · CHW Cooperative receives payment from the health center after performance has been
       certified by the PBF Sector Steering Committee. The funds received by the CHW
       Cooperatives are pooled with other resources from income generating activities.

7.      The Community PBF is a central element of the 2008 Community Health Policy and
Strategy in which the MoH commits to addressing preventable health problems through
empowering communities to participate in activities aimed at improving their own health
status. CHW are elected by the community and have been trained in high impact, curative
and preventive care services at the community level. The Community-PBF is a dynamic
program. It is evolving from paying for the submission of the report, to also rewarding
progress in selected output indicators. The inclusion of demand-side incentives to promote

                                              108
maternal health outcomes is a further step along the evolution of the model. Under this
revision, the PBF pays women for institutional deliveries.

                                   indicators

Supply-side model
8.    It provides incentives directly to community health worker cooperatives. There are
two components to this model:
   1. Pay for reporting: CHW cooperatives receive a quarterly payment based on the
      timely submission of quality data reports related to selected indicators.
   2. Pay for indicators: CHW cooperatives receive a quarterly payment based on changes
      in the 5 target indicators:
          a. Nutrition Monitoring: Increase the number of children (6-59 months)
              monitored and referred for the nutrition status,
          b. Antenatal care: Increase the number of women accompanied/referred to the
              health center for first trimester antenatal care visit,
          c. Deliveries: Increase number of women delivering at the facilities,
          d. Family Planning: Increase number of women new users of family planning
              methods (any method),
          e. Family Planning: Increase the number women (21-45 years) from regular to
              the long term FP users (IUD, implants, injection, Norplant, Surgical/NSV
              contraception).
The pay-for-reporting component will be implemented nationally. The pay-for-indicators
component will be implemented in all but 100 sectors.

Demand-side model
9.    The objectives of the demand-side incentive model include:
   1. Antenatal Care: Increase the number of pregnant women consulting the health center
      for prenatal care visit.
   2. Institutional Delivery: Increase number of women delivering in the health facilities.
                                              109
   3. Postnatal Care: Increase the number of mother-child pairs receiving postnatal care at
      HC within 7 days of birth/discharge.
   4. Family Planning: Increase the number of women 21-49 years who initiate long-term
      modern contraceptives (IUD, Norplant, Surgical/NSV contraception)

10.     The demand-side model will be implemented in 130 sectors in 2010. First, the MOH
will target the 30 first phase VUP sectors to implement the first phase of the demand-side
model. These 30 sectors were identified by MINELOC as the poorest sector in each of the 30
Districts. Second, given budget and logistical constraints, the MOH cannot scale up
implementation of the demand-side model nationally immediately. In order to identify the
first phase for implementation, an additional 100 sectors were randomly selected. This is a
fair and transparent method for identifying the sectors that will receive the program first, and
allows for a rigorous, prospective impact evaluation.

ANNEX 17: ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS IN THE RWANDAN CONTEXT


1. To address environmental challenges, GoR has developed an environmental framework as
part of its PSTA (Plan Statégique pour la Transformation Agricole) for marshland
development. A centerpiece of the implementation strategy is the Second Rural Sector
Support Project (RSSP), under which marshland development is being undertaken at a rate
now approaching 1,500 ha per year. By 2005, nearly 10,000 ha of arable land had been
improved through so-called "radical terracing," and in 2006 performance contracts were
negotiated at the District level between mayors and the President of the Republic calling for
the development of an additional 100 ha of radical terraces per District. The development of
irrigation schemes will require adequate resources to control the incidence of water-borne
diseases, pollution of surface and groundwater by agrochemicals, water-logging and
salinization of soils, and population resettlement.

2. Despite many remaining challenges facing Rwanda, the framework for environmental
management in the country has steadily evolved over the last decade, resulting in noticeable
improvements in the institutional framework during the last five years. Prior to the
restructuring of MINITERE in spring of 2008, MINITERE had been responsible since 2004
for the environment, mines, land, forest, and water resources. For policy formulation and
implementation, MINITERE relies on a number of specialized public agencies including
Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA) (environmental agency), REDEMI
(mining), and the National Land Center (land use planning and delivery of titles). Over these
last four years, MINITERE secured the adoption of several pieces of legislation by the
national assembly, including laws on forests, land, water, environment, and mining that will
improve the management of natural resources. MINITERE is now being restructured, and for
example, water and sanitation are being moved to MININFRA.

3. REMA, set up in 2006 after the introduction of the Environmental Law, is the agency
responsible for reviewing the Terms of References for Environmental Assessments (EA) that
must take place on all proposed projects in the country (GoR, donor or private). They also
then review the EA itself and provide the certificate without which no one can proceed. To
date, GoR has adopted environment organic law, environmental policy, and environmental
impact assessment guidelines to further address and coordinate its environmental concerns
and challenges. Given the decentralized framework, at District level, there are Environmental
Officers (EOs) charged with supervising implementation of the environment policy
commensurate with the legal framework established by the law. REMA trains the EOs and
supervises their technical work as provided for by the law and policy. Furthermore, in
collaboration with sector ministries, REMA is moving towards developing more custom-made
environmental guidelines for each of the ministries to replace the general guidelines. UNDP
and GoR also put together guidelines in 2007 to help mainstream environmental issues in all
sectors during the EDPRS process

4. Under the PRSC/G I an Environmental Assessment and Social Analysis59 was undertaken
during its preparation (which was governed by OD 8.60, Adjustment Lending Policy60). The

study intended to assist GoR in identifying and eventually establishing regulatory,
administrative, and technical capacity within Rwanda to ensure that for each development
project undertaken in the country, environmental and social impacts are identified, mitigated,
and monitored as part of the sustainable use and management of Rwanda's natural resources
and the environment. In the current PRSG series, such minor environmental effects may arise
through measures to support irrigation, watershed management and terracing, rural road
maintenance, and fertilizer distribution. As with the first series of PRSGs, the current series
(PRSG 4 to 6), will rely on two areas to address potential environmental concerns: (i)
continued strengthening of the overall framework for environmental management in Rwanda;
and (ii) environmental management assessments undertaken in the context of other Bank
projects.

5. The more recent RSSP of Rwanda has undertaken an Environmental Assessment (IP/BP
4.01) amongst other safeguard policies. This project will work on conservation of hills
through reforestation and terracing, marshland development, reforestation and improvements
in farming techniques through water resource and soil conservations, flood control and
rehabilitation and management. The second RSSP will serve to further strengthen GoR's
capabilities in regards to environmental safeguards.

6. Also, GoR's Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) program
consists of a two-phased operation to implement improved land husbandry and increased
productivity in 101 pilot watersheds covering some 30,000 hectares including 10,000 under
cultivation. Its development has led to a request by MINAGRI for a standard or common
framework of engagement for the various participating donors and partner organizations.
This would permit support of the larger LWH Program by many different financiers while
maintaining some common quality standards (e.g. dam safety) and common approaches (e.g.
to social safeguards), despite different implementation arrangements. The Bank is assisting
MINAGRI in this process. The framework would be based on experiences from similar
operations in the country, e.g. on progressive and radical terracing and other engineering
aspects, and would include a step-wise process to develop beneficiary involvement and
empowerment. It would also include a participatory site and technology selection process,
based on specific indicators, in particular demonstrated interest from beneficiaries, as well as
social and environmental safeguards.

7. MINALOC, as a major national ministry and as the national ministry responsible for local
government, has an ongoing responsibility to follow and conform with national laws, policies
and processes concerning environmental management. In its role as the ministry responsible
for local government, it has taken the necessary steps to incorporate environmental safeguards
and infrastructure technical advice guidelines in its operational manuals prepared for its VUP
flagship program, which is supported by this CLSG.
