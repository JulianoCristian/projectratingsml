Vietnam Second\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project were as follows:\n            the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was\n            satisfactory, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. Following are findings and implications: In\n            Vietnam, a stable political environment contributed to the\n            successful implementation of macroeconomic and structural\n            reforms. The risk of erosion of political support was\n            minimized and reversals due to political changes became less\n            likely. The political support was achieved with the building\n            of a broad-based consensus and strong government commitment\n            through the preparation of the Comprehensive Poverty\n            Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). To complement the\n            government's strong ownership, the availability of\n            technical assistance grants from donors, and strong and\n            close Bank team support played a key role in low-income\n            countries with weak technical working level capacity."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
