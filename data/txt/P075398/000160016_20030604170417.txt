                     SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM:
              SECOND POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT


                           Credit and ProgramSummary

Borrower:          The Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

Amount:            SDR 72.6 million (US$ 100 million equivalent).

Terms:             Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period.

Description:       A second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 2) for the
                   implementation o f Vietnam's Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth
                   Strategy (CPRGS) completed inMay 2002.

Benefits:          The proposed PRSC program has three key benefits:

                   0      It will strengthen competition in the economy, harden the budget
                          constraint on state-owned enterprises, and level the playing field for
                          the private sector, therefore leading to increased efficiency and job
                          creation.

                   0      It will promote investments in people through better access by the
                          poor to education and health care, more secure asset ownership in the
                          form o f land titles and a greater role for public involvement in
                          environmental management.

                   0      It will increase efficiency and accountability in public financial
                          management and improve legal transparency and accessibility, thus
                          laying the foundations for modern governance.

Risks:             Three main risks accompany the PRSC program:

                   0      A loss of momentum in the reform process, and resistance from
                          vested interests, could entail a risk o f slippage, especially in the area
                          of public sector reform.

                   0      The reform costs could be higher than estimated if the resolution of
                          non-performing loans proceeds at a slower pace, or if policy lending
                          by the Government goes into unviable projects.

                   0      Fiduciary risk, and a failure to ensure that adequate progress is made
                          with budget transparency and tackling corruption, could defeat the
                          attempt to buildmodern governance.

Disbursement:      The credit will be disbursedupon declaration o feffectiveness.

Co-financing:      About US$33.7 million equivalent from DFID (10 million Pounds), the
                   Netherlands(7 million Euros) and SIDA (70 million Krona).

                                   I. INTRODUCTION


1.       Vietnam's economy doubled in size during the last decade, while the rate of poverty was
halved from 70 percent in the early 1990s to around 37 percent in 1998. Savings rates rose six-
fold to around 25 percent of GDP. Exports grew by an average of 25 percent per year,
transforming a food-deficit country into the second largest exporter of rice in the world. Social
indicators improved markedly and across a broadfront there was widespreadand visible progress
in the lives of citizens.    Vietnam navigated through the East Asian crisis thanks to prudent
management of its economy, and took crucial steps to address the structural impedimentsto long-
term growth and poverty reduction.

2.       The proposed credit builds on this performance, and the reinvigoration of the structural
reform program, which was supported by the first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 1)
and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). The credit aims at sustaining the structural reforms, while extending into social and
institutional areas, and is expectedto help reducethe incidence of poverty furtherto 25 percent in
2004. The reform program supported through this process will be firmly aligned to Vietnam's
blueprint for development, the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy
(CPRGS). The three main pillars of the CPRGS are: (i)completing the transition to a market
economy; (ii)   making development inclusive; and (iii)building modern governance. In order to
achieve these objectives, the continuing series of PRSCs, proposed by the Bank, would support
measures to deepen the reforms taken under PRSC 1 and to extend sequentially the Bank's
assistance to social and institutional areas. The current credit is the second in this series of
operations, continuing the successful program started under PRSC 1.

3 .      The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings of Vietnam point to
these same areas as being in need of improvement. Comparisonswith the CPIA ratings for other
countries at a similar development level show Vietnam's strengths and weaknesses.
Macroeconomicmanagement has been solid throughout the period, as revealed by above-average
ratings. Structural policies have improved over time. But because most reforms are only now
beginning to be implemented, Vietnam still scores only average in the structural area, where it
has a large unfinished reform agenda. Policies for social inclusion are relatively strong, but the
capacity to implement these policies remains variable. Finally, governance indicators remain
weak, and only recently received a priority position on the Government's agenda. The sequence
of PRSCsproposed inthis document will make a contribution to addressingthe weak areas.

                                    11.    THEECONOMY


4.       The Vietnamese economy is on a path o f sustained economic growth and has good
prospects o f attaining key Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as well as the localized
MDGsestablished by the country, or Vietnam Development Goals (VDGs). After the slow-down
associated with the East Asian crisis, real GDP growth was 6 percent in 2002 and it is likely to
reach 7 percent in 2003. This performance reflects the commitment o f the Government o f
Vietnam to its economic reform program, and has been sustained through higher disbursements of
foreign direct investment and increasing overseas remittances. Preliminary estimates suggestthat
rapid economic growth is associatedwith continued poverty reduction. Incomes o f the rural poor
have been boosted by higher commodity prices over the past 12 months.

5.       The driving force underlying Vietnam's strong economic performance is private sector
development. More than 50,000 private enterprises have been registered under the Enterprise
Law passed in 2000, with 20,000 of them registered in 2002 alone. While a rigorous assessment
of the impact of this Law, especially at the provincial level, is not available yet, there is broad
agreement about its fundamental importance in fostering private sector development in Vietnam.
The share o f banking credit going to the private sector has attained 60 percent. The official and
public perception of the private sector has improved as well. The National Assembly approved
changes to the Constitution which acknowledge the key role o f the private sector. And the Party
officially acknowledged that the private sector is an important contributor to employment
creation, income generation, and budget revenue. This acknowledgement represents the Party's
strongest endorsement to the private sector ever.

6.       Manufacturing thrives, with the private domestic and the foreign invested sectors
recording annual output growth rates o f 19 and 15 percent respectively in 2002. At 12 percent,
the growth rate of the state-owned sector is more modest. This gap in economic performance
across institutional sectors mirrors Vietnam's gradual transition to a market economy, which has
not been characterized by mass privatization but rather by increased competitive pressures and
harder budget constraints. The formal private sector now employs one million people, which
representsalmost two thirds of employment in state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

7.       Investment levels are increasing steadily.    Total private investment now stands at 9
percent o f GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has increased to 3.2 percent o f GDP, up from 2
percent o f GDP in 2000.       Over the past five years, the implementation o f foreign direct
investment has been relatively stable, while commitments and approvals o f new foreign
investment projects have fluctuated significantly. In the same period, the amount of foreign
capital actually flowing into the country under implemented projects has risen.

8.       Inspite ofthese positive developments, the playing field is not level yet. Some sectors of
activity, deemed strategic by the Government, are not open to private sector participation. SOEs
have advantages over private enterprises in terms o f their access to land and to the soft resources
provided by policy lending. Public procurement tends to favor SOEs as well. Redressingthese
imbalances is an important part o fthe reform agenda o f Vietnam.

9.       The economy i s becoming more open as evidenced by the increase in the share o f exports
in GDP, which attained 48 percent in 2002. Manufactured and processed products currently
account for almost half o f sales abroad. Vietnam has locked in its intention to create a more
competitive and open economy by committing to several comprehensive international trade


                                                 2

agreements, including the Association o f South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area
(AFTA) and the Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US (USBTA). The strong supply response
o f Vietnam, which has allowed it to gain substantial market shares over short periods of time, has
prompted the use o f non-tariff barriers by industrial countries. The difficulties to oppose those
barriers underscore the importance for Vietnam to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) as
soon as possible.

10.       A total of 1,183 SOEs had their ownership transformed between 1992 and March 2003.
O f these, 946 were equitized. A key instrument for divestiture in Vietnam, equitization, consists
o f selling a fraction o f the state capital under the form o f shares, at book value. Other instruments
for divestiture, such as direct sales, leases, management contracts and transfers to workers were
developed in recent years.           Improvements were also made to the legal framework for
restructuring and divesting SOEs. A social safety net to assist workers who become redundant as
a result o f this process is currently in operation. The Government is determinedto retain control
over enterprises in a broad range o f activities.        Equitizations, sales and liquidations concern
enterprises in sectors which are deemed non-strategic, and those enterprises are often smaller than
average. Moreover, by the end o f 2002 progress in divestiture had slowed down, as a result o f
both cumbersome procedures and resistance by vested interests. For the enterprises bound to
remain in state hands, the strategy for reform focuses on increased competition in product
markets and a gradual tightening o fthe budget constraint. Banking reforms are part of this effort.

11.       The share of bank credit going to the private sector has increased continuously over the
period, reaching 61 percent at the end of 2002 up from 48 percent four years earlier. A series of
mergers and the termination o f 12 delinquent financial institutions are evidence of progress
towards securing full compliance with banking regulations. Loan classification has been brought
closer to international standards, as the entire loan balance has to be considered overdue in the
event of payment arrears.          A plan to phase in loan-loss provisioning o f the state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs), based on meetingrestructuring milestones, has been agreed with the
State Bank o f Vietnam (SBV).

12.       Two main concerns remain regardingthe finance sector, and they are both related to slow
progress in SOE reform. The first concern is the difficulty to make progress in the resolution of
non-performing loans (NPLs). At present, the prospects for foreclosure are limited, and many o f
the loans are not collateralized.         The second concern is the expansion of policy lending,
particularly by the Development Assistance Fund (DAF). As o f 2002, the outstanding and
disbursed loan portfolio o f DAF exceeded VND 40 trillion, or roughly 7 percent o f GDP.
Separating policy lending from commercial lending was an important step in the reform of the
banking sector, but an appropriate regulatory framework for policy lending is still inadequate.

13.      The medium-term macroeconomic framework for 2002-2004 was developed in
consultation with the Fund. It was designed to foster high growth over the period while
maintaining price and exchange rate stability. The framework provides sufficient resources to
support reforms while also avoiding the crowding out o f critical social expenditures. At this point
inthe program, most indicators are positive, and some are performing better than envisioned.

14.      Fiscal and monetary policies remained prudent in 2002, with a budget deficit of
approximately 2.5 percent o f GDP before on-lending, slightly less than in 2000 and 2001. The
deficit is being financed by concessional external sources and domestic non-bank sources. The
overall expenditure level was restrained to safeguard the budget and has been managed cautiously
in 2002.      Capital expenditures, which were increased in the early 2000s to rehabilitate




                                                     3

infrastructure damaged by floods, have been capped. Domestic credit expanded by 20.5 percent
last year, with growth o f banking credit to SOEs limited to 12 percent.

15.      Vietnam's outstanding external debt stood at US$ 13.5 billion in 2002. This represents
37 percent o f GDP and 84 percent o f exports, with an annual debt service of 8 percent of exports.
It is estimated that the concessional nature of this debt makes Vietnam's debt service capacity
sustainable over the mediumto long term, making the country ineligible for debt relief under the
HIPC initiative.

16.      Considerable progress has been made in the social areas as well. Using a poverty line
based on the consumption of 2100 calories per day, the poverty headcount has dropped
dramatically, from 58 percent in 1993 to 37 percent in 1998. Poverty declined in all seven
regions o f Vietnam, though the rate o f decline and incidence o f poverty vary greatly across
regions. Looking forward, however, the growth pattern may not be as pro-poor as it was in the
1990s. Most o f the poverty gains from land redistribution to households may be reaped by now.
Further integration with the world economy will increase the gap between urban and rural areas,
as well as between skilled and unskilledworkers. The effective delivery of social services to the
poor is key to sustain further poverty reduction. Greater attention also needs to be paid to the
situation of ethnic minorities.

17.      The coverage o f basic education expanded considerably in the 1990s. Net enrollment
rates for primary school increased from 87 percent in 1993 to 91 percent in 1998. Gains were
even more dramatic at the lower-secondary level (from 30 to 62 percent), and especially at the
upper-secondary level (where enrollment rates quadrupled). This expansion in coverage has been
characterized by equal access for boys and girls. However, disparities in enrollment between the
Kinh majority and ethnic minorities are an important source of concern. Regional disparities are
sizeable as well, especially in terms of student performance. Vietnam has a considerable task
ahead interms of improving the quality of education.

18.      A review of the education planning and financing shows that the system is characterized
by a lack o f strategic direction, which has direct implications for resource allocation. At present,
the fiscal transfer norms that channel resources to provinces for education spending are simply
based on population figures. The system is also characterized by a plethora o f inputs-based
norms which are sometimes contradictory and often ignored in practice. Yet they act as a shield
for deflecting criticism o f poor performance.

19.      Child mortality and maternal mortality have fallen to levels typically observed in
countries whose income per capita is two to three times higher. Malnutrition among children,
although still high by international standards, fell considerably during the second half o f the
1990s. On the other hand, there is a growing inequality in health outcomes between the poor and
the better-off. Reliance on out-of-pocket payments is noticeably high by international standards,
putting a heavy burden on the poor.        Self-treatment has become more common, potentially
escalating the level o f antibiotic resistance among the population. Coping with a developing
HIV/AIDS epidemic is a major challenge as well.

20.      The equitable allocation and distribution o f Land-Use Right Certificates (LUCs) on
agricultural land are two o f the biggest achievements o f Vietnam. It has been at the roots o f a
major increase in agricultural production. It has also underpinned a pattern o f growth with
equality, and dramatic poverty reduction. Progress in land allocation has been more limited in
urban areas, where only 35 percent of households possess secure LUCs, and in upland areas,
where about 60 percent o f the households and individuals who rented or received forest land



                                                  4

directly from the State now possessLUCs. Land-relateddisputes are frequent inthe uplands, and
the situation of ethnic minority groups that do not recognize individual land rights needs to be
explicitly dealt with. Numerous administrative constraints over land use remain, including
influenceover crops to be grown. Leasingor transferringlandis cumbersome.

21.      When a marriedhousehold is allocated rightsto use agriculturalland, these rights accrue
jointly to both spouses. However, LUCs have routinely been issued bearing only one name,
generally that of the male head of household. The absence of women's names from the
certificates undermines the ability of women to claim their right to land use. Participatory
povertyassessments and other researchhave highlightedthe difficultiesandtransaction coststhat
women face in instances of divorce or separation, or in the event of death of the male household
head. In addition, as agricultural land becomes more widely used as collateralfor formal sector
lending, the absence o f documented rights to land ownership may constrain women's access to
credit.

22.      Vietnam's rapid growth has unfortunatelybeen accompaniedby the damaging of natural
resources and declines in environmentalquality. Land degradation continues, while biodiversity
is under threat. Forest cover has improved marginally, but its quality remains a concern.
Burgeoning urban populations are overwhelming municipal infrastructure and causing
environmental problems such as unmanaged landfills, transport-relatedair pollution, untreated
hospitaland hazardouswaste, and raw sewage flowing in open channels. Incitiesandtowns, air,
water and solid waste pollutionneedto be addressed, while environmentalservices fall short of
demand. The participatorypoverty assessment carried out in 1999 and the consultations on the
draft CPRGS suggest that environmentaldegradation is disproportionatelyaffectingpoor people
throughimpacts ontheir healthand livelihoods.

23.      Recognizing these problems, the Government has started identifying policies and
measures aimed at improvinglivelihoods while simultaneously protectingthe environment. The
implementationofthose policies and measuresfalls under the newly created Ministry of Natural
Resources and Environment (MONRE) which brings together the General Department of Land
Administration, the General Hydro-Meteorology Department and the National Environment
Agency. In the immediate future, this ministry will be in charge of land and water resources as
well as environmentalprotection. Natural resource management is currently being transferred,
and other conservation functions such as forestry and protected areas will be transferred in later
years.

24.      Legaldevelopment has been shaped by the transition from a centrally planned economy
to a market economy with a socialist orientation. As the country enters a new phase of rapid
growth, the expansion of economic activity could well outpace the modernizationof the legal
framework. Secured propertyrights, an independentjudiciary and legaltransparency are needed
to keepattractinginvestment and generatingjobs. The right for citizensto complainand get their
grievances addressed is essential to improve public service delivery in areas such as health and
education. Effective law implementationis key to avoid abuses and corruption. In all of these
areas, muchremainsto be done.

25.      Public expenditure management has both strengths and weaknesses in Vietnam.
Mechanismsto avoidover-spending and misappropriationof resources exist, andthe targetingo f
spending on public healthand education (especially the latter) has improvedover time. But the
planning of recurrent and capital expenditures need to be integrated within a medium-term
expenditure framework focused on fiscal sustainabilityand pro-poor outcomes. Other important
priorities are clarifying the fiscal rules pertaining to sub-national administrationsand spending



                                                  5

units, and integrating and strengthening financial management information systems. The Public
Investment Program (PIP) currently emerges as a compilation of national, provincial and sectoral
strategies, with limited emphasis on economic efficiency and poverty alleviation impacts. Clearly
setting up priorities and evaluationmechanisms would be fundamental, given the massive amount
of resources which are channeled through the PIP.

26.     Massive public investment has translated into dramatic increases in infrastructure
services during the 1990s. Intransport, freight carried on roads and railways more than doubled;
on inland waterways, it grew by 70 percent. Coastal shipping grew six-fold, overtaking railways
in terms of freight carried.     In energy, electricity generation almost tripled and crude oil
production multiplied by five and a half. Access to electricity rose from 47 percent to 75 percent
o f the population. An increase in power tariffs contributed to making the electricity sector
financially viable. Crude oil became a major export commodity, accounting for one-fifth of the
country's foreign exchange receipts. Institutional reforms also contributed to the increase in
infrastructure services. In 2002, for the first time, a large scale infrastructure project was entirely
financed by the private sector.

27.     Despite these achievements, however,             Vietnam's     infrastructure  needs remain
considerable. Its existing stock lags behind the average for many low-income countries and is
more inefficient than in other countries. Despite being rich in primary energy resources, Vietnam
has more than half of its rural population without access to electricity. Per capita consumption o f
commercial energy remains one o f the lowest in the world.               Notwithstanding substantial
improvements in the past decade, the transport system is over-stretched, adding to costs and
preventingmany upland and rural areas from sharing in the benefits o f Vietnam's growth. Water
supply and sanitation facilities require investments and efficiency improvements to keep up with
accelerating urban population growth and industrial demands. Currently, limited competition
from private providers generates few economy-wide pressures for enhancing infrastructure
performance.



                 111. THECOMPREHENSIVEPOVERTYREDUCTION
                                       AND GROWTH STRATEGY


28.     Vietnam was the first country in Asia to present a full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) for discussion by the Boards o f the IMF and the World Bank. The CPRGS, completed in
May 2002, translated the vision laid out in the Ten-Year Strategy for 2001-2010 into concrete
public actions.    The Ten-Year Strategy envisioned a path o f transition towards a "market-
economy with socialist orientation".      It committed Vietnam to full openness to the global
economy over the coming decade, and to the creation o f a level-playing field between the public
and the private sectors. It emphasized that the transition had to be pro-poor, and noted that this
would require heavier investment in rural and lagging regions, as well as a more gradual reform
implementation than is often recommended by international advisors. It gave strong emphasis to
poverty reduction and social equity, and to a more modern system o f governance.

29.     The CPRGS built on that foundation, but had several strengths o f its own, both in terms
of substance and regarding its preparation process. A wide range o f stakeholders participated
actively in the discussions and even in the drafting. The underlying analysis o f poverty was
encompassing, and made a balanced use of quantitative and qualitative evidence. The strategy for
poverty reduction was articulated; it combined policies covering the macroeconomic, structural



                                                  6

and sectoral areas, with special attention given to improving governance. Moreover, the CPRGS
explicitly identified outcome targets to address the national challenges and the Government's
international commitments to the Millennium Development Goals              (MDGs). One of the
important features of this document is the use of localized MDGs, or Vietnam Development
Goals (VDGs), to clearly articulate the vision that Vietnam has set for itself for the coming
decade. These goals are ambitious, but attainable with high level of growth and also the right
pattern of growth. Overall, the CPRGS represented a systematic attempt to prioritize public
actions and to assesstheir resource implications.

30.      The CPRGS is a very comprehensive document and its wide coverage of topics and
policies may make it difficult to grasp it at once. However, its contents can be organized around
three broad pillars:


    0    Pillar I : High growth through a transition to a market economy. This requires the firm
         implementation o f the structural reform agenda laid out by the Government.


    0    Pillar 11: An equitable, socially inclusive and sustainable pattern of growth. This
         requires appropriate sectoral and social policies and programs.


    0    Pillar 111: Adoption o f a modern public administration, legal and governance system.
         This is essential for the first two goals to be attainable.

3 1.     The CPRGS pillars are not self-standing, but rather connected by cross-cutting themes.
One of them is employment generation for poverty reduction. Vietnam has roughly 1.4 million
new entrants to the labor market every year. And over the next two decades, about one million
people will move from rural to urban areas annually. The entire SOE sector, including roughly
5,200 enterprises, employs 1.7 million people. This is despite the fact that it still absorbs almost
40 percent of new credit to the economy, and accounts for a substantial portion o f its capital
stock.   The SOE sector cannot be counted upon as the main vehicle to generate off-farm
employment for the rural poor, or new job opportunities for migrants to urban areas. The
structural reforms underpinning private sector development are therefore key for small and
mediumenterprises (SMEs) to take over as the main source o f labor earnings.

32.      Another cross-cutting theme o f CPRGS is the link between public financial management
and the effective delivery o f social services to the poor. Vietnam has experienced a rapid
decentralization in the public provision o f health and education, leading to greater inequalities in
service delivery across provinces. Because of the limited resources allocated through the central
budget, an increased burden i s being placed on poor people for the financing of basic social
services. This tension is aggravated by the pressure on health and education provider networks to
modernize in a market-oriented economy, and to allow a greater role to the private sector. Inthe
CPRGS, the Government o f Vietnam has committed to finding alternative ways of financing
these services, includingthrough better allocation o f budgetary resources and improved targeting
of exemptions to the poor.

33.       The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the CPRGS outlines several challenges to CPRGS
implementation. An inter-ministerial working unit has been established and a CPRGS secretariat
has been set up at the Ministry o f Planning and Investment (MPI). But attention must be given to
involving all stakeholders in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the strategy,
including greater public access to data. Equally important, there is a need to develop concrete
action plans detailing the timing and costs of activities. This is particularly pressing for some o f
the proposed measures to improve governance. Sectoral programs need to be more sharply


                                                    7

prioritized and set within resource constraints and a well-defined medium-term expenditure
framework. Aligning resource allocation decisions at the national and provincial levels to the
desired outcomes will be key to place the proposed interventions in the budget framework. More
work is also needed to fully assess the poverty and social impact of the reform strategy and the
adequacy o f the existing safety nets.


                             Iv.      PROGRESSUNDERPRSC 1


34.      PRSC 1was approved by the Board in June 2001, basedon an InterimPoverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). As such, Vietnam was the second country in the world to secure a
PRSC from the World Bank. At that time, Vietnam was still emergingfrom the East Asian crisis,
and the focus was mainly on the structural reform agenda. Policy actions under PRSC 1 were
articulated around five areas: liberalizing trade, reforming SOEs, strengthening the banking
system, improvingthe private sector climate and improving public expenditure management and
transparency. PRSC 1 was a two-tranche operation, for an amount o f $250 million. DANIDA,
DFID, the Netherlands and the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) co-financed
the operation, providing an additional $52 million of budget support. PRSC 1was completed in
December 2002 with the release o f its Second Tranche.

35.      Overall progress in economic reform under PRSC 1 has been satisfactory. Economic
growth and poverty reduction outcomes, as reflected by intermediate indicators such as the
growth rate o f GDP and exports, credit available to the private sector, and others (see Table l),
set the stage for Vietnam to continue with its reform program and to achieve its sustainability.
These accomplishments justify the proposed next step in IDA assistance, the preparation of the
current operation, PRSC 2.

36.      Duringthe implementationof PRSC 1, Vietnam maintained an adequate macroeconomic
policy framework, supported by a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
program.    Fiscal and monetary policies continue to be on track with respect to the Fund's
program. Two PRGF reviews were completed successfully. The third one was held up mainly
due to lack o f agreement on safeguard measures related to the management o f international
reserves. The Fund Board has decided not to approve any further tranche releases under the
PRGF-supported program until they can reach agreement with the Government on new
approaches to strengthen accounting and reserves management at the SBV. The Government has
not been able to agree on an acceptable approach that would not violate the current laws. While
disagreement may persist, it is expected that a Fund mission scheduled to visit Hanoi in June
2003 will confirm the adequacy of the current macroeconomic framework.

37.      Policy reforms included in the first phase o f the three-year program laid out for PRSC 1
were implemented as planned. Technical assistance and quarterly monitoring at senior official
level in the Government helped to overcome the challenges caused by weak administrative
capacity. Table 1 reports progress accomplished under PRSC 1, usingas a benchmark the set o f
indicators identified when the credit was under preparation. Progress was particularly persuasive
in the areas of private sector development, trade liberalization and public expenditure
management. Targets were met inother areas as well, but in some cases the information to assess
progress against the benchmarks i s not available yet. Continued dialogue under PRSC 2 and
plans for technical assistance should lead to better information on the performance o f SOEs.
Social sector data will be available shortly from the recent household expenditure survey.

38.      Liberalizing Trade. Vietnam has gradually removed quantitative import restrictions
(QRs), reduced tariffs under the AFTA agreement, and raised private participation in exports.
During the period covered by PRSC 1, QRs were eliminated for paper, liquor, floor tiles,
construction glass, steel, vegetable oil and passenger vehicles up to 9 seats. Tariffs were not
raised on these products, except for vegetable oil. As a result o f this process, the coverage of
QRs fell from 20 percent o f imports and 22 percent o f production at the beginningof the period,
to 13 percent and 4 percent respectively at the end of it.

39.      Implementation of the first-year tariff-reductions under the AFTA agreement has been
broadly on track, with the average tariff on imports from ASEAN countries falling to 11 percent.
Export quotas, which currently only exist for garment exports to Europe, are now being partially
auctioned and partially licensed automatically.      Licenses operate on a first-come-first-served
basis. Auctioning and the automatic licensing of export quotas have had the effect o f increasing
private sector participationingarment exports.

40.      State-owned-enterprise reform.    Vietnam has been implementing an SOE reform plan
which comprises specific measures to divest small and medium SOEs, and general measures to
promote greater transparency, competition and financial accountability for the SOEs remaining in
Government hands. Divestiture is conducted mainly through equitization. An equitization is
considered major when the share of state capital sold exceeds 50 percent. Other instruments for
divestiture include selling the SOE, leasing it, contracting out its management, or transferring it to
its workers.

41.      The enterprise-specific measures proved to be the most difficult to implement in a time-
bound manner. Improvements in the legal framework for enterprise divestiture, including the set
up of a social safety net for redundant SOE workers and the adoption of a more streamlined
equitization process, were satisfactorily completed. Equitizations, sales, and liquidations of 408
SOEs were processed over the period covered by PRSC 1.                 Roughly 76 percent of the
equitizations were major. The SOEs whose ownership was transformed accounted for 2.5 percent
o f total SOE debt and around 5 percent o f total SOE employment, in line with what had been
planned. In addition, diagnostic audits o f 17 SOEs have been conducted and 13 others are
nearing completion. On the general measures, satisfactory liberalization o f trade, promotion of
private sector development and banking reform have contributed to increased competition and
greater financial accountability.

42.      While the SOE reform strategy o f Vietnam does not rest on mass privatization, the
divestiture process supported by PRSC 1 has shown encouraging results. A recent study focused
on the 422 enterprises equitized prior to 2001 revealed considerable efficiency gains. All the
equitized enterprises surveyedwere found to still be in business. Their sales were growing (at 20
percent per year) and their employment was growing as well (at 4 percent). Assets had increased
by 21 percent per year. These figures may be partly attributable to a consistent bias to equitize
the better-performing SOEs, butthey provide a strong rationale for continuing the process.

43.      One PRSC 1 condition related to SOE reform was partially fulfilled at the time of the
secondtranche release schedule, and requireda waiver. This condition referred to the adoption o f
restructuring plans for three large General Corporations, operating in textiles, coffee and sea
products. The agreed funding for the preparation o f these plans was not fully in Vietnam's
control, and became available later than expected. The inability to adopt the restructuring plans
for three General Corporations did not undermine the overall success of the program or the
effectiveness of any of its components. All three plans are expected to be completed by June

2003, and their approval by the Prime Minister, or by a ministry designate by the Prime Minister,
should follow shortly after.

44.     Financial sector reform. In early 2001, Vietnam began implementing a comprehensive
multi-year banking reform program. Its goals were to improve the regulation and supervisionof
banks, to enhance their transparency and accountability, to improve the financial health of the
banking system, and to create incentives for banks to operate in a more commercially-oriented
basis. Progressin carrying out these reforms has been slow, but steady.

45.     New regulations were issued regarding rules for loan classification and loan-loss
provisioning. The four largest SOCBs have been subjectedto audits of their financial statements
based on International Accounting Standards (IAS). Audits for the year 2000 have been
completed, and audits for 2001 are under way. Loan classification has been brought closer to
international practice, with banks now required to consider the entire loan balance as overdue
when there are arrears in its servicing. Previously, only the arrears were considered overdue.
Large SOCBs have adopted an interim phased plan to provision fully for NPLs using the
estimates from the international standard audits for the year 2000. This plan envisages full
provisioning, using own resources, by end 2004 and 2005 for different banks. Adoption of a
Capital, Assets, Management, Earnings, and Liquidity system (CAMEL) was delayed but an
implementation plan has been developed, and a revised manual for strengthening on-site
supervisionhas been completed.

46.      Policy lending has been separated from the commercial banking system, but it continues
to grow at a rapid pace. A decree establishingthe Social Policy Bank (SPB) was issued. The
SPB will provide loans at subsidized rates to vulnerable groups with limited access to the four
large SOCBs. The SPB is partly financed with mandatory depositsfrom SOCBs. Another policy
financial institution that lends to enterprises, projects, and provides financial guarantees, the
DAF, has expanded considerably and may now be a significant vehicle for routing financial
support to SOEs. Besides budget allocations, the DAF is financed with postal savings, social
security funds, and domestic bond issuance. Recently, SOCBs were requiredto transfer 2 percent
of their deposits to DAF. This probably reflects an attempt by the authorities to meet the targets
on the growth of domestic credit, at a time when deposits are expandingvery rapidly due to the
monetization of the economy. DAF lending is currently not countedtowards the domestic credit
targets. Its inclusion shouldreducethe incentive to transfer depositsfrom SOCBsto DAF.

47.     Private sector development. Several actions were taken under PRSC 1 to improve the
overall climate for private sector development. The National Assembly approved changes to the
Constitution making the private sector a key pillar of the economy, and recognizing the rights of
enterprises and entrepreneurs to determine their forms of business and to operate in sectors not
prohibited. The Fifth Party Plenum, in March 2002, endorsed the private sector as an important
contributor to employment creation, income generation and budget revenues. It called on the
leaders of the country to encourage it, and issued a resolution proposing policies to facilitate
private sector development.

48.     Over the period covered by PRSC 1, more than 50 business licenses affecting private
entry and operation were removed or modified, and a decree outlining support for the
development of private SMEs was issued. A secured transactions registration agency was made
operational in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in March 2002 to facilitate execution of
mortgages permitted under the Securities regulation. Steps have also been taken to gradually
phase-out dual pricing for foreign and domestic entities. This improved business climate is

reflected inthe growth of domestic formally registeredprivate firms. New registrationsrose from
12,000 in 2000, to 18,000 in 2001 and to 20,000 in2002.

49.      Public financial management.      This component of the program was implemented
satisfactorily. The budget plan and final accounts, disaggregated in greater sectoral detail, were
published and placed on the website of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The Treasury was
designated as the main agency responsible for comprehensive public accounts. Preparations to
install a comprehensive budgetary management information system in the Treasury are currently
underway. An inventory of the off-budget accounts has been made, including a detailed
statement for the DAF. A review of the norms for recurrent budget allocations has been
completed, and recurrent budget implications of the public investment program have been
estimated. The process for developing a medium-term sector expenditure program has been
initiated.


                      v.     THEPROPOSEDREFORMPROGRAM


A.       ProgramOverview

50.      The CPRGS is broader than the I-PRSP and foresees a vast number of policy actions of
different strategic importance, without systematically discussing their appropriate timing and
sequencing. Insufficient prioritization had to be expected in the first attempt to produce a
comprehensive strategy of this nature. However, for the strategy to become operational it was
necessary to identifya narrower set of policy actions to be supportedby the program. A key step
in this direction was undertaken in October 2002, when more than 300 Government officials,
donors and representativesof civil society gathered in Haiphong, to discuss the implementation of
the CPRGS agenda. This effort ledto a more focused set of policy matrices.

51.      The proposed reform program can be seen as a further distillation o f the Haiphong
matrices. The process leading to the set of actions to be supported by PRSC 2 and subsequent
operations is based on a continued policy dialogue with the Government. The process has been
influenced by analytical work carried out in recent years, including the World Bank's analytical
and advisory (AAA) program. Annex 8 lists the economic and sector work which has influenced
the design of the proposed reform program. The identification of the policy actions to be
supported through the PRSC process has also involved consultations with non-Government
organizations, as well as the participation of other donors. Among them, the donors who co-
financed PRSC 1 (DANIDA, DFID, the Netherlands and SIDA) have been associated with the
preparation of the proposed reform program from its initial stages. Other donors have expressed
interest injoining the PRSC process including its policy dialogue component at a later stage.

52.      The reform program supported by the proposed series of PRSCs covers a four-year
period, muchthe same as the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Vietnam. Consideration
of such an extended time horizon is warranted by the fact that CPRGS may not be thoroughly
revised until around 2006. At that point, it could become a substitute for the Five-Year Plan.
Rolling down a series of PRSCs, on an annual basis, is a mechanism to support the process of
implementing CPRGS, evaluate its impacts, and draw lessons for subsequent revisions of
strategiesand policies.




                                               12

53.      In line with the normal programmatic approach, PRSC 2 is basedon progress reflected in
key policy actions, while future institutional and policy benchmarks are notional. Decisions on
proceeding with PRSC 3 will be basedon a defined set o f triggers, and the prior actions for future
operations will be adjusted in light of actual progress achieved. These triggers are referred to in
the text and summarized in SectionVII.

54.      The list o f actions considered under PRSC 2 and subsequent PRSCs is discussed in detail
further down inthis section. Overall, the reform program includes 91 policy actions, ofwhich 37
are structural in nature, and the rest is split almost evenly between the social and the governance
areas. This amounts to about two dozen policy actions per year, which is probably the maximum
that can be managed through the PRSC process. But compared to the Haiphong matrices, the
selectedactions provide a clearer sense of importance and timing. They also draw attentionto the
relationship between the components of the program, and the degree to which they are expected
to build on each other to generate change.

55.      While the reform program supported by the proposed series o f PSRCs focuses on policy
actions, its implementation should translate into improved economic and social outcomes. The
expected outcomes of the program are reported further down inthis section, and compared to the
situation prevailing at present. The selected outcome indicators represent a sub-set o f the
monitoring indicators identified by CPRGS. Several o f them had already been considered by
PRSC 1. Others are based on the VDGs, the localized version of the MDGs. They all represent
measurable yardsticks to assess progress in the implementation of the structural, social and
governance reform agendas.

56.      A key issue is whether the pace o f reform across the three CPRGS pillars is balanced in
the proposed PRSC program. Oscillations in the pace o f implementation o f the three pillars of
the CPRGS agenda can be expected in a multi-year program. However, two main policy areas
have been singled out as a matter o f concern, both by donors and by Government. The first one is
SOE reform. The strategy followed by the Government has not been basedon mass privatization,
but rather on the introduction of incentives to the SOEs to reform themselves. At the onset o f this
series of PRSCs, it is necessary to assess whether the Government strategy has been successful,
and what is needed to make it more effective. The second area of concern relates to large-scale
infrastructure. Resources channeled through the PIP amount to around one third o f GDP. Still,
no discussion o f policy actions related to large-scale infrastructure can be found in the CPRGS.
How to improve the PIP, giving priority to growth and poverty reduction objectives, is
problematic in light o f this omission.

57.      State-owned enterprise reform. The Government strategy has been to free up resources
for poverty reduction programs and to achieve a level playingfield with a dynamic private sector.
To attain these goals, policies aimed at fostering competition in product markets, through trade
liberalization, and at hardening the budget constraint, through the suppression o f Government
subsidies and the introduction o f a ceiling on the growth o f banking credit to SOEs. In addition,
numericaltargets were set in 2001 for the annual divestiture or liquidation of SOEs. This prudent
strategy has worked so far. As Table 2 shows, the total number o f SOEs has declined steadily
over time. The pace is not dramatic, but the trend i s unambiguous. Progress is even more
significant when outcome indicators are considered. Table 2 shows a considerable drop in the
share o f SOEs in industrial output, non-oil exports, and banking credit. Unfortunately, outcome
indicators referring to capital, debt and employment levels cannot be constructed as the data
available on these variables are scatteredand unreliable.

58.     The proposed reform program supports the overall strategy, as it provides the foundations
for a level playing field between the private sector and SOEs. At the same time, the program
aims at strengthening each of the individual components o f this strategy. Trade liberalization has
fostered competition inthe product markets for tradable goods. Butkey services, such as finance,
energy or telecommunications, remain heavily dominated by General Corporations.               Public
procurement also tends to favor SOEs over private sector suppliers. This series of PRSCs
includes opening up the markets for services, through the adoption o f a roadmap leadingto WTO
accession within the shortest delays. It also includes greater competition in public markets,
improving openness and transparency in tenders, especially through the adoption o f a new
procurement ordinance.

59.     Hardening the budget constraint faced by SOEs i s another component o f the proposed
reform program. Separating policy lending from commercial lending was an important step to
make SOCBs more efficient. But no appropriate regulatory framework was set up for policy
lending. One of the policy actions included inthe proposed reform program is the revision o f the
regulatory framework for the operation o f the DAF. The program also foresees more stringent
requirements in the reporting o f financial information by SOEs to authorized financial agencies.
The gradual transition of SOEs to the regulatory framework established by the Enterprise Law
should also lead to improved disclosure of financial statements. The ability to monitor SOE
indebtedness on a timely basis is key to assess fiscal risks, as increased competition could push
unreformed SOEs to default on their financial obligations. At present, MOF monitors the debts
of the 200 most-indebted SOEs. MOF also has financial information on roughly 1,400 SOEs
reporting to General Corporations governed under Decrees 90/QD-TTg and 91/QD-TTg.
However, a careful comparison with detailed SOE audits conducted as part o f the PRSC 1
program cast doubts on the quality of that information. Updated information on the debts of the
remainingthree thousand SOEs is unavailable at this point.

60.     Efforts to harden the budget constraint on SOEs have been hampered by the lack o f
appropriate mechanisms for NPL resolution. While SOCBs have their own asset management
companies, they currently lack the power to reach foreclosure, seizing assets and forcing
enterprise liquidation if necessary. No central Debts and Assets Trading Company (DATC)
existed by the time when PRSC 1 was completed. As a result, it was not possible to swap inter-
enterprise debts, nor to link budget support for debt relief to real restructuring, or to divestiture.


                                                 14

The proposed reform program includes the creation of a DATC to be operated on a pilot basis
first, and the adoption of plans for NPL resolution based on experience acquired with 20 SOEs
with large bad debts.

61.      Policies for enterprise divestiture and liquidation have been the most controversial aspect
o f the Government strategy for SOE reform. Until recently, those policies were based on
numerical targets. Roughly 1,800 SOEs were supposed to be equitized, sold, leased, contracted
out, transferred or liquidated between 2001 and 2004. Under PRSC 1, the target was cautiously
set at 400 ownership transformations and liquidations. While this target was strictly met, by the
end o f the period covered by PRSC 1there was a noticeable slowdown inthe divestiture process.
Italso became clear that the 2004 objectivecould notbe attained without a policy change.

62.      The divestiture program supported from PRSC 2 onwards is based on a series of new
SOE reform plans, which include the names and time schedule for ownership transformation o f
enterprises under 104 line ministries, provinces and General Corporations. These entities were
requested to equitize, sell, lease, contract out or transfer all of their enterprises operating in
sectors o f activity deemed non-strategic, over a three-year period. Also, an instruction was
passed allowing these line ministries, provinces and General Corporations to dismiss the SOE
directors who fail to comply with the reform plans. Progress in the approval of these plans in
recent months seems to have reinvigorated the divestiture program.                A total of 125
transformations, including75 equitizations, took place during the first quarter of 2003, which i s
insharpcontrast with the almost complete standstill observed inthe last quarter of2002.

63.      Large-scale injPastructure. Realizing the failure to properly address issues related to
large-scale infrastructure, in December 2002 the Government decided to revise the CPRGS, based
on a consultation process along the same lines followed for the original document. Because of
the time necessary to prepare a chapter on infrastructure that would take into account both the
accumulated evidence and the views o f stakeholders, it was decided that the revised CPRGS
would be completed in time for its discussion at the Consultative Group (CG) meeting of
December 2003. The new CPRGS chapter on infrastructure is expected to assessthe contribution
o f large investment projects to economic growth and poverty reduction, and to serve as the basis
for policy actions aimed at maximizing that contribution. AAA work supported by various
donors will be usedto inform this process.

64.      Steps in the direction o f strengtheningthe management system for public investment
have been undertaken inthe context of Official Development Assistance (0DA)-funded projects.
ODA plays a significant role in Vietnam's economic growth and underlying capital investment.
ODA disbursements have funded an important share o f public investment expenditures since
1995. Between 1996-2001 the share o f ODA in public investment was 22 percent. Vietnam has
been unable to access the full amount o f concessional assistance potentially available. While the
results o f completed projects are generally good, implementation delays mean that expected
project benefits are often deferred or lost. Measures to improve and accelerate the project
preparation and implementation process need to be considered. Many initiatives are taking place
locally to improve the effectiveness o f aid delivery on the donors' side. Bilateral donors have
worked through the like-minded Donor Group to try to harmonize procedures. The World Bank,
the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
have also been collaborating on harmonization.

65.      In light of the ongoing efforts to improve the management of ODA-fundedprojects, and
to incorporate large-scale infrastructure into the CPRGS, the proposed reform program does not
include, at this stage, any immediate policy action in this area. It identifies two main objectives,



                                                   15

which are to revisethe criteria guidingthe preparation of the PIP and to develop the infrastructure
for trade. But the identification of specific steps towards these two objectives is delayed untilthe
revisedCPRGS is released. Those steps, as well as policy actions related to transport, energy and
the urban sector, will therefore be discussed inthe Program Document for PRSC 3.

66.      Policy matrices. The proposed reform program is summarized under the form of two
policy matrices attached to the document. One of them summarizes the PRSC program by policy
area, listing separately the policy actions supported by PRSC 2. This matrix does not commit to
the specific timing o f each action under subsequent PRSCs, but it does identify the Government
actions and economic developments that will be considered as triggers to launch the preparation
of PRSC 3. The other policy matrix refers specifically to actions under PRSC 2. It is organized
by Government agenciesand describes inmore detail the measuresundertaken insupport ofthose
actions, referring to the corresponding legal documents.


B.       CPRGSPillarI:Completingthe Transitionto a MarketEconomy

67.      Policy actions and economic outcomes related to the implementation o f CPRGS Pillar I
are summarized in Table 3. This Table distinguishes policy actions under PRSC 2 from those
scheduled for subsequent steps o f the PRSC process. Actions under PRSC 2 are discussed in
more detail below, when presenting the proposed credit.

68.      Trade liberalization. Vietnam has accelerated its integration into the world economy in
recent years. Under the PRSC process, it is geared towards further tariff reductions, the phasing-
out of QRs and trading-right restrictions, and the development o f an appropriate set o f rules and
regulations for trade in goods and services. It is expected that towards the end of this period the
average (un-weighted) Common Effective Preferential Tariff Scheme (CEPT) rate will be about
9.3 percent down from 10.7 percent in 2002.           It is also expected that Vietnam will have
completed all of its commitments under AFTA, will have achieved the key milestones of the
USBTA, and will beentitled to become a member of the WTO.

69.      Inthis process, QRs are to be phased out on a multilateral basis. The list of QRs to be
eliminated under PRSC 2 can be found inthe next sub-section. The process will continue under
subsequent PRSCs and will be completed by 2006, around the time o f WTO accession. Vietnam
i s also committed to removing trading right restrictions for companies with U S ownership of up
to 49 percent in2003, and up to 51 percent by 2006.

70.      A revamping o f the legal framework is needed for further integration into the world
economy. Vietnam submitted its application to join the WTO at the beginning of 1995 and
currently has observer status. Accelerating the pace of accession is a declared objective o f the
Government, but this will not happen without comprehensive economic reforms, supported by a
well thought-out integration roadmap. Making such a roadmap available, including a specific list
of policy actions and a timetable for their implementation, will help in promoting policy
awareness and gathering support from various stakeholders for an active and smooth accession
process. The target is for Vietnam to become a member o f WTO and comply with the Doha
Development Agenda towards the end o f the period covered by this series of PRSCs. Reform and
strengthening o f legal instruments in other sectors are also anticipated during this period,
including a revision to the laws on land and environmental protection.

71.      Changes in the regulatory framework which are scheduled to take place under PRSC 2
are listed in the next section. Key milestones under subsequent PRSCs will be the revised Law
on Commerce to include trade in services, Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), regulations to deal
with dumping and subsidized imports, a law on unfair competition, rules o f origin, and
regulations on transparency.

72.      State-owned enterprise reform. Substantial progress is needed regarding the divestiture
o f SOEs that do not play a strategic role, the hardening o f the budget constraint faced by SOEs
bound to remain in Government hands, and the close supervision o f SOE debts and other
financial indicators.

73.       The divestiture effort will be guided by a series of SOE reform plans, approved by the
Prime Minister under PRSC 2. The underpinning for these reform plans is Decision 58, which
classifies all sectors of activity accordingto the rationale for state intervention inthem. Based on
this Decision, all line ministries, provinces and General Corporations were requested to produce
an ownership transformation plan leading to the divestiture of all the SOEs under their
supervisionthat did not operate in sectors of activity where state intervention wasjustified. Inall,
there are 104 separate SOE reform plans, issued by the line ministries, provinces and General
Corporations, reviewed by the National Steering Committee for Enterprise Reform and
Development (NSCERD), and approved by the Prime Minister.

74.       Unlike the plan for SOE restructuring supported by PRSC 1, the new SOE reform plans
identify enterprises by name, and indicate the date for their transformation. Based on preliminary
information, over a three-year period about 2,300 SOEs, out of roughly 5,200, are bound to be
equitized, sold, liquidated, merged, or converted into administrative units (see Table 4). These
enterprises employ roughly 0.4 million workers, out of a total of roughly 1.7 million employed by
the SOE sector. Capital i s allegedly in excess o f 17 trillion VND, and their total debt could be
close to 6 trillion VND. However, these figures should be treated with caution as data on SOE
debts or capital are unreliable. Another difference between the new SOE reform plans and the
previous plan for SOE restructuring concerns the existence o f sanctions for directors who fail to
comply. Details on the implementation o f SOE reform plans under PRSC 2 are provided in the
next section.

75.        Progress in the planned SOE transformations will be monitored under subsequent
PRSCs, with monthly reporting on the numbers and names o f the concerned SOEs. For each
completed transformation, the monitoring scheme will indicate the proportion o f equity sold, and
the different classes o f equity holders to whom the equity was sold. The monitoring scheme will
also put under surveillance the creation o f new SOEs, and of joint stock companies involving
SOEs. In light o f the information, it will be possible to assess whether progress is in accordance
with the SOE reform plans. Timely implementation o f ownership transformations under the new
SOE reform plans is considered atrigger for PRSC 3.

76.       The hardening o f the constraints faced by SOEs comes from increased competition in
product markets and limited access to soft lending. The key measures to make markets more
competitive are covered in the sub-section on foreign trade, for barriers on trade in goods and
services, and in the sub-section on public investment, regarding a level playing field for
procurement. Measures to harden the budget constraint refer to the adoption o f more effective
guidelines for NPL resolution, the establishment o f a central DATC and the revision o f the
regulatory framework for policy lending. These measuresare discussed below, in the sub-section
on the financial sector.

77.         Regarding supervision, under PRSC 2 all SOEs have been requested to submit detailed
financial information to authorized financial agencies on an annual basis. The nature of the
information to be submitted is described in the next section. The information management
system to be established at MOF is aimed at ensuring the accountability of SOE managers and
hence the effective use o f state assets. Policy makers need timely financial information to
monitor the performance o f SOEs, exercise their state ownership responsibilities and assess the
Governments contingent liabilities. This will require that SOEs prepare financial statements in
accordance with improved accounting standards and be audited by independent auditors. In line
with the Government's plans, the triggers for PRSC 3 include evidence o f progress in
implementing the Decision on SOE Performance Evaluation and Monitoring and, in particular,
require that rating o f some SOEs take place accordingto the stated criteria.

78.       Financial sector reform.   The program in this area is critical to reduce the risk o f a
financial crisis which could have a devastating impact on the poor. The Government aims at
increasing the transparency and accountability of the system, improving its legal and regulatory
framework, moving to international accounting standards especially in loan-classification and
provisioning, leveling the playing field for all banks, and restructuring the joint-stock banks
(JSBs) and the SOCBs.

79.       One o f the most difficult challenges in this process concerns the large stock of NPLs.
Due to differences between Vietnamese and international accounting standards regarding loan
classification, the true size o f the NPL portfolio remains controversial.       The adoption and
institutionalization o f IAS audit practices is likely to reveal weak financial positions for several
SOCBs. A plan exists to re-capitalize these banks. Re-capitalization will be performance based,
i.e. conditional on strict adherence to implementation o f the individual restructuring plans. It is
expected that re-capitalization o f SOCBs will be finalized by end 2006, resulting in 8 percent
capital-adequacy ratios.    Accordingly, monitoring the implementation of the plan will be a
recurrent theme o fthe PRSC process.

80.       The restructuringplan also includes targets for implementation o f credit manuals to guide
credit and risk analysis in lending operations, and involves the use o f explicit Government


                                                  22

guarantees for lending to SOEs. By 2004, responsibility for internal audits at SOCBs will shift
from the individual banks' Board o f Management to their Board of Directors. In order to carry
out this task, the Law on Credit Institutions will need to be revised to lay a foundation for
independent internal audits, as well as other banking governance improvements. Furthermore,
detailed plans for equitization of one o f the SOCBs will be approved in 2004, with full
equitization slated for 2005. This process will signal the willingness to separate the ownership
and supervisory roles of the SBV.

81.      Future progress towards the resolution o f NPLs requires the development o f an effective
approach that could be implementedon a systematic basis over the coming years. An important
step inthis direction is the establishment o f a central DATC, under PRSC 2. Inorder to minimize
fiscal risks and to avoid undermining efforts towards the resolution of non-performing loans by
SOCB-based Asset Management Companies (AMCs), the scope o f operation o f the DATC will
be primarily on non-performing bank loans for which the Government has assumed full
responsibility. Links between the activities of the central DATC and the operational and financial
restructuring of the concerned SOEs need to be firmly established. Given the mixed international
experiences in this respect, the DATC will be tested on a pilot basis first. The main features o f
the pilot program are discussed inthe next section.

82.      Improving the capacity of SOCBs to resolve the NPLs of SOEs, including those with no
collateral, are also part of the PRSC process. Under PRSC 2, a re-evaluation exercise for
unsecured NPLs of 80 large SOEs was launched. Looking forward, the creditor's rights of
SOCBs in the re-evaluation and resolution of NPLs will be strengthened, and a link will be
established between NPL resolution and the SOE reform plans.

83.      The Government is committed to separating policy lendingfrom commercial lending, as
reflected by the creation o f SPB and DAF. But these institutions need a transparent legal
framework to function in a prudent manner. A comprehensive diagnosis of the DAF will be
conducted under the PRSC process, leading to a revision of Decree 43, which guides its
operation. The preparation o f this diagnosis will be supplemented by a donor-supported technical
assistance program, aimed at strengthening DAF's procedures and risk assessment capacity. The
diagnosis will focus on total outstanding loans and NPLs, both to SOEs and to others, at the end
of 2000, 2001 and 2002. It will also identify the 20 largest defaulters to the DAF. It is expected
that the revision will limit the sectors o f activity in which the DAF can operate, make the DAF
rely more heavily on the subsidization o f commercial lending, and curtail DAF lendingto SOEs
with NPLs which do not have a workout plan agreed with their major SOCB creditor.

84.      Private sector development. Policy actions in this area focus on facilitating access to
land, leveling the playing field, and further implementing the Enterprise Law. PRSC 2 seeks
improvements in the climate for private enterprise through two actions. First, the Government
has drawn up an Action Plan to implement the Party resolutions on promoting private sector
development. Secondly, the Government has issued a Decree to intensify the implementation o f
the Enterprise Law. Private sector access to land, through improving land-use planning and
removing restrictions on allocating agricultural land for industrial activities, i s expected to have a
major beneficial impact on private sector development in Vietnam. Amending the Land Law, so
as to allow private enterprises to transfer LUCs, is also part o f the PRSC process. Continued
expansion o f the private sector, as evidenced by an increase in registrations o f at least 1200
enterprises per month, is included as a trigger for PRSC 3.

85.      Enterprises in Vietnam currently operate under various legal and regulatory regimes. The
reform program features the amendment o f the Enterprise Law to cover all corporate sectors



                                                  23

(foreign, private domestic and state-owned) accompanied by a clear timetable for compliance by
large SOEs.       Equal access to the significant market opportunities represented by the
Government's public investment program (PIP) is another key element o f the reform program.
Policy actions under subsequent PRSCs include the introduction of competitive tenders for public
sector contracts. Introducing competition into the telecommunications sector will be key to
ensuring the provision of reliable and competitively priced services, which in turn affects the
ability to compete and innovate of all business activities in Vietnam. Actions outlined above,
aimed at subjecting large SOEs to the same accounting and auditing regulations will support this
move towards a more level playing field.

86.      Vietnam is making progress in improving its accounting and auditing standards and has
by now its own timetable for the development and issuanceo f revised standards. Several of them
have already been approved under PRSC 2. Satisfactory progress on the issuance o f accounting
and auditing standardsconsistent with internationalpractice is foreseen under subsequentPRSCs.

87.      Large-scale inj?astructure. A detailed consideration of policy actions in this area needs
to be postponed until the CPRGS is revised and a chapter on large infrastructure included in it.
Butpolicy reforms inenergy andtransport are expected to be part ofthe PRSC process, as well as
measures aimed at improving the infrastructure for trade.

88.      In energy, efforts have so far been aimed at improving the financial sustainability of the
power sector through a program of tariff increases agreed in June 2002. The first increase was
implemented on October 1, 2002.           A power sector reform road map is currently under
preparation. It should include the setting up of regulatory agencies in the sector. The creation o f
the National Energy Policy Council and office i s also a main item in the policy agenda. An
Electricity Law, with associated rural electrification decrees, is currently being drafted and will
be submitted to the National Assembly for its possible passage by end 2004. The approval o f gas
decrees is expected by June 2003. The equitization o f distribution is also under consideration.

89.      In transport, actions related to road maintenance are likely to be included either through
sector-wide approaches or in subsequent PRSCs. Those actions will focus on the promotion o f
institutions that are capable of planning, programming and funding routine and periodic
maintenance for all classes o f road. They will also aim at improving the regional balance of
investment, as well as the regulatory framework to promote competition on a level playing field
inthe provision o ftransport services for roads and waterways.

90.      Infrastructure for trade has improved, albeit slowly, over the past few years. Efficiency
and reliability o f container handling operations has increased by modification o f port facilities
and operations, and the new Customs Law further improved operations by streamlining customs
clearance of goods. WTO-consistent customs valuation, which is to be implemented under
subsequent PRSCs, will enhance efficiency further.


C.       CPRGSPillar11:MakingDevelopmentInclusive

91.      Policy actions and economic outcomes related to the implementation o f CPRGS Pillar I1
are summarized in Table 5. Actions under PRSC 2 are described in more detail when presenting
the proposed credit.

92.      Education. The reform program supported through the proposed series o f PRSCs aims at
increasing the overall spending in education, at reducing the current dispersion in effective



                                                24

spending per pupil, and at improving quality standards. The program hinges on the combination
o f two elements: the adoption of school quality standards, and the introduction of resource
allocation mechanisms geared towards the attainment of those standards, especially in
disadvantaged districts. The overall approach is captured in the Education for All framework,
approved by the Prime Ministerunder PRSC 2.

93.      A fundamental upgrade in management practices will take place under subsequent
PRSCs with the introduction o f a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the
education sector. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has been selected as a pilot
sector for this exercise, under improved accounting systems and control procedures by MOF.
Also scheduled for subsequent PRSCs is the adoption o f Fundamental School Quality Level
(FSQL) standards, which will not only guide resource allocation, but also serve as a lever to
facilitate monitoring, both at the central and the provincial levels. The FSQL standards will refer
to physical infrastructure, teaching staff, school organization and management, social
participation in education, educational activities and quality, and expected educational outcomes.
Draftingthe regulations for the adoption o f FSQL standards is a trigger for PRSC 3.

94.      This overall approach is to be complemented by a targeting strategy. An index of
educational disadvantage has already been developed, combining net enrollment rates, the
percentage o f 6-year-old children having access to schooling, and completion rates.             This
targeting mechanism allows to identify a substantial number of districts that have their indices
well below the national average. Proposed investments aim at bringing a significant number of
these districts to the FSQL standards. Under the PRSC program, it is expected that by 2006, at
least 40 percent o f the educationally disadvantaged zones will receive Government support to
upgrade to the FSQL level. It is also expected that schools receiving the FSQL investmentswill
eliminate all the charges which currently burden families, especially the poor.

95.      Health. To redressthe imbalances in health outcomes, the reform program supported by
the PRSC process focuses on changing the financing o f health. Public resource allocation by the
central Government will be more closely linked to health sector's goals and priorities, and the
targeting o f central Government transfers and donor assistance will be improved. An action plan
for HIV/AIDS is also part of the process.

96.      An important policy action under PRSC 2 is the adoption of Decision 139/2002/QD-TTg
dated October 15, 2002, which makes more funding available for health services for the poor at
the provincial level. Ultimately, the Health Care Fund for the Poor (HCFP) created by Decision
139 should be usedto improve access to quality health services for the poor. Attention is needed
regarding which beneficiaries and health care services will be covered, and to what extent extra
funds from the central Government will be made available to pay for those services. Also
deserving focus are the mechanisms to be used to compensate suppliers o f health care to poor
beneficiaries. The adoption o f tested criteria regarding the design o f the HCFP i s an essential part
o f the PRSC process.

97.     For the longer term, the implementationof an MTEF for the health sector is key to deal
with the overall financing issues in a systematic way. Efforts to improve expenditure and
financial managementat the Ministry of Health (MOH) are plannedfor 2003-2004. They will be
coupledwith on-going technical assistance to MOF to develop MTEFs for four sectors, including
health. It is expected that all preparatory, analytic and capacity-building activities for MTEF for
health sector will be completed within the PRSC cycle. Within that process, it will be necessary
to revise the planning methods, allocation criteria, and financing instruments governing central
and provincial spendingon health by programand function.

98.     A National Committee for the Preventionof AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution was recently
established by the Prime Minister to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. A policy framework for
HIV/AIDS will be developed within the PRSC process to identify critical needs, challenges and
opportunities. It will be important that the future HIV/AIDS prevention agenda links HIV/AIDS
to other social and economic development plans, increases Government's human resource
capacity and financial commitment to HIV/AIDS, scales-up successful pilot programs. More
broadly, HIV/AIDS needto be recognizedas a gender issue andthe approach to HIV/AIDS needs
to become a program of harm prevention, rather than elimination of a social evil. By December
2003, the Government expects to have drafted a ten-year strategy for slowing and halting the
spread of HIV/AIDs. The preparationof this draft is included as atrigger for PRSC 3.

99.     Improved environmental management has an important role to play in addressing a
number of significant and widespread health problems. The recent decision to phase-out leaded
petrol has resulted in substantially reduced lead blood levels in urban areas.             Improved
investments in solid waste collection and sanitation services offer considerable potential for
reducing disease transmission in both rural and urban environments. Reductions in indoor air
pollution through the introduction of cleaner fuels, improved technologies and house design
offers the potential to reduce acute and chronic respiratory problems, a problem prevalent in
many parts of Vietnam. Further action is neededto address the healthand environmental impacts
of over-use of pesticidesand other persistentorganic pollutants.

100.    Land.    The reform agenda supported through the PRSC process builds on the
achievements of the 1990s, when an equitable allocation of agricultural lowland to households
laid the foundation for rapid growth and poverty reduction. To continue these achievements,
policy actions will focus on completing the classification of land, issuing the corresponding
LUCs, and redefiningthe legal basisof land administration for a moremarket-basedeconomy.

101.    A key benchmark under PRSC 2 is the proportion of land users who have receivedLUCs,
including combined Building, Ownership and Land-use Right Certificates. Dueto different rates
of progress inthe process of land classification, the benchmarks is establishedseparately for land
users in urbanareas and in forest land. The latter include communities, as well as households and
individuals.

102.      Under subsequent PRSCs, the National Assembly is expected to adopt a new,
substantially revised Land Law, which will provide greater land-tenure security and access to
land by all sectors.    It will also address customary land-use practices, leading to secure
community land tenure. This revision should serve as the basis for more sustainable approaches
to land and forest-use management, for example through the introduction of community forest
management. The submission of a bill for this revision of the Land Law constitutes a trigger for
PRSC 3.     The adoption of improved land-use zoning regulations and planning to permit the
orderly conversion of land from one use to another, reflecting public needs, market forces and



                                                 29

community participation, is expected to be part of the process as well. Other actions to be
coveredunder subsequent PRSCs includethe adoptionof efficient procedures for transacting land
and addressingland disputesand distress sales. The gradual completion of landclassification and
the provision of LUCs inurbanand forest areas are also part ofthe PRSC process.

103.       Public spending in agriculture and rural development must be improved to offset the
incipient trends towards increased inequality in Vietnam and to reach marginalized groups who
do not directly benefit from overall economic growth. Under subsequent PRSCs, an MTEF for
the sector will be adopted, with the goal of making public spendingplans more transparent, with
priorities based on their probable impacts. While Vietnam's current five-year plan emphasizes
improvements in public spending for the rural sector, an MTEF is lacking at the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). A series of impact assessment studies, to be
completedduring the life of the PRSC program, will provide the basis for this MTEF.

104.       Gender. The Government has made a strong commitment to re-issue existing LUCs to
specify names of both husband and wife as joint users. The objective is that a vast majority of
LUCs bear the names of both spouses by the end of the PRSC process. Progress towards this
objective will be monitored on a regular basis under subsequent PRSCs.

105.       Environment and natural resource management.         Commitments in this policy area
were made under the National Strategy for Environmental Protection (NSEP), 2001-2010,
adopted under PRSC 2.        This strategy includes the revision of a Politburo Resolution on
environment, which is expected to be approved in mid 2003. The NSEP will also lead to an
action plan to translate the overall strategy into concrete actions. Subsequent steps include the
strengthening of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of investment projects. A joint
circular with the Ministry of Planning and Investment(MPI) on EIA, requiring the environmental
assessment of projects and its approval by the responsible environmental agency, prior to the
issuance of investment licenses, is also part of the reform program anticipatedin the roadmap for
subsequent PRSCs. The EIA systemwill be strengthenedfurther by the introduction of Decisions
and circulars facilitating public participation in the EIA process. Triggers for PRSC 3 include
carrying out a broad dialogue on the strengthening of the EIA mechanismsthat is reflected in
draft Governmentregulations.

106.       Effective land classification and land-use planning are essential to address the serious
housing shortage faced at present throughout the cities of Vietnam, and to improve the
sustainability of land management practices. As part of the PRSC process, instructions will be
issued to improve zoning, particularly for urban development. Particular attention will be given
to transparency and public access to information. In parallel to this effort, a decision will be
issued to provide basic services by zones, regardless of the migrant status of the population. At
present, many amongthe urbanpoor inVietnam live in areas with limited access to basic services
such as safe water, sanitation, drainage, electricity and solid waste collection. Lack of access is
common among unregisteredurban migrants. Environmental sustainability of land use planning
will be strengthenedby extending the environmental assessment process to provincial and urban
plans, river basins and economic developmentzones.

107.     Sustainable water resource management is critical to Vietnam's economic and social
development. The new Law on Water Resources adopted in 1999 representedan important step
forward, but many of its provisions have yet to be applied. The Law will now need to be revised
in view of the transfer of water resource management functions to MONRE. This revision
process will offer an opportunity to respondto experience since 1999, to ensure consistencywith
MONRE's new tasks and functions, and to integrate appropriate environmental considerations in



                                                 30

line with Decree 91. The roadmap for future PRSCs therefore includes a revision o f the Law on
Water Resources in a way that follows the principles approved by the National Water Resources
Council. The draft revisions to the Law will be subject to public consultation and comment.

108.    Additionally, since the Government's five-year development plan for the water sub-
sector (2001-5) gives priority to building capacity to implement the new Law, benchmarks for
subsequent PRSCs includethe issuance of several implementingdecrees. These decrees will deal
with institutional arrangements, including regular operations o f river basin organizations;
financing water resource management; water inspection; and water licensing. Progress in these
areas will facilitate basin-basedwater resource management across administrative borders.

109.    An important benchmark will be the transfer o f responsibility for natural resource
management from MARD to MONRE. MONRE will need to staff and equip the Department o f
Water Resource Management and approve aNational Water Resource Strategy and Action Plan.

110.    Reversing forest degradation remains a high priority o f the Government, as reflected in
its Five Million Hectare Program. However, despite an apparent increase in forest cover over
recent years, attributable to the establishment o f plantations, the extent and quality o f natural
forest cover continues to decline, with serious implications for the environment and for the forest-
dependent poor living inremote mountainous areas. Under the PRSC program, an action plan to
restore forests and wetlands with high biodiversity will be prepared and adopted. The plan will
seek to provide a greater role for forest-and wetland-dependent peoples with a stake in the
management o f these resources. The plan will rely on a monitoring and reporting system which
will make more effective use of aerial photography.

111.    The PRSC process also includes the restructuring o f State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) and
State Farms. Currently, SFEs manage a substantial proportion of the overall land area o f the
country, particularly in hilly and mountainous areas where poverty is most prevalent.           The
transformation process will lead to the re-allocation o f under-used forest land to local
populations. To further separate the management o f public goods from commercial functions,
SFEswill have to be transformed into either viable businesses or forest protectionboards.

112.      Vietnam suffers frequently from natural disasters, notably typhoons and floods, which
disproportionately affect the poor. While the immediate policy response to these challenges is
reasonably good, there is still a need for a comprehensive Natural Disaster Mitigation (NDM)
strategy. Its goal will be to guide the management o f risks and public efforts to assist those most
likely to be affected by natural disasters.      Sound environmental management, such as the
protection and sustainable management o f forests in critical watersheds and vulnerable coastal
areas, has a clear role to play in disaster avoidance and mitigation. Adoption o f the NDM
strategy will be part of the PRSC process.

are summarized in Table 6. Actions under PRSC 2 are described in more detail when presenting

114.     Improving planning processes. The long-term objective of the reform program i s to
incorporate CPRGS into planning process at all levels, in order to foster economic growth and
accelerate poverty reduction. A crucial step in this process is the establishment of a National
Steering Committee to implement both the CPRGS and PRSC/PRGF, which occurred under
PRSC 2.

115.      Under subsequent PRSCs, the approach underlyingCPRGS will be rolled down to a set
o f provinces and sectors. A first step in that direction was the issuance of a Government
instruction mandating provinces to develop a socio-economic development plan for 2003. A
series of regional workshops is currently being conducted to help provinces familiarize with the
CPRGS process and its implications at the local level. A new poverty assessment with a regional
breakdown will be carried out in 2003 using a new, much larger household survey, as well as
other sources o f information. Based on this experience, a number of provinces are expected to
effectively incorporate the CPRGS into their planning process. The trend will be institutionalized
through the issuance of an ordinance on planning. Triggers for PRSC 3 include demonstrated
progress in implementing CPRGS planning processesin one sector and at the provincial level.

116.     In parallel with the preparationof the new CPRGS chapter on large-scale infrastructure,
various ongoing studies to assess the growth and poverty alleviation impacts o f public investment
programs will be completed. These studies are currently being conducted by donors, including
the World Bank, and will inform the 2003 poverty assessment. They deal with a wide range o f
projects, from local infrastructure to highways to irrigation to health clinics. Based on the new
CPRGS chapter, and on the findings o f these impact evaluation studies, a comprehensive revision
o f the criteria used in the compilation of the PIP is scheduled to take place under subsequent
PRSCs. Policy and institutional reforms to support this process will include the consolidation of
the Treasury's new status as the lead agency responsible for maintenance o f treasury and budget
management information.       Reforms will also include the integration o f currently disparate
accounting systems, making them more consistent with international standards. The routine
disclosures of detailed, reliable public financial information including budget plans and budget
final accounts, are other key components of the process.

117.     Public financial management. By 2008, an effective, integrated Treasury and Budget
Management Information System (TABMIS) will be operational in all central, provincial and
district treasury offices. Modern budget planning approaches will have been established in MOF,
MPI, and four sector ministries. Strengthened approaches to the management of public debt will
have been adopted in core Government agencies, including integrated processes for recording o f
domestic and external debt and for analysis and management o f fiscal risk. A first step in this
direction was the adoption o f a revised Budget Law, making substantial progress in
decentralization and transparency, under PRSC 2.

118.     MOF will consolidate its status as the leading agency in budget preparation through the
development of better partnership arrangements with MPI, line ministries and provinces. MTEFs
will become part of each budget cycle, including economic classification and projections o f
expenditure aggregates by ministry or province. The establishment o f sector-level MTEFswill be
a vehicle for forward-looking expenditureplanning and policy management in line ministries and
provinces. A measure o f success will be the integration o f capital and recurrent expenditures,
leading to disaggregated expenditure plans which are consistent with the forward-looking fiscal
framework, and including a modest number of indicative performance goals consistent with the
CPRGS.




                                                35

119.     Tangible improvements on financial accountability in the public sector will also be part
of the PRSC process. They will include increased transparency of the budget process and off-
budget accounts, improved timeliness, reliability, consistency and accessibility of budget
information, greater independenceand improvedeffectiveness of the State Audit of Vietnam, and
increased public access to audit reports. These improvements will be further complemented by
the Government's Public Financial Management Reform Program, which is supported by the
World Bank and seven other donors.

120.     Under the PRSC process, there will also be a strengthened management of public debt.
MOF's legal mandate to manage all components of Vietnam's public debt will become
operational. Public debt management objectives and guidelines within Government will be
formalized, and reporting relationshipsbetween the different agencies that are involved in day-to-
day debt-related transactions will be clarified. An integrated debt-recording system will be set
up, whereas risk management systems and practiceswill be institutionalized. Under PRSC 2, a
mechanism for monitoring SOE liabilities is being set up, as these liabilities impact on the
indebtedness level ofthe country.

121.     Legal Development. The Legal System Development Strategy (LSDS) and its action
plans form the foundation for the reform program to be supported by the PRSC process. Actions
already adopted under PRSC 2 include the enactment of the law amendingand supplementingthe
Law on the Promulgation of Legal Documents, also known as "Law on Laws", and the Law on
the Organizationofthe People's Court.

122.     Under subsequent PRSCs, a law or ordinance mandating the publication of decisions,
judgments, opinions and guidelinesof the Supreme People's Court will be issued. Publication of
court decisions facilitates a consistent application of the law, makes the reasoning of the court
explicit, provides a transparent record for record review, and limits litigation of matters already
decided. A publication mandate is also expected for important and non-routine decisions of local
courts. Specific institutional arrangements, such as designating a resources departmentwithin the
Supreme People's Court to publish the information as well as ensuring regular feedback from the
local courts, will be essentialto makethis policy operational.

123.     The Regulation on the Exercise of Democracy in Communes, often termed the "Decree
on Grassroots Democracy" is a pilot initiative that defines a ground-breaking framework for
consultation, participation, and transparency on issues relating to socio-economic planning, and
cultural and political affairs at the commune level. However, the implementation of the pilot
decree has been held back by weak enforcement mechanisms. Under subsequent PRSCs, the
Ministry of Home Affairs is expected to scale up the coverage of the Decree on Grassroots
Democracy to all communes. To be effective, this initiative will have to be supplemented by
clearly designated responsibilities for implementation.

124.     The launchingof a Government Portal will be an additional step towards facilitating legal
information access for citizens.      The establishment of an on-line facility of this sort is
instrumentalfor successfully implementing the Law on the Promulgation of Legal Documents
and the law or ordinance mandating publication of all decisions, judgments, opinions and
guidelinesof the Supreme People's Court. The creation of an Office of the State Public Defender
will also contributeto the citizen's accessto legal information.

125.     Public administration reform. The program in this area builds on the strategic objectives
of the Public Administration Reform (PAR) Master Program 2001-2010. While no specific




                                                36

actions were adopted under PRSC 2, an ambitious policy agenda aims at making the civil service
more responsive, transparent, efficient and accountable.

126.     A first step in the implementation of this agenda will be the adoption of a time-bound
action plan for simplification o f administrative procedures. The One-Stop-Shop approach will
constitute the backbone of this plan. Specific measures will aim at establishing clear, accessible
and recognizable entry points for people in need of administrative services; increasing clarity on
fees, service regulation and procedures; improving the quality and effectiveness o f services; and
streamlining administrativeprocedures related to the provision o f administrative services.

 127.    Promulgating a procurement ordinance is also part o f the reform agenda.               The
introduction o f a procurement system with some competitive elements, in 1996, has already led to
increased efficiency. According to Government estimates, in 1999 savings from this procurement
system amounted to 14 of the pre-bid estimates. However, to accrue more substantive savings
and to curb corruption, new measures are needed. The new procurement ordinance to be
promulgated under subsequent PRSCs should include the following measures: ensure competitive
bidding as the main method for procurement; introduce mandatory publication o f procurement
announcements in a National Procurement Bulletin; introduce mandatory use o f standard bidding
documents, standard bid evaluation and standard contracts; define types o f violations of rules and
corresponding corrective measures; and reduce monetary thresholds for automatic use without a
justification for direct purchase of goods, appointment of contractors and selection o f consultants
without competition down to the values normally used in other countries.

 128.    The salaries o f public servants are low, despite some recent increases. However,
according to an estimate by the Ministry o f Home Affairs (MOHA) salaries represent only a third
to a half of the remuneration actually received by civil servants. Other forms of remuneration
include allowances (for housing, for instance) and various payments for services rendered.
Taking these other forms of remuneration into account, there is no firm basis for concluding that
civil servants are consistently underpaid, but there are grounds to assume that their pay bears little
relationship with their labor market alternatives. Under subsequentPRSCs, an action plan will be
adopted to gradually align civil service remuneration with the market, to monetize some o f the
allowances and to introduce performance-based incentives.

 129.    Corruption. While Vietnam has achieved a remarkable record in economic and social
development, corruption still exists. The move towards a more market-based economy requires a
strengthening of institutions and mechanisms for accountability. A diagnostic study on source o f
corruption in Vietnam is currently underway. The results o f this study will feed into the
amendment o f the Ordinance Against Corruption, scheduled to take place under subsequent
PRSCs.

 130.    Information. More reliable statistics should allow for better-quality monitoring of social
and economic targets, as specified in Government strategies and plans. Better statistics should
also lead to better analyses of these plans, in order to assess what works best in terms o f growth
and poverty reduction. Substantial progress has been accomplished under PRSC 2, with the
preparation and passage o f a National Statistical Law. This new law should lead to improved
data collection and reporting, and thus foster evidence-based policy making.

 131.    The development o f specific indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of CPRGS is
another important step in this direction. At present, a framework that clearly indicates the links
between policy actions and outcomes is missing. Under subsequent PRSCs, a Working Group on
Monitoringand Evaluationwill be set up to develop the correspondingaction plan. The resulting



                                                 37

information system must include indicators at the central, local and sectoral levels. It also needs
to meet high quality standards in terms o f both quantitative and qualitative information. In
Vietnam, this means going beyond administrative records, to make full use of census and
household survey data.

132.    Monitoring and evaluation o f the CPRGS involve consultation with researchers and the
civil society, including community-based organizations. To facilitate a wide participation of all
stakeholders in the monitoring and evaluation process, raw data from the 2002 and 2004
Household Living Standard Surveys will be made available to users.             Also, high-quality
enterprise surveys and censuses for which a strategy is currently under development will need to
be implemented, and the data made available while protecting the privacy o f the enterprises.
Increased public access to statistical data is covered under subsequent PRSCs.



E.      TimingandImplementation

133.    The expected sequence o f strategic plans, policy actions, and analytical work to be
undertaken in Vietnam over the next few years is summarized in Figure 1. This figure also
highlightsthe interplay between policy lendingand project lendingwhen the latter is key to move
forward the policy reform agenda. The PRSC process sees the expansion o f the agenda beyond
the narrower focus on structural reforms in PRSC 1. Policy actions supported by PRSC 2 and
subsequent PRSCs focus on cross-sectoral issues that underpin progress in many sectors.
Reforms in governance, in public finance, in land administration and in the availability o f and
access to information will all foster progress beyond any one sector and, as such, provide an
important complement to investment lendingwithin sectors.

134.    Lending under the PRSC process will be aligned with the budget cycle, with operations
taking place annually and disbursements occurring towards the middle o f the Vietnamese fiscal
year. From 2003 onwards, CPRGS Progress Reports will be discussed at the full CG Meetings,
in December of every year. The associated JSA is expected to follow up shortly after and
represent a key step in the preparation of the next PRSC operation. Jointly with the triggers,
which are discussed in Section VII, the JSA will serve as the basis to determine whether to
proceed with the preparation o f the following PRSC. The decision on whether to consider Low-
Case, Base-Caseor High-Case lending will also be informed by the JSA and the triggers.

135.    Because PRSC 2 is the first operation after the completion of CPRGS, its emphasis is
more on the adoption of implementation plans than on policies. CPRGS still needs to be
translated into concrete strategies, and this is what several of the prior actions for PRSC 2
actually do. It i s expected that PRSC 3 will be more focused on specific policies, while PRSC 4
and PRSC 5 will include an increasing number o f outcomes, as the process o f implementing the
first CPRGS comes close to an end.

                          VI.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS


136.     There are three areas where ex-ante poverty and social impact analysis of the reform
program supported through the PRSC process is most pressing. These areas concern the impacts
of trade liberalization, retrenchment as a result o f SOE reform, and coping with distress sales in
emerging land markets. Some analytical work has been carried out in all of these areas, but the
World Bank and partners will need to build on this work over the coming year if the assessment
of future policy options is to be fully informed. This section outlines the analyses carried out to
date and describes the work planned for the near future.

137.     Tradeliberalization. One commonly voiced concern is that trade liberalization may have
an adverse impact on rural households.          Exposure to world markets could lead to higher
variability in the price o f their products, hence affect their earnings. It must be noted, however,
that trade barriers usually protect the manufacturing sector, and penalize the agricultural sector,
so that liberalizationcould turn to the advantageo f rural households. Rice provides an interesting
example. From 1993 to 1998, the average domestic price o f rice increased 29 percent relative to
the consumer price index. Part o f this increase stemmed from the relaxation o f a rice export
quota. A recent study found large reductions in child labor associated with this increase in the
price o f rice. In the context of this study, child labor was defined as doing household chores for
seven or more hours per week, or working in agriculture, wage employment, a family business or
as a domestic servant for one or more hours per week. The study estimated that rice price
increasesalone accounted for almost half of the decline in child labor that occurred in Vietnam in
the 1990s. The extra household income from higher rice prices particularly benefited older girls,
who experienced the largest declines in child labor and the largest increasesin school enrollment.

138.        The World Bank has also carried out a study with an international economic research
institute to assess the effects o f the recently-adopted trade reforms, using a computable general
equilibrium modeling approach. According to this study, trade liberalization should increase
employment, incomes and consumption of all income groups. On average, the increases in labor
for expanding sectors compensate for the contractions in the highly protected, import competing
sectors. This study alone, though reassuring in its conclusions, is not sufficient to inform the
future trade reform agenda as Vietnam moves towards WTO accession. The World Bank has
established a relationship with the National Center for Social Sciences and Humanities in seeking
to inform top policymakers on issues associated with WTO accession. It i s expected that the
process, which started with a workshop for policymakers in May, will evolve to encompass the
necessarytrade-related work on poverty and social impacts. This will involve an analysis o f the
impacts on different subgroups of the population, including differences based on age, location,
sex and ethnicity.

139.        An assessment of the poverty and social impacts o f WTO accession which is currently
under preparation includes a combination o f analyses at three levels. At the highest level o f
aggregation, a computable general equilibrium model will be used to predict the changes in the
prices of goods and services that would result from further integration with the world economy.
At an intermediate level, "regional" models will be usedto determine the resulting change inthe
prices of factors o f production which are not mobile across regions, including unskilled labor and
land. At the lowest level, the estimated changes in the prices o f goods and factors o f production
will allow to estimate the impact on consumption at the household level. Introducing the
intermediate level is key to capture the regional heterogeneity o f impacts. In Vietnam, it can be



                                                  40

expected that the regions of HCMC and Hanoi will benefitthe most from WTO accession, while
poverty alleviation impacts in mountainous areas could be more modest.

140.       The reform of state-owned enterprises is an area where identifying "losers" is relatively
uncomplicated.     If these enterprises were to operate as profit-maximizing units, they would
employ a much smaller number o f workers. According to a study based on enterprise-level data
across sectors, as much as half o f the SOE workforce could be redundant, although the fraction
could be negligible in sectors such as garments, or footwear, and much higher in coal mining or
transportation. The restructuring o f SOEs does not imply that halfo f their workforce will become
redundant. Workers will gain control of many of them, implying that employment will remain
one o f their objectives, alongside with profits.       Moreover, a considerable portion of the
redundancies can be handled through natural attrition and early retirement. But the number o fjob
losses could still be considerable.

141.      An assistance fund to support SOE workers made redundant because of the reform
program was established in the context of PRSC 1. The fund gets its resources from the
Government budget and from concessional external resources provided by donors. It became
fully operational inOctober 2002, after the corresponding regulations were issued.

142.       The fund is intended to assist redundant workers who were on long-term contracts
when the restructuring o f SOEs was launched in 1998.            Assistance takes the form o f a
compensation package and support for re-training. In order to mitigate the adverse impact on the
workers and to encourage voluntary separations, the package is substantially more generous than
the one stipulated by the Labor Code. The obligations o f SOEs towards their workers are not
modified. But the fund provides additional support amounting to one month o f basic salary per
year of service, a lump sum o f 5 million Dong, and an additional six months of basic salary to
supportjob search and re-training efforts.

143.       This package was designed based on an analysis o f the earnings o f workers who are
"similar" (in age, skills, region o f residence etc.) to those in SOEs, except that they are self-
employed, or work in the private sector. The lump-sum component, in particular, was aimed at
favoring female workers, who tend would otherwise get much smaller packages than males
because of their lower salaries. Workers who are rehired by SOEs have to reimburse the
assistancethey received to the fund. The fund also assists workers who opt for early retirement.
The assistance package does not vary depending on whether the SOE is equitized, sold or
liquidated. It is also available for redundant workers in SOEs that remain in state hands, provided
that these enterprises are included in the restructuring list under the Government's reform
program. The fund can also be used to assist workers who become redundant during the first 12
months following equitization.        This is to encourage private sector participation in the
equitization process, even inthe case o f heavily over-staffed enterprises.

144.      Numerous SOEs have applied for support from the fund within the first few months of
its operation, and thousands o f workers have been assisted since then. The average redundancy
rate among the SOEs which applied i s 25 percent. But it varies considerably across enterprises.
A tracer survey o f separated workers is about to be launched. The goal o f this survey is to assess
their situation as aresult ofjob loss and to evaluate the adequacy of the assistanceprovided.

145.      Distress sales of land-use rights.    The distribution o f land to rural households was
remarkably equalitarian in Vietnam. Access to land is only weakly correlated to the household
attributes which are usually associated with higher consumption, such as education.             The
development of a land market will probably increase this correlation. As a result, land ownership



                                                 41

could become gradually more concentrated in the hands o f wealthier households. This process
can be exacerbated by environmental shocks, such as floods, typhoons and prolonged droughts.
At the same time, it is recognized that rural poverty reductionrequires the expansion of non-farm
employment. And this expansion would be slow in the absence of properly functioning land
markets.

146.      Land market liberalization must therefore be accompanied by measures that redress
inequalities and protect the vulnerable. One important concern is to mitigate the effects of
distress sales, which may result in landlessness. The general perception is that the number o f
rural households with no or little land has increased, particularly in the Mekong delta. According
to the General Statistics Office, 37 percent o f rural households in this area had less than 0.2
hectares o f cultivable land, compared to 28 percent in 1994. A lower figure is reported by a
recent study, which estimates the fraction of rural households with less than 0.2 hectares at 8.7
percent as o f 1997. The study also found that one third of landlessness cases was caused by land
sales or mortgage losses. Other reasons for landlessnesswere households dividing (21 percent o f
the cases) and inheritedlandlessness(27 percent).

147.      So far, initiatives to counteract distress sales have been taken mainly at local level.
They include measures as diverse as the provision o f loans to redeem land, support for land
reclamation, restrictions on mortgage and sale o f agricultural land, the promotion of off-farm
employment, tax exemptions, and the provision o f transfers and subsidized social services.

148.      National policy options that mitigate adverse consequences of land market
liberalization arejust beginning to be discussed and piloted in Vietnam. Insurance schemes, land
purchase programs by the Government, progressive land taxation, and disaster mitigation are
among the options considered. But the effectiveness of these tools remains under-researched. In
the CPRGS the Government proposes new measures to reduce vulnerability, related to building
the assets o f poor households and increasing their ability to manage risk. Two of the measures
proposed are improved access to agricultural extension, to help diversify farm incomes, and
improved access to affordable health care. Additional measures such as enhancing access to
savings facilities, would also be essential.

149.      The poverty assessment currently being conducted in Vietnam will deal with land
issues, among others.      Analytical efforts will be based on the new, more comprehensive
household survey completed in 2002. This household survey allows an analysis of legal land
entitlements to be broken down by sex, so gender dimensions o f changes in access to land can be
explored.   Analysis will also involve participatory poverty assessments in various regions,
including the Mekong Delta, where anecdotal evidence suggests that distress sales of land are
becoming increasingly common. Information from this assessment should be incorporated in the
design of policy actions under subsequent PRSCs. A survey is also underway to assess whether
access to credit is more prevalent among households who have LUCs, other things equal.




150.    Triggers ensure that the program objectives are being met as the program progresses in
time. They are focused on well-defined milestones, policy actions or indicators which regulate
the move from one PRSC to the next. Triggers help the World Bank and the Government
anticipate critical next steps in the relevant areas of reform. They provide benchmarks against

which to objectively evaluate progress on reforms and the readiness to move forward with the
next operation. Triggers for PRSC 3 are summarized in Table 7.

151.      The triggers for PRSC 3 cover key developments related to the three pillars of CPRGS:
completing the transition to market economy, making development inclusive, and building
modern governance. Only triggers that are critical to the Bank's decision to move forward with
the next operation were considered. With one exception, all of the triggers are directly linked to


                                                43

Government actions, reflecting progress in the implementation of the reform agenda.               The
exception refers to private sector development, where an outcome indicator is considered. Focus
on development outcomes is warranted in this case, for two reasons. First, private sector
development is the combined outcome of actions in many policy areas, from trade liberalization
to financial sector reform to the emergence o f a land market. It would be difficult to focus on one
or a few policy actions which could signal, on their own, significant progress in the private sector
development agenda. Second, the experience of Vietnam, and especially the different pace of
enterprise registration across provinces, suggests that implementation is becoming more
important than the regulatory framework itself.

152.     It is recognized that some of the monitorable indicators listed in Table 7 may not be
attained due to reasons that are beyond the Government's control. To take this possibility into
account, triggers are formulated in a prudent manner, allowing some room for unexpected shocks
or developments.      By December, 2003, when the Government presents its CPRGS Progress
Report to the CG meeting, not all the triggers may have beenmet. However, progress on most of
the indicators considered, and no backtracking on any o f them, will be required to start the
preparation o f the next PRSC. Consistent progress across all indicators would prompt the
considerationo fthe High-Case scenario for PRSC 3.

153.     Policy actions supported by the proposed credit are summarized in Table 8, which
compiles the contents of the "PRSC 2" columns in Tables 3, 5 and 6. This sub-section provides a
more detailed description of the nature and implications of each o f those actions.

154.     Implement CEPT/AFTA obligations. The most important action in this context i s the
Decree on Implementation of the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT). As a result o f
this decree, tariff items within the Temporary Exclusion List (TEL) will be transferred to the
Inclusion List (IL). Also, under this Decree tariffs on all IL items will be lowered to 20 percent at
most.     In the meantime, a custom valuation based on the ASEAN Harmonized Tariff
Nomenclature will be applied for ASEAN imports. The tariff level will be continuously reduced
in subsequent years, as committed under the CEPT Decree, with the ultimate target beinga range
o f 0 to 5 percent in 2006, down from an un-weighted average o f 10.7 percent in 2002.

155.     Eliminate QRs. Vietnam has been gradually phasing out its QRs on a multilateral basis.
Many QRs removal has been done within PRSC 1 as indicated above. QRs for petroleum
products and sugar should be removed in subsequent PRSCs. QRs for all tariff lines for cement
and clinker, remaining kinds o f steel, construction glass, floor tiles, paper, vegetable oil and tiles
have been removed within the PRSC 2 time frame.

156.     Issue key legal documentsfor integration with the world economy. Regulations for Most
FavoredNation (MFN) and National Treatment (NT), and Safeguard Measures for imports were
issued in October 2002.

157.      Make available detailed plans for SOE reform.            Detailed plans to transform the
ownership o f roughly two thousand SOEs were completed under PRSC 2. These plans were
drawn by line ministries, provincial Governments and General Corporations based on Decision
58, which classifies all sectors o f activity based on the rationale for state intervention in them, as
well as on their strategic nature. SOEs in sectors where state intervention is notjustified are to be
divested, sold or liquidated over the period of 2003-2005. Unlike previous blueprints for SOE
reform, the new reform plans identify the SOEs to be divested by name, and indicate a specific
year for the ownership transformation to be carried out. The plan also indicates the relevant
supervisory authority, the charter capital, number o f employees and level o f debt. The medium
selected for the publication will be one accessibleto all stakeholders including SOE management
and potential bidders.

158.      An important issue refers to the implementation of the SOE reform plans. Previous
slippages suggest that overcoming the resistance from vested interests, and the difficulties created
by a cumbersome procedure, may be too difficult. To address these issues, Instruction 01 allows
the dismissed of the SOE directors who fail to comply with the reform plans.

159.      Providefinancial information on SOEs. Despite their scope, the SOE reform plans will
still leave roughly three thousand enterprises in state hands. Having a timely monitoring system
o f their financial situation, leadingto a correct assessment of the fiscal risks involved, is essential.
Decision 167, issued in 2000, and the subsequent circular 89, issued in 2002, support full
financial disclosure for the last completed accounting period by all SOEs, on an annual basis.
This information, to be provided to the authorized financial agencies includes Profit and Loss
Accounts (indicating profits pre tax, tax liabilities, interest payments made and retained profits)
and Balance Sheets (indicating fixed assets, debtors, inventory, cash in hand, creditors, long term
debt and equity).

160.      The current mechanism to monitor the financial situation o f SOEs is ineffective. Few
SOEs are actually compliant with the reporting obligations established by Decision 167, jointly
with Circular 89 on applicable accounting standards. While fines are in principle applicable to
SOEs which are not current, they do not appear to provide the required incentive. A recently
drafted Decision on SOE Performance Evaluation and Monitoring indirectly leads to
administrative sanctions for lack o f compliance. The draft authorizes the separation of directors
o f SOEs displaying consistently poor performance. The latter is assessed based on a series of
indicators, including the timely reporting o f financial statements to authorized financial agencies.
It is expected that SOEs will be classified inthree categories: A, B and C, with sanctions foreseen
for the directors o f enterprises falling inthe third one.

161.      Establish central DATC. More determined action is requiredto address the outstanding
NPLs o f SOEs. The establishment o f a central DATC is a step in that direction. In order to
minimize fiscal risks and not to undermine the NPL resolution efforts o f the SOCBs, the scope o f
operations of this central DATC will be primarily on inter-enterprise debts and non-performing
bank loans for which the Government has assumed full responsibility.                Links between the
activities o f this DATC and the operational and financial restructuring of the concerned SOEs
needto be firmly established.

162.      Inthe absence of strong powers givento DATC, its operationneeds to be tested on a pilot
basis. Under PRSC 2, MOF will develop a plan regarding the SOEs to be covered by the DATC
and the pricing o f their debts. It i s recommended that 20 SOEs be selected for the pilot, among
those with total debts o f more than VND 10 billion. Their debts would need to be classified

accordingto their creditors and terms, and the appropriate methodologyto deal with each type of
debt should be identified.

163.     Plan to resolve unsecured NPLs by SOCBs. A separate approach to deal with the bad
debts of SOEs is based on Instruction 04 from SBV to the four largest SOCBs, dated January 2,
2003. This instruction refers to the implementationof MOF Circular 74/2002/TT-BTC, regarding
the resolution of NPLs of 20 SOEs heavily indebted SOEs by each of four largest SOCBs.
According to the instruction, documentation for resolutionof five SOEs will be submittedto SBV
on the last day of the second month of each quarter of 2003. Any delay to this plan shall be
promptly advisedto SBV and MOF.

164.      Subsequent stages in this process foresee the development of broader guidelines to deal
with unsecuredNPLs. SBV has already formulated recommendations to revise Circular 74 in
order to strengthen the creditor's rights of SOCBs in the re-evaluation and resolution of NPLs.
These recommendations also include the establishment of a link between NPL resolution and
ownershiptransformationas instructed inthe SOE reform plans.

165.      Complete key periodical milestones of restructuring plans of four largest SOCBs. The
SOCBs have identified their provisioning needs based on IAS audits for the year 2000. With
approval from SBV, they have planned to complete the 2002 loan-loss provisioning targets
establishedinthe respectiverestructuring plan approvedby SBV. Those targets are basedon the
IAS audits completed for 2000.        Similarly, each SOCB is expected to meet its target for
resolution ofNPLs, inaccordance with the respectiverestructuringplan.

166.      In parallel, the IAS audits of the SOCBs will be institutionalized. Contracts have been
signed for the completion of the 2001 audits of the Bank for Investment and Development of
Vietnam (BIDV) and Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), to be
undertaken by reputable international auditors.         There is also agreement on the audit
qualifications from the year 2001 audits that are to be eliminated by the end of 2003.          A
timetable for each SOCB to prepare and adopt their respective credit manuals has also been
agreed uponwith the SBV.

167.      Develop an action plan for private sector development. The Resolution of the 5th
Plenum of the IX Congress of the Party Central Committee provided a break-through high-level
policy endorsement in support of private sector development. The Action Plan based on this
Resolution (Decision 94, July 2002) specified Government policies to support the private sector
inthe areas ofbusiness entry/environment, land, finance andcredit, labor, technology and science
and trade and investment. Importantly, the Action Plan also identified the responsible ministry
and timetable for implementation of the numerousactions detailed inthe Plan.

168.      Intens& the implementation of the Enterprise Law. The enactmentof the EnterpriseLaw
is widely credited as providing a major stimulus to private sector development through
facilitating firm entry. Directive 17/TTg, issued in August 2002, provides specific instructionsto
MPI and Peoples Committees of the provinces and centrally-run cities on actions to improve the
implementationof the Enterprise Law and firm entry in general. Among other things, provincial
and municipal planning and investment services are requested to immediately abolish the
regulationson business registration procedureswhich are contrary to the provisions of Enterprise
Law. The Directive also instructs MPI, in coordination with others, to draft a decree announcing
the list ofvalid permits.




                                                47

169.    Adopt the Education for All fiamework.           The National Education for All (EFA)
framework constitutes a strategic framework for the long-term education development of the four
target groups: early childhood care and education, primary education, lower secondary education,
and non-formal education. The EFA framework lays out the educational objectives and targets to
be reached by 2015, the action programs that need to be implemented in order to reach the
objectives and targets and the assessment of resource requirements and resource gaps. One of
the main thrusts of the EFA framework for period 2002 2015 is completing primary and lower
                                                          -
secondary universal education at the international standards. The EFA framework also aims at
moving from quantitative to qualitative achievements, providing life-long learning opportunities,
mobilizing full community participation (All for Education), and ensuring effective management
and better resource mobilization.      The EFA document has been finalized and MOET has
submittedthe document to the Prime Minister for approval and adoption.

170.     Establish a health-carefundfor thepoor, Decision 139, issued bythe Prime Ministeron
October 15, 2002, createsthe HCFP to finance out-of-pocket costs o f eligible individuals who use
publicly provided health services.      The HCFP is to receive funding sufficient initially to
reimburse outlays of VND 70,000 per poor beneficiary per year, with 75 percent of this amount
financed via publicly allocated resources and the remaining 25 percent covered through
community and individual contributions.

171.     Issue land-use certlficates (LUCs). In the past decade, the allocation o f land-use right
certificates has been slow in urban and upland/ forest areas.         More recently, however, the
Government reports that it has made faster progress. The latest reliable figures indicate that 35
percent o f land users in urban areas and 60 percent of the total number of households usingforest
land now have LUCs. Most recent announcements by Government officials suggest that the
allocation of LUCs might be even more widespread than this.

 172.    Establish a national CPRGSSteering Committee. In September 2002, the Prime Minister
issued Decree No.825/QD-TTg, which established a National Steering Committee (NSC) to
implementthe CPRGS and PRSC/PRGF. The Committee is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung. A DeputyGovernor of State Bank o f Vietnam i s Standing Vice Chairman o f
the Committee in charge of PRSC/PRGF, while a Vice Minister o f MPI is in charge of the
CPRGS. The NSC's members include ministerial level representatives from 14 related ministries
and 6 Government agencies. An Inter-ministerial Working Group for implementing the CPRGS
has been established which consists of senior representatives from relevant ministries and
Government agencies to support the NSC in conducting the task.             This Working Group is
coordinated and chaired by MPI.

 173.    Revise the Budget Law with progress on decentralization and transparency. As part o f
the Government's program o f public financial management reform, in December 2002, the
National Assembly approved the Revised Law on State Budget, which will be effective starting
from fiscal year 2004. This law clearly delineates the roles o f the National Assembly and the
Provincial People's Councils in budget approval.         Henceforth, the National Assembly will
approve the aggregate amount of state budget and appropriations to central ministries leaving to
the Provincial People's Councils the powers to decide on appropriations to sub-national
jurisdictions. The Provincial People's Councils are empowered to make specific revenue and
expenditure assignments among their subordinate jurisdictions as well as to set certain non-tax
revenues and issue certain expenditure policies. In addition, sub-national Governments will have
access to additional sources of revenue, raising their share in total revenue from the current level
o f 29 percent to 35 percent.




                                                48

174.     The new Law assignsthe Treasury Department as the lead agency responsible for budget
execution and for Government financial management information.             The budget execution
processes will be streamlined though elimination of duplicative and low-value added steps in the
budget formulation and allotment processes. As part of implementation o f the Law, a major
effort is underway to simplify and strengthen financial management and reporting requirements.
A unified Chart of Accounts is being devised to bringtogether the currently separate accounting
systems o f the State Treasury Department, the State BudgetDepartment and the spending units.

175.     The new Law enshrines transparency principles in financial management by requiring
that the budget appropriations and allocations, final accounts and audit results o f the state budget
and the budget o f all sub-national levels o f Government have to be made public. Furthermore, all
processes and procedures for revenue collection, tax reduction and exemption as well as for
budget execution and payment, have to be posted at the place where these transactions occur.
Under the new Law, the budget execution processes will be streamlined though abolishment o f
mostly duplicative quarterly budget ceiling allotment, thus reducing red tape and containing the
risko fcorruption.

176.     Lastly, regarding legislative oversight, a legal mandate has been established for the State
Audit of Vietnam to report their audit results to the Standing Committee of the National
Assembly on a routine basis, as opposed to on request as was the practice up to now. This makes
it possible for SAV to later operate outside the executive branch of the Government and report
directly to the National Assembly.

177.     Publish legal documents in the Official Gazette. Until recently, legal dissemination had
not been seen as an integral part o f the law making and implementation process, thus hampering
transparency and predictability. The Law on Amendments o f and Additions to a Number o f
Articles o f the Law on Promulgation of Legal Instruments, also know as "Law on Laws",
imposes greater legal transparency and i s one o f the key legal reform measures outlined in the
CPRGS. This Law requires the publication in the Official Gazette o f legal documents issued by
the Government, Prime Minister, line ministers, head of ministerial-level agencies, Supreme
People's Court and Supreme People's Procuracy, as a condition o f their effectiveness.

178.     Put local courts under Supreme Court management.                An Enactment of Law
06/2002/L/CTN on the Organization o f the People's Courts, transferred the management o f the
local courts from the Ministry o f Justice to the Supreme People's Court.               Moving the
responsibility on courts at the provincial and district from the executive branch of the
Government to the Supreme People's Court should enhance the independence o f the judiciary
system as a whole.

179.     Establish a legal pamework for data quality, transparency and availability. With the
adoption o f the CPRGS, the Government of Vietnam has made an important move towards more
evidence-based policy making. To further strengthen this move, statistical information needs to
be treated as public good. Between now and 2006, a strong legal framework and action plans for
the collection and dissemination o f social, economic and environmental statistics will be put in
place. The Law o f Statistics, passed in May 2003, representsa key step inthis direction.

180.     A strategy for producing high quality household living standard surveys on a bi-annual
basis has already been adopted.       The General Statistics Office (GSO) is working towards
designing similar strategies for enterprise surveys and other instruments for data collection. The
GSO Strategic Plan 2001-2010 provides a good basis for change. Its goal is to support high-
quality monitoring o f Government outcome targets as specified in Government strategies and



                                                  49

  plans, and also allow for high quality assessments of the effectiveness of these plans. Data-based
  evaluation should be conducive to further improve policies and spendingplans over time.

  181.      Environment and natural resource management.               The National Strategy for
  Environmental Protection, 2001-2010, resulted from a prolonged and comprehensive consultation
  process amongst Government line ministries, all 61 provinces and other stakeholder groups. It is
  anticipated that the strategy will provide an important framework for planning and
  implementation of environmental protection.      In particular, the strategy seeks to mainstream
  environmental considerations into sector planning and implementation, by defining clear tasks
  and responsibilitiesfor line ministriesand other Government bodies.



  B.      ImplementationandMonitoring

  182.    Recognizing the importance o f the CPRGS/PRSCs as one o f key instruments that
  supports medium-term policy and institutional reforms in Vietnam in cross-sector areas, and the
  creation of a strong link between reforms as principal vehicle o f growth and poverty reduction in
  Vietnam, the Vietnamese Government established NSC to implement the CPRGS and
  PRSC/PRGF according to Decision o f the Prime MinisterNo. 825/QD-TTg in September 2002.
  The NSC is chaired by the first Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dungand consists o f several
  heads of 20 relevant line ministries. SBV is assigned as the agency responsible, in close
  collaboration with the World Bank and IMF, for preparation and implementation of
  PRSCs/PRGFs. Under leadership of a Deputy Governor of State Bank o f Vietnam who acts as
  Standing Vice Chairman of NSC, an expanded Secretariat has been formed. This quasi-advisory
  body i s based on the PRSC 1 Secretariat with several former PRSC 1 representatives from key
  economic ministries, such as MOF, MOT, SBV, Office of the Government (OOG), Party's
' Economic Commission (PEC), The Ministry o f Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA)
  etc., and a number o f extended members from Ministry o f Justice (MOJ), MARD, MOTE, etc.,
  representing new policy reform areas under PRSC 2 and subsequent PRSCs.

  183.    Given the complex coordination nature o f such comprehensive reform program, SBV
  plansto create a Program Coordination Unit (PCU) as a program executive agency with dedicated
  staff from SBV. This unit will deal on a regular basis with the program agenda, from reform
  designing, monitoring, and reporting types of work to reform awareness raising, capacity building
  and reform outcome dissemination etc. ,and interaction on daily basis with the World Bank, IMF
  and donor communities as far as PRSCs issues are concerned. Thus, any technical assistance in
  helping PCU operation will be essential for successful PRSC coordination and implementation.

  184.      A secretariat to implement and monitor the CPRGS has also been established at MPI.
  Among its goals is the implementation o f CPRGS at sub-national levels. During the period
  covered by the proposed program, medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF) will be
  developed for a series o f key sectors (education, rural, health and transport).       The CPRGS
  Secretariat at MPI also supports provincial Governments in adapting the CPRGS to their own
  context, and reformulating plans and budgets accordingly. Efforts to implement CPRGS rely on
  the development of appropriate monitoring indicators as well.          Gradually, the number o f
  indicators has been narrowed to around forty, roughly one hundred less than when the process
  started. Many o f the indicators in this narrower set will be generated using the new household
  living standardsurveys to be conducted bi-annually from 2002 onwards.

  185.    Monitoring Arrangements. Vietnam continues to make good use o f information and
  analysis in its policy making and the development o f individual components of the PRSC


                                                  50

program. The formulation of the recent Ten-Year Strategy bears testimony to that fact. The
PRSC 2 will continueto buildon this experience, streamliningthe numerous ongoingmonitoring
and evaluation initiatives. Key sources of monitoring information for poverty and program
outcomes will include the proposed biannual household living standard survey, periodic
participatory poverty assessments, the small business registration survey, public expenditure
tracking survey, as well as the quarterly progress reports from the relevant sector ministries and
committees implementingthe reform program. In addition, the strengthening of management
informationsystems for SOEs and for all public spending, both ledby MOF, is an integralpart of
the PRSCprogram.



C.      CreditAdministration

186.    Borrower and Credit Amount. The Borrower is the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and
this operation is a one-tranche Credit of US$lOO million equivalentthat wouldbe madeavailable
uponcredit effectiveness.

187.    Disbursement, Reporting and Auditing Arrangements. The Credit will follow IDA'S
disbursement procedures for adjustment operations, and the Credit proceeds will be disbursed in
compliancewith the stipulated release conditions. Various measures have been taken to ensure
that the overall fiduciary policiesand institutionsare adequateto proceedwith support from IDA
and other development partners. The ESW underpinnings for the operation are largelycomplete:
(i) cross-cuttingassessmentofthecountry'sdevelopmentpolicies(social,structuralandkey
   the
sectoral) covering the policy reforms and institutional development priorities for sustainable
growth and poverty reduction has been discussed with the Government in a number of recent
joint reports; (ii)an assessment of the country financial accountability arrangements has been
made in the Public ExpenditureReview(PER), the Country FinancialAccountabilityAssessment
(CFAA) and the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR). Disbursement will not be
linkedto any specific purchasesandthat no procurementrequirementswill haveto be satisfied.

188.    Deposit Account. The Borrower will open and maintain in SBV a dedicated Deposit
Account in U S dollars for the Borrower's use once the Credit is approved by the Board. Ifafter
deposit in the Deposit Account the proceeds of the Credit or any part thereof are used for
ineligible purposes, as defined in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the Bank will
requirethe Borrower to either returnthat amount to the Deposit Account to be used for eligible
purposes, or refund the amount directly to IDA.          The Deposit Account of SBV will be
independently auditeduponrequeston terms ofreference to be agreedwith IDA.

189.    All U S dollar disbursements from the Deposit Account will be executed by SBV in
accordance with its existing rules and should be monitorable by the World Bank. Since SBV
does not import directly, it will sell this foreign currencyto commercialbanks that will execute
the imports. These banks, in turn, would open separate deposit accounts from which they will
finance the eligible importsandmaintainthose accountsfor review by SBV.

190.    Through SBV, the Borrower will (1) report the exact sum received into the Deposit
Account; (ii) insurethat all withdrawalare for "eligible" expenditures; (ii)indicateto IDA details
of the Treasury account to which the Vietnamese Dongequivalentof the Credit proceeds will be
credited; (iv) submit a report on receipts anddisbursementsfor the DepositAccount.




                                                 51

191.     The processes and controls described above are intended to provide assurance that IDA
funds have arrived at their intended destinationand are being used for their intendedpurposes,
and are subject to the Borrower'srulesandregulations.

192.     Country Financial Accountability Assessment. The CFAA on Vietnam, conducted in
partnership with the Asian Development Bank (completed in 2002) concluded that the public
financial management system compares well with other countries, but nevertheless represents a
level of fiduciary risk. The Government has agreed with the main recommendations of the
Bank's CFAA - includingthe provisionof more timely information for closer monitoring and
capacity-buildingfor strengtheninginstitutionalaccountability- and an actionplanwas prepared
by the CFAA report which complements the one by the PER. The Government will implement
the action plan under the proposed IDA project on public financial management system. In
addition, an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant is supporting capacity building in
accountingand auditing,buildingupon a programof support financed by the EuropeanUnion.

193.     Public Procurement. Vietnam's public procurement system underwent rapid changes
recently. Nationwidecompetitivebiddingwas introducedby a Government decree in 1996. This
system was improved in 1999, by the introduction of the concept of the "responsive lowest
evaluated bid". A Procurement Ordinance, designed with the Bank's IDF grant, is being
introduced,bringingVietnam closer to internationalstandards. The Governmenthas indicatedits
strong concern about corruption. The CPAR is completed and lays out the needs for capacity
buildingover the comingyears in publicprocurement.

194.     Environmental Issues. The proposedPRSC 2 is a structuraladjustment credit in support
of a collection of diverse reform and policy activities and the requirements of OD 8.60 apply.
Initiatives in private sector reform, SOE reform, trade liberalization, and public sector
management have potential implications for environmental quality as well as Government's
capacityto address futureenvironmentalrisks.

195.     The Government has developed a regulatory framework for environmental assessment,
standards and compliance monitoringwith the overallresponsibilitynow under the newly created
Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. But additional work is still needed to
improvethis framework and to strengthen implementationcapacity of the Ministry. Though its
present field level capacity is limited, the Government of Vietnam appears committed to
undertaking a substantive program of environmental capacity building, institutional
strengthening, environmental and land use planning as well as physical investment projects
addressing environmental issues. Donor support for national environmentalprograms is strong
and coversa diverse rangeof initiativesacross many sectors.


D.       Benefitsand Risks

 196.     As one o f the building blocks for the comprehensive structural reform agenda
elaborated in the CPRGS, this operationwould provide further support to Vietnam's policy and
institutional reforms to maintain high growth and poverty reduction. It will promote greater
internal and external competition and reduce waste in all enterprises, especially SOEs. It will
improvetransparency andaccountabilityin SOE operations and inthe bankingsector. Itwill also
contribute to the development of effective guidelines to deal with NPLs, thus reducing fiscal
risks. Overall, the increasedefficiency should be reflectedin increased investmentand exports,
especiallyfrom the privatesector. This economic expansion should be associatedwith additional
job creation, thus providingemployment opportunitiesfor the poor.



                                              52

197.      The proposed credit will also promote human development through improved access by
poor people to education and health care, and more secure asset ownership in the form o f land
titles. PRSC 2 addresses some o f the key challenges facing Vietnam in the attainment o f the
health and educationMDGs. Analytical work carried out as part of the preparation o f the CPRGS
showed the importance of addressing inequalities in health and education outcomes across
regions and population groups. The actions undertaken in PRSC 2 and proposed in the roadmap
for future reforms tackle an underlyingproblem o f resource allocation mechanisms in the social
sectors to ensure a stronger pro-poor focus. Actions taken to intensify land titling are designedto
build formal ownership of the assets o f groups that have so far benefited less from development,
such as ethnic minorities and upland communities. Actions are also designed to realize equal
rightsto land ownership by women.

198.      The proposed credit will increase transparency and accountability o f public finances
and improve legal transparency and accessibility, thus laying the foundations for a state ruled by
law. Lack o f transparency undermines effective resource allocation and service delivery at
national and local levels o f Government. Actions included in PRSC 2 complement activities in
the Public Financial Management Reform project and address a number of gaps in the original
Budget Law. Later actions support fuller accountability inthe planning and budget process at the
lowest level o f the administration, the commune.       In addition, important legal reforms are
recognized in the PRSC 2 operations, supporting the Government in the implementation o f their
comprehensive and ambitious legal reform agenda.

199.       Some o f the most important risks accompanying the proposed credit relate to slippage,
especially in the area of public sector reform, due to resistance from losers of reform. There is
always a possibility that political support might erode, or momentum might slow, as
implementation proceeds. This is particularly so when benefits from the reform program are
shared unequally, or when certain groups bear disproportionate costs. The agenda for poverty
and social impact assessments set out in this document should allow the Government to consult
with key stakeholders and to assess the trade-offs implied by the reform agenda in an informed
manner. The effectiveness o f the safety net for displaced SOE workers will be examined through
studies that track those who have been laid off.

200.      The reform costs could also be higher than estimated if SOE reform proceeds at a
slower pace, or if new lending goes into unviable projects. There could be a significant increase
inthe costs ofre-capitalizationof SOCBs ifthe actual pace of reform slows down or if lendingis
not more prudential. The current estimates of the fiscal costs o f banking reform and SOE reform
will be updated later this year based on the new IAS audits and better loan-loss provisioning
practices of the SOCBs. Earlier estimates o f the cumulative total fiscal costs o f reform are
projectedto be 12 percent of GDP. This estimate comprises the costs o f absorbing and resolving
non-performing loans o f SOEs, and severance payments to workers that become redundant under
SOE reform. Also included are the costs related to provisioning for NPLs in the SOCBs,
restructuring o f joint-stock banks, and raising the capital-asset ratios to international standards.
Continued progress in procedures to resolve NPLs and to improve the regulatory framework for
policy lendingare a fundamental step towards reducing this secondrisk.

201.      Finally, there is a fiduciary risk associated with the proposed credit, if inadequate
progress is made with budget transparency and tackling corruption.            There is undoubtedly
commitment at the highest level to tackle corruption, and a number o f high-profile cases have
been described inthe local media. Ingeneral, however, coordinated and concerted action has not
taken place. There have been delays in implementing a diagnostic survey o f corruption which
undermines a more coherent approach to attacking corruption.            Improvements in fiduciary



                                                53

controls and fiscal transparency are also fundamental for some bilateral donors, in allowingthem
to support to future PRSC operations. Actions in PRSC 2 and in future operations are intended to
address exactly these issues.

202.      Policy risks are mitigated by an expanded program o f AAA work, undertaken jointly
with Government and other donors. This work, and accompanying technical assistance in key
areas, will ensure that the underlying analytics for the PRSC program are well understood and
articulated. The monitoring framework for the CPRGS provides an opportunity for these results
to be shared transparently with donors and civil society groups, and for any issues or slippages to
be brought to the attention of senior policymakers in a timely fashion. Ifthe implementation of
reforms is impaired, or outcome indicators prove to be unsatisfactory, the program for future
years would need to be readjusted.



           Ix.      COORDINATIONWITH DONORS STAKEHOLDERS     AND


A.       TheIMF

203.     The World Bank has a wide-ranging policy dialogue in Vietnam, covering traditional
areas such as poverty reduction, fiscal and structural reforms, and gradually extending to areas
such as social inclusion, governance and public administration reform.

204.     In the areas of fiscal and structural reform the IMF and the World Bank have been
conducting tripartite meetings with the Government since April 1998. Under the framework o f
enhanced collaboration, the two institutions have done joint reports, launched numerous parallel
missions, and conducted tripartite discussions on policy with the Government. A single voice
approach has been taken on many issues. The Bank has led the policy dialogue on structural and
institutional reforms in a number of sectors, including measures to: (i)improve the efficiency,
equity, and transparency o f public spending; (ii)restructure or divest SOEs; (iii)strengthen the
banking system; (iv) liberalize foreign trade; and (v) create a better climate for the development
of the domestic private sector.

205.     The IMF has assumed responsibility for advising on the monetary policy functions o f the
SBV and the fiscal implications of the restructuring of SOCBs, including NPL resolution and the
resulting re-capitalization.   Included in this has been work on minimizing directed lending,
interest rate liberalization, and the process and timing o f the re-capitalization of SOCBs. The
direct involvement o f the IMF in some o f the structural areas such as SOCB/SOE reform and
trade reform was justified because of their potential impact on macroeconomic stability. For
example, changes intariffs have implications for Government revenue. Non-performing loans o f
SOEs can affect the fiscal position.


B.       Co-financiers

206.      Three bilateral donors expect to co-finance the PRSC 2, as they did the first PRSC.
They are the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and SIDA. Jointly with DANIDA, these co-
financiers contributed a total o f US$ 49 million to PRSC 1. These bilateral donors have played
an important role, not only in providing grant financing as a complement to IDA loan funds, but



                                                54

also in supporting technical assistance for implementation of reforms, and engaging in and
supporting the policy dialogue. For several o f the co-financiers, this support to PRSC 2 is an
important pillar o f their overall assistance strategy for Vietnam and indicates the central role that
the CPRGS is playing in definingtheir support to Vietnam. For PRSC 2, DFIDwill contribute 10
million Pounds, the Netherlands 7 million Euros, and SIDA 70 million Krona. This combined
contribution amounts to US$ 33.7 million equivalent.           Other donors have expressed strong
interest in supporting CPRGS implementation through their co-financing o f subsequent PRSCs
and their participation inthe policy dialogue associated with PRSC preparation.


C.       Other Multilateral and BilateralDonors

207.    Joint working groups o f donors, Government and international NGOs that meet on a
regular basis have helped carry the discussions on Government's plans for reforms to a wide
group o f stake holders. With the formation o f working groups on banking, state-enterprises,
trade, and public expenditure, donors have the opportunity to engage in discussions on reform
with Government counterparts on an ongoing basis. Such an arrangement is also helping to
ensure coherence across donors' programs o f support, and to mobilize funding for high priority
tasks in each area.

208.    As a consequence of the many challenges facing the financial sector inits transition from
a Government directed and managed system to a market-based one, assistance from the World
Bank, IMF, ADB, and other donors has been sought. The World Bank has led the effort of donor
coordination in the financial sector. It hosts regular financial sector donor coordination meetings
which have been recently supplemented by the IMF-hosted donor meetings specific to assistance
to the SBV.

209.     In the financial sector a division of labor between the IMF, ADB, and the World Bank
has been decided. The ADB takes responsibility for most of the non-bank financial institutions
while the World Bank takes the lead in the effort o f modernizing the banking system, including a
rationalization of joint stock banks, strengthening o f SOCBs and improved supervision o f the
system. This has been done in the context o f providing guidance and assistance in bringing
international standards of supervision and accounting to the banking sector. Lately the World
Bank has also taken the lead in providing assistance to the SBV in the area o f anti-money
laundering.

210.     Efforts to improve governance will focus on public financial management, information
and transparency, and legal development. Major technical assistance will be provided by the
World Bank in each o f these areas, and IDA projects will be undertaken in Public Financial
Management, e-Governance, and if requested, Legal Development. So far, ADB, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), and a number o f donors have taken the lead on public
administration and civil service reform, whereas the World Bank plays the leading role in public
financial management.

211.     Bilateral and multilateral donors are coordinating their financial and technical support to
the Public Financial Management Reform Initiative (PFMRI), launched by the Government as a
medium-termprogram for strengthening public financial management. This overarching program
deals with reforms in five areas: public expenditure management (including state budget
management, investment planning, and financial management information); public debt
management; revenue management; SOE fiscal risk management; and public asset management.
While the Fund takes the lead in revenue management, the Bank takes the lead in public

212.      Early documentation was shared with NGOs at various meetings organized with the
assistance of the NGO Resource Center. A copy of the matrix of policy actions under PRSC 2
andthe future roadmap of possible reforms was presentedand discussedat one ofthose meetings.
There was a lively, constructive discussion part of which revolved around how to keep
communicationlinesopen inthe future.

         IMFCompletesSecond Review of Vietnam's PRGF Programand
               Approves In PrincipleUS$53 Million Disbursement

The Executive Board of the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) today completed the
second review of Vietnam's arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). The Boardalso determinedthat Vietnam's ComprehensivePoverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) provides a sound basis for Fund
concessionalfinancial assistance.

The Board's decision wit1 become effective after the World Bank's review of the
CPRGS, which is currently scheduledfor July 2, 2002. Vietnam will be able to draw
SDR 41.4 million (US$53 million) from the arrangement.

Vietnam's three-year IMF-supported program was approved on April 6, 2001 (see
Press Release No. 07/12}. It amounts to SDR 290 million (US$370 million), of which
SDR 82.8 million (US$106 million) has been disbursed.

The PRGF is the IMF'sconcessional facility for low-income countries. It is intended
that PRGF-supported programs will in time be based on country-owned poverty
reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and
development partners, and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP). This is intendedto ensure that each PRGF-supportedprogram is consistent
with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic,structural, and social policies
to foster growth and reduce poverty.

After the Executive Board's discussion on Vietnam, Shigemitsu Sugisaki, Deputy
ManagingDirector and Acting Chairman, madethe following statement:

"The Vietnamese authorities have continuedto make progress in implementingtheir
three-year program, which seeks to improvecompetitivenessand spur investment in
order to foster high growth and rapid poverty reduction. Economic performance
under the first-year program was relatively strong and based on generally sound
macroeconomic policies and progress in structurai reforms. However, delays
continuedto be experiencedin reformingstate-ownedenterprises (SOEs).

`The second-year program is therefore appropriately centered on a firmer
implementationof the structural reform agenda, along with continued discipline in
macroeconomic management. To promote growth and investment, the authorities
will need to pressahead with steps to further open the economy to the private sector
and to reformthe trade regime and the state-ownedcommercial banks (SOCBs) and
SOEs.

"The budget deficit will be capped at a financeable level, but adhering,to this limit
and ensuring medium-term sustainability will require strengthened revenue
performance and spending discipline. Credit growth will continue to be restrained, to
keep inflation low and to protect banks' asset quality. Externaldebt managementwill
remain prudent and will continueto rely primarilyon concessionalfinancing.

`The authorities are expected to press ahead with restructuring the four large
SOCBs, bringing loan classification and provisioning in line with international best
practices. Under the bank restructuring program, strategic equity participation by a
foreign investor inone of the SOCBs is envisagedto take place by end-2003.

"lo advance SOE reform, moreforceful implementationof the authorities' three-year
reform plan will be required. Recent steps taken to accelerate the pace of
equitization will need to be fully implemented, and over time, the reform plan should
be extendedto cover the larger, heavily indebted SOEs.

"The authorities' Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy has been
prepared in a commendable participatory process. Its successful implemeoktion will
require careful prioritization and costing, strong expenditure management and
monitoring, and a full assessmentof the social impact of reform.

"In view of the encouraging progress thus far and the authorities' commitment to
accelerate reforms in critical program areas, the Executive Board completed the
second review under the arrangement, and granted waivers for the nonobservance
of a number of performance criteria under the program, as well as for a minor
incident of misreportingof resewes data," Mr. Sugisaki said.

Dear Mr.Wolfensohn :


                        LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY


                              I. INTRODUCTION

1.     The Government of Vietnam has been implementing a social and economic reform
programduring the past year and a half with the objective of restoring highand sustained
growth and poverty reduction.      The program i s an integral part of the Ten-year
Socioeconomic Development Strategy (2001-2010), the Comprehensive Poverty
Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), and the Government's Five-Year Plan (2001-
2005). This program i s endorsed by the World Bank and was supported by the First
Poverty Reduction Support Credit, completed successfully in December 2002. This
Letter of Development Policy (LDP) indicates the outcomes of this first phase of the
program, addresses the specifics of the program going forward and seeks financial
support from the World Bank for the next phase through a Second Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC 2). The attached Policy Matrix summarizes the specific policy
measures that have been adopted so far.      The LDP also indicates the main policy
directions within the framework of the Government's five-year program.


                              11.     BACKGROUND

2.     The "Doi moi" program, initiatedinthe late 1980s, succeeded inraising economic
growth rates and in reducing poverty very significantly. Between 1992 and 1997, the
Vietnamese economy grew at an average annual rate of 8.7 percent and poverty fell from
57 percent of the population in 1993 to 37 percent in 1998 and 32.5 percent in 2001
(according to the World Bank's standards). Investment rose from 8.6 percent in the late
1980s to 30.9 percent in 1997 and exports grew at an average rate of 28.9 percent each
year. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows rose continuously, peaking at $2 billion a
year during the 1995-97 period. However, growth slowed in 1998 and 1999, due largely


                                           1

to the impact of the regional crisis and recession but also because of declining growth
effects of the first phase of reforms. Exports growth fell to 2 percent in 1998, before
rebounding to 23 and 25 percent in 1999 and 2000 respectively. However, in the recent
years, thanks to the reform policy that made possible the mobilization of various resources,
economic growth has recovered very quickly, taking the second position compared to other
countries inthe region.

3.      Recent Developments. After a relatively subdued 2001, a recovery has been
underway since early 2002, supported by strong export performance as well as buoyant
domestic demand, and supportive fiscal and monetary policies. Real GDP growth rose in
2002, with domestic private investment showing impressive growth.           Although FDI
remains lower than it was prior to 1997, there are signs of improvements toward a more
sustainable level.

4.      In2002, export earnings increased by 11percent, compared to 4 percent the year
before. This growth was mainly due to significant increases in exports to the U S market
under the Bilateral Trade Agreement between the UnitedStates and Vietnam. Exports of
non-oil products such as garments, footwear, sea foods expanded rapidly. Manufactured
exports now account for 48 percent of exports, up from 37 percent three years ago.
Domestic credit grew by 21 percent and 22 percent in2001 and 2002 respectively. The
fiscal deficit was 2.9 percent and 2.4 percent of GDP inthose years.

5.      This recovery is partly a reflection of the economic reforms that were
implemented in recent years.       The measures taken so far have sought to maintain
macroeconomic stability, to integrate with the world economy and to continue the
transition to a market-oriented economy by creating a more favorable environment for the
private sector well as by initiating reforms of State-Owned-Enterprises (SOEs) and
commercialbanks .

6.      Ten-year Socio-economic Development Strategy (2001-2010).            Our Ten-year
Socio-economic Development Strategy envisages the doubling of GDP, the creation of
jobs for 15 million Vietnamese, and substantially reducing poverty. We believe that
these are achievable targets.      Therefore, we want to continue reforms aimed at
integrating Vietnam with the rest of the world, promoting private investment, making
banks and SOEs stronger, more competitive and efficient, strengthening social safety
nets, including health and education, and furthering the public administration reform.
Most of the employment creation i s expected to come from manufacturing and exports,
with the share of agriculture inGDP and employment declining over the decade.

7.      Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). The CPRGS
was approved by the Prime Minister in May 2002. It was subsequently discussed and
supported by the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF. The CPRGS translates the
vision laid out in the Ten-Year Strategy for 2001-2010 into concrete public actions and


                                             2

has several strengths both interms of substance and regarding its preparation process. A
wide range of stakeholders participated actively in the discussions and even in the
drafting through a series of workshops. Donors also contributed to the formulation of
this document through active discussions with and comments provided to the
Government. The underlying analysis of poverty is encompassing, and makes balanced
use of quantitative and qualitative evidence.     The strategy for poverty reduction is
articulated; it combines policies covering the macroeconomic, structural and sectoral
areas, with special attention given to improving governance. Moreover, the CPRGS
explicitly identifies outcome targets to address the national challenges and the
Government's international commitments to the Millennium Development Goals.
Overall, CPRGS represents a systematic attempt to prioritize public actions andto assess
their resource implications.

8.     These documents together establish the reform roadmap that Vietnam has been
pursuingfor the medium term. The country is seeking to mobilize resources required to
ensure that its efforts would bring about the outcomes envisaged. The Government of
Vietnam is seeking continuing support from the World Bank for its on-going reform
programinthe following critical areas.

                              111.       PROGRESSUNDERPRSC 1

9.     PRSC 1 was approved in June 2001. At that time, Vietnam was still emerging
from the East Asian crisis, and the focus was mainly on the structural reform agenda.
Policy actions under PRSC 1 were articulated around five areas: liberalizing trade,
reforming state-owned enterprises, strengthening the banking system, improving the
private sector climate and improving public expenditure management and transparency.
PRSC 1 was a two-tranche operation, for an amount of $250 million. Denmark, The
Netherlands, Sweden and the UK co-financed the operation, providing an additional $52
million of budget support. PRSC 1was successfully completed inDecember, 2002.

10.    Duringthe implementationof PRSC 1, Vietnammaintained an adequate
macroeconomic policy framework, supported by a three-year PRGFprogram. Fiscaland
monetary policies continue to be prudently implemented. Two PRGFreviews were
completed successfully. The third one was not completed yet mainly due to lack of
agreement with the IMFon safeguard measures.

11.    Policyreforms included inthe first phase of the three-year program laid out for
PRSC1 were implemented as planned. Progress was particularly clear inthe areas of
private sector development, trade liberalization and public expenditure management.
Targets were met inother areas as well, but insome cases the information to assess
progress against the benchmarks i s not available yet.




                                             3

 12.    Liberalizing Trade. Vietnam has removed quantitative import restrictions (QRs),
reduced tariffs under AFTA agreement as planned, and expanded private participation in
exports. During the period covered by PRSC 1, QRs were also eliminated for paper,
alcohol drinks, floor tiles, construction glass, steel, vegetable oil and passenger vehicles
up to 9 seats. Tariffs were not raised on these products, except for vegetable oil. As a
result of this process, the coverage of QRs fell from 20 percent of imports and 22 percent
of production at the beginning of the period, to 13 percent and 4 percent respectively at
the end of it.


13,     Implementation of the tariff-reductions under the AFTA agreement has been
broadly on track, with the average tariff on imports from ASEAN countries falling to 11
percent. Export quotas, which currently only exist for garment exports to Europe, are now
beingpartially auctioned and partially licensed automatically. Licenses operate on a first-
come-first-serve basis. Auctioning and the automatic licensing of export quotas have had
the effect of increasing private sector participationingarment exports.


14.     State-owned-enterprise reform. Vietnam has been implementing an SOE reform
plan which comprises specific measures to divest small and medium SOEs, and general
measures to promote greater transparency, competition and financial accountability for
the remaining SOEs.


15.     The enterprise-specific measures proved to be difficult to implement in a time-
boundmanner. Improvements inthe legal framework for enterprise divestiture, including
the establishment of a social safety net for redundant SOE workers and the adoption of a
more streamlined equitization process, were satisfactorily completed.         Equitizations,
sales, and liquidations of 408 SOEs were processed over the period covered by PRSC 1.
The SOEs whose ownership was transformed accounted for 2.5 percent of total SOE debt
and around 5 percent of total SOE employment, in line with what had been planned. In
addition, diagnostic audits of 17 SOEs had been conducted and 13 others were nearing
completion.    A recent study focused on the 422 enterprises equitised prior to 2001
revealed encouraging results interms of efficiency.


16.     Only one PRSC 1 condition related to SOE reform was not met, and required a
waiver. This condition referred to the adoption of restructuring plans for three large
General Corporations, operating in textiles, coffee and sea products. The agreed funding
for the preparation of these plans was not fully in Vietnam's control, and became
available later than expected. The inability to adopt the restructuring plans for three
General Corporations did not undermine the overall success of the program or the
effectiveness of any of its components. This action is now programmed for completionin
June 2003.



                                              4

 17.   Financial sector reform. In early 2001, Vietnam began implementing a
comprehensive multi-year banking reform program.          I t s goals were to improve the
regulation and supervision of banks, to enhance their transparency and accountability, to
improve the financial health of the banking system, and to create incentives for banks to
operate in a more commercially-oriented basis. Progress in carrying out these reforms
has been satisfactory, even though improvements in supervision were limited.


 18.   New regulations were issued regarding rules for loan classification and loan-loss
provisioning. The four largest SOCBs have been subject to audits of their financial
statements based on International Accounting Standards (IAS). Audits for the year 2000
have been completed, and audits for 2001 are under way. Loan classification has been
brought closer to international practice, with banks now required to consider the entire
loan balance as overdue when there are arrears inthe servicing of the debt. Large SOCBs
have adopted an interimphased plan to provisionfully for NPLs using the estimates form
the international standard audits for the year 2000. This plan envisages full provisioning,
using own resources, by end 2003 and 2006 for different banks. Adoption of a CAMEL
system was delayed but an implementation plan has been developed, and a revised
manual for strengthening on-site supervision has been completed. A series of mergers
and the termination of 12 delinquent institutions in the financial sector are evidence of
progress towards securing full compliance with bankingregulations.


19.    Policy lendinghas been separated from the commercial banking system. A decree
establishing the Social Policy Bank (SPB) was issued. This policy lending institution
will provide loans at subsidized rates to vulnerable groups with limited access to the four
large SOCBs. The SPB i s partly financed with mandatory deposits from SOCBs. Another
policy financial institution that lends to enterprises, projects, and provides financial
guarantees, the Development Assistance Fund (DAF), has been growing rapidly. DAF
lending i s currently not counted towards the domestic credit targets. Its inclusion should
reduce the incentive to transfer deposits from SOCBs to DAF.


20.    Private sector development. Several actions were taken under PRSC 1to improve
the overall climate for private sector development. The National Assembly approved
changes to the Constitution making the private sector an important component of the
economy, and recognizing the rights of enterprises and entrepreneurs to determine their
forms of business and to operate in sectors not prohibited. The Fifth Party Plenum, in
March 2002, endorsed the private sector as an important contributor to employment
creation, income generation and budget revenues. It called on the leaders of the country
to encourage it, and issued a resolution proposing policies to facilitate private sector
development  .



                                             5

21.     Over the period covered by PRSC 1, more than 50 business licenses affecting
private entry and operation were removed or modified, and a decree outlining support for
the development of private small and medium enterprises (SMEs) was issued. The
Secured Transactions Registration Agency was made operational in both Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City in March 2002, to facilitate execution of mortgages permitted under the
Securities regulation. Steps have also been taken to gradually phase-out dual pricing for
foreign and domestic entities. This improved business climate i s reflected in the growth
of domestic formally registered private firms. New registrations rose from 14,400 in
2000, to 19,800 in2001 and to 21,500 in2002.

22.    Public financial management. This component of PRSC 1 was implemented
satisfactorily. The budget plan and final accounts, disaggregated in greater sectoral
detail, were published and placed on the website of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The
Treasury was designated as the main agency responsible for comprehensive public
accounts. Preparations to install a comprehensive budgetary management information
system in the Treasury are currently underway. An inventory of the off-budget accounts
has been made, including a detailed statement for the Development Assistance Fund. A
review of the norms for recurrent budget allocations has been completed, and recurrent
budget implications of the public investment program have been estimated. The process
for developing a medium-term sector expenditure programhas been initiated.


  IV.    MAJORPOLICIESAND MEASURES INTHE SOCIAL SECTORSTO
      PROMOTESUSTAINABLE GROWTHAND POVERTY REDUCTION

Education

23.    Establish an Education System for the People that is more Egalitarian and of
Higher Quality. The Government aims to implement Decision 201/2001/QD-TTgon the
Education Development Strategy for 2001-2010 period.           This decision covers the
following areas:

          Focus on renovation educational objectives, content and curriculum to
          standardize, modernize, move closer to advanced standards in the region and
          the world.     Continue to raise the quality of higher and post-secondary
          education, and vocational training.
          Develop the contingent of teachers. Ensure that their numbers are satisfactory,
          and are appropriate with respect to structure and standards. renovate the
          training program and nurture teachers, lecturers, with special attention to
          maintaining and raising the ethical standards of teachers.
          Renovate the management of education to raise the effectiveness of state
          management; pursue decentralize to promote initiative and responsibility at the



                                            6

           local level, at the grassroots education level; prevent and curb negative
           behavior.
           Continue to complete the structure of the national education system to be
           responsive to the requirements of our people, economic sectors, and regions
           with priority to developing higher-level technical and industrial schools and to
           grassroots education for ethnic minority peoples and in remote and isolated
           regions.
           Encourage and create the conditions for all society to participate in the
           development of education. Create opportunities for all to study on a regular
           basis, with a view to lifetime learning through schools outside the public
           sector, with mechanisms and policies to give them priority with respect to
           renting land and accessing credit, funding to encourage study, to support
           education, to encourage individuals and groups to invest in education.
           Promote international cooperation in education with respect to training and
           cooperative research with various schools and various scientific research
           institutions worldwide.

24.    Continue to develop ways to expand equality of access to education, pay special
attention to improving the quality of educationfor poor people and disadvantagedgroups
(including girls), consider this one of thefocal points of development that is decisivefor
poverty reduction. Continue to compete the set of policies on equality of access to
training; access to primary and junior secondary education for children from rural
households and those inpoor regions i s of special importance; ensure gender equality and
enable girls to access education.

25.    Increase financial resources for training and education. Increase the share of
spending on training and education inthe state budget from 15 percent in2000 to at least
18 percent by 2005 and to 20 percent by 2010. The state budget will focus more on the
primary education level, mountainous and rural areas, high quality education and sectors
that have difficulty attracting non-budgetary investments. Obtain concessional funding
from the World Bank, the ADB, other international organizations and other countries.
Encourage the participation of the private sector in education, particularly in vocational
training. Encourage various forms of investment and expansion of the labor market to
increase job opportunities, and opportunities of high productivity jobs for poor people
and poor regions.       Implement preferential mechanisms for land use and provide
concessional credit for investment inbasic education.

Health

26.    Improve the Quality of Health Services, Family Planning Programs, Improve
Access and Reduce Health Care Costs for the Poor.            Strengthen and improve the
grassroots health service network, with improved access for the poor, especially women
and children, to basic health services, ensure equality in accessing and using health


                                             7

 service. Regulate and develop the non-state health service. Strengthen communication
 activities for health education, and increase the percentage of families that have access to
 clean water and hygienic latrines.

 27.     Consolidate and develop health sewices in poor regions, including training and
 developing local health staff with favorable policies and priority given to on-site training
 of ethnic staff in mountainous, remote, and disadvantaged areas. Ensure that 100 percent
 of commune and villages will have clinics. By 2005, 100 percent of inter-commune
polyclinics will have doctors; 65 percent of all communes will have doctors; 100percent
of commune clinics will have mid-wives and midwifery. By 2010, 80 percent of all
communes will have doctor; 100 percent of village will have at least primary health care
staff. Continue to carry out the integration of national targeted programs between the
health care sector and poverty reduction. Have the means to prevent and overcome
quickly health consequences caused by natural disasters.

28.      Improve the quality of public health services, especially at the grassroots level, in
mountainous, remote and isolated areas with national standards applied for commune
health services. Continue to develop preventive health care and health improvement,
reducing the infection and mortality rate.        Implement effectively national targeted
programs to control the spread of infectious diseases, dangerous diseases, and those
commonly affecting the poor, such as malaria, goiter, tuberculosis, leprosy and mental
illness and policies for taking care of HIV/AIDS patient in the community and their
children.

29.      Implement effectively the National Action Program for Children of Vietnam and
the Strategy to Care for Maternal Health in the Period 2001-2010.            Ensure that all
children can access basic health care services. Taking appropriate and effective measures
to improve mother and child nutrition. Improve the quality of health services providedto
mothers and children.

30.     Inthe coming years, the Government will continue to increase funding for health
with priority policies to take care of the health of people living in mountainous, remote,
and isolated areas and regions with a high poverty rate. Establish a suitable financial
mechanism to cover fully expenditures for regular health care activities of commune and
district health centers, especially in mountainous, remote, and isolated areas and in areas
with large ethnic minority populations.      Extend pre-pay health care services, health
insurance, especially health insurance in rural areas moving towards compulsory health
insurance for all. Have appropriate and effective policies and measures to reduce the cost
burden for the poor for curative services. The state ensures adequate funding from the
budget to carry out well pro-poor policies such as reducing and exempting the cost of
accessing health care services, buying insurance cards for the poor, the dependent elderly
who live alone, the disabled at the same time, implement the hospital fee exemption
policy for ethnic minority peoples and children under six. The state provides free of


                                              8

charge common medicines to treat social diseases and basic vaccines for children. The
 state implements targeted subsidy policies to prevent diseases inmountainous areas. The
 State provides ordinary medical subsidy of VND 20,000 per capita per annum for ethnic
minority people living inRegion111.

31.     Organize to implement effectively the Vietnam Population Strategy in the 2001-
2010 period. Consider implementation of family planning and the reduction of the birth
rate to be one of the important steps to poverty reduction with special attention to
publicity through effectively communication channels and the other education channels.
Step by step achieve an appropriate population growth rate to improve the quality of life
for all strata of people, integrate population targets inthe development plans.

Information Dissemination

32.     Improve the dissemination of information to help people expand their options.
Upgrade the quality and expand the information system at the grassroots level in many
forms, utilizing various means of communication.          Disseminate information in both
national and ethnic languages. Upgrade and improve the quality of information, provide
information for human development, assist people by providing more information so that
they can expand their choices and decision-making capacity.

33.     Improve the quality of education programs to ensure that they are entertaining to
attract and encourage the participationof children. Ensure that all communes nationwide
have newspapers and magazine to improve the language ability of ethnic minority
children. Enrich and maintain popular sports. Strengthen cultural and sports activities for
all.

34.     Continue to complete the nationwide broadcasting and television system, ensure
that more than 90 percent of households can see Vietnamese television programs and that
95 percent will be able to hear the Voice of Vietnam by 2005. Develop and modernize
the mass media network. Increase the amount of broadcasting and television time and
public ethnic language books and newspapers that are suitable for each locality. The
Government will have support policies to ensure that poor communes will have a
communication station to disseminate state policies and information on science and
technology.

35.     Undertake the initial investment in essential facilities such as the cultural house,
library, broadcasting and television equipment, certain kinds of books, newspapers and
scientific and technical documents. Supplemental investment and the cost of operations
and maintenance will be mobilizedby communities.

36.     Develop mechanisms for management and operations that are appropriate for each
province and area. Besides the direct management carried out by the postal sector,


                                              9

communes will develop their own action plan, asset management mechanisms,
operational expenditures, service fees and a regular maintenance plan for these facilities.


                           V.    THE PROPOSEDCREDIT

37.     The proposed credit would support policy actions in the structural, social and
governance areas outlined above and bear a direct relationship with the reform agenda set
out in the CPRGS. These actions represent further steps towards implementing the
development vision set out inthe Ten-year Strategy (2001-2010).

A.      Liberalizing Foreign Trade

38.     Zmplement obligations to AFTA. The most important priority in this context i s to
issue the Decree on Implementationof the CommonEffective PreferentialTariff (CEPT),
which will become effective on July 1, 2003. This decree provides for the transfer of the
last tranche of the Temporary Exclusion List (TEL) to the Inclusion List (IL). Also,
tariffs on all ILitems will be loweredto 20 percent at most. Inthe meantime, an ASEAN
Harmonized Tariff Nomenclature will be applied for ASEAN imports. The tariff level
will be continuously reduced in subsequent years, as committed under the CEPT Decree,
with the ultimate target being a range of 0 to 5 percent in 2006. At this point, it i s
expected that the average (un-weighted) CEPT rate will be about 9.3 percent in2003, and
3.0 percent in2006, down from 10.7 percent in2002.

39.     Eliminate QRs. Vietnam has been gradually phasing out its QRs on a multilateral
basis. Many QRs have been removed under PRSCl as mentioned in the paragraph 11.
QRs for all tariff lines for cement, motorcycles, and passenger vehicles (of up to 9 seats)
have been removed within the time frame of PRSC 2. On motorcycles, QRs were
replaced in early 2003 by a tariff rate of 100 percent from previous rate of 60 percent.
Tariff rebates on imported components for those producers who commit to increase the
share of locally-made components were removed at that point. On automobiles, during
the past several years QRs had applied to most finished products. For those products that
could be imported, the tariff was inthe range of 100to 120percent. Inaddition, an excise
tax of 90 percent was in force. But there was an excise-duty exemption for up to five
years for foreign-invested car makers. Since 2003, this excise duty discrimination has
beeneliminated.

40.    Issue key legal documentsfor integration with the world economy. To facilitate
further international integration, we have recently issued the Regulations for Most
Favored Nation (MFN) Treatment and National Treatment (NT), and                  Safeguard
Measures for imports, under the operation of PRSC 2.

B.      Makingthe State-Owned EnterprisesMore Efficient

41.     Make available SOE reform detailed plan. We have been making publicly
available the detailed SOE reform plan from 2003 to 2005. Unlike previous plans for
SOE reform, the new master plan identifies the enterprises to be divested by name, and
indicates a specific year for the ownership transformation to be carried out. The plan also
indicates the relevant supervisory authority, the charter capital, number of employees and
level of debt. The medium selected for the publication will be one accessible to all
stakeholders including, SOE management and potential bidders.

42.     Inpractice, the SOEreformmaster planis made of 104separateplans prepared by
line ministries, provincial governments and General Corporations. As of April 2003, 103
plans have already been submitted to NSCERD, and 94 have been approved by the Prime
Minister. The new SOE reform master plan indicates that as many as 2,000 SOEs could
be liquidated, or divested through equitizations or direct sales over the next three years.
These SOEs may account for as much as one quarter of the total SOE work force, and
one third of the total SOE debt. To avoid previous slippages in reform implementation,
the Prime Minister has issued Instruction 01 allowing to discharge the SOE directors who
fail to comply with the reformmaster plan. We will set out a similar rule on sanctions for
those who are responsible for SOE reform outcomes from line ministries, provincial
governments and General Corporations.

43.     Providefinancial information on SOEs. After completing the implementation of
the SOE reform road map, there will be approximately 3,000 untransformed SOEs. It i s
essential to have a timely and accurate monitoring system of their financial situation, in
order to make correct assessments of their performance and any implicit fiscal risks. We
will requirefull financial disclosure for the last completed accounting periodby all SOEs,
on an annual basis. This information, to be providedto relevant authorities, will include:
Profit and Loss Accounts (indicating profits pre tax, tax liabilities, interest payments
made and retained profits) and Balance Sheets (indicating fixed assets, debtors,
inventory, cash in hand, creditors, long-term debt and equity).     The current mechanism
to monitor the financial situation of SOEs i s Decision 167, which instructs them to report
to relevant authorities, but few SOEs are compliant with this obligation. Inthe future, we
will take actions to assure the effectiveness of such financial reporting.

44.     The policy dialogue i s currently geared towards setting up a more effective
mechanism to monitor SOE indebtedness. In particular, it i s recommended that, the
issuance of a Decision on SOE performance monitoring and evaluation will be made
available to sanction poorly performing SOEs which fail to comply with financial and
accounting regulations..

45.     Establisha Central Debt andAsset Trading Company (DATC). The establishment
of a central asset management company (DATC) i s an important step to address the


                                              11

 outstanding NPLs by SOEs. It i s expected that the formal decision on establishing the
 DATC will be signed by the Prime Minister within the coming weeks. In order to
minimize fiscal risks, and not to undermine the NPL resolution efforts of the SOCBs, the
 scope of operations of this central DATC will be primarily on inter-enterprise debts and
 non-performing bank loans for which the Government has assumed full responsibility.
Links between the activities of this DATC and the operational and financial restructuring
of the concerned SOCBs need to be firmly established.

46.     We plan to establish the DATC in the coming time and a pilot plan for DATC to
resolve NPLs of SOEs i s currently being developed. This pilot plan will include the
classification of the debts by debt type and identification of the appropriate methodology
to deal with each type of debts.

C.      Strengthening the Banking Sector

47.     Plan to resolve debts of 20 SOEs with large non-collaterized debts. The State
Bank of Vietnam issued Instruction 04 in January 2003 to deal on a separate approach
with the bad debts of SOEs. This instruction requests each of four largest SOCBs to
identify 20 large indebted SOEs for debt resolution according to M O F Circular
74/2002/TT-BTC. According to the instruction, documentation for debt re-valuation of
five SOEs shall be submitted to the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) on the last day of the
second month of each quarter of 2003. Any delay to this plan shall be promptly advised
to SBV and MOF. In a next phase, the remaining NPLs shall be handled in 2004 with
proper documentation being submitted to SBV and MOF.

48.    Ensure adequate provisioning for SOCBs according to targets assigned by the
SBV and the MOF. The SOCBs have identified their provisioning needs based on IAS
audits for the year 2000. With approval from SBV, they have planned to complete loan-
loss provisioning within their own timetable and according to their yearly targets, in
accordance with Circular 1627 of the SBV. Each bank has made adequate provisions as
definedinthe plan. The provisioning schedule will be reset once they have the new level
of required provisioning, based on new IAS audits.

49.    Complete key periodical milestones of restructuring plans of four largest SOCBs.
As a first step, the IAS audits of the SOCBs will be institutionalized. IAS audits of
financial statements for the 2000 fiscal year of these banks by reputable international
auditors have been completed, and contracts have been signed for similar external audits
for the fiscal year 2001 accounts. Each SOCB and the World Bank agree on the audit
qualifications from the year 2001 audits that are to be eliminated by the end of 2003.
Second, a work program to implement the use of credit manuals inSOCBs will have been
agreed between the SBV and the World Bank.

D.      EnablingPrivate Sector Development

50.     Develop an Action Planfor private sector development. The Resolution of the 5th
Plenum of the IX Congress of the Party Central Committee provided break-through high-
level policy endorsement in support of private sector development. The Action Plan
based on this Resolution (Decision 94, July 2002) specified Government policies to
support the private sector in the areas of business entry/environment, land, finance and
credit, labor, technology and science and trade and investment. Importantly, the Action
Plan also identified the responsible ministry and timetable for implementation of the
numerous actions detailed inthe Plan.

51.    Intensib implementation of Enterprise Law. The enactment of the Enterprise Law
i s widely credited as providing a major stimulus to private sector development through
facilitating firm entry. To further accelerate the implementation of the Enterprise Law,
the Government issued Directive No. 17 (August 2002) which provide specific
instructions to MPI and Peoples Committees of the provinces and centrally-run cities on
actions to improve the EL implementation and firm entry in general. For example, the
provincial/municipal Planning and Investment services are requested to immediately
announce the regulations on business registration procedures which are contrary to the
provisions of Enterprise Law; the Directive also requires MPI incoordination with others
to draft a decree announcing the list of valid permits. These actions are important for
creating a more transparent and consistent operating environment for private firms.

E.     Strengthening the Education and Health System

52.    Adopt the Education for All framework (2003-2015). The national Education for
All (EFA) framework constitutes a strategic framework for the long-term education
development of the four target groups: (i)early childhood care and education; (ii)
primary education; (iii) secondary education; and (iv) non-formal education. The
                         lower
EFA framework lays out the educational objectives and targets to bereachedby 2015, the
action programs that need to be implemented in order to reach these objectives and
targets as well as the assessment of resource requirements and resource gaps. The main
thrusts of the EFA framework for the period 2002 - 2015 are: (1) to complete primary and
lower secondary universal education at the international standards; (2) to move from
quantitative to qualitative achievements; (3) to provide life-long learning opportunities;
(4) to mobilize full community participation - All for Education; and (5) to ensure
effective management and better resource mobilization. The EFA document has been
finalized and the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has submitted the
document to the Prime Minister for approval and adoption. It i s expected that a Prime
Minister's decision to adopt this Framework will be issued by June, 2003.

53.    Establish provincial health-care funds for the poor. Decision 139, issued by the
Prime Minister on October 15, 2002, creates province-level Health Care Funds for the


                                            13

Poor (HCFPs) to finance out-of-pocket costs of eligible individuals who use publicly
provided health services. HCFPs are to receive funding sufficient initially to reimburse
outlays of VND 70,000 per poor beneficiary per year, with 75 percent of this amount
financed via publicly allocated resources and the remaining 25 percent covered through
community and individual contributions.

G.     Improving LandPolicy

54.    Zssue land Tenure Certificates (LTCs). Land-use rights that can be traded and
mortgaged provide several benefits, especially for the poor. They are a source of security,
they form the foundation for formal property markets, and they can be used as collateral.
Inthe past time, the allocation of land-use right certificates has been slow inurban and
upland forest areas. More recently, however, it has made faster progress. The latest
figures indicate that 35 percent of residential land users in urban areas and 60 percent of
the total number of households using forest landnow have LTCs.

H.     Furthering Budget Decentralization and Transparency

55.    Revise the Budget Law with progress on decentralization and transparency. The
first Vietnam's organic budget law was enacted in 1996 and came into effect in 1997.
While this law has provided a good legal framework for proper management of public
funds, a review of its 5-year implementation has revealed several weaknesses that need
to be addressed. These include (i)overlapping and duplicative authorities in budget
approval between the National Assembly and sub-national Peoples' Councils; (ii)     limited
powers of the National Assembly and the sub-national Peoples' Councils in budget
approval and budget execution oversight(iii) cumbersome budget execution processes
and procedures with many unnecessary steps; and (iv) lack of regulations on fiscal
transparency and weak accountability framework.

56.    As part of the Government's program of public financial management reform, in
December 2002, the National Assembly approved the Revised Law on State Budget
(2002 Law on State Budget -2002 LSB which will be effective starting from 2004). The
2002 LSB clearly delineates the roles of the NA and the Provincial People's councils in
budget approval whereby the NA will approve aggregate amount of state budget and
appropriations among central ministries leaving to the Provincial People's Councils the
powers to decide on appropriations among sub-national jurisdictions. The Provincial
People's Councils are empowered to make specific revenue and expenditure assignments
among its subordinate jurisdictions as well as to set some non-taxes and issue some
expenditure policies. In addition, sub-national governments will be given with more
sources of revenue raisingits share inthe total state budget revenue from the current level
of 29 percent to 35 percent.




                                             14

57.    Under the new Law, the budget execution processes will be streamlined though
abolishment of quarterly budget ceiling allotment thus contributing to the administrative
reform in budget execution process. Last but not least, the new Law legalizes the
transparency principles in state budget management by requiring that the plan, final
accounts and the results of audit of state budget and budget of all sub-national levels have
to be made public. Also processes and procedures for revenue collection, reduction and
exemption as well as for budget execution and payment have to be posted at the place
where these transactions occur.

58.    The new Law assigns the State Treasury Department as the lead agency
responsible for budget execution and accounting. The budget execution processes will be
streamlined though elimination of duplicative steps. As part of implementation of the
Law, a major effort i s underway to simplify and strengthen financial management and
reporting requirements. A unified Chart of Accounts i s being devised to bring together
the currently separate accounting systems of the State Treasury Department and the State
Budget Department.

59.    The new Law for the first time legalizes the transparency principles instate budget
management by requiring that the budget appropriations and allocations, their final
accounts and the audit results of state budget and budget of all sub-national levels have to
be made public. Furthermore, all processes and procedures for revenue collection, tax
reduction and exemption as well as for budget execution and payment have to be posted
at the place where these transactions occur.

60.    Lastly, regarding legislative oversight, a legal mandate has been established for
the State Audit of Vietnam to report their audit results the National Assembly, the
Standing Committee of the National Assembly (as opposed to when required as was a
practice up till now).

I. PromotingTransparency

61.    Publish legal documents in the Oflcial Gazette Legal transparency is key for
                                                          .
enabling people to make informed choices. People could not execute and comply with
legal provisions unless these provisions are well understood or easily accessible to the
them. Up to now, the dissemination of all legal provisions was not considered as an
integral part of legal development and execution process, thus hindering transparency and
forecasting ability. Ensuringthat all currently valid normative legal provisions are easily
accessible to the public i s essential in this respect. The recently approved the Law on
Amendments of and Additions to a Number of Articles of the Law on Promulgation of
Legal Instruments imposes greater legal transparency and i s one of the key legal reform
measures outlined in the CPRGS. This Law specifies that legal documents and decisions
of the Government cannot be enforced if they have not been published.



                                              15

62.     Establish a legal framework and issue a strategy for data quality, transparency
and availability. With the adoption of the CPRGS, a mechanism for measuring the
progress of its development plans and policies along a set of outcome targets and
intermediate indicators has been set up. To further strengthen the move towards more
evidence-based policy making it will be important to regard statistical information as a
public good, and made easily accessible to everyone who i s interested. The Law of
Statistics, now under discussion at the National Assembly and included as a PRSC2
action, should provide a framework for establishing a transparent well-coordinated
approach for the collection and dissemination of social, economic and environmental
statistics.

63.     A strategy for collecting highquality household living standard data has also been
adopted and the General Statistical Office (GSO) i s working towards designing similar
strategies for enterprise surveys and other surveys. The GSO Strategic Plan for 2001-
2010 period constituted a good foundation for changing and disseminating statistics on
environment and social economy. The goal of the Strategic Plan i s to support a high-
quality monitoring of government outcome targets as specified in government strategies
and plans, thus facilitating the analysis of these plans, to assess what works best for
poverty reduction and growth in Vietnam and what does not. Data-based assessment
should be conducive to further improvement of policies and spending plans over time,
ensuring that they fulfill the goals that they have set out for the development of Vietnam.

J.      LegalReform

64.     Put local courts under Supreme Court management. An independent judiciary is
required by the Constitution, with sufficient power to decide cases, and to make and
enforce judgments and rulings. A policy that moves the management responsibility of
courts at the provincial and district level from the executive branch of the Government to
the Supreme People's Court (SPC) will enhance the legalcy, reputation and independence
of the judiciary system as a whole. To implement this law, it i s important that the
Supreme People's Court will strengthen capacity of the department that i s assigned to
manage the local People's Courts (currently this i s the Department of Localities). In
addition, other departments and institutes involved such as the Office, Financial and
Accounting Department (newly-established) are responsible for budget management.
Institute of Judging Science takes responsibility for development and issuance of the
professional guidance to People's Courts to apply laws universally.

K.      Natural ResourceDevelopment

65.     Environment and natural resource management.The Government has drafted and
submitted for approval a National Strategy for Environmental Protection, under PRSC 2,
which i s expected to be approved by June 2003. This strategy is the product of a
consultative process. It integrates principles of sustainable natural resources use in the


                                               16

development process, thus representing important progress towards achieving the
environmental Millennium Development Goal (MDG). Subsequent steps to improve
environment and natural resource management include the strengthening of the
EnvironmentalImpact Assessment (EIA) of investment projects.

I. ImprovingImplementationandMonitoring

66.    The Government of Vietnam sees the implementation of the CPRGS as one of key
instruments to support medium-term policy and institutional reforms in cross-sector
areas, as well as the creation of a strong link between reforms as principal vehicle of
growth and poverty reduction. Recognizing its importance, the Prime Minister issued
Decision No. 825/QD-TTg, of September 2002, creating a National Steering Committee
(NSC) to implement the CPRGS and PRSCPRGF. The NSC i s chaired by the first
Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and consists of the heads of 22 relevant line
ministries. SBV is assigned as the agency responsible, in close collaboration with the
World Bank and IMF, for preparation and implementation of PRSCsPRGFs. Under the
leadership of a Deputy Governor of the SBV who acts as Standing Vice Chairman of the
NSC, an expanded Secretariat has been formed. This quasi-advisory body i s based on the
PRSC 1Secretariat and includes several former PRSC 1representatives from MOF, MPI,
Ministry of Trade (MOT), SBV, the Office of the Government (OOG), the Party's
Economic Commission (PEC) and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLISA).
It also has members from the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development (MARD), MOET, and others representing new policy reform areas
under PRSC 2 and subsequent PRSCs.

67.    Given the complex coordination nature of such a comprehensive reform program,
the SBV plans to create a Program Coordination Unit (PCU) as a program executive
agency with dedicated staff. This unit will deal on a regular basis with the program
agenda, including monitoring, reporting, awareness-raising, capacity building and
dissemination. The PCU will interact on a regular basis with the World Bank, the IMF
and other donors, as far as PRSCs issues are concerned. Therefore, technical assistance
from the donor community will be essential to help the PCUperformits coordination and
implementation tasks successfully.

68.    Monitoring Arrangements. The formulation of the recent ten-year Strategy bears
testimony to good use of information and analysis in the policy-making process. PRSC 2
will continue to build on this experience, streamlining the numerous ongoing monitoring
and evaluation initiatives.   Key sources of monitoring information for poverty and
program outcomes will include the proposed biannual household living standard survey,
periodic participatory poverty assessments, the small business registration survey, public
expenditure tracking survey, as well as the quarterly progress reports from the relevant
sector ministries and committees implementing the reform program. In addition, the

strengthening of management information systems for SOEs and for all public spending,
both ledby the MOF, i s an integralpart of the PRSC program.


                      VI.    THE FUTUREREFORMPROGRAM

69.    This part indicates what the Government has identified to do in furthering the
implementation of the reform program for future PRSC operations. Though not legally
binding, these represent the important areas of future policy dialogue. It is quite likely
that the list of policy actions will evolve, as sectoral programs are completed or revised
while progress on those already agreed upon may proceed at a faster or a slower pace
than expected.

70.    Trade liberalization. With support from the PRSC process, Vietnam is geared
towards further tariff reductions, the phasing-out of QRs and trading-right restrictions,
and the development of an appropriate set of rules and regulations for further integration
into the world economy.

71.    State-owned enterprise reform. We will continue the divestiture of SOEs that do
not play a strategic role, the hardening of the budget constraint faced by SOEs bound to
remain in government hands, and the close supervision of SOE debts and other financial
indicators. We plan to accelerate the implementation of the Government's SOE reform.
We would also beginrating SOEs according to the criteria set out inthe Decision on SOE
performance evaluation and monitoring before the end of 2003. The hardening of
constraints faced by SOEs comes from increased competition in product markets and
limited access to soft lending. Measures to harden the budget constraint refer to the
establishment of a central DATC and to the revision of the regulatory framework for
policy lending.

72.    Bunking sector reform.        The program in this area aims at increasing the
transparency and accountability of the banking system, improving its legal and regulatory
framework, moving to international accounting standards especially in loan-classification
and provisioning, leveling the playing field for all banks, and restructuring the JSBs and
the SOCBs. To deal with the most difficult challenges in this process concerning the
large stock of NPLs, the Government will strengthen legal framework and accounting
standards for the resolution of NPLs on a systematic basis over the coming years. We
expect that the four largest SOCBs will meet their loan-loss provisioning and NPL
resolution targets intheir restructuring plans. Inaddition, implementationof existing plan
for SOCB re-capitalization will be performance based, i.e. conditional on strict adherence
to implementation of the individual restructuring plans. It i s expected that re-
capitalization of SOCBs will be finalized by end 2006, resulting in 8 percent capital
adequacy ratios. Accordingly, monitoring the implementation of the plan will be a
recurrent theme of the PRSC process.


                                             18

73.    We hope, by the end of the year, to adopt a plan with a clear timetable to enable
one SOCB to seek equity participation by a reputable international partner. We will also
be approving a new legal document to replace Decree 43, which will provide a sound
regulatoryframework for policy lending.

74.    Private sector development. Policy actions inthis area focus on facilitating access
to land, leveling the playing field, and further implementing the Enterprise Law. Private
sector access to land, through improving land-use planning and removing restrictions on
allocating agricultural land for industrial activities, i s expected to have a major beneficial
impact on private sector development in Vietnam. Amending of the Land Law, so as to
allow private enterprises to transfer Land-Tenure Right Certificates (LTCs), is also part
of the PRSC process. Various enterprise types currently operate under different legal and
regulatory regimes. The reform program features the amendment of the Enterprise Law
to cover all corporate sectors (foreign, private domestic and state-owned) accompanied
by a clear timetable for compliance by large SOEs.

75.    Looking forward, satisfactory progress on issuance of accounting and auditing
standards consistent with international practice and a framework that will allow private
sector participation in infrastructure projects, especially in energy and transport are
foreseen under subsequent PRSCs.

76.    Education. The reform program supported through the proposed series of PRSCs
aims at increasing the overall spending in education, at reducing the current dispersion in
effective spending per pupil, and at improving quality standards, especially in
disadvantaged areas. The program hinges on the combination of two elements: the
adoption of school quality standards, and the introduction of resource allocation
mechanisms geared towards the attainment of those standards, especially in
disadvantaged districts,

77.    A fundamental upgrade inmanagement practices will take place under subsequent
PRSCs with the introduction of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the
education sector. Also scheduled for subsequent PRSCs i s the adoption of Fundamental
School Quality Level (FSQL) standards, which will not only guide resource allocation,
but also serve as a lever to facilitate monitoring, both at the central and the provincial
level. The FSQL standards will refer to physical infrastructure, teaching staff, school
organization and management, social participation in education, educational activities
and quality, and expected educational outcomes. This overall approach i s to be
complemented by a targeting strategy.

78.    Health. To redress the imbalances in health outcomes, the reform program
supported by the PRSC process focuses on changing the financing of health. Public
resource allocation by the central government will be more closely linked to health



                                              19

sector's goals and priorities, and the targeting of central government transfers and donor
assistance will be improved. A ten year strategy for HIV/AIDS i s also part of the process.

79.     For the longer term, the implementation of an MTEFfor the health sector is key to
deal with the overall financing issues ina systematic way. Efforts to improve expenditure
and financial management at the Ministry of Health (MOH) are planned for 2003-2004.
Within that process, it will be necessary to revise the planning methods, allocation
criteria, and financing instruments governing central and provincial spending on health
by programand function.

80.     Land. Under future PRSCs, the National Assembly i s expected to adopt a new,
substantially revised LandLaw, which will provide greater land-tenure security and equal
access to land by all sectors, that i s correspondant with the customs and habits of the
communities that are using land legally. Registration and other civil transactions relating
to land use rights will be simplified. Especially, land use rights and project bidding
methods will be applied widely for the cases when credit organizations fail to collect their
debts. Issuance of LandTenure Certificates will be continued under PRSCs.

81.     Gender. The Government has made a strong commitment to re-issue existing
LTCs to specify names of bothhusband and wife as joint users. The objective i s expected
to be completed by the end of PRSC implementation process. Progress towards this
objective will be monitoredon a regular basis under subsequent PRSCs.

82.     Environment and natural resource management. Effective landclassification and
land-use planning are essential to address the serious housing shortage faced at present
throughout the cities of Vietnam. As part of the reform PRSC process, instructions will
be issued to improve zoning, particularly for urban development.. In parallel to this
effort, a decision will be issued to provide basic services by zones, regardless of migrant
status of the population. Subsequent PRSCs also include the approval of a revised Law
on Water Resources, with the implementing decrees focusing on the appropriate
institutional arrangements, including regular operations of river basin organizations, and
financing water resource management, water inspection and water licensing. The revised
Law will facilitate basin-based water resource management, across administrative
borders. In the meantime, reversing forest degradation remains a high priority of the
Government. Under the PRSC program, an action plan to restore forests and wetlands
with high biodiversity will be adopted. The plan will include a reliable monitoring
system, making more use of aerial photography.

83.     We hope to make rapid progress in strengthening the Environmental Impact
Assessment system. Over the coming months we will be consulting key stakeholders on
ways to improve EIA and we will use these consultations as a basis for drafting
Government regulations.



                                             20

84.    Vietnam suffers frequently from natural disasters, notably typhoons and floods,
which disproportionately affect the poor. While the immediate policy response to these
challenges i s reasonably good, there i s still a need for a comprehensive natural disaster
mitigation (NDM) strategy to guide the management of risks and public efforts to assist
those most likely to be affected by natural disasters. Adoption of the NDM strategy will
be part of the PRSC process.

85.    Improving planning processes. A series of regional workshops will be organized
in the first half of 2003 to help provinces familiarize with the CPRGS process and its
implications at the local level. A new poverty assessment with a regional breakdown will
be carried out in 2003 using a new, much larger household survey, as well as other
sources of information. Based on this experience, targets on the number of provinces
which effectively incorporate the CPRGS into their planning process will be set up. In
parallel with the preparation of the new CPRGS chapter on large infrastructure projects,
various ongoing studies to assess the growth and poverty alleviation impacts of public
investment programs will be completed.

86.    Public financial management. By 2008, an effective, integrated Treasury and
Budget Management Information System (TABMIS) will be operational in all central,
provincial and district treasury offices. Modern budget planning approaches will have
been established in MOF, MPI, and four sector ministries. Strengthened approaches to
the management of public debt will have been established in core government agencies,
including integrated processes for recording of domestic and external debt and for
analysis and management of fiscal risk. Policy and institutional reforms to support this
process, to be adopted under subsequent PRSCs, include the consolidation of the
Treasury's new status as the lead agency responsible for maintenance of treasury and
budget management information. Reforms will also include the integration of currently
disparate accounting systems, making them more consistent with international standards.
The routine disclosure of detailed, reliable public financial information including budget
plans and budget final accounts, and substantial progress with procurement and
implementation of effective TABMIS, are other key components of the process.

87.    Legal Development. The Law and Ordinance Development Program and its action
plans form the foundation for the reform program to be supported by the PRSC process.
Under future PRSCs, a law or ordinance mandating the publication of decisions and
guidelines of the Supreme People's Court will be issued. Specific institutional
arrangements, such as designating a resourced department within the Supreme People's
Court to publish the information as well as ensuring regular feedback from the local
courts, will be essential to make this policy operational.

88.    In order to promote accountability of local authorities, the Ministry of Home
Affairs i s expected to issue a decree that will scale-up the coverage of the earlier Decree
on Grassroots Democracy to all communes. To be effective, this initiative will have to be


                                             21

supplemented by clearly designated responsibilities for implementation. In addition, the
Law on Complaints and Denunciations will be amended, so as to expand the jurisdiction
of the courts to review and correct illegal administrative decisions. The Government will
also consider the launching of a Government Portal as an additional step towards
facilitating legal information access for citizens. Under future PRSCs it i s expected that a
Law on Local Organizations will be drafted in consultation with its stakeholders and
passed by the National Assembly. This law should be based on the principle that citizens
and organizations can do anything that i s not explicitly prohibited.

89.    Public administration reform (PAR). We will concretize the PAR Master Program
2001-2010 in making the civil service more responsive, transparent, efficient and
accountable. A first step in the implementation of this agenda will be the adoption of a
time-bound action plan for simplification of administrative procedures, The one-stop-
shop approach will constitute the backbone of this plan. Promulgating a procurement
ordinance i s also part of the reform agenda. This would include measures to ensure
competitive bidding as the main method for procurement and to introduce mandatory use
of standard bidding documents, standard bid evaluation and standard contracts.
Moreover, under future PRSCs, an action plan for rationalizing salaries of public servants
will be adopted to gradually align civil service remuneration with the market, to monetize
some of the allowances and to introduce performance-based incentives.

90.    Corruption. We recognize that while Vietnam has achieved a remarkable record
ineconomic and social development but the corruption still exists. The move towards a
more market-based economy requires a strengthening of institutions and mechanisms for
accountability. A diagnostic study on source of corruption in Vietnam is currently
underway. The results of this study will feed into the amendment of the Ordinance
Against Corruption, scheduled to take place under subsequent PRSCs.

91,    Information. The development of specific indicators for the monitoring and
evaluation of CPRGS i s an important step towards a better-quality monitoring of social
and economic targets. Under future PRSCs, a Working Group on Monitoring and
Evaluation will be set up to develop a monitoring and evaluation action plan. The
resulting information system must include indicators at the central, local and sectoral
levels. It also needs to meet high quality standards in terms of both quantitative and
qualitative information. In Vietnam, this means going beyond administrative records, to
make full use of census and household survey data. It i s important that monitoring and
evaluation of the CPRGS involves consultation with researchers and the civil society,
including community-based organizations.

92.    Strengthening pro-poor planning processes. MPI will continue to work with line
ministries and subnational levels of government to ensure that the CPRGS becomes a
meaningful part of the planning process. By the end of the year we would expect to
demonstrate progress inthe planning program at the provincial levels and in one sector.

                                 VII. CONCLUSION

93.   We have presented our strategy and the concrete steps to implement this strategy.
We are working with the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral donors to
broaden and deepen the reforms set out in the CPRGS and will monitor the outcome
through a result-oriented approach with indicative triggers to achieve our objectives.
