Date PID Prepared/Revised        March 26, 2003
Projected Appraisal Date         April 2003
Projected Board Date             June 2003
Background
unlike other countries in the region that suffered from the 1997 financial
breakdown, Vietnam has avoided a fiscal, balance-of-payments and banking crisis
through judicious and prudent macro-economic policy. During 1998-2002, structural
reforms also picked up steam during 1998-2001 period relative to the previous three
years. A trade agreement with the uS and the record investment deal in the energy
sector in late 2000 contributed positively to government effort to restore
confidence of investors and exporters. various ministries and restructuring
committees have also developed a quicker reform program for the next three years
that meets with approval from higher levels of the government. The IMF supported
the renewed reform with a three-year program through the PRGF.
Project objectives
The Bank has provided fast-disbursing budget support in the form of a Structural
Adjustment Credit in 1994 and the first Poverty Reduction Support Credit which was
successfully completed in December 2002. The PRSC 2 would build on the work of the
first PRSC and the SAC by liberalizing the economy further and permitting the
private sector to grow.
Project Description
The PSRC 2 builds on the recent reforms already taken by the government and support
the implementation of Vietnam's current poverty reduction strategy as summarized in
the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) The PRSC 2 supports
the continued adherence to sound macroeconomic policies and supports structural
reform in the following areas: banking reform, state-enterprise reform, trade
reform and private sector deregulation, all aimed at creating a more favorable
environment for the private sector. The project also focuses on other sectors like
education, health, gender, infrastructure, rural and environment, as well as legal
development, public finance, public administration and information.

Project Financing
The proposed credit amount would be a US$100 million equivalent. The credit would
be disbursed in one tranche at effectiveness subject to the fulfillment of the
conditions listed in the Policy Matrix.
Project Implementation
The State Bank of Vietnam will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of
the program.
Sustainability
Vietnam has continued on a road of slow but steady reform with few reversals of
policy. It has committed to some key principles of policy like integration with the
rest of the world and rapid growth with social stability and equity. It takes a
long time to develop a consensus on policy-reform, but once agreed, the country has
generally implemented such changes. If the new reforms promote growth and reduce
poverty, they are likely to be sustained.
Environmental aspects
In accordance with Bank guidelines, the proposed operation has been placed in
category u and will not require an environmental assessment.
Poverty Category
The PRSC supports the implementation of vietnam's current poverty reduction strategy
as summarized in the Government's CPRGS.
Program objective categories
The project is a structural adjustment operation.
