 3. ProgramDescription

 3.a. Concise Description of the Overall Program

 3.a. 1. Vietnam's overall program of reforms i s embodied in the government's national strategies and plans,
 including the 2002 Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS) and its updates. These
 translated the vision laid out in the Ten-Year Strategyfor 2001-2010 into concrete actions to position Vietnam
 on the path towards a "market-economy with socialist orientation." With the involvement a wide range of
 stakeholders during its preparation, the CPRGS built on this foundation, spelling out clear development targets,
 identifying appropriate policies to attain them, and aligning resources to those policies.                        The Vietnam
Development Goals (VDGs), which are the localized version of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
are among the CPRGS's key targets. The CPRGS's contents can be organized - at the risk of simplification --
around three broad pillars:


   0   Pillar I:High growth through a transition to a market economy, requiring the implementation of an
       ambitious structural reformagenda.
   0   Pillar 11: An equitable, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable pattern of growth through
       appropriate sectoral and social policies and programs.
   0   Pillar 111: Adoption of a modem public administration, legal and governance system, essential to attain the
       first two goals.

3.a.2.    These pillars are not self-standing but connected through cross-cutting themes, i.e., employment
generation for poverty reduction, link between public financial management, and effective delivery of social
services to the poor. In 2003 the CPRGS was expanded with a chapter discussing the role of infrastructure in
promoting economic and social development.                  In November 2003, the first CPRGS Progress Report was
completed. This Report evaluates performance in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction, reviews
policy implementation in 2002-2003, and identifies challenges ahead.

3.b. Brief Description of the Operation and its Relatioidiip to the Program

3.b. 1. The above reformprogram i s supported by a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) from
the Bank covering a four-year period.            * The series of annual PRSCs constituted a mechanismto support the
process of implementing the CPRGS, evaluate its impacts, and draw lessons for subsequent revisions of
strategies and policies.        While the reform program supported by PRSCs focuses on policy actions, its
implementation should translate into improved economic and social outcomes. The expected outcomes of the
program are compared to the situation prevailing at present. The selected outcome indicators represent a sub-
set of the monitoring indicators identified by the CPRGS. Several of them had already been considered by
PRSC 1. Others are based on the VDGs. They all represent measurable yardsticks to assess progress in the
implementation of the structural, social and governance reform agendas. The PRSC 2 continued with the
program initiated by PRSC 1and aimed to support the implementation of the CPRGS in the following areas::

  0    Strengthen competition in the economy, harden the budget constraints on state-owned enterprises, and
      level the playing field for the private sector, thus leading to increased efficiency andjob creation.
  0   Promote investments in people through better access by the poor to education and health care, more secure
      asset ownership in the form of land titles and a greater role for public involvement in environmental
      management.



*
'   The inclusion of this chapter fills what the Govemment perceivedas an importantgap in the original CPRGS.
    Considerationof such an extended time horizon is warranted by the fact that the CPRGS will be mainstreamedinto the five-year
    plan 2006-2010.


                                                                 2

'       Increase efficiency and accountability in public financial management and improve legal transparency and
        accessibility, thus laying the foundations for modem governance.

  3.b.2. In line with the programmatic approach, PRSC 2 is based on progress reflected in key policy actions,
  summarized in the following table.

 4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

 4.1.      The range of economic reforms supported by the Bank was considerably broadened from PRSC 1. In
 addition to the mainly structural reforms previously, PRSC 2 included various policy actions aimed at keeping
 development inclusive and building modern governance, including measures related to education and health
 sectors, environmental sustainability, land management, legal development and public financial management.
 The table below summarizes the achievements under PRSC 2.

    4.2       The next operation, PRSC 3, was approved by the Board on June 22, 2004. It carries the reforms
    further to support the CPRGS implementation on several fronts:

    0    SOE sector. PRSC 3 promotes greater internal and external competition, endorses an acceleration in the
         divestiture of SOEs and SOCBs, improves transparency and accountability in SOE operations and in the
         banking sector, and supports a sound regulatory framework for government policy lending.
         Social sectors. PRSC 3 promotes human development through an expanded budget appropriation and
         higher quality standards for education, through resources to cover the poor's health care costs and through
         mechanisms to complete the transfer of land-use rights to households, especially in upland and ethnic
         minority areas. The credit supports measuresto improve environmental and water resources management.
         Governance and administration. Increased transparency and accountability of public finances, simplified
         administrative procedures, and steps to curb corruption are part of a broader effort to build modem
         governance. Other actions supported aim at revamping planning processes, moving towards the alignment
         of policies and resources to the attainment of well-specified development goals.

    4.3.     PRSC 3 triggers cover key developments in the three pillars of CPRGS. All the triggers, except one,
    are directly linked to government actions, reflecting implementation progress of the reform agenda. The
    exception refers to private sector development, where an outcome indicator i s considered for two reasons. First,
    private sector development i s the combined outcome of actions in many policy areas, from trade liberalization
    to financial sector reform to the emergence of a land market. It would be difficult to focus on one or a few
    policy actions which could signal, on their own, significant progress in the private sector development agenda.
    Second, the experience of Vietnam, and especially the different pace of enterprise registration across provinces,
    suggests that implementation i s becoming more important than the regulatory framework itself.

 5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

 5.1     The reform program supported under PRSC 2 sought to maintain the momentum built up by the
 achievements under PRSC 1 and the government's own blue print for reform, the CPRGS. Most of the
 measures supported by PRSC 2 were within the govemment control, and directly monitored by the PRSC
 Steering Committee, under the Prime Minister's direction and headed by the First Deputy Prime Minister, and
 the PRSC Secretariat for the day-today matters. As the program i s strongly owned by the govemment and
 widely supported by the stakeholders, achievements and fulfillments of the committed actions were effectively
 carried out.

 5.2     The SBV continued to be the principal implementing agency for PRSC 2, chairing the Secretariat
 Group which oversaw the day-to-day implementation of the program. Its experiences acquired under the SAC
 and the PRSC 1 contributed to the successful completion of PRSC 2. SBV coordinated with the Ministry of
 Finance (MOF), Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), Ministry o f Trade (MOT), and related ministries
 and agencies involved in PRSC 2. The PRSC Secretariat coordinated and monitored the implementation of the
reform program among the ministries and agencies with reports on accomplishments, problems, and
 adjustments. The Secretariat also worked closely with Bank staff during the implementation of the program and
followed up on the specified conditions with relevant agencies and ministries to meet the conditionality for
Board presentation and effectiveness of the credit.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

6.1      Bank Performance. The Bank through its country office presence under the direction of a proactive
Country Director has provided an effective voice to implement the series of PRSCs through its lending policies
outlined in the CAS to assist the government with its poverty reduction strategy and sustained growth with
equity. Through direct supervision on the ground, Bank resident staff helped ensure the smooth and successful
supervision of the operation.

6.2      The Bank has satisfactorily and effectively played a supportive role to the country through its
continuing economic dialogue with the authorities and responded timely to their request for help to implement
the country's reform program, along with other donor agencies. As chairman of the Consultative Group, the
Bank helps coordinate development activities closely with other development partners and minimize overlap
and competing demands from straining the authorities' weak administrative capacity. This form of effective
cooperation was supported and reflected in the cofinancing of PRSC 2 by three cofinanciers, the Netherlands,
Sweden and the United Kingdom.

6.3      The Bank's PRSC Working Group has designated category C for PRSC 2 and thus OP 4.01 did not
apply to this operation.

6.4      The PRSC 2 was assessed by the Sixth Quality at EntryAssessment (QEA6) Panel. The Panel rated the
quality at entry of the PRSC 2 overall as "Satisfactory." Two of the quality dimensions, Strategic Relevance
and Approach and Poverty and Social Aspects are rated as "Highly Satisfactory."

6.4     Borrower Performance. The government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam played an active role in
the preparation of the Credit through the PRSC Steering Committee under the direction of the First Deputy
Prime Minister and the sense of program ownership was very strong among the govemment officials of all
levels. Reflecting this strong ownership, the govemment implementation of the program was effective and
satisfactory. The PRSC Steering Committee maintained a continuing economic dialogue with Bank staff,
coordinated and monitored the program under the direction of the First Deputy Prime Minister, and helpedcarry
out most of the policy actions called for in PRSC 2 before Board presentation and effectiveness. The SBV
provided an effective anchor for the implementation of the program and was proactive in meeting the


                                                      7

requirements called for by the Credit. The preparation and implementation of the PRSC 1 was effected under
the solid leadership of the Prime Minister, the firm direction of the First Deputy Prime Minister, and the
experienced SBV staff with almost a decade of experience working with international financial institutions.

7. Findings and Implicationsfor Subsequent Operation@)in Series

7.1      In Vietnam, a stable political environment contributed to the successful implementation of
macroeconomic and structural reforms. The risk of erosion of political support was minimized and reversals due
to political changes became less likely. The political support was achieved with the building of a broad-based
consensus and strong govemment commitment through the preparation of the CPRGS.
7.2      To complement the government's strong ownership, the availability of technical assistance grantsfrom
donors and strong and close Bank team support played a key role in low-income countries with weak technical
working level capacity, especially in the reforms in the SOE and banking sectors
7.3      Capacity to implement structural reforms can easily be overwhelmed by the relatively large number of
donors. It i s therefore critical to have close donor coordination in order to minimize duplication of efforts that
could stretch government capacity. The PRSC 2 incorporated well the donor coordination in both the design
and implementation.
7.4      Subsequent operations.       PRSC 2 is the second of a series of PRSCs designed to support the
government's program as outlined in the CPRGS. The third PRSC (PRSC 3) that has been prepared and i s
scheduled to be presented to the Bank Board on June 22, 2004 continues the Bank support to Vietnam under the
PRSC series within the CPRGS framework.
