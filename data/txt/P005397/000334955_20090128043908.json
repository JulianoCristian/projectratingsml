The Agriculture Development\n            Project was the third of four projects appraised by the\n            Bank, during the late seventies and early eighties that\n            demonstrated the interest of both Government and the Bank in\n            the integrated development of rainfed agriculture. Previous\n            governmental agricultural development policies had aimed\n            almost solely at developing the large-scale irrigated\n            agriculture sub-sector. Designed as an integrated\n            agrosylvo-pastoral development effort, the Middle Atlas\n            project through the implementation in five communes of a\n            series of interrelated actions in the forest, on the range\n            and on arable land aimed at: (a) bringing about production\n            increases of meat, milk, fodder, cereals and wood; (b)\n            increasing income and employment among the rural production;\n            and (c) reversing the deterioration of the forest and\n            rangelands in the areas, while restoring the role of tribal\n            fractions in managing collective rangelands. The project\n            comprised four major components: forestry development,\n            livestock improvement, cropping development and technical\n            assistance/studies. Specifically, these included (i)\n            infrastructure and equipment for the management and\n            exploitation of the region's forest resources; (ii)\n            forest and collective rangeland development activities;\n            (iii) development of animal health facilities; (iv) on-farm\n            development and working capital for agricultural production;\n            (v) construction and improvement of forest range and feeder\n            roads; (vi) improved extension and research; (vii)\n            irrigation rehabilitation; and (viii) technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1992-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
