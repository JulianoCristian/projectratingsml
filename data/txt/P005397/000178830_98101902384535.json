population. Forestry development will consist of the\n            implementation of forest management plans; the provision of\n            infrastructure, mostly roads; the planting of trees and\n            forage shrubs; felling and thinning; and pest management.\n            Livestock development will consist of increasing forage\n            production and improving forage conservation; the\n            acquisition of selected animals; the introduction of range\n            management based on fixed stocking rates and on deferred and\n            rotational grazing; the provision of infrastructure on the\n            range as well as reseeding and fertilization of forage; the\n            construction of animal health facilities and of breeding\n            stations; and the provision of credit.
