                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation continues to progress in a satisfactory manner and the Project can be expected to deliver on its development outcome. Almost all contracts have been
                         awarded and only six are still under processing. The technical assistance components to improve the financial capacities of the local utilities, for studies, and for the preparation of
                         projects for EU financing are completed or nearing completion. Disbursement has increased from 47% to 70% in the last six months. Disbursing 30% of the remaining loan by the
                         Loan closing date (December 31, 2012) remains challenging.
