                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project implementation overall continues to progress in a satisfactory manner and it can be expected to deliver on its development outcome. It has significantly accelerated from
                         a technical point of view, resulting with completion of more than 40% of the procured contracts. The Technical Assistance component of the Project, aiming to preparing projects to
                         support future EU fund absorption is also proceeding well. While disbursement is still behind schedule, if sufficient counterpart funds are allocated to the project and this is done
                         swiftly, the Project is expected to be completed by its closing date (December 31, 2012).
