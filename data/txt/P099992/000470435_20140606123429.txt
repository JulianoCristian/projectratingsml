F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower's Project Cities in enhancing: (i) the
performance and quality of their existing urban transport infrastructure in terms of mobility,
access, and safety; (ii) the efficiency and effectiveness of their urban public transport and road
maintenance services; and (iii) the responsiveness of their urban transport systems to the needs of
population without access to private motorized vehicles.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not revised.

                      complex to organizing bidding with private sector who were not familiar with local

H. Restructuring

A Level Two Restructuring was approved by the Bank’s Country Director on September 18, 2011.
The restructuring included: (i) adjustments to the overall project size to $473 million instead of
$525 million; (ii) adjustments to project components with an overall reduction in the scope for
civil works for road infrastructure and maintenance compared to the original project, and an
increase in equipment for road and maintenance and public transport and traffic safety
components, and the appreciation of the Chinese currency; (iii) an extension of the project closing
date by twenty-two months to complete critical contracts for traffic signaling equipment as well
as construction of a major bridge in the city of Benxi; (iv) reallocation of loan proceeds reflecting
primarily the allocation of unallocated funds; and (v) minor changes in project indicators to
reflect changes in components and implementation experience. At project closing, the loan had
savings of US$5.12 million, which has been cancelled.

1.         Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1        Context at Appraisal

1.      The Liaoning Medium Cities Infrastructure Project (the project) was introduced at a time
when the Government of China launched an ambitious program in mid-2000s to revitalize
Northeast China, which had lost its traditional competitive position during the transition to a
market economy as the region had relied mostly on inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOE).
The World Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the time (2006-2010) focused, among
other objectives, on improving the competitiveness of the various regions of China and the
overall investment climate, and on addressing the needs of disadvantaged groups and
underdeveloped areas through financing infrastructure 1. The medium-sized cities in Liaoning
Province were especially vulnerable during the economic transition period started in the 1990s, as
they were reliant on a small number of large, inefficient SOEs focusing on heavy industry and
mining sectors. Severe financial pressure faced by the SOEs put fiscal pressure on and weakened
the economic base of the cities, whose growth rate in general was lower than that of the
province’s major cities, Shenyang and Dalian. As a result, at a time when many of the cities in
China’s coastal region had been investing heavily in transport infrastructure, the road and public
transport systems in the medium cities of Liaoning had suffered from systemic fiscal neglect.
This accumulated underfunding had resulted in a serious deterioration of the asset base and
under-provision of basic transportation services.

2.       The project attempted to promote “people-centered” development at a time when the
Government launched the “People First” development strategy and the desire to create a socially
harmonious society. The national government had taken several actions during that period to
operationalize these general strategies in the context of urban transport. The National Road
Safety Law, put into effect in 2004, explicitly valued safety and focused especially on the most
vulnerable road users. Similarly, the State Council, the Ministry of Construction, as well as the
highest levels of Chinese leadership, had promoted the provision of priority to public transport in
cities in official documents and public announcements. The Bank had supported development
programs in Liaoning and had around $400 million investments in four previous urban
infrastructure projects in the province. Following this successful development partnership with
Liaoning, the central and provincial governments requested Bank support for a series of
additional urban infrastructure investment projects, including urban transport, environment and
heating investments in high-priority medium-sized cities.

1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

3.      The objective of the project was to assist the project cities in enhancing: (i) the
performance and quality of their existing urban transport infrastructure in terms of mobility,
access, and safety; (ii) the efficiency and effectiveness of their urban public transport and road
maintenance services; and (iii) the responsiveness of their urban transport systems to the needs of
population without access to private motorized vehicles. The indicators used to measure project
outcomes were as follows. Details of the PDOs and monitoring results are in Annex 1.

A.         Indicators relating to the performance of the road network were measured through:

      The World Bank. May 2006. Country Partnership Strategy for the People’s Republic of China for the
      Period of FY2006-FY2010, approved by the Board on May 23, 2006.

                                                     1
           1.   Satisfaction levels with transport facilities (mobility, access, safety) expressed by a
                panel of public participants;
           2.   The percentage of the road network functioning as an all-weather road;
           3.   Weighted travel time for all users (bicycles, cars, buses, pedestrians) over a selected
                set of travel itineraries;
           4.   Number of traffic accident fatalities; and
           5.   Use of open competitive bidding methods on a pilot basis to award maintenance
                contracts.

B.         Indicators relating to public transport services were measured through:

           6.  Satisfaction levels with public transport services, expressed by a panel of public
               participants;
           7. Competitive award of bus route franchises to multiple independent operators on a
               pilot basis;
           8. Improved level of bus service (measured by the number of bus passengers and
               vehicle kilometer of revenue service) in at least one project city;
           9. Network coverage of public transport, measured in route-kilometer (km) per square
               km; and
           10. Adoption of effective bus priority measures, as measured by differences in the
               operating speeds along priority sections.

1.3        Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

4.     There were no changes to the PDO. However, specific definitions and baselines of some
outcome indicators were revised during project restructuring, including:

5.       Indicator 3c(i). This indicator which measures travel time in minutes between the railway
station and the city hall in Jinzhou was replaced by measurement on a different control pair. The
original indicator was dropped since the Zhongyang Road, originally targeted for improvement,
would not be improved due to lack of financing. Instead, Jinzhou would calculate travel times on
an alternative travel pair from the railway station to the stadium (Jiefang Street), which would be
improved under the project.

6.       Indicator 5. This indicator was redefined. It was originally measured in terms of actual
costs, in RMB/m3. However, experience showed that variations in asphalt prices (reflecting
volatility in oil prices during the project implementation period) swamped any evidence of
efficiency gain from open competitive bidding. The revised indicator would measure the ratio
between actual and estimated cost in open competitive bidding. This indicator applied to account
contracts above a threshold of RMB500,000, for which competitive bidding was required.

1.4        Main Beneficiaries

7.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not explicitly specify the project’s main
beneficiaries. 2 Based on the PDO and the components, it could be inferred that a large portion of
transport users in the six project cities, including motorists, public transport passengers, cyclists,
pedestrians and people with disabilities could benefit directly from the improvements introduced

by this project. People in the project cities also stood to benefit from the incremental job
opportunities, improved investment climate and enhanced economic competitiveness. Various
transport agencies in the cities were also beneficiaries, with improved capacities fostered during
the course of this project.

1.5       Original Components

8.       The project covered the cities of Panjin, Jinzhou, Fushun, Benxi, and Liaoyang
municipalities, and the county town of Dengta in Liaoyang municipality. A brief description of
the original approved project components follows:

A.        Road Infrastructure and Reconstruction Component (RI) [$330.93 million, including
          resettlement costs of $105.1 million] included road improvements in the primary,
          secondary and tertiary networks that would address current transport problems and
          bottlenecks.
B.        Secondary Road Rehabilitation and Road Maintenance Equipment Component (RM)
          [$113.40 million] financed rehabilitation of major segments of the participating cities’
          road network to improve last-mile access to pedestrians and bicyclists, and finance road
          maintenance equipment.
C.        Traffic Safety and Traffic Management Component (TS) [$22.18 million] supported the
          implementation of the National Road Safety Law through enhanced traffic management,
          monitoring and traffic control systems (including traffic signals and intersection
          improvements) to improve safety and traffic flow.
D.        Public Transport Component (PT) [$14.45 million] included provision of bus priority
          facilities and improvements in public transport planning and operations in the project
          cities. It included investments in public transport infrastructure such as on-street bus
          priority and transit oriented traffic engineering, shelters, terminals and interchanges.
E.        Institutional Development Component (ID) [$4.85 million] supported technical assistance
          (TA) in transport planning and management, reform in road maintenance practices and in
          the structure of the public transport industry, and includes project management assistance
          for the implementation agency (LUCRPO).

1.6       Revised Components

9.       The project components were not revised, but the size of the project components was
adjusted at the project restructuring, mainly on (i) reducing the investment for the Road
Infrastructure and Reconstruction component by $83 million; (ii) increasing investment for the
Secondary Road Rehabilitation and Road Maintenance Equipment component by $57 million;
and (iii) increasing the investments for the Road Safety and Public Transport components by $10
million and $4 million respectively. (see restructuring for justifications)

1.7       Other Significant Changes

10.     Project Restructuring. On September 18, 2011, the Bank management approved a Level-
2 Restructuring. 3 The changes reflected adjustments in: (i) the dynamics of the urban program of

                                                    3
the six cities involved in the project; and (ii) applicable prices. Several sub-components,
originally envisaged as part of the project, were implemented by the project cities with their own
funds as part of other urban development programs. The changes also reflect the appreciation of
the Chinese currency and increase in factor prices, particularly between 2006 and 2008.

11.      The restructuring included: (i) adjustments to the overall project size reducing it from
$525 million to $473 million; (ii) adjustments to project components with an overall reduction in
the scope for road infrastructure and maintenance compared to the original project and an
increase in the equipment for road and maintenance and the public transport and traffic safety
components; (iii) an extension of the project closing date by twenty-two months to complete
critical contracts for traffic signaling equipment as well as construction of a major bridge in the
city of Benxi; (iv) reallocation of loan proceeds reflecting primarily the allocation of unallocated
funds; and (v) minor changes in project indicators to reflect changes in the components and
implementation experience. The restructuring changes did not entail any adjustment to the
previous environmental and social safeguards.

12.     The restructuring also reallocated the proceeds of the loan among different categories.
The most significant change was the allocation of $18.93 million “unallocated” funds to the
expenditure category “Goods”. In addition, $1.985 million “civil works” funds and $0.68 million
“consultants’ services, training and workshops” funds were also reallocated to the category
“Goods”.

2.        Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.      Background and Lessons Learned. At appraisal, the PDO was in line with the goals
stated in the 2006-2010 CPS. The project was seen as a response to China’s priorities to
revitalize the northeast “rust belt” through urban infrastructure investments in medium-size cities
in Liaoning Province. Government commitment was strong and explicit. This project was the
first of a series of three urban infrastructure projects in Liaoning Province programmed by the
Government of China. Lessons from earlier projects, especially the earlier urban transport
projects in Liaoning 4 , were well considered, including (a) selecting appropriate capital
investments, (b) promoting Borrower ownership through institutional development, and (c)
arranging proper operations and maintenance.

14.      Project Design and Preparation. The project was prepared in an efficient way – it took
only 10 months from the Project Concept Note (PCN) to Board approval. The project
identification went through an intensive pre-screening process of individual investment proposals,
followed by a rigid and thorough economic analysis for all 115 sub-projects in six cities in the
road infrastructure component, in order to select high-impact capital investments. The project
pioneered the use of an extensive and successful public consultation process, which significantly
influenced the project design and enabled the project to address the transport-related needs of
vulnerable groups and sensitive gender issues. Sustainability and realism of the selected project
design were assessed from technical, financial, social, environmental, and institutional
perspectives. Implementation arrangements were made well in advance. In particular, adequate
arrangements for financial management and procurement were made before project approval,
which facilitated the retroactive financing process and boosted the disbursement rate in the first

     March 30, 1999 and closed on December 31, 2005.

                                                    4
year of implementation. The project design was transformative in helping shift focus from the
traditional orientation of public authorities’ focus on roads and physical investments to a broader
perspective with design driven by road safety, public transport, and considerations of use by non-
motorized and disabled inhabitants of the cities, drawing on wide community participation.

15.     Project Risks. The project identified five potential risks, two Substantial and three
Moderate, toward project objectives. For each of the four project components, RI, RM, TS, and
PT, two risks were identified respectively; all of them were rated as Moderate except the two
risks in component RM, which were considered Substantial. Appropriate mitigation measures
were proposed in response to the identified risks. The risk related to public transport reform was
rated as Moderate in the PT component, but it turned out that the franchising-based reform was
not pursued, as national policies no longer championed such practice.

16.     Quality at Entry. The quality of the project at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory,
although the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) rated it satisfactory in 2010. The Results
Framework had too many indicators and the requirements for data collection and reporting were
extensive, creating a huge burden on the PMO. Similarly, the risk assessment for public transport
franchising was inadequate and the Bank did not take into account fully the role of the national
government in defining policies for public transport tariffs and operational modalities.

2.2       Implementation

17.      Actual Project Outputs. During implementation, the project outputs had significant
changes, which were mainly caused by parallel government investments and evolution in
corresponding priorities, 5 notably the Chinese currency appreciation, and applicable price
escalations. Following is a summary of the project outputs at completion. The details of the
project actual outputs are in Annex 2.

A.        Road Infrastructure and Reconstruction Component. 43 roads with a total 107 km were
          constructed/rehabilitated, including 20 km new construction and 87 km of rehabilitation,
          and 6 bridges.
B.        Secondary Road Rehabilitation and Road Maintenance Equipment Component. Total
          about 4,478,000 sq m of road surface and pedestrian lane were repaired; traffic lights on
          156 km roads and drainage system of 107 km were constructed/rehabilitated; and 141
          units of road maintenance equipment and vehicles were procured.
C.        Traffic Safety and Traffic Management Component. The automatic traffic control (ATC)
          systems in the project cities were improved by installing 824 units of monitoring and
          control facilities; about 34 km of road sections were improved and 45,600 sq m of road
          land marks were installed; and 9 units of equipment/vehicles were procured.
D.        Public Transport Component. 20 bus-priority lines, 11 bus depots, and 196 bus
          stations/shelters were constructed; a large amount of bus route and information signs
          were installed; and 112 buses were purchased in Panjin.
E.        Institutional Development Component. This component was implemented almost as
          anticipated, including 8 technical assistance programs, 5 domestic study tours, and 1
          overseas study tour.

18.     Project Cost and Financing. At appraisal, the project cost was estimated at $525.4
million, which would be financed by the World Bank loan of $218 million (41.5%) and

5
     In 2007, the mayors in several project cities were replaced and the government investment priorities
     were also revised.

                                                       5
government funds of $307.4 million (58.5%). Due to project scope changes, the actual project
costs also had significant revisions. At completion, the total project cost was RMB2,425 million
($397.44 million equivalents), 6 which is about 24% lower than that at appraisal. 7 Among the
actual project costs, the costs for the Road Infrastructure and Reconstruction component and the
Institutional Development component were reduced by $169.3 million (45%) and $1.0 million
(21%); the costs for the Secondary Road Rehabilitation and the Road Maintenance Equipment
component, the Traffic Safety and Traffic Management component, and the Public Transport
component were increased by $67.3 million (59%), $9.6 million (43%), and $4.4 million (31%)
respectively. Upon completion, the project financing was also revised, to 53.5% by the World
Bank loan and 46.5% by the governments. Comparisons of the project costs and financing are in
Annex 3. The major reduction was caused by: (i) an overall reduction in the scope for civil works
for road infrastructure and maintenance compared to the original project, several project items,
that were originally envisaged as part of the project, had been implemented separately from the
project with local funds of each municipality; and (iii) the appreciation of the Chinese currency
from 2006 to 2011. At project closing, US$5.12 million was cancelled from the loan.

19.     Implementation Schedule. The project implementation experienced significant delays.
The project’s Implementation Progress (IP) was rated Moderate Satisfactory in 7 of the 10 Bank’s
ISP reports (see project data for details).

20.       For facilitating implementation, the project used retroactive financing for some civil
works packages within a ceiling of $40 million. Procurement of the civil works packages started
in middle 2006. To help in the procuring, an international consulting firm was engaged in May
2006 to review the engineering design and prepare bidding documents, and a domestic bidding
agent was engaged in June 2006 to implement the procurement. The first group of the civil works
packages (15 contracts) started in June 2006, while the other civil works started mostly in 2008–
2009. The goods packages were mostly procured in 2010. However, the World Bank supervision
mission in May 2007 found that only Fushun and Benxi cities had substantially completed the
first-year targets, which was mainly caused by revisions in government investment priorities. 8
The subsequent Bank mission in November 2007 noted that no significant construction works
were completed in 2007 and only 2 of 39 planned contracts were signed in 2007. The mission
expressed concern at the continued delays with these procurements and asked that the Provincial
Leading Group play a more pro-active role in guiding the project implementation to avoid such
delays in the coming years. However, implementation progress continued to be slow in 2008 and
2009, mainly due to substantial revisions in the project scope and procurement plans, shortages in
counterpart funds in some project cities, and slow resettlement activities and policy changes. In
May–June 2009, the World Bank carried out a midterm review of the project.9 As of April 30,
2009, 15 civil work contracts had been completed; 19 contracts were under construction; and the
remaining 27 contract packages would be procured in 2009 and 2010. In 2010, the project made
steady progress on most of its components with 63 contracts for civil works and equipment
completed, 20 contracts underway, and 17 contracts to be procured within 2011. It was
anticipated that most components could be completed by December 2012, about one year beyond
the original loan closing date. Considering such project implementation status, the World Bank,

6
     The exchange rate at project completion (USD1.00 = RMB6.095) was applied.
7
    At the Level Two Restructuring, the total project size was adjusted to $473 million. Comparing to this
    adjusted project cost, the actual project cost was about 16% lower.

through a Level Two Restructuring in 2011, approved extension of the loan closing date by 22
months and also reallocation of the loan proceeds. Eventually, most project contracts were fully
completed by the revised loan closing date of October 31, 2013, except the contract for the Beidi
Bridge in Benxi.

21.     Beidi Bridge in Benxi. It was the largest investment in this project (about $ 40 million).
The bridge was supposed to cross the Shenyang-Dandong rail line, which required permission
from the rail authority for such bridge construction. However, priority was given to railway
operations when civil works were scheduled. The project had many difficulties in obtaining
construction permits and coordinating with the rail authority regarding construction scheduling,
which led to significant delays during 2010–2013. This was not envisioned at the beginning of
the project, largely beyond the control of the project itself, and could be a lesson for any future
investments in which the railway is involved. During the World Bank ICR mission in January
2014, the Bank task team visited Benxi and inspected the implementation status of the Beidi
Bridge. It was found that its construction pace had improved and was scheduled to be completed
by September 2014.

22.     Public Consultation and Integrated Corridor Approach and Studies and Workshops. The
project established a public participation mechanism during project selection, preparation, and
implementation. The cities consulted vulnerable groups, including disabled people who were
given the opportunity to test the design of the accessibility of the bus stops, intersections and
sidewalks. The designs benefitted greatly from the inputs during the consultation process. Public
participation has become a regular procedure and introduced in the cities’ non-Bank-financed
projects. The project cities organized several HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns targeted at
construction workers. Public opinion as regards satisfaction with the road network, satisfaction
with public transport services and road safety has shown significant improvement.

23.      An Integrated Corridor Approach was introduced after the project appraisal, and
Liaoyang successfully implemented this approach in Minzhu Road. In order to improve public
transport services and traffic management and safety, studies were conducted in each one of the
city, and many recommendations from the studies were accepted and taken actions by the city
authorities.

24.      For institutional strengthening perspective - one of the systematic efforts of the project
was to promote peer to peer learning. Towards this end at least twice a year - coincident with the
supervision missions – the project held a conference at one of the cities that all the cities
participated in. The host city showcased project related good practice - pedestrian facilities,
traffic management, public transport facilities - and some outside speakers were brought to help
focus on project issues (cost estimates, resettlement) or other good practice (safety, public
transport etc.). In addition, several knowledge-sharing workshops were organized, including the
workshops on Integrated Corridor Approach in Liaoyang Minzhu Road and ATC system
installation for five cities.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

25.     PDO Monitoring. An M&E framework was designed to track achievement of the PDO as
well as progress toward completion. The monitoring was undertaken annually throughout project
implementation by the consultants engaged by LUCROP and the city PMOs. Extensive data were
collected and analyzed during project implementation, which were included in the project semi-
annual progress reports. The baseline values for some indicators were revised due to revisions of
the indicator itself, the availability of more accurate data, or miscalculation at appraisal. The

                                                7
public transport reform indicator, competitive award of bus route franchises to multiple
independent operators on a pilot basis, was not pursued as a result of updated national policies.
Generally, the M&E design was too extensive, requiring the collection of large amount of figures
by project cities. The implementation of the M&E framework proved cumbersome, most
indicators were collected with the help consultants. Yet, some of the indicators were useful,
especially the PDO outcome indicators, such as roads in good and fair condition, which were
used by local authorities as part of their own normal evaluation program.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

26.      Social Safeguard. This project included significant resettlement activities that scattered
in the six project cities. The original resettlement plan involved 4,994 households, 677
enterprises and shops, and 31,547 people. Actual resettlement was scaled down because of
cancellations and adjustments of the project components. The final resettlement involved 2467
households, 119 enterprises and shops, and 6080 people. Most of the resettlement activities were
completed in all project cities before loan closing. The local governments implemented the land
acquisition and resettlement. An independent consulting entity monitored the whole process
through consultation meetings, document reviews, and interviews to impacted people. The Bank’s
supervision missions provided continuous and systematic attention to social aspects including
user feedback, RAP implementation – compensation levels for those with and without titles as per
the RAP, the suggestions from the independent monitors, efforts at information dissemination to
all project affected people on their entitlements. During implementation supervision and at the
time of project completion, the resettlement activities had consistently been rated satisfactory for
its best practice consultation and participatory process and compliance with the RAPs.

27.     Land Acquisition and Resettlement. External consultants were engaged to monitor
implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The first external monitoring and
evaluation report was submitted to the World Bank in March 2007. Post-evaluations on the
resettlement activities were carried out in 2010 and 2011 in the project cities separately. The post-
evaluation reports covered many aspects of the resettlement activities, like the institutional set-up,
the legislative framework, actual quantities of land acquired and resettlement, monitoring and
impact analysis, public consultation and grievance redress mechanisms, lessons learnt, etc.

28.      Environment Safeguard. This was a Category A project under OP 4.01. During
component design and preparation, environmental impacts were fully considered, and the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environment Management Plan (EMP) were found
satisfactory. The main potential environmental impacts anticipated during the construction phase
were short-term impacts such as dust, noise, traffic, soil erosion, workers’ safety, and solid waste
from construction activities. The primary potential negative impacts of the project in its operation
phase were higher-than-standard noise levels at a selection of identified locations. Project impacts
on air quality were identified as limited at project inception, since the motor vehicle fleets in the
project cities were generally small. At appraisal, a framework including environmental
management and supervision organizational setup, monitoring approach and methodology, and
institutional strengthening and training, was established to ensure smooth implementation and
quality performance. Considerable efforts were made to follow the EMP and to mitigate and
monitor the project’s impacts. Effective measures were taken promptly to ensure that all
environmental indicators were within acceptable levels at all times. Based on the monitoring
results, noise and air pollution were well controlled and fully met the relevant national
environmental standards and certification requirements.



                                                  8
29.     Environmental Impacts. The environment monitoring was undertaken by the external
consultants engaged by each project city. The monitoring program was designed and
implemented based on the environmental management plan (EMP) prepared at appraisal.
Representative locations were selected to periodically monitor the air, noise, and surface water
which might be impacted by the project’s implementation. As revealed by external monitoring
reports and the Bank’s regular supervision missions, the environmental monitoring activities had
consistently been rated satisfactory for its overall compliance with the EMP requirements. Public
consultation and information disclosure was a continuous process during the entire project cycle.
According to the monitoring results, no unforeseen problems arose during project implementation.

30.     Procurement. The project procurement included over 100 contracts. Procurement for
some packages was ready to start even before appraisal. This was due to the availability of a large
and successful program of retroactive financing for civil works and consulting services. But the
influence of the retroactive financing quickly died down. Very little progress was made in 2007
and the subsequent years due to several causes such as lack of counterpart funds, but also poor
quality of design and technical specifications, delays in the delivery of traffic equipment, slow
tendering process for consulting services, and poor performance by contractors. The Bank’s post
review detected no major deviation from the Bank’s procurement procedures. Only minor
deviations were found and reported to the Borrower through a management letter, involving use
of Bank funds in Fushun for items not included in the project. The city promptly restored the
diverted funds to the project account. Procurement was rated constantly satisfactory except the
January 2008 ISR in which a Moderately Satisfactory was given due to little progress in 2007.

31.      Financial Management (FM). In 2008, some concerns arose about the quality of
financial management when the external audit report for 2007 identified some serious issues of
non-compliance in the use of Bank’s funds in the Panjin and Fushun jurisdictions, which
accounted for 21% and 13% respectively of the Bank loan of $218 million. This had resulted in a
rating of “Unsatisfactory” for FM Implementation in April 2009 ISR. The point relating to Panjin
was that RMB19.89 million had been claimed for work which did not conform to stated
specifications. In Fushun, there were two issues: (i) RMB7.7 million had been claimed for work
which had not been approved by the Bank; and (ii) the quality of some work in other claims did
not conform to stated specifications. The authorities in both Panjin and Fushun and at the
provincial level investigated these issues and took swift remedial action. It was agreed that
Fushun would return RMB7.7 million which had been drawn towards ineligible expenditures.
Fushun PMO took punitive action against officials who were responsible for the lapse and also
initiated measures to strengthen FM arrangements with the help of financial officers designated
by LUCPRO. As regards quality of construction, independent investigations confirmed that the
bulk of the work cited in audit reports in Panjin and Fushun conformed to specifications.
Contractors were asked to correct residual weaknesses and steps were initiated to strengthen
construction supervision arrangements in both cities. Since then, the FM implementation has been
mostly satisfactory in all the six cities.

32.     Operation of the Public Bus Company. One legal covenant (PA, Sec. I.9) required that
the Project Implementing Entity should cause each Project City to notify the Bank reasonably in
advance of adopting or putting into effect any policies which might result in changes to the
following: (a) legal status or corporate form of state-owned bus companies; (b) granting of bus
route or bus network concessions longer than three years in duration; and (c) transfer from
government ownership of bus fixed infrastructure, such as depots, interchanges, terminals, and
maintenance workshops. However, this legal covenant could not be complied with, as the cities
did not have the authority to change the legal status of the public transport companies.

2.5        Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

33.     After project completion, the assets created under the project have been transferred to
different municipal agencies for operation and maintenance.

34.     Road Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance. After completion, the project roads,
including the main roads, sidewalks, street lights, and drainage system, ware transferred to other
government agencies for operation and maintenance depending on the areas of their
responsibilities. For urban road infrastructure and equipment purchased under the project, the
Municipal Urban Infrastructure Administration Division took over responsibility for operation
and maintenance. Similarly, municipal environment and sanitation division and greening and
gardening division took over the responsibility for cleaning and greening of the project roads. All
funds for operation and maintenance come from the municipal government through annual fiscal
budget. The planned contracting out for road maintenance did not take place, because of the
multitude of activities and institutions involved in the maintenance and operations of urban road
corridors, including the need to coordinate among different divisions.

35.     Traffic Safety and Management. In the project cities, the municipal traffic police brigades
are responsible for traffic management, including operating and maintaining the traffic
management facilities installed and the equipment purchased under the project. All budgets for
project operation and maintenance are from the municipal fiscal expenditures. Most project cities
have installed substantial traffic management facilities and operate advanced monitoring systems
(ATC and CCTV). However, the efficiency of the traffic management needs to be improved.

36.     Public Transport. Originally, the project foresaw that the project cities would transfer the
ownership and operation of public transport infrastructure and services to the private sector under
a long-term route franchise contract. However, the cities were unable to comply with this legal
covenant as they lacked the authority to change the legal status of public transport companies.
Currently, public transport operations, including the use of the newly built facilities and buses
purchased under the project, are operated all government-owned companies. Most bus companies
generate some revenues with low tariffs decided by the government. The financial deficits are
covered by government subsidies. Large-scale maintenance and rehabilitation activities also rely
on government funding. Currently, the local governments have been fully funding the bus
companies’ subsidy requirements, and the quality and level of services have been maintained and
expected to continue being maintained.

3.         Assessment of Outcomes
3.1        Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37.     The project’s PDOs are directly linked to two of the three themes stated in the FY2013-
2016 CPS with China: (a) supporting greener growth, and (b) promoting more inclusive
development. 10 The PDOs were consistent with China’s development priorities at the time of
appraisal, and remained relevant at the time of project completion. The design of the physical
components and their associated TA and training proved effective in achieving the PDOs. As
circumstances changed during project implementation, notably the Chinese currency appreciation,
applicable prices and the dynamics of the urban program of the six cities, flexibility and adjusting
the project components in the Level Two Restructuring, including scaling down the RI part and

                                                    10
increasing the TS and PT components ensured achievement of the PDOs. At the time of project
completion, all components remained important to meeting the development objectives of China,
the World Bank, and the project. They were also consistent with the Bank’s prevailing social and
environmental safeguard policies and fiduciary requirements.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

38.     The project met the three PDOs established at project preparation, particularly,

39.       Enhancing the performance and quality of their existing urban transport infrastructure in
terms of mobility, access, and safety. The objective related to enhancing the performance and
quality of existing urban transport infrastructure in terms of mobility, access, and safety, was
achieved. The quality of the infrastructure built in the project cities was good, as was the
equipment. Road conditions in the project cities have significantly improved. The share of roads
in good condition before the project ranged from 41 percent (in Liaoyang) to 60 percent (in
Panjin). After project completion, the shares of the roads in good condition were from 70 percent
(Dengta) to 89 percent (Panjin). Despite increases in vehicle ownership and traffic volumes in the
project cities, travel times along the 12 monitored routes decreased by margins ranging from 13
percent to 68 percent, which met the targets set at project appraisal. The safety indicators
improved significantly. A number of black spots were improved in the project roads, especially
where school crossings existed in Panjin. These were fitted with traffic calming measures, such as
traffic lights and pedestrian signals near the intersections. This led to significant reduction in the
accident rates, by margins ranging from 15 percent to 70 percent. The safety performance targets
set out at appraisal were met despite the increased in vehicle-miles traveled during the project
period. Overall, the satisfaction level regarding transport facilities’ mobility, access and safety
increased significantly across all project cities (increases ranging from 47 to 66 percent),
exceeding the target (15 percent increase) by a wide margin.

40.      Enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their urban public transport and road
maintenance services. The objective related to enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of
urban public transport and road maintenance services was partially achieved. Several bus
corridors were built in some of the project cities such as Benxi, Jinzhou and Liaoyang, which
resulted in reducing the travel time. Annual vehicle-kilometer (veh-km) of bus revenue service
increased significantly, by margins ranging from 16 percent in Jinzhou to 212 percent in Panjin.
The number of public transport passengers increased significantly, between 21 percent in Fushun
and 281 percent in Panjin, exceeding the target by a wide margin. Network coverage of public
transport, measured in route-km per square km, increased by 10 percent (Jinzhou) to 69 percent
(Panjin), exceeding the targets. The capacity building program has improved the project cities’
awareness of international and national good practice in the delivery of public transport services.
Several training and study tours were carried out. Senior officials from project cities visited
Brazil and Colombia to learn from the bus rapid transit operations in cities of these cities. Overall,
the satisfaction level regarding public transport service increased significantly across all project
cities (increases ranging from 27 to 48 percent), which exceeded the target (15 percent increase)
by a wide margin.

41.      However, the plan to franchise bus operations and contract out road maintenance to the
private sector did not take place as planned. This is because the central government made the
policy decision to designate bus services as a social good (like primary health care) to be
provided at subsidized tariffs through SOEs. As a result, the project cities did not have the
authority to franchise their bus operations. However, during the project implementation period,
all project cities improved bus service quality and level (albeit under SOE operation), and user

                                                 11
satisfaction rate improved during the project period. The cities improved quality of public
transport through expanding bus services to newly developed areas, increasing bus schedule
frequencies, deploying new vehicles, and constructing bus priority lanes. Therefore, although bus
franchising did not take place, the intended outcomes of improving quality of bus services was
achieved, as shown by the improved network coverage, frequency, and user satisfaction.

42.     With respect to the road maintenance contracting, only Jinzhou city carried out
competitive bidding for road maintenance. However, the other project cities did not pursue
competitive bidding, in part because of the fact that contracting out with the private sector proved
to be more complex. The maintenance for urban road corridors entails, among other things,
pavement maintenance, utility repairs, and green area maintenance, which are activities carried
out by different municipal agencies. Contracting out would have involved high transaction costs
to organize open bidding with many several contractors. Most local governments therefore chose
to go for “limited bidding” with municipal government-owned construction companies that were
familiar with the works to be done.

43.      Enhancing the responsiveness of their urban transport systems to the needs of population
without access to private motorized vehicles. This objective was achieved. The project established
a public participation mechanism during project selection, preparation, and implementation. The
cities consulted vulnerable groups, including disabled people who were given the opportunity to
test the design of the accessibility of the bus stops, intersections, and sidewalks. The designs
benefitted greatly from inputs received during this consultation process. Public participation has
become a regular procedure, including in the cities’ non-Bank financed projects. They organized
several HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns targeted at construction workers. Public opinion as
regards satisfaction with the road network, satisfaction with public transport services and road
safety, has shown significant improvement.


3.3     Efficiency

44.      Economic Analysis. Economic reevaluation of the project was conducted by the World
Bank ICR task team to re-assess the economic viability of the project after completion. A traffic
analysis was carried out by using the actual traffic counts on the project roads in the six project
cities. The traffic forecast for future years was revised according to the actual traffic and latest
socioeconomic development status. The economic reevaluation assumed that the vehicles on the
project roads could drive at faster speeds with lower vehicle operating costs (VOC) and less
travel time, especially to the passenger vehicles on the project roads and bus lanes. Economic
benefits were calculated by comparing the “with-project” and “without-project” cases.
Consequently, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the whole project,
as well as for each of the project cities separately.

45.      The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was recalculated at 22.7% for the whole
project, which is much higher than that calculated at appraisal of 15.2%. The higher EIRR was
mainly caused by (i) higher traffic level (comparing with that at appraisal, the actual traffic in
2010 was about 50% higher and the revised traffic forecast for 2020 is about 92% higher); and (ii)
the actual unit cost per km for the Road Infrastructure and Reconstruction component was about
20% lower. The recalculated EIRR for the whole project is higher than the World Bank
recommended discount rate. Therefore, the project is still considered economic viable. The
EIRRs were subjected to sensitivity analysis to test different scenarios of the costs and benefits.
The sensitivity analysis results showed that the project continues to be economically viable for all
tested scenarios. If a 20% maintenance cost increase were to be combined with a 20% benefit

                                                12
reduction, the EIRR would be 18.1% for the whole project. The details of the economic
reevaluation are in Annex 4.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

46.      The PDOs remained relevant to China despite rapid changes in the transport sector since
the project’s inception, and are consistent with the latest CPS. In fact, the project’s innovation in
public participation and care of vulnerable groups in urban transport have set pioneering
examples for today’s emphasis in promoting inclusive growth in China and promoting shared
prosperity. Despite recently rapid increases in vehicle ownership and traffic volumes in project
cities, this project achieved, and sometimes exceeded, the original targets set more than seven
years ago in travel time savings and decrease in traffic fatalities. Public transport was improved
significantly with increased ridership and service kilometers, which generally outpaced
population growth. Most the target values for the PDO outcome indicators were met and people’s
satisfaction levels regarding urban transport network and public transport service increased.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development.

47.      A high-level objective of the project was to reduce poverty, inequality, and social
exclusion. The pioneering public participation process undertaken during preparation enabled the
project to address the transport-related needs of vulnerable groups. The project was also designed
to be sensitive to gender issues, by conducting women-only focus groups. Accordingly,
participatory social assessments of the project cities were carried out during project preparation.
During implementation, four public surveys were conducted with special attention to the social
impacts of the project. Several consultation meetings were specially organized for vulnerable
people, including elders, poor and handicapped people, women, and children. Their comments on
the project design and implementation were well incorporated. This project included significant
resettlement activities scattered over the six project cities. During implementation and at the time
of project completion, the resettlement activities have consistently been rated satisfactory for their
best practice consultation and participatory process and compliance with the resettlement action
plans.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening.

48.      During implementation, the institutional capacity was significantly strengthened,
especially at city level. The strengthening was through (i) technical assistance programs under the
project, including consulting services, domestic training, and an oversea study tour; (ii) facilities
and equipment procured under the project, especially the road maintenance and traffic
management equipment; and (iii) implementing an urban transport project of such a large scale,
introducing substantial international experience and procedures, especially in social and
environmental safeguards. The two reform agendas originally envisaged, namely bus franchising
and road maintenance contracting were not achieved because changing government priorities as
discussed above (Section 3.2).

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative).

Not applicable.

3.6       Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

49.      During project preparation, a survey of bicycle users was conducted in Fushun, in order
to identify the need for bicycle-friendly traffic management measures and address concerns
related to absent or poorly designed bicycle lanes, encroachment by pedestrians (often because of
the absence of functioning sidewalks), illegally parked cars, and construction works. It increased
the focus on the need for a high-quality secondary road system to provide critical last-mile access
and to offer bicyclists alternatives to major arterials, where conflicts with motor vehicles were
minimized.

50.     As requested in the loan covenants, four public consultation surveys were conducted
during project implementation. The first survey was conducted in September 2005 to collect the
baseline data and public expectations about the project. The second survey was conducted in
April 2006 to collect comments on the project design. The third survey was conducted in January
2010 to have a public consultation on the project’s implementation. And the last survey was
conducted in August 2013 to review the project’s impacts and sustainability. The public surveys
were conducted through consultation meetings, interviews, and questionnaires. The consultation
meetings were held with different stakeholder groups, including passengers using different modes,
taxi drivers, elders and the handicapped, women and children, and low-income people.
Questionnaires were filled out by sample households and individuals. Based on the information
collected, analysis was carried out and comments were provided to related government agencies
and design institutes. The design institutes confirmed that some of the constructive comments
were incorporated in the project design and implementation, like providing more facilities to the
handicapped and revising the design to increase road safety. During the Bank’s ICR mission, a
workshop was organized on the intensive public consultations on January7, 2014, which was
attended by representatives of several cities which have had similar World Bank-financed
projects (see Annex 6 on Beneficiary Results Survey).

4.        Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

51.     Fast Socioeconomic Development and Traffic Development. The project is located in six
medium cities in Liaoning Province. As with other similar cities in China, the project cities also
have experienced robust socio-economic development in the past 30 years. According to the
provincial “12th Five-Year Socio-economic Development Plan (2011–2015)”, 11 the average
growth rate of Gross Domestic Product for the whole province would average 11% per year over
the plan period. The urbanization rate was expected to increase from 63% in 2010 to 70% in
2015. One development focus was to develop transport infrastructure, including that for urban
transport to meet fast urbanization, especially in medium-size cities. All of these indicate the
project cities would have resources to ensure continuous urban transport development and
maintenance, particular public transport and traffic management.

52.       Promotion of Public Transport. In China, public transport development is specially
promoted to meet the fast growing traffic demand and to improve the urban environment. The
governments in the project cities are deploying resources to improve public transport, including
facilities and services. According to the PDO monitoring, the level of satisfaction with public
transport services in the project cities has exceeded what was anticipated at appraisal; the

                                                   14
coverage of public transport has expanded quickly; and the number of passengers also has
increased sharply. The public transport facilities created under the project, including transport
corridors, bus depots and stations, and vehicles, will be well utilized and maintained.

53.      Improvement of Urban Road Development and Maintenance. As the most important
infrastructure, the urban roads in terms of space and quality have been significantly improved by
the project. The PDO monitoring results show that the satisfaction levels with transport facilities
far exceeded what was anticipated at appraisal. Roads in good condition increased from an
average of 48% of the network at baseline, to 81% in 2013. Each project city has a well-
established institutional framework and capacity to continuously improve its urban roads and
keep them in good condition. With the national 12th five-year plan, there is a renewed focus on
asset management by local authorities, and new capital investment is no longer the only focus.

54.      Enhancement of Traffic Management. Under the project, large amounts of traffic
monitoring and management equipment were procured and installed, which have significantly
improved the capacity and performance of urban traffic management in the project cities. One
project outcome is the remarkable reduction in travel times and accident rates in the project cities.
The traffic management authorities in the project cities are sustaining improvement of traffic
management, including providing adequate and efficient facilities and enhancing compliance with
the traffic law.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The quality at entry was considered moderately satisfactory. During preparation, a multi-
disciplinary Bank task team was assembled to cover all aspects of the project and worked
with the Borrower in ensuring the design of the project met the Bank’s technical,
financial, economic, and fiduciary requirements. Implementation arrangements and M&E
were discussed in detailed and agreed in advance. The project appraisal coverage was
comprehensive, as reflected in the PAD. Working relationships with the Borrower, based
on mutual respect and constructive dialogue, were collegial at all levels. However, the
Results Framework had too many indicators and required extensive data collection which
created a huge burden for the client cities. In addition, the risk assessment for public
transport franchising was inadequate and the Bank did not take into account the role of
the national government policy and local governments’ readiness to go through
franchising their bus operations to the private sector. The procurement package was not
well defined at the appraisal which was one of the reasons for the implementation delay.
Overall the Bank’s performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry was Moderately
Satisfactory, although the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) concluded it was satisfactory
in 2010.

(b)     Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

                                                 15
55.     Project supervision was planned and carried out twice each year. Supervision teams were
by and large appropriately staffed to address and report on implementation issues as they emerged.
Supervision kept constant focus on development effectiveness with prompt attention to flagging
and addressing implementation issues. Appropriate advice and close follow-up such as
management letters were provided by continuous supervision efforts. Risks were managed to
ensure successful achievement of the PDOs. Project performance indicators were tracked and
used to assess project progress. The project supervision visits paid specific attention to fiduciary
responsibilities. Procurement oversight was satisfactory. The capacity weakness in counterpart
government was identified in early procurement assessment and was properly addressed, first
through the recruitment of procurement staff for the PMOs and procurement training by
LUCRPO, and later through the recruitment of consulting firms to assist the PMOs in the
preparation of bid documents, technical specifications and tendering issues.

56.      In response to changing circumstances, procurement plans were updated in the
restructuring and supervision missions to reflect revised needs. Project supervision provided
continuous and systematic attention to social aspects, including user feedback, RAP
implementation – compensation levels for those with and without land titles as per the RAP,
quality of the monitoring and evaluation report, and suggestions to the RAP implementation, and
efforts at information dissemination to all project-affected people on their entitlements. The
Bank’s environmental supervision was of high standard; reporting was comprehensive and clear.
The Bank worked with the governments in ensuring that supervision was meaningful and
followed by adequate actions, for example in the delivery of training.

57.      However, the project implementation experienced delays since early period of
implementation in 2007 due to slow procurement, and implementation progress continued to be
slow in 2008 and 2009 which mainly due to substantial revisions in the project scope and
procurement plans, shortages in counterpart funds in some project cities, and slow resettlement
activities and policy changes. The project design was very complex and the initial procurement
plan did not have detailed procurement packages which caused implementation delay. Although
the Bank task team took actions during and in between the missions, more proactive actions and
assistance should have been provided to help solving these implementation issues.

58.     Overall the Bank performance in Quality of Supervision was considered Moderately
Satisfactory.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

59.     In view of the above, the overall rating for the Bank performance was Moderately
Satisfactory.

60.     The Ministry of Finance and the National Development and Reform Commission both
supported the design and the PDO of the project and showed strong commitment to revitalizing

                                                16
the northeast industrial base through infrastructure investments in medium-size cities. Liaoning’s
Provincial Government had sufficient experience in managing Bank-funded projects and provided
adequate and timely support, including establishing the Liaoning Provincial Coordinating Group
chaired by a Vice Governor to provide high-level guidance and coordination on policy and
institutional issues, managing the designated account for the Bank loan, assisting in overseas
study tours, coordinating with the World Bank, the Central Government, and the project cities’
governments. Municipal governments in the six cities generally supported the project, but with
varying capacity and degree of commitment. In one city there was a lack of support from the
Finance Bureau, which caused slow disbursement and a complaint from a contractor. Overall the
Government Performance of this project was considered satisfactory.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.      The Liaoning Urban Construction and Renewal Project Office (LUCRPO) established
under the Liaoning Provincial Construction Department took the responsibilities of day-to-day
project implementation at the provincial level. In each of the six project cities, a project
management office (PMO) was established to manage and coordinated day-to-day project
preparation and implementation at the city level. During implementation, LUCRPO worked
intensively on project planning, implementation coordination, activities monitoring, procurement
of all consulting services under the ID component and international specialist consulting services
in developing technical bidding documents for equipment procurement, and ensuring
environmental requirements. LUCRPO acted as a focal point in coordination with the Bank,
provincial government, and the city PMOs. LUCRPO managed to strengthen its capacity to meet
project requirements, including recruiting consultants, participating in training and study tours.
LUCRPO took special efforts in implementing the successful public participatory process and
caring for the needs of vulnerable groups. When issues arose in financial management and audit
objections (e.g Fushun) or low quality technical standards (e.g. Panjin), LUCRPO acted swiftly
and caused the cities to take corrective actions in a timely and satisfactory fashion.

62.      The project experienced implementation delays from time to time. As identified in the
QAG review in 2010, early delays were mainly caused by procurement, which involved a large
number of civil works contracts with high demand on processing time, lack of counterpart
funding in some project cities due to increase in prices and appreciation of the RMB, delay in
reaching agreement with the rail authorities on the Beidi bridge in Benxi, lack of interest in
transforming government public transport functions, delays in delivering traffic equipment, poor
quality and technical specifications, slow tendering process for consulting services and poor
performance by contractors. Later delays were mainly caused by slow progress in reaching
agreement with rail authorities regarding the Beidi Bridge construction scheduling. As noted in
the last supervision mission aide-memoire, there were still contracting issues and delays caused
by resettlement issues four months prior to the loan closing. In the end, the Beidi Bridge was not
completed by the loan closing date. Though resolved satisfactorily, deviations of the Bank loan
were found in Fushun and transparency issues were found in Panjin in its early implementation of
this project. At the ICR stage, the implementation agencies could not provide the required data in
a timely way, especially the financial and contract data. Overall, the implementing agencies
performed Moderately Satisfactory.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

                                               17
63.      In view of the performance of the Borrower and the implementation agencies, the overall
rating for Borrower performance was Moderately Satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned
64.     Project Coordination among Government Line Agencies. For the project, coordination
among different government line agencies was a problem in most of the project cities. There was
generally weak coordination between the finance bureaus and the implementation agencies,
especially in Panjin, which sometimes delayed payments to contractors and suppliers. The
coordination with environment and land resource administration bureaus was generally good,
which helped in facilitating environmental approval and processing land acquisition and
resettlement. The delay in implementing the Beidi Bridge in Benxi was mainly caused by weak
coordination with the railway authority. In future similar projects, close coordination between
related government agencies will be needed, including to setup a project leading group at
municipal level, form a joint PMO, and establish a coordinating mechanism.

65.     PDO Design and Monitoring. The designed PDO has 61 indicators, which reflected an
early trend of Bank-financed urban transport projects in China: city-wide intervention with
complex components toward comprehensive PDO. This complex design added challenges in
tracking achievement of the PDO. For example, the target values for indicators 1 and 6, which
monitor customer satisfactory levels on road network and public transport service respectively,
were both set to increase 15% based on the baseline. This design required that, to meet the target,
whatever was already judged highly satisfactory would have to advance by a larger step than
would be needed where the starting point was a ‘low satisfactory’ level. The reality is often that
highly satisfactory conditions have less room to improve compared to ‘low satisfactory’
conditions.

66.     Project Design and Contract Packages. The project design was very complex, having
five components scattered over six cities. In all, more than 100 contracts for civil works and
goods packages and 17 consulting contracts were procured and implemented. However, the
project appraisal document had only a summary of the procurement plan without detailed
procurement packages. During implementation, revisions in the procurement packages were made
substantially, which changed the project scope and delayed the project schedule. For future
projects, the project design and contract packaging should be enhanced, so that serious revisions
are avoided during implementation.

67.      Implementation Delays. Although the project had a prompt start due to the use of
retroactive financing, the project implementation experienced a number of setbacks and
adjustments. Implementation delays were caused by a number of reasons, mainly including (a)
large number of civil works contracts with high demand on processing time, (b) increase in costs
curtailing scope of Bank-financed works in some cities and causing others to use their own
resources to make up the short-fall, and (c) delay in reaching a construction scheduling agreement
with the railway authorities on the Beidi Bridge in Benxi. In future projects, design and contract
packaging should be enhanced to avoid significant revisions during implementation. The project
financing plan should be made adequately, including properly assessing the counterpart funds
available and preparing sufficient contingencies.

68.      Training. The financial and quality problems that happened in Fushun and Panjin were
partially due to weak concepts on compliance and inadequate training on requirements and
procedures of World Bank-financed projects. In future projects, education and training should be

                                                18
enhanced, especially to medium and small cities which have never before implemented projects
financed by international agencies. The training should be provided by the World Bank and
consultants in a timely way and adequately to all relevant people. In the meantime, supervision
should be also enhanced, especially in the early stages of project implementation.

69.      Public Consultations. During implementation, four public consultation surveys were
conducted through consultation meetings, interviews, and questionnaires. Based on the
information collected, analysis was carried out and comments were provided to related
government agencies and design institutes, like providing more facilities to the handicapped and
revising the design to increase road safety. In addition, several knowledge-sharing workshops
were organized, including the workshops on the Integrated Corridor Approach in June 2011 and
on the ATC system in November 2011. During the Bank’s ICR mission in January 2014, a
workshop was organized to disseminate the practice and impacts of the public consultations. In
future similar projects, such public consultations should be well designed and implemented.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
        Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

70.     During the Bank’s ICR mission in January 2014, lessons leant and sustainability of the
project was discussed with the project implementation agency (LUCPRO). Following are some
comments raised during the discussion, which might be incorporated in future similar projects.

71.      Continuing Performance Monitoring. Continue with monitoring the project’s PDO
indicators as a process of demonstrating further continual improvement. For future projects the
identification of appropriate project indicators, establishing baselines and targets, and the
collecting and analysis of monitoring results will be a useful project management tool to
demonstrate success. An appreciation of the interrelationship of data is another important area
that could be beneficially taken into account in future projects to more meaningful conclusions
and assessments of success criteria, e.g. traffic density can affect noise and air quality and so, for
best assessment, it should be measured at the same time and place as the noise and air quality
monitored.

72.      Unifying Data Unit in Financial Reporting. In the financial reports, different units were
used, like RMB 1,000, RMB10,000, and RMB millions. This created some confusion and room
for errors in summarizing financial reports. Consistency in the use of units of measurement is
important and for future projects units should be established at the outset to avoid the potential for
errors.

73.     Rationalizing Differences in Technical Standards. Suggested design standards for several
technical aspects for this project were provided in Annex 5 of the World Bank Guidelines. Some
designs or on-site applications did not follow the guidelines, which were noted by the World
Bank task team in the mission aide-memoire reports, e.g. the local practice of overlapping
pedestrian crossings at intersections. Communication and training on design standards could be
enhanced, in particular to establish a system to ensure that designers and supervisors are
appropriately briefed.

                             (including assumptions in the analysis)

1.       Economic reevaluation of the project was conducted by the World Bank ICR task team to
re-assess the economic viability of the project after completion. A traffic analysis was carried out
by using the actual traffic counts on the project roads in the six project cities. The traffic forecast
for future years was revised accordingly. The economic reevaluation assumed that the vehicles on
the project roads could drive at faster speeds with lower vehicle operating costs (VOC) and less
travel time, especially to the passenger vehicles on the project roads and bus lanes. Economic
benefits were calculated by comparing the “with-project” and “without-project” cases.
Consequently, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the whole project,
as well as for each of the project cities separately.

Traffic Analysis and Forecast

2.       43 roads with total 107 km of the roads were constructed or rehabilitated under the
project. These project roads have well facilitated the fast increasing traffic demands in the project
cities. According to the actual traffic counts provided by the implementation agency, the actual
traffic volumes on the project roads increased about 5.2%–9.4% per year in the period of 2006–
2010 and 5.4%–7.1% in 2011–2013. The volumes in AADT reached 30,749 vehicles in Panjin,
34,765 vehicles in Jinzhou, 39,434 vehicles in Fushun, 32,845 vehicles in Benxi, 33,859 vehicles
in Liaoyang, and 19,991 vehicles in Dengta. In comparing with the traffic forecast at appraisal,
these traffic levels were about 50% higher (2010 traffic). Considering the actual traffic and the
fast socioeconomic development in the project cities, the future traffic was also revised
accordingly. Table 4.1 is the actual traffic counts and the revised future traffic increase rates.

Project Costs

3.       The actual project capital costs were used in the economic reevaluation. To be
consistence with the benefit calculations, the project costs for the Road Infrastructure and
Reconstruction component, the Traffic Safety and Traffic Management component, and Public
Transport component were fully included. But, only part of the cost for the Secondary Road
Rehabilitation and Road Maintenance Equipment component was included (30%–50%) by
considering that some of the costs were not directly linked with the project roads and bus lanes.
Comparing with the cost estimations at appraisal, the actual unit cost per km for the Road
Infrastructure and Reconstruction component was about 20% lower. The cost for routine
maintenance was estimated at RMB0.30 per km per year. It was also assumed that the routine
maintenance cost would be increased by 3% per year by considering the road deteriorations. The
periodical maintenance costs were estimated at 50% of the capital costs and it was scheduled to
be taken place in every 5 years starting in 2017. In the economic reevaluation, all of above capital
costs and maintenance costs were converted into economic costs by using the conversion factor of
0.95.

Project Benefits

4.       The main economic benefits were calculated by comparing the “with-project” and
“without-project” cases, including (i) savings in vehicle operation cost (VOC) due to better road
condition and faster traveling speed; (ii) savings in passenger travel time costs due to less time
spent on the project roads; and (iii) savings in traveling time costs for the passengers using the
bus-only-lanes installed under the project. The VOC savings were calculated using the latest unit
VOC data adopted from other similar project in China. The VOC savings for the project roads
were estimated at RMB0.14 for car, RMB0.55 for bus, and RMB0.16 for others per vehicle-km.
The average speeds were assumed to be 25 km per hour for the “without-project” case, 30 km per
hour on the project roads and 35 km per hour on the bus-only-lanes for the “with-project” case.
The passenger time costs were derived from the GDP per capita of the six project cities in 2013.
Other factors taken into account in the calculation for passenger time cost savings included
average vehicle loads and percentage of work-related trips. The benefit calculation results shown
that the VOC savings took about 33% of the total benefits and the passenger time cost savings
took about 67% of the total benefits including the benefits for the general passenger vehicles on
the project roads and the bus passengers on the bus-only-lanes.

Economic Reevaluation

5.       Based on above assumptions and estimations of the economic costs and benefits, the
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was recalculated at 22.7% for the whole project, which is
much higher than that calculated at appraisal of 15.2%. The higher EIRR was mainly caused by
(i) higher traffic level (the actual traffic in 2010 was about 50% higher and the revised traffic
forecast for 2020 is about 92% higher than that forecast at appraisal); and (ii) the actual unit cost
per km for the Road Infrastructure and Reconstruction component was about 20% lower. The
recalculated EIRR for the whole project is higher than the World Bank recommended discount
rate of 12%. Therefore, the project is still considered economic viable. The cash flows of the
EIRR calculations are in Table 4.3. By project cities, the EIRRs were 10.1% for Panjin, 20.8% for
Jinzhou, 25.2% for Fushun, 21.8% for Benxi, 26.5% for Liaoyang, and 32.8% for Dengta. The




                                                 26
lower EIRR for Panjin is the much higher unit cost for the Road Infrastructure and
Reconstruction component.1

6.       The EIRRs were subjected to sensitivity analysis to test different scenarios of the costs
and benefits. The sensitivity analysis results in Table 4.2 showed that the project continues to be
economically viable for all tested scenarios. If a 20% maintenance cost increase were to be
combined with a 20% benefit reduction, the EIRR would be 18.1% for the whole project. The
sensitivity analysis also showed that the EIRR is more sensitive to the changes in benefits.
Therefore, the governments should keep the roads in good condition and provide more public
transport service to the local residents.

    In Panjin, 2 roads with total 2.93 km were constructed. The total actual cost was RMB44.19 million. The
    unit cost was RMB15.08 million per km, which is much higher than the average of RMB9.21 million for
    the whole project.

The Public Consultation for Transport Design and Implementation Workshop for the Project
Completion Review was conducted in Shenyang, Liaoning on January7, 2014. The workshop
focused on sharing public consultation experience in all stages of the urban transport project
cycle. More than 30 professionals from 5 project cities and 3 other cities that are in the
preparation stage of the Bank projects participated in the workshop, including government
officials, staff of several Project Management Offices and design institutes.

Highlights:

•        Four large public consultation programs were conducted throughout the preparation and
implementation of Liaoning Medium Cities Infrastructure Project. Both the project cities and
Bank team found that there were significant benefits in mainstreaming consultation at all stages
of the project cycle.

•       The following public consultation experiences for transport design and implantation were
shared during the workshop.

        •     Mainstream public consultation into urban transport project cycle is important at all
              stages.
        •     How and When to conduct effective public consultations in different stages of a
              project to ensure people’s participation into the project design and implementation, in
              terms of methodologies, technics, gaining supports from government and
              communities, timing etc.
        •     How to design and coordinate consultants, public consultation consultants, Project
              Management Offices and other stakeholders to improve the design of the project, and
              to introduce the design into implementation and operation.
        •     Case study of Jinzhou was explained with regard to the Federation for the People
              with Disabilities of the city coordinated closely with the project to bring people with
              disabilities to the streets to "field test” issues and ensure proper identification of
              accessibility consideration in the design process.

         Annex 8 Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.       As required, a draft Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the project
implementation agency, which was sent to the World Bank in September 2013. Based on the
comments provided by the Bank’s task team, this draft PCR was revised and sent to the World
Bank in March 2014. 13 The revised PCR covered several aspects of the project implementation,
including (i) project description; (ii) project objectives and implementation; (iii) project
performance; and (iv) overall assessment and achievements. Following is the key points raised in
the revised PCR report.

I.        Project Performance

A.       Project Performance Indicators

2.       Project Indicators to measure the overall achievement of the agreed Project Objectives
were established in the project appraisal document (PAD) in 2006. Baseline measurements and
improvement targets for each of the indicators were also provided. Some Indicators were later
modified and updated as a consequence of changes which occurred in the project. Monitoring of
the Project Indicators was made annually and/or at mid point throughout the project
implementation and was by the consultants employed by LUCRPO or the PMOs and/or by other
Provincial Government agencies. Analysis of this monitoring indicates that improvement has
been progressively achieved in most aspects. In particular, public opinion as regards satisfaction
with the road network, satisfaction with public transport services and road safety showed
significant improvement. One of the major project outcomes is the increasing of the traffic flow
and the accessibility of the project cities.

B.       Environment, Social Culture and Other Impacts

3.      According to the Environment Impact Assessment of the Project and the loan agreement
signed with the World Bank, Liaoning Provincial Environmental Monitoring Station carried out
the environment monitoring work of this project, and the company has drawn up Environmental
Management of Construction Period which has been given to related units and held environment
protection training to ensure the environmental work to be qualified. In addition, the environment
assessment examined the environmental and social impacts caused by the construction and
operation, and the conclusion was that the project would not cause serious negative effects on
premise that the remission and management measures suggested carried out.

4.     During the implementation stage, environmental monitoring and remission measures fit
the EIA report and summary of the EIA report. To minimize the negative impacts to the
environment, the measures included:

            Ecological protection measures;
            Noise control measures;
            Measures of air quality protection;
            Choosing suitable selection and taking protection for sensitive materials;
            Traffic control and so on.

5.      People’s living had developed as a result of the implementation of the Project. During the
planning and implementation of the Project, it was useful to consult the affected people around.
This process involved the discussion with representatives of the affected people, on –site
investigation of local officials, explaining the purpose and scope of the project to the beneficiaries,
arrangements for the affected people and migrants. The outcome of the public consultation has
been considered during the design and implementation of the project.

C.      Performance of LUCPRO

6.       Throughout the project implementation management team namely LUCRPO and the
PMOs in the six cities have endeavored to meet the technical, quality, project management and
financial standards necessary for successful implementation of the project. They have benefited
from the guidance and training provided by the World Bank. The PMOs have provided comments
on the success factors of the project as regards their respective cities. Success factors which the
PMOs consider to have been particularly noteworthy and which are common to most cities
include:

           Improvements to transport arrangements.
           Very successful public consultation and supports from the society.
           Improvements to the living environment.
           The use of tactile strips on sidewalks.
           IC Card and ACT systems.
           Better maintenance as a result of equipment provided.

7.      LUCRPO share the opinions of the PMOs as regards these success factors and of
considerable improvements that have been made as a result of this project.

8.       A challenge for this project has been that since inception of the project, the RMB has
significantly and progressively strengthened against the USD, from RMB 8.037/USD at the outset
in 2005 to RMB/USD of 6.1373 on project completion on October 31, 2013 and the total World
Bank loan value was not increased and remained at the original value of USD 218 million. This
required continuous review of the RMB value of the remaining available USD balance of the loan
during implementation. This together with inflation in China generally gave rise to the need to
periodically review and restructure the project scope from a financial perspective. Additionally,
difficulties with land acquisition and resettlement, and the interfacing of other urban development
projects in the six cities also provided challenges which required further restructuring of a number
of packages.

D.      Performance of Consultants

9.       The international consultants performed their work satisfactorily in accordance with the
terms of reference. The domestic and international consulting firms engaged in the project shown
satisfied working on national standards and project management, contract administration and
quality control with good international practices.

E.      World Bank Contribution

10.    Performance of the World Bank in completing the project was essential and satisfactory.
The implementation arrangements were appropriate to the project needs and the loan reallocations
adapted to the actual condition of the project, allowing the effective use of the loan. The

                                                 36
inspections made by the World Bank Missions were adequate, the necessary approvals for
procurements were given promptly, and the level of support provided by the World Bank mission
was appreciated. LUCRPO and the PMOs are unanimous in their assessment that the knowledge
and technical guidance and assistance that World Bank provided has been a significant
contribution factor to the successes of this project. This has been particularly the case in respect
of project management which along with other training provided, will also benefit future projects
in this region. The experience sharing presentations provided by the World Bank experts have
added further value to the training and in particular have provided the Project Managers of the 6
cities with good examples which when implemented will ensure that maintenance practice is cost
effective.

11.     The visits by the World Bank experts who provided particular training or experience
sharing presentations were both relevant and of considerable interest to LUCRPO and PMO staff
who attended. In view of the complexity of the World Bank’s working routine, we hope the
World Bank will simplify its process, thus enhance working efficiency.

II.     Overall Assessment and Achievements.

A.      Overall Assessment

12.      Overall the Project Objectives have been largely achieved. The project is also regarded as
a success in terms of the strategic relevance, appropriateness of development objectives, and
through the integration of social and environmental aspects into the planning, design, and
construction phases of the project. Overall financial management of the project has also been
satisfactory despite significant weakening of the US Dollar and the experience of financial
management will also be of benefit to future projects. Progress on Project Component 5,
Institutional Development will be of considerable benefit to the Liaoning Provincial Project
Management agencies in the maintenance operations associated with this project and in
implementing future projects. Building on the training and experience skills acquired under this
project LUCRPO and the PMOs see opportunities to utilize these skills on future projects with
benefits in resource management and utilization, cost effectiveness and technical improvements.
The project has achieved its main objectives and the overall socioeconomic impact of the project
has been positive.

B.      Achievements and Sustainability

13.      Future operation of the project will largely consist of maintenance operations for the
roads and equipment provided through this project. Maintenance operations for roads will include
the improved planning arrangements developed under this project which will make use of the
testing equipment provided to facilitate a more proactive preventative maintenance approach
rather than the reactive approach to actual maintenance problems as was previously used. In
identifying the success factors for this project, the PMOs also provided suggestions on aspects of
the project to be beneficially continued in their future operations of this project.

14.     Public participation and consultation. To better understand the actual needs of the project
affected society, the project incorporated a very wide range of public participation and
consultation process, through many meetings with and surveys on the affected societies, as an
important strategic input into the project preparation to enhance project design and
implementations. A major achievement of this project has been the successful development of a


                                                37
meaningful public participation and consultation process that influenced project designs and
supports from the local societies.

15.     HIV awareness and educational activity. During the implementation of project, a series
of HIV educational activities have been carried out on site through inviting a nationally known
Professor Gui Xi’en to raise public awareness of AIDS prevention due to the tremendous mobility
of male labors worked for project construction.

16.      Bus priority lane. Bus priority lanes designed and built with the specially allocated or
colored asphalt pavement to improve the public traffic and provide guidance for bus lane/station
establishment. The colored bus priority lanes have been realized in some cities like Liaoyang and
are being increasingly provided elsewhere in the other cities.

17.     Improved facilities for the vulnerable. The project has improved significantly traffic
convenience of the vulnerable like disabled and seniors, e.g. dedicated seated, disability facility.
What is worthy to be mentioned is that various kinds of disabled have been asked to cross the
roads in Jinzhou to test the safety and the appropriateness of the road facilities, for example the
introduction of some tactile strips on sidewalks for the blind.
