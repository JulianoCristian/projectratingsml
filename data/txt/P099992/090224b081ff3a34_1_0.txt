                         After seven years of implementation, the project is due to close on October 31, 201. The project was implemented in six project cities of Liaoning provinces, namely Benxi, Fushun,

                         coordinating construction schedule with the Ministry of Railway on a planned railway construction program crossing the bridge. Because of the priority given to railways, the Benxi
                         Bridge construction had to be delayed. However, Benxi has now resumed the construction using its own funds, and expects to complete the bridge by mid-2014. The development
                         objective of the project was achieved. Most of the outcome indicators were met. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is currently under preparation by the Bank and the
