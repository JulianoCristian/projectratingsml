This\n            environmental impact assessment (EIA) evaluated\n            environmental and social impacts as follows : air-born dust;\n            motor vehicle emissions; noise generated from machinery and\n            construction equipment; surface and ground water quality;\n            soil erosion; surface vegetation; impact to communities upon\n            project implementation; solid waste disposal; drainage\n            systems; analysis alternatives with and without the project.\n            As a result of these impacts the project developed an\n            environmental impact assessment (EIA). Some of the\n            preventing and mitigation measures included in the EIA are :\n            avoid excavation and surface leveling during heavy raining\n            season; no traffic affecting construction activities will be\n            allowed during rush hours in the morning and early evenings;\n            low noise machinery will be selected where possible;\n            construction trucks movement will be arranged to avoid\n            residential areas; on dry days water will sprayed at least\n            twice a day; construction waste will be promptly removed\n            from the sites, daily if possible; before leaving\n            construction sites trucks wheels will be washed to limit\n            dust propagation; temporary settling ponds will be\n            constructed near the site to intercept contaminated runoff\n            or wastewaters and remove suspended solid waste before\n            allowing to discharge; constructors will be required to\n            recycle and reuse building demolition waste; project area\n            will be landscaped and replanted following construction;\n            contractors will notify PMO and relics authority when\n            cultural or archeological relics are found before continuing\n            operations; contractors personnel will be required to\n            participate in a mandatory environmental training program\n            before the start of any construction activity; to protect\n            pedestrians and bicycles, construction of pavement paths,\n            pedestrian bridges and bicycle lanes will be recommended;\n            and finally, provide project affected people the\n            opportunities to express their opinions and concerns about\n            the project activities. Additionally, fostering a\n            consultation process, the project will better receive the\n            support of the public and avoid solutions to potential\n            conflicts between developments and protection of the natural\n            environment and the communities."}, "docdt": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
