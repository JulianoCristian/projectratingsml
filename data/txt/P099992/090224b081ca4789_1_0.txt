                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower's Project Cities in enhancing: (i) the performance and quality of their existing urban transport infrastructure in
                         terms of mobility, access, and safety; (ii) the efficiency and effectiveness of their urban public transport and road maintenance services; and (iii) the responsiveness of
                         their urban transport systems to the needs of population without access to private motorized vehicles.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The project is set to achieve its Development Objective. Project implementation has accelerated since the last mission in December 2012. The largest remaining works for Beidi
                         Bridge in Benxi is now under construction and will be completed before loan closing. The final technical assistance/capacity building contract has been awarded and is under
                         implementation. The other remaining components are smaller in size and are expected to be implemented prior to the closing date.
                         Project funds are fully allocated for all cities, except for Benxi. In the case of Benxi, since the project now covers one bridge instead of two, Benxi had loan savings of about US$11

                         million. Benxi submitted a proposal to use the savings for components that were already included in the original project description but could not be implemented due to adequate
                         funds at that time. Since the proposal was part of the original PDO and components, it was agreed to bring back these project civil works and allow Benxi to utilize the funds freed up
                         by the cancellation of one bridge. The new works in Benxi have already been contract out and are under implementation to be completed before closing date.
                         The Implementations for the Area Traffic Control System in five cities is ongoing, although disbursement is lagging behind in part because the agency executing this component is
                         different from the main PIU. The PMO is working with the respective city PIUs to speed up the disbursement for this component and the team is following up closely with the PMO.
                         The next and final supervision mission is planned for June 24-28, 2013. An ICR mission will be carried out in October 2013. Given this project is one of the early urban transport
                         project, the team proposes to carry out an intensive learning ICR to draw deep lessons that can be applied to the growing urban transport portfolio.
