                         The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower's Project Cities in enhancing: (i) the performance and quality of their existing urban transport infrastructure
                         in terms of mobility, access, and safety; (ii) the efficiency and effectiveness of their urban public transport and road maintenance services; and (iii) the
                         responsiveness of their urban transport systems to the needs of population without access to private motorized vehicles.
