Preface
This report reviews the achievements under Credit 428-IND to the
P.T. Jakarta Industrial Estate PuLogadung (P.T. JIEP), to help finance the
establishment of an industrial estate at Pulogadung on the outskirts of
Jakarta. The Credit of US$16.5 million was to cover about 27.5Z of the total
development cost of the Project including land development, power, water,
sewerage treatment, telephone facilities, and standard factory buildings. The
Credit was approved on September 11, 1973, declared effective on November 13,
1973 and cLosed on December 31, 1982. The withdrawal of funds was allowed
until June 30, 1983, after which the undisbursed balance of $1.60 million was
cancelled effective July 5, 1983.
This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Industrial
Development and Finance Division of the Projects Department, East Asia and
Pacific Regional Office, based on a draft PCR prepared by P.T. JIEP, which was
discussed in the field in July 1984, and on a file review. It focuses on the
Project's achievements in relation to the objectives of the Credit, issues
faced by P.T. JIEP, and lessons learned during the project implementation
period. It generally covers the period November 1973 to December 1983.
Comments from the Borrower have been taken into account in finalizing the
report and are reproduced as Annex 15.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

INDONESIA - P.T. JAKARTA INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PULOGADUNG
(CREDIT 428-IND)
Highlights
In the 1960s and early 1970s, new industries established and Located
within the confines of Jakarta in a haphazard manner due to the absence of
enforced zoning regulations, thus contributing to congestion, pollution and
overloading of infrastructure. The Government consequently started focusing
on the merits of industrial estate development. A Bank mission visited
Indonesia in 1970 and, together with the national planning agency (BAPPENAS),
reviewed the prospects of several industrial estate locations of which
Pulogadung on the outskirts of Jakarta emerged as the most promising. This
was confirmed by a full feasibility study in 1972. The Association appraised
the Project in July/August 1972 and in February 1973 and approved a $16.5 mil-
lion Credit on September 11, 1973. Disbursement of the funds was slow and the
Closing Date was postponed twice. The undisbursed balance of $1.6 million was
cancelled effective July 5, 1983 (para. 1).
The principal objective of the Project was to introduce the indus-
trial estate concept in Indonesia and provide fully-serviced industrial sites
at Pulogadung. This concept was aimed at fostering more rational industriaL
location, thus alleviating urban congestion and pollution, reducing the inter-
vals between project conception and start-up, introducing economies of scale
in infrastructure development, and enabling smaller firms with constrained
resources to obtain the needed space and infrastructure. Other project objec-
tives included the upgrading of waste disposal practices in Indonesia and
enforcement of pollutian control measures (para. 10).
The Project can in many ways be regarded as a ccnsiderable success,
operationally as well as financially. It demonstrated the viability of the
estate concept in Indonesia which is now being replicated on a broader scale
and P.T. JIEP has been estabLished as a competent institution. The Project
experienced significant implementation difficulties. It was the first indus-
trial estate project in Indonesia and, as a result, the appraisal mission
seriously underestimated problems involved in the implementation of the Pro-
ject, particularly in the area of land acquisition. These difficulties signi-
ficantly delayed implementation and increased nominal costs. There were also
several unforeseen developments during implementation which resulted in signi-
ficant changes in project design and resource allocation. These included the
cancellation of the waste treatment plant, an additional but subsequently can-
celled EPZ, and changes in the number and pattern of factory and warehouse
space. Higher costs particularly for land acquisition were more than compen-
sated for by higher selling prices of developed sites, so that P.T. JIEP has
been able to earn a satisfactory financial return as born out by a higher
Financial Rate of Return (17.1%) than originally estimated (13.4%). In con-
stant terms, overall development costs of the Projects were not affected by
its implemenLation delay (para. 13, 34).



- iv -
The lessons learned from the Project are:
Appraisal of industriaL estate projects in Indonesia should give
greater attention to the issue of land acquisition to be sure that
the estate authority has sufficient legal powers and access to land
to ensure that estate work can be impLemented in a timely manner.
More in-depth analysis should be made during project preparation and
appraisal to ensure that environmental factors have been adequately
taken into account including the establishment of standards for
estate effluents and cLear Lines of authority for their enforce-
ment. A satisfactory monitoring mechanism should be established
from the outset.
A tirm undertaking should be obtained from utility suppliers as to
their obligations to provide the necessary services in a timely
manner (para. 39).

INDONESIA - P.T. JAKARTA INDUSTRIAL ESTATE PULOGADUNG
(CREDIT 428-IND)
A. Project History
1.        The growt.i of investment in manufacturing since 1967 created an
unprecedented demand for industrial Land, specifically in the Jakarta area.
In the absence of en: orced zoning regulations, new industries located within
the city confines in a haphazard manner, thus contributing to congestiqn,
pollution and overlo'ading of infrastructure. In 1970, the Government-
started focusing on the merits of industrial estate development and made it
one of its priority tasks. In the same year, a Bank mission and BAPPENAS
reviewed the prospects of various industrial estate Locations near Java's
major urban centers on the basis of preliminary studies. Pulogadung, a
location on the outskirts of metropoLitan Jakarta, emerged as the most
promising choice. A preliminary study in nrly 1971, followed by a full-
fledged feasibility study in 1972 (April),-  undertaken by a team of
consultants from the municipal government (DKI) and Westinghouse Electric
Corporation, concluded that there was growing demand for industrial Land in
Jakarta and Pulogadung was a feasible and viable location. In response to a
Government request, the Bank appraised the Project in July/August 1972 and in
February 1973. Some 530 ha were delineated by DKI for industrial develoament
at Pulogadung of which 422.4 ha were earmarked for the development of the
proposed estate. The Association approved a Credit of $16.5 million on
September 11, 1973 for the Project. The Credit became effective on
November 13, 1973.
B. Environment
2.        General.  The neriod of project implementation was marked by politi-
cal stability and economic growth. During the seventies Indonesia experienced
strong and diversified economic growth with GDP rising at a rate of almost 8%
per annum. This was associated with rapid increases in public expenditures,
total investment and savings. The dominant infLuence was the huge expansion
and large variability in foreign exchange from oil. Oil receipts provided
about 70% of Central Government receipts and heLped finance the sustained
increase in demand via the budget. In 1982, however, there was a sharp dete-
rioration in the economic outlook with real CDP stagnating (showing a 0.1%
decline in constant 1981 prices) - the worst performance in a decade. Total
export revenues fell by 15Z, while imports recorded an increase of 9X over the

estates until 1978 and the Department of Industry (Center of Industrial
Estate Projects) thereafter.

previous year. The decline in oil prices in early 1983 accentuated these
difficulties. To address the balance of payment problems and enable continued
economic growth on a sustainabLe basis, the Government took a number of
steps: in March 1983, it devaLued the Rupiah by 28Z against the US dollar, in
May 1983, it announced the rephasing of many projects to reduce imports and in
June 1983, it deregulated the financial sector by freeing lending (except for
selective priority programs) and deposit rates and eliminating credit
ceilings.
3.        The Manufacturing Sector.  Following the 1973 increase in oil
prices, the industrial sector, including mining and energy, became the fastest
growing sector in the economy with an average annual rate of growth of 11% be-
tween 1971 and 1980. It now accounts for 33X of GDP as compared with 20% in
1970 and for 12% of total employment, 80% of the latter in small enter-
prises. The manufacturing sector grew at an even faster pace (13.0%), but
started expanding at a considerably slower pace from 1983/84 on due to
depressed domestic and externaL demand. Manufacturing exports which in the
late 1970s and early 1980s ;rew rapidly from a very Low base, now account for
14% of non-oil exports ana about 5% of total exports. The industrial sector
and manufacturing account for about 12% and 9% of total employw.ient. Small
enterprises provide about 802 of total employment in the sector while medium-
and large-scaLe, capital-intensive enterprises, which employ only 13% of the
labor force in the sector, contribute about 80% of the total value-added.
4.        During the 70s, industrial policies were inward-oriented.  A high
level of protection and quantitative restrictions favored import substitu-
tion. This and large scale capital intensive government investment resulted
in some structural changes of the manufacturing sector since the mid-seven-
ties. Traditional industries such as food, beverage and textiles declined in
terms of employment and value added relative to modern capital intensive
industries such as chemical products, iron and steel. During the past decade,
public sector investment in industry and mining grew by 17.5% per annum as
compared with overall gross domestic investment of 9% p.a. The industrial
sector which emerged from these policies did not generate sufficient employ-
ment opportunities or export revenues and is characterized by reLative ineffi-
cient, capitaL intensive (mainly government-owned) firms. However, the early
80s saw a policy shift and the third five year development plan (1979/80-
1983/84) places greater emphasis on the manufacturing sector and focuses on
structural changes, employment generation, protection of fledgling enter-
prises, promotion of labor intensive manufactured exports and export financ-
ing. Some progress in initiating this shift has already taken place particu-
larly in the trade sector. Besides the Rupiah devaluation, the Government
introduced over the past two years initiatives in the areas of export finance,
guarantees, credit and insurance. Terms of payment for exports were libera-
lized and exporters' access to working capital eased. Other initiatives in
trade policy were also started.
5.        Industrial Estate PoLicy.  The development of the Pulogadung Estate
was the Government s first step towards a broader national estate development
prc.gram to promote industrial investment, growth and dispersion. Another four
estates were subsequently deveLoped in Surabaya, Cilacap, Medan and Ujung
Pandang, thus increasing the total estate area in Indonesia to some



-3-
1,000 ha. Feasibility studies are currently underway or planned for another
four estates (Lampung, Padang, Aceh and Cirebon), while an additional three
locations are under review (preliminary studies). In addition to the broader
macroeconomic objectives, Pulogadung was also intended to concentrate
Jakarta's industrial development in one particular area in an organized
fashion, thus reducing diseconomies such as pollution, congestion and over-
loading of infrastructure.
C. The Project and its Objectives
6.        Project Description.  The original Project consisted of the develop-
ment of a 422.4 ha industriaL estate at Jakarta's eastern border and com-
prised: (i) land acquisition within the boundaries designated by DKI for
industrial purposes (568 ha); (ii) development of land through grading, road
construction, infrastructure and other services, including construction of a
power plant for the settlement of industries; (iii) the construction of stan-
dard factory buildings (SFBs) for rentaL to medium-and small-scale enter-
prisec; and (iv) management and technical assistance. Developed sites were to
be sold to entrepreneurs wishing to establish their own factories. There was
also a land lease option. Five SFBs were to be built with a combined floor
space of 22,400 sq m to accommodate, inter alia, 40-60 smalL factories. Tech-
nical assistance for project execution was to be provided by Westinghouse
Electric Corporation (Westinghouse).
7.        According to che land use plan, about 80Z of the estate area
(338 ha) would be used for industrial sites, while rights of way, open space
and the management complex were to occupy the remaining 20Z. Existing indus-
tries and perimeter village Land accounted for the remaining area designated
for industrial development (not included in the Project).
8.        The project concept included the establishment of a biofilter liquid
waste treatment plant for both sanitary and industrial waste. As the first
such facility in the country, it was intended to serve as a model for upgrad-
ing waste disposal practices in Indonesia. Power was to be supplied from a
substation with a 25MW gas turbine unit to be built, owned and operated by the
National Power Authority (PLN), on whose output estate industries would have
first call. US$2.5 million ot the Credit was allocated for this purpose.
9.        The management complex component consisted of the construction of
two buildings to accommodate the P.T. JIEP administration and other service
operations. Under the Project ic was planned to provide certain basic ser-
vices if and when required by enterprises, such as negotiating government per-
mits and assistance in project development (studies, surveys and consulting)
as well as a range of support services to estate clients such as training,
computer facilities, trucking, warehouse facilities (including bonded facili-
ties), central maintenance workshops, quality control and marketing assi-
stance. Moreover, it was envisaged that the Project would provide technical
extension services for P.T. JIEP's small workshops program aimed at providing
moderately priced space and services to SSEs in support of the Government's
then emerging new concept for this sector. In this context, P.T. JIEP was
expected to play an innovative role by providing services such as assistance
in arranging loan financing in addition to moderately priced factory space.



10.       Project Objectives.  The principal objective of the Project was to
provide fully serviced industrial sites at Pulogadung, in support of the
Government's policy to concentrate industriaL development in specifically
designated areas. The haphazard approach to the Location of industries in the
past, had compounded the difficulties of city development, installation of
utility networks and created ecologicaL probLems. The organized estate
approach was also aimed at enabling smaller firms with resource constraints to
obtain the needed space and infrastructure. It was also expected to foster
modern concepts of plant engineering, reduce the intervals between pro iect
conception and start-up and introduce economies of scaLe in infrastructure
development. High cost and long delays in obtaining access to the necessary
utilities for off-estate sites were beLieved to have deterred many prospective
investors from going into industrial business. Pulogadung was the first step
towards a network of estates to be spread alL over the country which was
expected to contribute to a better balanced industrial distribution. Other
project objectives, also mentioned in the SAR, were the upgrading of waste
disposal practices in Indonesia through the introduction of a pilot liquid
waste treatment facility, enforcement of pollution control measures. indi-
genous entrepreneur development, particularly through P.T. JIEP's small work-
shop program, and fiscal benefits from the operation of the Project as well as
its occupants.
11.       In the course of project implementation, the idea emerged (1978)
that it would be desirable to develop part of the Pulogadung Estate into an
export processing zone (EPZ), particularly after it became apparent that the
Estate Project as designed would not absorb the full amount of the Credit
funds in time due to the deLay in its development. The proposed EPZ would be
almost fully covered with SFBs and storage areas and, as a result, wouLd have
a higher per hectar development cost than the estate project. In view of the
full occupancy of Jakarta's only other EPZ of 10 ha (P.T. Bonded Warehouse
Indonesia), which could not be expanded, the new EPZ was intended to serve as
a pilot project for eventual expansion on a larger scaLe. The introduction of
the EPZ component resulted in additional project objectives, such as the acce-
leration of industrial growth, attraction of domestic and overseas investment,
promotion of nontraditionaL export industries, creation of employment and
demonstration of the merits of a relatively free trade regime. This EPZ com-
ponent, however, did not materiaLize and had to be dropped (see para. 22).
12.       The estate was expected to accommodate about 146 medium/large enter-
prises and 40-60 small ones and to result in a total capital investment of
some $700 million and creation of 55,500 permanent jobs at fuLl operational
capacity. The FRRs were expected to be 20.42 and 13.4% in current and con-
stant terms respectively. (Achievement of these targets is discussed in
para. 14.)

D. Project Implementation
13.       Overview.  The Project can in many ways be regarded as a consider-
able overall success, operationally as weLl as financialLy. It demonstrates
the viabilit) of the estate concept in Indonesia, now being replicated on a
broader scale and P.T. JIEP has been established as a competent institution.
Higher costs particularLy for land acquisition have been more than compensated
fur by higher selling prices for developeJ sites and P.T. JIEP has been abLe
to earn a higher than expected return.  WhilIe nominal development cost have
increased considerably due to the delay in implementation, costs in real terms
are unlikely to exceed original estimates. Despite the overall success of the
Project, considerable difficuLties were encountered during implementation.
Land acquisition problems and the various changes during construction necessi-
tated a repeated postponement of the Closing Date (from December 31, 1978 to
December 31, 1980 and eventually to December 31, 1982) and reallocation of the
funds. Paras. 15 to 26 deal with the various problems in detail. The Project
is now expected to be completed by about 1987. P,T. JIEP has so far been able
to acquire some 377 ha of land (of about 407 ha) - and sell some 180 ha of
developed factory sites (Dec. 31, 1983). Some 8,822 sq m of SFB space was
initially constructed and leased to 21 medium-scale (5,200 sq m) and 75 small-
scale enterprises (3,070 sq m), while 552 sq m of the latter (15 small work-
shop lots) are currently vacant. In 1982/83, additional SFB space
(58,000 sq m) and warehouse space (20,352 sq m) was constructed in conjunction
with the planned EPZ development. P.T. JIEP intends to acqutire the remaining
area (about 30 ha) for consolidation with the existing land and conversion
into marketable sites.  This should now be possible within a reasonak,e time
span and at predictable cost with the help of a resettlement program- which
was recently introduced (1984). There were also a number of unforeseen
developments during project implementation which resulted in significant
changes in project design. These included cancelling the construction of the
waste tre.Atment plant, adding and than cancelling the development of an EPZ
for which the necessary operating license was not obtained, and changes in the
number and pattern of factory space.
14.       As of June 30, 1984, 190 firms have so far settled on the Estate, of
which 45 firms are still under construction. These firms represent a wide
variety of sectors such as printing, electronics, chemical goods, wood and
furniture manufacture, fcod and beverages and pharmaceuticals. About 16 of
these firms are exporters. Total overaLl investment cost so far is estimated
to amount to some Rp 135-140 billion (as compared with Rp 290 billion projec-
ted at appraisal for the entire estate), resulting in an average investment
cost per estate client of some Rp 735 million. Total employment stood about
17,500 workers which is expected to increase to some 21,500 workers when the
3/   This is a reduction from the original estate size of 422 ha (see
para. 17).
4/   This program foresees the resettlement of the remaining land owners at
?.T. JIEP's expense in addition to compensating tham for their land
hoLding.



- 6 -
firms under construction (45) come on stream. Estimates which anticipated the
creation of 55,000 jobs on the basis of an assumed 150 workers/ha and 300
workers/ha for large and smalL-scale firms respectively may not fully materia-
lize. Employment may, however, increase to some 40,000 workers on the basis
of the actual empLoyment average of 119 worker/ha. when the entire estate area
is occupied and may increase further, if the SFBs are leased out to labor-
intensive customers.
15.       Estate Corporation and Managemenc.  P.T. JIEP was established in
1973 on the basis    G Covernment Regulation No. 28 as a limited Liability
corporation (P.T.)- to develop, own, and operate the Pulogadung Industrial
Estate. P.T. JIEP's share capital of Rp 3 bilLion is held by the Central
Government (50%) and Jakarta Municipal Government (DKI) (50%), who also share
membership and responsibility on the Board of Commissioners which has so far
been chaired by Jakarta's Governor. The Board of Commissioners lays down the
company's policies and supervises the full-time Board of Directors. The
latter is responsible for P.T.JIEP's day-to-day management and comprises the
President Director and three Directors, in charge of marketing, finance and
operations. In its early years, P.T.JIEP was assisted by a team of four
advisors under a management assistance contract with Westinghouse which
provided P.T. JIEP with about 10 man-years of advisory services in finance,
planning, estate development, operations, sales and marketing. In 1975 a
UNIDO expert was seconded to P.T.JIEP for six months to assist P.T.JIEP in
designing and implementing its small workshop program.
16.       P.T. JIEP has been satisfactorily mana /de.  It also has since its
inception employed an adequate staff complement.-   P.T. JIEP, nevertheless,
has had to face several implementation-related problems which have marred its
performance, deLayed project completion and consequently also credit Lse. On
hindsight, however, most of these problems can be attributed to exogenous fac-
tors beyond the control of P.T. JIEP's management.
17.       Land Acquisition.  According to the original project proposal, land
acquisition and development of the Estate was expected to be compLeted by 1976
and 1977 respectively. However, by June 1974 it already was apparent (SPN
report of Jan. 76) that the original development plan had become unrealis-
tic. P.T. JIEP's difficulties were further aggravated when it started moving
into more densely populated areas where occupants either refused to sell their
land or demanded unrealistically high prices. This problem was not foreseen
at the project appraisal stage. In the absence of effective expropriation
measures, zoning of this area for industrial development could not be enfor-
ced, and P.T. JIEP had (and still has) to negotiate deals directly with each
individual land owner. In view of these difficulties, P.T. JIEP reduced the
original estate size from 422 ha to about 407 ha. As of December 1983, some
5/   Perseroan Terbata (P.T.).
6/   P. T. JIEP currently employs a staff of 196, including 27 casual and
part-time workers. its professional staff complement (15) comprises
8 engineers, 4 lawyers, 2 economists and 1 accounrant.



377 ha had been acquired, and P.T. _IEP now expects to acquire the remaining
30 ha land within a reasonable time span and at predictable cost by virtue of
a resettlement program which was recently introduced (1984). Under this pro-
gram, P.T. JIEP not only compensates the land owners for the sale of their
land, but aLso resettles them in a nearby area at P.T. JIEP's own expense.
The projected and actual land acquisition schedule is shown in Annex 1 and
summarized in the following Table:

18.       Construction Progress.  Protracted land acquisition did not allow
speedy and cost effective estate development and delayed work completion con-
siderably (now expected for 1987/88). As of June 30, 1984, about 69Z of the
land fill and grading work, 62Z of the surfacing and drainage work, 63Z of
road construction and 692 of the water supply and piping work had been com-
pleted. Due to temporary demand constraints, standard factory buildings
(SFBs) with a total floor space of only 8,822 sq m were constructed as com-
pared with a total planned floor space of 22,400 sq m. The existing SFBs
prov)ded rental sp-ce for 21 medium-size enterprises (5,200 sq m) and for
92 7 small workshops (3,622 sq m) of 72 sq m and 24 sq m for more traditional
small-scale enterprises. In addition, 58,000 sq m of SFB space and 20,352 sq
m warehouse space were constructed in conjunction with a planned EPZ (see
,ara. 22). In view of the lively demand for such facilities, according to
P.T. JIEP also among potential non-EPZ clients, the risk of them remaining
empty was considered negligible even if the EPZ did not materialize. Even-
tually, P.T. JIEP did not obtain the operating license. The additional SFB,
warehouse and storage space, ready for occupation since about mid-1983, has
not yet been leased out despite lively demand since electricity supply and
telephone connections are still lacking. P.T. JIEP hopes to resolve this pro-
blem very soon.
19.       Procurement.  Civil works, equipment, material and services were to
be procured on the basis of full international competitive bidding (ICB) for
contracts of $150,000 equivalent and above in line with the Cuidelines for
Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits of 1972. This ceiling was
7/   P.T. JIEP originally intended to provide 278 such units.



- 8 -
raised for civil works to $250,000 (letter dated October 10, 1979) and even-
tually S1 million (letter dated December 10, 1981) to reflect increased price
levels, speed up project implementation, eliminate unnecessarily cumbersome
steps and because the contracts were proving to be too small to be of inter-
national interest. Eventually no contract was subject to full ICB since the
amount remained below the stipulated ceilings. The non-ICB procedures follow-
ed were clearly spelled out and provided for adequate competition and were
satisfactory to the Bank.
20.       Waste Treatment Component.  The construction of a US$2.6 million
liquid waste treatment plant was also part of the original estate concept.
However, this facility was never built, since P.T. JIEP realized, on the basis
of a pollution level survey. that its estate effluents were less polluted than
the rivers in which they were discharged. In view of this result, P.T. JEEP
shelved the plan to establish such a treatment plant with the consent of the
Association (SPN report dated March 6, 1978). The Association requested, how-
ever, that at least pretreatment of effluents at individual plant level be
introduced to ensure that effluents would meet Jakarta's requirements, if and
when established/enforced by PPMPL. It also requested che pollution level of
effluents to be monitored.
21.       This monitoring took place regularly with the help of Succofindo, a
quasi-government institution. Succofindo's tests, however, were found to lack
consistency and neither the Bank nor P.T. JIEP are fully satisfied with the
current approach, particularly after the Pulogadung Estate was suspected of
being a pollutor by some of the news media. An engineer of the Bank's Envi-
ronment, Science and Technology Division visited the Estate at P.T. JIEP's
request and identified the following problems:
(a) Indonesia's environmental requirements and standards are
currently not adequate for this Project. The Act of the
Republic of Indonesia, No. 4 of 1982, concerning Basis
Provision for the Management of the Living Environment, is far
too general and includes no actual standards. Standards are
planned but not expected to berime effective very soon. As a
consequence, encerprises in the estate area have gone virtually
unmonitored and unregulated.
(b) Pretreatment of effluents at factory level is inadequate and
P.T. Succofindo's test results are not fully satisfactory;
(c) Grading of polluter firms and segregating them is not
systematically done;
(d) Enforcement of pretreatment standards is done by the Ministry
of Environment (together with the City of Jakarta).
Simultaneously, P.T. JIEP sends a letter to the offending
estate occupant. This procedure, however, does not assign
clear responsibility and authority and has proven ineffective.
For zeliable monitoring and analyzing of estate effluents, P.T. JIEP should
hire an environmental or sanitary engineer, unless this capacity can be

estabLished in Succofindo. In addition, standards for the estate should be
*       established, data from the various firms/applicants solicited and segregation
pursued of polluter firms whose effluents require pretreatment.
22.        EPZ Development.  Due to P.T. JIEP's Land acquisition difficulties
(para. 17). not anticipated during appraisal of the Project, the Credit was
not withdrawn as scheduled (see Annex 12) and even a two-year extension in
1978 of the Closing Date did not substantially change this situation. More
than 50% of the funds remained undisbursed by the end of 1980 and the Govern-
ment requested another extension of the Closing Date until December 31, 1982
and reallocation of the remaining funds for the development of an EPZ to be
developed and administered by P.T. JIEP. The idea of such an EPZ emerged
sometime in 1978 in view of the scrong demand for such facilities in Jakarta
and when it became apparent that the Credit could not be fully used up in time
for the development of the Pulogadung Estate. The proposed EPZ would be
almost fully covered with SFBs and storage area and, as a result, would have a
higher per hectare development cost than the estate proper. The Bank agreed
to this proposal on the basis of a Eeasibility study by the Shannon Free Air-
port Developn.cnt Company, Ltd. which recommended the establishment of an EPZ
on part of the estate area (27.6 ha). Its financial viability was evaluated
by P.T. JIEP. To facilitate disbursem ent of the Credit, the Bank authorized
P.T. JIEP to use the remaining funds 8 for estate expansion in the earmarked
EPZ area of 27.6 ha and convert it into an EPZ. This decision was made
despite the risk that P.T. JIEP might not be able to secure an operating
license for the EPZ due to a major dispute within the Department of Trade and
Cooperatives about jurisdictional responsibilities for the construction and
operation of EPZs in Indonesia. It was felt that there was minimal financial
risk since, if the license were not obtained, the area could easily be conver-
ted to a standard estate for which there was a lively demand for SFBs and
warehouse space from potential non-EPZ clients. P.T. JIEP was eventually not
able to obtain the required operating license and the area is now being opera-
ted as a conventional estate.
23.       Workshop Program for Small-Scale Enterprises.  P.T. JIEP is now pro-
vidiug 92 small workshop lots with a total floor space of 3,070 sq m for
small-scale enterprises. However, despite intensive promotion and heavy rent
subsidization,9 P.T. JIEP has not been able to lease out all available 92 SFB
workshop lots at any one time. Fifteen units are currently vacant. According
to P.T. JIEP, the turnover of firms was very high and it was repeatedly faced
with rent collection problems. Moreover, none of the small firms have out-
grown their current space requirements and did not need relocation elsewhere
8/   Except US$1.5 million required for the financing of several studies
(eventually not fuily utiLized).

For leasing SFB space, small entrepreneurs have to pay Rp 1,100/sq m, as
compared with Rp 3,696/sq m for larger enterprises.

in the estate as originally anticipated. On the whole, the small workshop
program has not borne out appraisal expectations, which were not based on a
thorough analysis of such a component during project conception. The
remoteness of the small-scale enterprises in Pulogadung from their natural
markets and their generally low survi%-3l rate are believed to be the major
reasons for the disappointing performance of the program, although they had
not been analyzed in detail.  This program appears not to warrant expansion or
replication in the future, unless the reasons for-its failure and the
prerequisites for its success are determined in detail.
24.       Project Development Cost.  Since the Project is not yet completed,
its total development costs cannot be determined with certainty. On the basis
of the work done so far, P.T. JIEP estimated the remaining costs to complete
estate development; they are summarized in the following Table (for details
see Annex 2).

the planned establishment of the EPZ, make the comparison of actual anj0yro-
jected investment cost not very meaningful.  Nonetheless, total costs  -  in
nominal terms including EPZ related cost (mainly EPZ SFBs) are expected to
exceed appraisal estimates by about about 2.6 times, particularly due to sub-
stantially higher (4.2 times) land acquisition cost. Building costs cannot be
compared in any meaningful way in view of the changes in the construction pro-
gram. However, in real terms, i.e., excluding inflation, total development
cost are unlikely to exceed original appraisal estimates.
26.       S           The Pulogadun,Estate ensures occupants of a satisfactory
electri.ity,flJ and water supply.-   The telephone system, however, is not
fully satisfactcry and provides only about 250 lines, i.e., about 250 lines
short Ti,appraisal expectations and 400 lines short of actual require-
ments .-   In addition, miscellaneous services are also provided such as a
fire station, health center, canteen, vehicle repair station, waste collection
system, design services for factories locating on the estate, bank teller
facilities, industrial safety advice for estate workers, assistance in obtain-
ing government permits such as land use and building plan approvals, audito-
rium, sports facilities, mosque and vocational training facilities. Charges
for these services are comparable to those offered elsewhere in Jakarta and
generally cover P.T. JIEP's cost.
E. Institution Building
27.       The Bank's discussions with the Government on institutional require-
ments for efficient industrial estate development started in 1971 and resulted
in the establishment of P.T. JIEP in June 1973. From then on, the Bank was
involved ii a continuous institution building process through its project
identification, preparation and appraisal work that eventually culminated in
the program of action agreed upon during negotiations (Annex 3). This program
included, inter alia, the following measures: development of regulations
governing industry and building standards in the proposed Estate, long range
program of national and international promotion of the Estate, estate develop-
ment in line with demand, agreement on minimum terms for land sales prices and
rentals for SFBs, request for tax holidays and financial prudence limits for

P.T. JIEP. During its formative stage, P.T. JIEP was also assisted2'" by a
four-man team under a management assistance contract (of June 15, 1973) with
Westinghouse, whose termination was subject to Bank approval. Subsequently, a
UNIDO advisor was seconded to P.T. JIEP, to assist in the introduction of a
workshop program for small-scaLe enterprises. Various issues were dealt with
during project supervision, such as assistance of P.T. JIEP in tryinC to
secure the required telephone connections, proposal of an EPZ (SPN Report of
June 22, 1979), Land sales price reviews to ensure continued financial health,
the proposal of a dividend payout moratorium (SPN report of September 24,
1980) and assistance in P.T. JIEP's endeavor to secure an operating license
for the planned EPZ (SPN report of July 31, 1981). The Bank also introduced a
quarterly reporting format, covering inter alia, P.T. JIEP's construction pro-
gress, sales performance and test results of estate effluents. P.T. JIEP has,
in the meantime, developed into a mature and well managed organization whose
staff is experienced enough to manage and complete the existing estate as well
as take on new tasks such as the development of an Export Estate as envisaged
in the context of an Export Promotion Project planned for implementation in
FY86.
F. Project Operation
28.       Operations-Related Issues.  P.T. JIEP's actual Land sales perfor-
mance, shown in Annex 1 and summarized in the following Table, did not bear
out appraisal expectations and has been affected by perennial Land acquisition
difficulties. However, during the past 2-3 years the slower pace of growth in
manufacturing has also had an affect on P.T. JIEP's sales performance. With
the introduction of its resettlement program (in 1984), P.T. JIEP hopes to
acquire the remaining land area without delay and at predictable cost and com-
plete the Project within the revised timeframe. After revision of the origi-
nal land use plan, only about 297 ha will be available for industrial sites as
compared with 337.5 ha estimated at appraisal. The smaller area will never-
theless accommodate a larger number of industrial plots (+9Z). For cash fLow
reasons, P.T. JIEP has so far not leased any land to occupants in contrast to
appraisal expectations which earmarked 30 ha for this purpose.

G. Financial Analysis
29.        Financial Performance and Position.  P.T. JIEP's financial state-
ments for the years 1977-1983 are shown in Annexes 4 and 5. Its financial
performance was characterized by a fairly erratic revenue stream and 5onse-
quently income pattern largely due to varying demand for its sites.15   Cumu-
lative income (before corporate income tax and management bonuses) for the
years 1977-82 amounted to Rp 4.7 billion, averaging 21% of total revenues.
Cost of s.iles accounted for about 47.5Z of gross sales on average, while gene-
ral sales and administrative expenses have increased almost four-fold since
1977 and accounted for about 27% of gross sales. On the whole, average
returns during 1977-83 to total assets (5.5%) and equity (12.5X) were satis-
factory, notwithstanding P.T. JIEP's poor showing in 1931 and 1982. Since
inception, P.T. JIEP paid cumulative dividends to its shareholders of
Rp 2.29 billion and some Rp 518 million in management bonuses. This resulted
in an average payout ratio of 46% and cumulative retained earnings of
Rp 3.27 billion. According to the Project Agreement (section 4.03), P.T. JIEP
was not to declare dividends (other than stock dividends), unless, after their
dividend has been paid, current assets exceeded th,/e times its current liabi-
lities.  To ensure compLiance with this covenant,-   P.T. JIEP relied on
specific liquidity statements by.its auditors based on the definition for cur-
rent assets and liabilities as contained in the Project Agreement.
30.        P.T. JIEP's total assets have grown from Rp 7.2 billion (1977) to
Rp 23.3 billion (1983), mainly due to heavy investment in land inventory and
SFBs in conjunction with the intended EPZ. The assets base was financed
(1983) by term debts (65.8%), equity (27.3%) and short-term liabilities
15/ Cross sales during 1977-83 fluctuated between Rp 1.6 billion (1978) and
Rp 5.4 billion (1982).

(6.9X). P.T. JIEP's liquidity has been satisfactory throughout (current ratio
of 1.8:1 as of end 83) and its total debt/equity ratio stood at 2.7:1.
31.       Land Price Policy and Price Development.  A satisfactory financial
return on its investment, maintenance of competitiveness and a moderating
influence on the prices for industrial sites in Jakarta have been the major
underlying principles of P.T. JIEP's price policy. P.T. JIEP considers speci-
fically Ancol and Suntar as comparable and compecing locations, where prices
for sites even without infrastructure have generallv exceeded P.T. JIEP's
prices. P.T. JIEP's sales prices are shown in Annex 6. During the past four
years they compare with optional locations as follows:
Land Sales Price
($/ha)
Year          Pulogadung      Other locations

1981               411            192-640
1982               720            240-880
1983               560            180-670
32.       Actual and Projected Financial Performance.  P. T. JIEP's actual and
projected financial statements including a breakdown of its service charges
and general and administrative expenses are shown in Annexes 7-11. Due to the
land acquisition difficulties and consequent delay in estate development,
revenue buildup has been much slower than expected at appraisal. This, how-
ever, did not affect P.T. JIEP's profitability due to its market-oriented
price policy. Cumulative profits followed appraisal estimates quite closely
and started exceeding them from 1982 onward./ Equity buildup from retained
earnings, on the other hand, lagged behi7d.7 in dollar equivalents, but would
have come close to appraisal estimates-8 on the basis of the original
exchange rate. A comparison of the growth of P.T. JIEP's projected and actual
asset base will not be realistic because of substantial changes in the land
inventory and SFB program. Nonetheless, total assets started exceeding
appraisal estimates from 1982 onward and stood at $24.6 million as of end
1983. Due to slow project implementation, disbursements of the IDA Credit was

far behind ,chedule (estimated and actual disbursement are shown in
Annex 12).1
33.       Revised Financial Forecast.  Protracted estate development and site
disposal and conceptual changes have rendered the original forecast obso-
lete. The revised projections for 1984-91 are given in Annex 13. P.T. JIEP
has been able to maintain profitability since the inception of the Project,
largely due to its pricing policy. This is expected to remain so until the
end of the assumed 20-year life span of the project (1991), due to the expec-
ted income from the sale of the remaining sites. -
34.       Recalculation of the Financial Rate of Return.  The revised internal
financial rate of return. (FRR) for the period 1972-1991 was calculated (see
Annex 14) on the basis of actual investment expenditure, capital costs and
revenues for 1972-83, mainly reflecting slower development and site disposal
and Project changes, and P.T. JIEP's cost projection until 1991. The revised
FRR in constant terms 201 is estimated to be 17.1% (before corporate income
tax 21/ and management bonuses) as compared with 13.4% estimated during
appraisal. Given this rate, which does not include residual values for infra-
structure and buildings, the project continues to be a financially sound pro-
position. Economic rate of return analysis was not included in the appraisal
of the project and therefore also not attempted in the context of the PCR.
H. Summary and Conclusions
35.       The Association appraised the Project in July/August 1972 and
February 1973 and approved a US$16.5 million Credit on September 11, 1973.
Disbursements was slow and the Closing Date was postponed twice. The undis-
bursed balance of $1.6 million was canceled effective July 5, 1983. The prin-
cipaL objective of the project was to introduce the industrial estate concept
in Indonesia and provide fully-serviced industrial sites at Pulogadung. This
concept was aimed at fostering more rational industrial location, thus alle-
viating uiZan congestion and pollution, reducing the intervals between project
conception and start-up, introducing economies of scale in infrastructure
development and enabling smaLler firms with constrained resources to obtain
the needed space. Other project objectives included the upgrading of waste
disposal practices in Indonesia and enforcement of pollution control mea-
sures. Project completion and consequently credit absorption has been delayed
due to continuous land acquisition difficulties. P.T. JIEP eventually intends
to overcome these difficulties for the purchase of the remaining area (about
19/  About $5.6 million or 45% of P.T. JIEP's totaL withdrawals took place
during a six month "grace" period after the official Closing Date of the
credit.

SAR also contains an FRR in current terms (20.4Z); the corresponding
revised rate is 44%.

30 ha) with the help of a resettlement program introduced in 1964. Estate
compLetion is now scheduled for 1977/88.
36.       Pulogadung was the first industrial estate in Indonesia and the
implementation problems involved in the Project, particularly the land acqui-
sition probLems were seriously underestimated during appraisal. There were
also several unforeseen developments during project implementation which
resulted in significant changes in project design and resource allocation.
These included the cancellation of the waste treatment plant, development of
an additional EPZ and changes in the number and pattern of factory and
warehouse space. The waste treatment plant was cancelled with the consent of
the Association, when P.T. JIEP realized on the basis of a survey that the
estate effluents were Less polluted than the rivers in which they were
discharged. The EPZ did not materialize since the necessary operating license
was not obtained due to a major dispute within the Department of Trade and
Cooperatives about jurisdictional responsibilities for the construction and
operation of EPZs in Indonesia.
37.       Although some of the original expectations such as the number of
newly created jobs and improvements in waste disposal practices did not fully
materialize, the Project can be regarded as a considerable overall success,
operationally as well as financially, the impLementation difficulties notwiLh-
standing. It demonstrated the viability of the estate concept in Indonesia
which is now being replicated on a broader scale and P.T. JIEP has been
established as a competent institution. Higher costs particularly for land
acquisition have been more than compensated for by increase in the selling
price for developed sites and P.T. JIEP has been able to earn a satisfactory
financial return as born out by a higher FRR (17.1%) than originally estimated
(13.4%). In constant terms, overall development costs were not affected by
the implementation delay.
38.       The compLeted portion of the Estate has accommodated 190 firms
(June 30, 1984), representing a variety of sectors, as compared with between
186-206 which were originally expected to settle in the entire estate. Total
employment stood at 17,500 workers and is expected to increase to some 21,500
as soon as all 190 firms have come on stream. Whether total actual employment
for the entire estate bears out appraisal expectations (55,500 permanent
jobs), remains to be seen. Actual average employment of 119 workers/ha lags
currently behind appraisal estimates of 150 workers/ha and 300 workers/ha for
larger and smaller, labor-intensive firms (including SFB lessees)
respectively.
39.       Several lessons can be learned from the project:
-    Appraisal of industrial estate projects should more adequately
address the problems of land acquisition to be sure that the estate
authority has sufficient legal powers and access to land to ensure
that estate work can be implemented in a timely manner;
-    more detailed analysis should be made during project preparation and
appraisal to ensure that environmentaL factors have been adequately
taken into account, including the establishment of standards for



- 17 -
estate effluents and clear lines of authority for their enforce-
ment. A satisfactory monitoring mechanism should be established
from the outset; and,
a firm undertaking should be obtained from utility suppliers as to
their obligations to provide the necessary services in a timely
manner.
40.       The Role of the Borrower.  The borrower's performance related to the
development of the Estate was satisfactory in the light of the Land acquisi-
tion constraints. Project viability was maintained by the borrower's far-
sighted and flexible pricing policy. Bank recommendations at the time of
project appraisal and supervision were generally welcomed and accepted. An
overall development strategy would have helped P.T. JIEP to pursue a more
systematic client promotion and selection, thus addressing issues such as
segregating firms with risks to the environment and providing sites on the
basis of leasing arrangements for financially weaker occupants.
41.       The Role of the Bank.  After appraisal, the responsibilitv for the
Project was transferred in 1977 from the Industrial Project Department to the
IDF Division of the Projects Department, East Asia and Pacific Regional
office. When the Project was conceptualized, the Bank pursued a dialogue with
the Indonesian Covernment on the rationale and requirements for industrial
estate development and selection of suitable locations. This dialogue even-
tually resulted in the creation of P.T. JIEP which was actively assisted by
the Bank particularly during the initial phases of identification, designing
and development of the Pulogadung Project. The Bank's institution building
efforts were particularly aimed at assisting P.T. JIEP in the development and
introduction of sound operating principles and procedures, financial prudence
limits and price calculation principles. These efforts, which were continued
during the project supervision phase, were instrumental in project implementa-
tion. The Bank was less successful, however, in persuading the Government to
issue an operating license to P.T. JIEP for its planned EPZ. P.T. JIEP has,
in the meantime, developed into a mature institution and the Bank expects it
to play a major role in the planned development of an Export Estate (component
of the Bank's proposed Export Promotion Project) adjacent to the industrial
estate.
