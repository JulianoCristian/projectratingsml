REPORT AND RECOMDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EI3BUTIVM DIRECTORS ON A PRDPOSED
DEVELO1T CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC CF
IND0NESIA FOR THE PULO GADUNG IN]lJSTRIAL
ESTATE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recomendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$1605
million on standard IDA terms to help finance the Pulo Gadung Industrial Eatate
Project.  Of the proceeds of the credit, $14 nd1li-on equivalent would be relent
to PT Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate at 12 percent interest for a terin of 11
years including 5 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
20        The last Bank report on Indonesia (Development Issues for indonesias
December 1, 1972: A73-6/1),s contained a discussion of recent economic develop-
ments, but addessed itaelf principaUly to longer-term policy issues relevant
to the Second Plan (1974-78) now  in preparation. Country data are presented
in Annex I.
3.        Indonesia's economic progress over the five years ending 1971 has been
satisfactory, The rate of growth of GDP, averaging five percent per year in
1965-70, reached 6-7 percent in 1971, but was probably lower in 1972 when food
production, particularly rice, was severely affected by drought. R-Jee imports
to meet the shortages in 1972/73 are estimated at 1.2 million tons, up from
530,000 tons in the precedi jg  syear, Mainly as a result of these shortages
the cost of living indicse escalated towards the end of 1972, so that prices
at the end of December were 26 percent higher than a year earlier, interrupting
the relative price stability achieved and maintained since 1969. HFowever,
secondary price effects have so far been limited, R.ce prices declined in the
first quarter of 1973 and the general price level also fell slightly.
4.         In the industrial sector, there has been further substantial growth
in the production of textiles as well as of other consumer and industrial goods.
The rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises, backed by a continuing
inflow of pzivate investment and conmitments of official aid for several major
industrial projects, suggests that the prospects are good for further industrial
growth from the present small base.  Infrastrmcture rehabilitation and expansion
is underway, financed in large measure by project aid, including IDA credits0
Dsficiancies in the transport, power and telecommunications sectors could, however,
become a  constraint on agricultural and industrial growth unless special efforts
are made to accelerate the implementation of ongoing and future projects.
5.        In the public sector, Government revenuea in 1971/72 were 20 percent
higher than in the previous year. A much larger increase, in the order of 40
percent, has been realized in 1972/73. The largest item in this increase has
been taxes on the rapidly increasing earnings of foreign oil companies. Other
revenues are estimated to have increased by some 25 percent. 2fe estimated in-
crease in revenues of Rp 160 billion (US$387 million) after financing increases



-2-
in salaries azd material expen,iture in the routine budget, allowed  for a
doubling (to Rp 135 billion or fS$326 million) of the surplus available for
the development budget. Together with counterpart funds generated by program
2iZ. "estimated at Ro 97 billion or US$2314 million) this provided for a rupiah
development budget in 1972/73 of` p 232 billion (US:60 million) which was
48 .ercent more than in 1971/72, In addition, project aid disbursemzrnts in
1972/73 are estimated at i? 62 billion (US$1350 millionX,
6.        The balance of payments situation has improved steadi:ly0  Dports,
led by oil, have expanded at an unprecedented rate in recent years, but imports
aave also risan rapidly. FPcorded exports from indonesia rose by over 30 percent
in t,he last two years, and they increased even more in 1972/73, reaching about
US$1,935 million, largely as a result of sharp increases in the volunme and valu e
of oil and timber exports.  Foraign exchange reserves increased ralpiLdly in 1972,
from formerly very low levels, and reached a net level o:!f US$285 million at th,e
end of December 1972. Gross reserves then amounted to UTS$89 rmillion, equivalent
to about three months of total imports at 1972/73 rates and an increase of
USV345 million in the year.  Ma changed situation resulted partly from good ex-
port performance, partly from aU1 inflow of capital attracted by high Indonesian
interest rates' but largely also from the utilization of foreign loans contracted
in 1972 by state enterprises, notably Pertamina, the national oil conpany.  The
Government has since taken steps to ensure effective control over the amounts
and purposes of short and medium-term foreign borrowing which, under the new IMF
standby arrangements agreed on iRiay 4, 1973, will be substantially less in the
coming year than last year.
7.        The Government is now in the process of assessing Indonesiags past
pezformance and future economic potential as part of its preparations for the
Second Plan.  This l'lan will address itself more directly than was possible in
the rehabilitation phase to the issues of employment, income distribution, and
regional development. Although the ability of the Indonesian Government to
formulate and implement plans, pro;graws and projects has improved, limited
managerial capacity presents a Oe-ous obstacle to more rapid growth. This
problem, as well as the continuet.1 leed to improve the mobilization of domestic
savings, will also have to be coansidered in the formulation of the Plaen.
3.        Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the international zup-
port being given in increasing aounts through the IGGI.   Aid cormmitments have
isen from less than US$200 million aquivalent in 1967 to over US$CO million for
1971/72.  The proportion of project aid has steadily increased over this period,
but substantial program aid remains essential as support for the balance of
payments and - in spite of strong domestic revenue eff#Fts - as a source of
add`tional funds for the development budget. For 1972/73, express or implied
co=aitments  made by IGGT members an2unted to some US,$724 million equivalent,
of -rzhich US$320 million was for program aid, including US$110 'Illion in food
sup:lles. In December 1972 the IOI accepted as reasonable and resastic, in



-3
terms of Indonesia's needs, a request for US$760 million in new aid coimitments
in 1973/74. Cf the total, US$L60 million was requested in food aid, with
US$390 million in project aid and TS$210 million in program aid. On May 7, the
IGGI member countries and agencies announced intentions to provide non-food aid
amounting to US$720 million in 1973/74.. Even after allowance for recent currency
realignments, this substantially exceeds the Indonesian request. Efforts will
be made in addition to ensure the timely availability of food aid in the re-
quired amounts.
9.        The soft average terms of foreign assistance in the IGGI framework,
and the rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris
Club agreement with the Western countries and Japan, and parallel arrangementis
with several astern European countries) have kept Indonesia's public debt
service ratio relatively low - estimated at' 11 percent of exports for 1973.
The capacity to service external debt will, however, continue to be limited by
the size of investment income transfers arising from foreign investment in oil,
hard minerals, forestry and manufacturing, which amounted to 14 percent of exports
in 1972. The maintenance of low official debt service ratios during the decade
will depend on the continued availability of concessional aid, restrAints on
short and medium-term foreign borrowing not directly related to export growth,
and the further substantial increases in exports which are now projected.
PART II - BANK   GROUP OPERATIONS   IN  INDONESIA
10.       In order to accalerate the pace of economic development, Indonesia will
require substantial external support for rehabilitation and improvement of infra-
structure and expansion of production capabilities in agriculture, minerals,
forestry and manufacturing. It will also require continued strengthening of the
institutions for development planning and the management of the ecenomy. Wolfare
and income distribution, including family planning, as well as regional develop-
ment and related patterns of employment and population wovemiVts, also-need to be
given an impartantpliace in Indonesia's development strategy.
11       The work of both the Resident Staff in Indonesia and at headquarters
and the lending activities of the Bank Group have been oriented towards these
development objectives. The focus of the Bank's economic work in providing as-
sistance to the Government in the current preparation of Indonesia's next Five-
Year Plan is also along these lines.
12,       Consistent with Indonesia's low per capita income, large external re-
source requirements, amd limited debt servicing capacity, the Bank Group's lending
to Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has thus far been in the form of IDA
credits. The terms of Bank Group assistance to Indonesia are being kept under
continuing review. In recognition of the urgent need for institutional reforms,
most IDA-financed projects have been associated with .major reorganizations of
existing institutions or the establishment of new ones, and most credits have
included appropriate provision for consultant services.



13.       Priority projects inL Indonesia commorly involve a high proportion
of local costs. ben with the substantial program assistance made available
through the I3GI, and Indonesia s improving savings effort, it would be diffcult
to meet her need for capital if external capital lenders were to lend only 'o:;
the import component of prolecte.  The Bank Group has therefore covered some
local expenditures inits fina.ncing amd will continue to do so in the future iz
cases vhere the foreign exchange component of project ex2enditure is lowe
140       Up to the end of June 1973, Indonesia had received 31 !DA creit's
amounting to US$477.8 million,  'he Association accounts for less tha n two pee-
cent of Indonesia's total outotonding public debt   1 By 1978 it is expected to
account for less than ten percer. t of total outstanding debt and lass than one
percent of Indonesia's annuaL dEbt service ob- igations.  Amex II containi a
summary staterLent of IDA credits and UiIC irvestments as of July 31, 1973 and
notes on the execution of on-going projects.
15.       The composition of I1D lending reflects the pTrorities br rehabillitation
and developmeent established by the Government. Indonesia's first ?ive'-Year Kan
(1969-74) gives highest priority to agriculture. The Association has already
extended four credits to help rehabilitate and develop plantations in the Govezu..-
ment estates sector. Other credits for agriculture include four t,o assist re-
habilitation of irrigation systems and one eacIh for a fisheries project, a seecds
multiplication program, beef cattle development, smalTholder rubber development-,
sugar industry rehabilitation, and smallholder tea development. ITnu&stry L; oc-'
growing importance to the Indonesian economy and the Association ihas assisted in
two projects in this sector-0  It organized a consortium of lenders to finaace a
major expansionG of the PUISR1 Fertilizer plant and has assisted in. the reorganiza-
tion and finarUing of BAPINDQO t.Le major state development bank. Other priority
sectors to which credits have been extended are power, transportation, telecowi
munications, education and population. In addition, three technical assistance
credits have been *ade to f.nance prd .investment studies undertaken by the
Government, which have helped to ezi.tablish investment priorities over a Wide
range of activities. A credit to ass'-Sit the establishment of a private devlu-D
ment finance company is e7oeo- ed to oe presented to the Eecutive DLracctors so0.1,
and irrigation, teleco unicatiol    toorism, urban development, raral works,
fisheries, and water supply proje;cts ara in advanced stages of preparation0
160       The first IDA credit, to Indonesia was made in September 1958, and more
than half of all credits have been made since July 1970.  The program is thus new,
and the undisbursed portion o-l the credits ia relatively large.  Virtually every
credit has been associated with extensive instiltutional reforms involving, inter
alla, the creation of new project authorities, drafting of new charters, and
enactrment of new legislation, all of which have, in m, ost cases, taken much time.
Several credits - including the first two for agricultural estates projects - have
experienced delays in disbursement because of management p;roblems.

PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
ILdustrial Developent
17.        Indonesia is still largely an agricultural society. Manufacturing
generates only about ten percent of GDP and is concentrated in a relatively
few industries, with food processing, textiles and rubber processing
accounting for most industrial employment. Only about ten percent of the
18,000 industrial establishments in Indonesia employ more than 300 persons;
the rest are small to medium companies which on average employ about 16
persons.
18.        Although relatively small, the manufacturing sector has been
growing faster than the rest of the economy during the last five years.
A major contributing factor has been the Government's policy, introduced in
1967, of liberalizing a highly protectionist and heavily state controlled
industrial system by removing import restrictions and relying more on
incentives based on tax and tariff relief. The Government has also launched
a program to restore the productive capacity of public enterprises in cement,
paper, fertilizer, textiles and rubber. It has also been rehabilitating and
improving roads, power and other vital infrastructure necessary for an
industrializing economy. The Government has recently turned its attention
to assisting small to medium-scale industry; it has set aside for such
industries a major share of investment credit provided through the state
banking system and established a new agency, PT Bahana, to extend equity
financing as well as managerial assistance to small businessmen.
19.        These measures, together with the overall success of the financial
stabilization program (1966-69), have brought about a substantial increase in
industrial investment. Reliable data on industrial development are few, but
the flow of applications under the Foreign and Domestic Investment Laws,
which regulate new investments, give an indication of the size and growth of
private sector investment. During the period 1967-72, private foreign
investments in the manufacturing sector approved under the Foreign Investment
Law amounted to US$687 million, and investment approvals under the Domestic
Investment Law to US$921 million. Over 45 percent of private foreign
investments and 56 percent of domestic investments approved under the above
Laws were under construction or in operation at the end of 1972, In addition,
a substantial part of the US$855 million in official project aid received from
the IGGI in previous years has been committed to industrial projects in the
public sector.  On the average, industrial investment amounted to over US$4OG
million a year over the period. On the basis of the pipeline of projects
approved under the two Investment Laws, and the project aid committed within
the framework of the IGGI, the Bank Group estimates that investments in the
industrial sector may grow at an annual rate of 13-15 percent in the next decade,
a rate compatible with an estimated increase in GDP of 7-8 percent a year.
Major constraints on future industrial growth will be scarcity of managerial
expertise and the lack of capital resources on suitable terms.
Infrastructure, Location and Industrial Estates
20.        The rapid growth of industrial investment has resulted in
regionally unbalanced development. Despite tax and tariff incentives
offered to investors locating their plants outside of Java, present



-6-
industrial investments have concentrated in and around the Jakarta
metropolitan  area, on account of the many advantages it offers. However,
the high cost of land and long delays involved in building adequate power,
transport, telecommunication aad other facilities have deterred marn
prospective %nvestors. Haphazard locational decisions by those who have
invested compound the difficul-tties of city development and the installation
of utility networks and created ecological problems. It has been particularly
difficult for small and medium-scale domestic investors to compete nrith
foreign-financed projects for the scarce land and skilled labor inputs
available.
21.        To help alleviate these difficulties, the Government of Irdoresia
(GOI) has decided to develoD industrial estates in selected locations.
Planning and installation of infrastructure, both external and internal to
the selected sitespwould be simplified and less costly if large ni=bers of
firms were concentrated in delineated areas the axininLotrative problems
involved in acquiring land Lid obtaining permits by occupant industries would
also be minimized.   Infrastructure such as roads, power, water; sewage and
communications would be supplied by or through the industrial esta'te which,
through economies of scale, would reduce the cost and accelerate the
industrial investment process.  The creation of industrial estates v-ould
also help small-scale and indigenous entrepreneurs who cannot afford to pay
for their own infrastructure needs without seriously undermining their
capital position.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
22.        In September 1970, a Baunk Group Industrial Projects Mission to
Indonesia reviewed with BAPPENA3 (Nat-ional Plarnning Agency) preliminary
studies of various possible -eidustrial estate projects in or near three
major urban centers on the island of Java. Jakarta, the national capital
and major financial and business center of the country, provided mairket
advantages and an ample supply of labor, and was therefore selec-ted as the
location for the first industvrial estate in Indonesia.   Among various
alternative sites available in and arouad Jakarta that were evaluated in
great detail, the one at Pulo Gadung w-as found to be most feasible for early
implementation.
23.        A preliminary study undertaken by GOI in 1971 with the assistance
of Westinghouse Electric CorDoration (Westinghouse), which had offered to
help in developing industrial estates, confirmed that there was a growing
demanrd for serviced industrial land in the Jakarta area, and that a properly
planned and managed estate would be financially viable and economically
attractive.  The study also endorsed the choice of Pulo Gadung as the
location for ITndonesia's first industrial estate.



-7-
24.        The project was initiated formally by a decree of the Governor
of Jakarta in April 1971. A comprehensive feasibility study was completed
in March 1972 and the project was appraised in August 1972 and in February
1973. By June 1973, about 100 ha of a total of 420 ha had been acquired
with funds advanced by the Municipal Government (DKI) and over 50 ha had
been sold to 40 domestic and foreign companies. Negotiations for the
proposed credit were held in Washington from July 10 to July 12, 1973. The
Government's delegation was headed by Mr. Sugeng Sundjaswadi of BAPPENAS.
The appraisal report is being circulated to the Executive Directors
separately and a credit and project summary is contained in Annex III.
Project Description
25.        The proposed project is the establishment of an industrial
estate at Pulo Gadung in Jakarta near the eastern boundary of the city and
consists of:
(i)   the acquisition of about 420 ha of land
within the boundaries of the 568 ha designated
by DKI at Pulo Gadung for industrial develop-
ment;
(ii) the development of this land through grading,
provision of roads, a power plant, utility
connections and other services for settlement
by private industry;
(iii) the construction of standard factory buildings
for rental to small-scale domestic industrial
enterprises; and
(iv) management and technical assistance.
26.        Of the 420 ha to be developed, rights of way, a management complex
and open landscaped space will require about 85 ha, so that about 335 ha will
be available for factory occupancy. The estate master plan provides for
about 150 plots ranging in size from 0.6 ha to 8.4 ha. Five sta_1dard
buildings would be built with a combined floor space of 22,400 m which would
be adequate to accommodate 40 to 60 small factories. The number of factory
plots will be adjusted as circumstances warrant and additional standard
buildings will be constructed if demand by small-scale industries should
exceed present estimates. In addition, provision is made for a management
complex which would house management staff and provide space for services to
occupant industries such as a bank, post-office, product display areas, a
clinic and meeting rooms.
27.        The land requires an average fill of one half cubic meter per
square meter and appropriate drainage would be installed. Main and secondary
roads would have rights of way of 27 and 14 meters respectively and a macadam
surface. Utility lines and pipes would be put underground along the road
system.



- 8 -
28.        The DKI water supply company would connect the estate through a
500 mm pipeline with the municipal water system.   The water distribution
system within the estate, a 20,000 m3 reservoir to meet peak demand, an
elevated tank to ensure adeouate water pressure and a sewage system are
part of the proposed projec-;.  A biofilter liquid wraste treatment plant for
both sanitary and industrial waste would be provided which, as the first
installation of its kind in Indonesia, would serve as a model for upgrading
waste disposal practices in Indonesia. The fire-fighting system would
consist of the necessary ring and submains, hydrants, booster pumps and
controls.
29.        Power would be supplied from substations and a 25 Mw gas turbine
uni-t which the National Power Company (PLN) will build at the estate and on
whose output the estate industries would have first call. The unit
constitutes part of PLN's expansion program described in the appraisal report
of the West Java Thermal Power Project (IDA R73-48-A of May 6, !973).
30.        As part of the project, a 500-line telephone exchange will be
installed and the Government has agreed to make arrangements for the provision
of the necessary connections to the public telephone network.
Organization and Management
31.        The Pulo Gadung Estate has been established as a Perseroan
Terbates or P.T. (a limited liability public corporation). The GOI and the
DKIeach hold half of the share capital of the Corporation. Technical
and management advisory services would be provided by a four man Westinghouse
team, for which a contract has already been concluded.
32.        The P.T. will be managed by a Board of Management (Direksi)
responsible for day-to-day administration. The Board will be headed by a
President Director assisted by ';hree Directors in charge of the operating
divisions for:
(a) planning, deve'lo;ment and operations;
(b) sales and market'ing;  and
(c) finance.
The Board of Management will report to a Board of Supervisors (Dewan Komisaris),
responsible for determining general policy for the P.T., which will consist of
officials from the GOI and DKI concerned with industrial development and
related fields.
33.        A special office will be organized under the Customers Ser-vice
Section of the Corporation to provide specialized services to small-scale
enterprises.  This office will be staffed by a foreign expert atvisor and
three Indonesian staff members with the following functions: to seek out
suitable small industries to occupy the standard buildings; assist those
industries in improving their production, marketing and management techniques;
and find suitable financing for their investments.



-9-
34.        The Government has established within BAPPENAS, a small office
to determine industrial estates development policy, plan strategy and
allocate resources, provide technical assistance and represent the central
government in all dealings with provincial and municipal authorities.
In addition, the Government plans to establish a separate Central Industrial
Estates Authority with appropriate staff and powyers to coordinate and
promote the establishment of industrial estates on a nation-wide basis and
has allocated funds in the 1973/74 budget-for this purpose. When organized,
the Central Authority will take over the responsibilities now being discharged
by the office in BAPPENAS.
Marketing
35.        Forecasts for the occupancy of the estate have been based on
analyses of the experience of similar projects in other Asian countries, a
review of investment applications filed with the Investment Board, and
interviews with some 80 foreign and domestic companies. It is expected that
the estate will initially serve import substituting industries primarily,
but that after the mid-seventies export oriented industries will represent
an increasing share of companies settling on the estate. About one half of
the 40 firms already committed to the estate are domestic; the other half
includes firms 100 percent foreign owned or joint ventures with majority
foreign capital.
36.        Land, pr sently bought by the estate on a negotiated basis at
about US$1.10 per m is being sqld, after development, for US$9.16 per m2if
sold for cash, or US1156 per m4 if sold on three year payment terms, including
an implied annual interest of 18 percent on the outstanding balance. There is
also a lease option, but so far no firm has exercized this because of the
preference for outright ownership. The sales prices and lease rates have been
set at levels which are sufficient to cover all development and operating
costs and to provide a satisfactory return on the resources committed. The prices
have been confirmed as being attractive by actual land sales exceeding earlier
forecasts by more than 100 percent.  The Government might be able to charge some-
what higher land sale and lease rates so as to maximize profits of the estate,
but this could reduce the rate of occupancy and thus impede the Government's
primary objective of maximizing industrial growth and the attendant economic
and social benefits. The estate is expected to be fully occupied by 1980, but if
sales and leases should in the future build up at a slower pace than forecast,
the rate of estate development could be adjusted correspondingly without serious
problems.
Project Cost and Finance
37.        Total financial costs of the project are estimated at US$51.0 million,
which includes US$47-5 million for development of the estate, including US$15.0
million for net working capital. The balance of US$3.5 million is for the
electric power plant to be constructed and owned by PLN. The direct foreign
exchange component of the project is estimated to be about US$12.1 million. The
indirect foreign exchange cost of locally procured items is difficult to identify
and has not been included in this estimate, but based on similar projects elsewhere
this could amount to about US$2.2.million;
38.        Finance for the estate, excluding the power plant, would be provided
from four sources; share capital contributed by GOI and DKI, internally generated
funds, a long-term Government loan from the proceeds of the DA credit and medium-
term loans from local banks, The financing plan is summarized below;

39.     The US$1h.0 million of the IDA credit allocatad to the estate would
finance the direct foreign exchange requirements of the estate and an estimated
US$4.4 million of local currency expenditures (which include some indirect
foreign exchange costs). The amount of the credit allocated to the estate is
based on the estate's resource requirements after taking into account the funds
available to it from all other sourcesa IDA's contribution to the financing of
the estate would be made to the Gsove^rnment on standard credit terms and relent
to the estate Corporation at 12 percent interest per annum, the current rate
for development loans in Indenesia, wvith repayment over 11 years including five
years of grace. This relatively short repayment period is Justified by the
rapid build-up of net revenue in the early years. Loans from local banks would
be on three year terms and would bear an estimated interest rate of 18 percent
per annum.
h40     IDA would finance the foreign exchange component of the power plant,
estimated at US$2.5 million, and the Government would finance the local costs,
estimated to be US$1.0 million. Both the proceeds of the IDA credit and the
Government contribution would be made available to ?L in the form of equity.
Procurement
41      Contracts for goods and services financed out of the proceeds of
the IDA credit would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. A preference margin of 15 percent or the actual tariff, whichever
is less, would be granted to qualified domestic manufacturers.



Project Justification
42.        Prepared sites and services ready for immediate occupancy in an
industrial estate area encourage and accelerate the establishment of both
foreign and domestically owned industries. The cost of infrastructure per
manufacturing unit is reduced, thus leading to lower capital costs, and the
infrastructure itself is more intensely used with attendant savings in
operating costs.  Ecological problems are more easily dealt with.  In the
establishment of a factory in Indonesia, the search for suitable land and
negotiation of land purchases, Government permits and utility connections is
a lengthy and costly process which has deterred prospective investors.
A factory located on the estate would avoid most of these problems and
therefore the benefits of industrial investment, such as job creation and
skill upgrading, fiscal income, GNP growth, foreign exchange savings and
earnings would begin to accrue to the economy much earlier.
43.        Permanent employment for operation of the estate would be small,
only 78 persons at the peak. However, it is estimated that at full occupancy
the estate would provide employment for more than 50,000 persons. Not all of
these jobs would be directly attributable to the estate, of course, but to
the extent the estate accelerates industrial investment, these jobs would be
created earlier than otherwise. Moreover, the working environment on the
estate would be better than that now existing in other industrial areas in
Indonesia.
44.        The financial rate of return over 20 years of operation is about
13 percent. This rate reflects the Government's decision not to aim at
profit maximization in the pricing of land, leases and services, in order to
accelerate the economic and social benefits of the project, but, at the
same tim is an adequate return on the resources invested. Appropriate
provisions have been made in the credit agreement for periodic review of the
Estate Corporation's financial performance and for adjustment of sales, lease
and rental levels if needed to preserve the financial viability of the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between Pulo
Gadung Estate, the DKI and the Association, the recommendation of the
committee provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and the text of the resolution approving the
proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits for industrial
estates projects.
46.        I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

Development Credit.

Cr. No, 127     Irrigation Rehabilitation; US $5 Million Credit of
September 6, _965  Closing Date:  June 30, 1974
This Credit is the first for irrigation rehabilitation in
Indonesia. It covers 201,000 ha. The project includes the supply of
earth-moving equipment and machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation
work on three irrigation systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth
(in South Sumatra). Provision of consultant services is also included. All
the equipment supplied under the Credit is being well utilized and disburse-
ments are 98. of appraisal timetable. The bulk of the cost of the project is
being borne by GOI. Final completion of the project is expected to be
delayed by about two years in order to complete much needed drainage work,
the financing of which is not included under the Credit, The revised econo-
mic rate of return on the project, which was calculated as 509 at appraisal,
is now expected to be about 25%,.
Cr, No. 135     Technical Assistanice; US $2.0 Million Credit of December 27,
1965; Closing Date:  January 31, 1974
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progress-
ing satisfactorily and the credit is nearly fully committed. In order to
complete disbursements for ongoing studies, we have recently agreed to post-
pone the closing date for one year, to January 31, 1974.
Cr, No. 154     Highways; US $28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969; Closing
Date: December 3L, 1973
This credit finances equipment for highway maintenance and
a specific highway rehabilitation program. Initial delays in project execu-
tion arose from the unfamiliarity of the Indonesian officials with Bank
procurement procedures and administrative inefficiencies in disbursement
of local funds. The project is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 155     Agricultural Estates; US $16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Closing Date: June 30, 197L4
Th1s credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. The project includes planting or replanting
of 20,000 ha of rubber and oil palms; upkeep of some 13,000 ha of immature
1/    These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution,

plantation; fertilizers; agricultural machinery and vehicles; processing
plant; and technical assistance for research, marketing, and management;
a development survey of Government owned estates in North Sumatra and a
feasibility study for smallhoader rubber rehabilitation,
The project is about a year behind schedule due to initial
delays in the appointment of management advisors and visiting inspectors,
lack of suitable planting material in the early stages of development and
an unexpected sharp fall in rubber prices which seriously restricted the
availability of self-generated funds, Adequate supplies of good quality
planting material are now becoming available so that by the end of 197h
the oil palm planting program should be on target, There has also been a
recovery in rubber prices in recent months and the availability of self-
generated funds will be much less of a problem in 1973.
While there have been improvements in plantation work,
leading to increased production, weak and inexperienced management continues
to be the principal problem, and the impact of advisors has been mixed,
Improvements are still needf3i in budgetary procedures, financial and opera-
tional control, and overall organization in the Government estates sector,
To achieve management improvements, ensure that planting
and rehabilitation programs are maintained and to see that IDA Guidelines
for Procurement are adhered to, it has been necessary to increase IDA
supervision; and the Agricultural Advisor on the Bank Resident Staff in
Jakarta is engaged almost full-time in helping Government carry out IDA
financed estate projects,
During the last eighteen months, Government has taken two
steps to improve the situation. It ageed an an action timetable for specific
management improvements. It also commissioned a study by management con-
sultants to determine a system for effective supervision and control of all
Government-owned estates. Some of the study's recommendations are being
implemented, Moderate improvements have since been made in reporting and
accounting procedures, but there is still a need to make more effective use
of this information in exercising management control.
Cr, No, 165     Electricity Distribution:  US $15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
This project is progressing satisfactorily,
Cr, No, 193     PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion:  US $35 Million Credit of June 15.
1970 (as amended May 1973) *Closing Date:  December 31 19?75
Implementation of this project began nearly a year later
than anticipated in the appraisal report because of the time required to
meet all the conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid spe-
cifications acceptable to all co-lenders, and to negotiate contracts satis-
factory to all parties, Since the conclusion of the contracts, Part I



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 9 Pages
(construction of an ammonia--urea fertilizer complex with an annual capacity
of 380,000 metric tons of urea) has progressed well, and the contractors,
spurred on by a penalty-bornus arrangement, are now ahead of the new
schedule. Part II (constru-ction and installation of a natural gas gathering
system and a 65 m-ile transruission line to the fertilizer complex for use as
feedstock and fuel anLc to servs other industrial users) has also suffered
delays, but the construction contract has been awarded and the system is now
expected to supply gas to the fertilizer plant when it will be required in
February 1974 for plant testing.
Current estimites of capital cost show an increase of about
25 percent over the appraisal report figures. Part I shows an increase of
17 percent, due to currency revaluations and changes made necessary as
detailed design progressed and the true composition of the gas supply became
known. Part II has been enlarged to increase transmission of gas, in part
to meet the increased needs of the fertilizer complex but also'to s-upply
a greatly increased usage by Pertamina for its refineries and by power
plants. This has increaseC the cost of Pa.rt II by about 78 percent, but
has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer complex since the system
throughput has been increased by 1Ol percent.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result in
increased foreign exchange costs of US $20.2 million equivalent, ncluding
contigencies and a potential bonus for the general contractor if he completes
the facilities ahead of the agreed schedule. AID, OECF and IDA have agreed
to contribute US $4.0 million, US $4h5 million and US $5.0 million respectively
to help finance the foreign exchange cost overrun. The Governmnt will cover
the balance required to complete both parts of the project.
Despite the cauital cost increase, the project has become
more remunerative. The economic rate of return has increased from 14 to 21
percent and, because of recent market developmernts a faster build-up of
sales and higher market prices c<:i be expected than. assumed in the appraisal
report,

Cr, No. 195     Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US $18.5 Allion Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1974
This credit is the second irrigation rehabilitation project
in Indonesia. It includes rehabilitation and drainage works over 186,000 ha.
It provides consultant services both for its execution and for a future
extension. After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of tender
documents and difficulties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is now proceed-
ing somewhat better. Problems of quality and progress still exist and,
although the consultants are tackling these vigorously, the lack of a
President-Director to lead    the Authority is a serious problem.  GOI has



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 9 Pages
been advised strongly to appoint a suitable replacement shortly. Estimated
costs remain within the overall appraisal estimate, but the project will be
one year behind appraisal schedule, Disbursements are still slow and were
about 47 percent of appraisal estimates at the end of Nay 31, 1973.
Cre No, 210     Telecommunications Expansion; US $12.8 Million Credit
Of July 13, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties, orders
for all equipment except the tropospheric scatter system have now been
placed, The management consultants have completed their work, bdt have been
retained to implement the recommendations. There is a cost overrun of
about US $1.0 million due mainly to currency realignments. These matters
are being discussed between Government and the Association to work out
appropriate measures,
Cr. No, 211     Fisheries; US $3,5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This project is part of an overall program to develop
export-oriented skipjack tuna fishing. It consists of construction and
equipment of freezing and cold storage facilities, the construction of a
wharf in Aer Tembaga, and the purchase of 30 wooden vessels for pole and line
fishing,   The project provides technical assistanceto support the program,
Though operations of the project unit, the State Fisheries Ehkterprise, have
been inefficient, the recent appointment by Government of new management
acceptable to IDA is expected to improve the situation, and overall prospects
for successful implementation have improved, particularly since there is an
upward trend of world market prices for skipjack tuna.
Cr. No, 216     Technical Assistance II; US $4.0 Million Credit of September

This project is progressing satisfactorily,
Cr, No, 219     Education; US $4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The project is about 12 months behind schedule because of
the delay in the appointment of the architect, but is now progressing
satisfactorily. Prequalification of contractors for civil works has been
completed and award of contracts is likely to be made by early October,
Equipment lists have been approved by the Association and suppliers have
been invited to register their interest, The leader of the team of overseas
specialists has arrived and is assisting the training of the first group of
technical teachers for the centers, While disbursements were initially
slower than expected, it is likely that construction of the five centers
will be completed in less time than orginally estimated and the final
implementation would thus be on schedule,

Cr, No, 220     Irrigation Rehabilitation III; ITS _l45 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This credit- is the third irrigation rehabilitation project
financed by IDA in Indonesia,   It covers 202,000 ha and inclu des rehabili-
tation and reintroduction of an 0 & IM organization in three irrigation
systems, two in Java and onie in SoutEh Sulawesi. Provision is made for
equipment for both construction and 0 & M and for consultants and manage-
rent assis tance, Construction remains about two years behind schedule.
The problems with preparation of contract documents, which have caused
this delay, rave been overcome and while no further delays are expected,
it is unlikely that the -time lost could be regained. There has been no
further increase in overall project costs, but a review is beLng carried
out to determine the effect of the dollar devaluation on civil works and
equipment contracts yet to be awarded    Disbtrsements are improving at
about 52,4 of the level estimated at appraisal, Sensitivity tests run at
the time of appraisal shoved that a two year delay and l5 percent cost over-
run would reduce the econoTiv.c rate of returr. from. 25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No, 246     Seeds; US 37,5 Million Credit of 14ay l, 1971; Closing
Date:  Sep tember 30 1977
This credit is for the establishment of facilities for
growing, processing and distributing high yield varieties of rice seeds
initially arzA other seeds at a later date.  Project implementation is
behind schedule due to initial delays in organizing management and effect-
ive procurement,  These problems are being overcome, but because procurement
delays, inflation, currencey revaluations and design change of the seed
processing plant, a likeLih`ood of a 30 percent cost overrun became
apparent.  In addition, studies recently comple-ted indicate that the 1980
market size for rice seed m.ay be smaller tha. the project seed production
target. A s-upervision mission ht:k5 recently returned from Indonesia and
its recommendations for re.v*ed-,Tnhg these problems are currently under review
in the Bank.

research is being improved,, Daspite certain management weaknesses in cost
control and efficiency, progress to date is satisf'actory and relationships
between management and consultants are good. Recently revised cost estimates
for factory rehabilitation and expansion are substantially above appraisal
estimates and project consultants have been asked to review them,
