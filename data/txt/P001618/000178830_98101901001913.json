{"cdata!": "The proposed project would assist Malawi\n            in improving the quality of primary education, expanding\n            secondary education, increasing the number of trained\n            accountants and accounting technicians, and strengthening\n            the management of the education and audit systems.\n            Specifically, the project would finance: (a) three new\n            primary teacher training colleges, expansion of one existing\n            college and staff training; (b) 25 new Malawi Correspondence\n            College centers (MCC), other necessary additions to MCC\n            headquarters, technical assistance, and training of MCC\n            staff; (c) one new secondary school and expansion of an\n            existing school; (d) a new college of accountancy and\n            related technical assistance and staff training; and (e)\n            studies, technical assistance and fellowships to the\n            Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Auditor General's\n            office. As a result of the project, primary teacher training\n            capacity would be increased by 80 percent and the quality of\n            teaching improved, contributing to significantly improved\n            completion rates. Relatedly, the number of successful MCC\n            students is expected to increase significantly and the need\n            for trained accountants be met through the 1990's. The\n            project would also strengthen the MOE's planning and\n            research capacity and improve the Auditor General's capabilities."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
