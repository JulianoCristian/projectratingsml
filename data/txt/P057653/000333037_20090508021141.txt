1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       In 1997 the Government of Brazil (the Borrower) presented the strategy and operational
design of the Federal Program FUNDESCOLA (School Improvement Fund). The Program was
intended to assist the Ministry of Education of Brazil (MEC) to improve the educational
attainment of students residing in the country's poorest regions (Northeast, North and Center-
West)2. At the heart of the Program was the provision of technical assistance to states and
municipalities in the aforementioned regions to reduce inequalities and increase school
effectiveness, thereby, maximizing the likelihood of children completing eight years of education
successfully, which is the equivalent to the basic education cycle in Brazil3. The Bank financed
the Federal Program with a series of loans. The first two loans financed the implementation of
FUNDESCOLA I from 1998 to 2001 and FUNDESCOLA II from 1999 to 2004, respectively.
The last operation ­ FUNDESCOLA III ­ was designed to be implemented in two phases over
the period from 2002 to 2010 using an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) modality. As a result the
third series of the Program was divided into two phases: FUNDESCOLA IIIA and
FUNDESCOLA IIIB. Originally, the first phase of implementation was planned to be carried out
from May 2002 to December 2006, while the second phase was to be implemented between July
2006 and December 2010.

2.       The objective of this Implementation Completion Results (ICR) report is to provide an
overall assessment of the FUNDESCOLA IIIA and achievements reached, using the most recent
ICR preparation guidelines while at the same time adhering to the principles of implementation
completion report assessments. Given the (i) relevance of the overall FUNDESCOLA Program in
Brazil, (ii) the scope and size of the overall FUNDESCOLA Program and (iii) the decision not to
move forward with World Bank financing for the implementation of FUNDESCOLA IIIB, the
report incorporates, as needed, features inherent in the Federal Program that have guided,
influenced or affected the implementation of FUNDESCOLA IIIA, which is the investment
operation of reference for this ICR.

3.       FUNDESCOLA I was designed to finance the development of a set of school
improvement and school-based management products to improve equity and effectiveness in the
educational system and, in particular, at school level. The objective was to increase society's
awareness on the importance of improving the quality of education using the school as the unit of
analysis and implementation of specific school-based management products. FUNDESCOLA II
focused on improving and expanding the school-based products developed in the first project,
while at the same time increasing the number of schools participating in the program and
strengthening community and school-level participation in the development of teaching units to
accompany the products. Finally, FUNDESCOLA III focused on finalizing the development of
products and designing test strategies to test product implementation on a large scale. All three
operations of the FUNDESCOLA Program were designed in accordance with the strategy
described here.



2States in the Northern region: Acre, Amazonas, Roraima, Rondônia, Pará, Amapá and Tocantins. States in
the Northeastern region: Maranhão, Piauí, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas,
Sergipe and Bahia. States in the Center-West region: Goiás, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.
3The basic education cycle in Brazil encompassed, at the time of designing FUNDESCOLA, eight grades
(from 1st to 8th). However, in 2006 Decree No. 11,274 expanded the basic education cycle to nine years,
with mandatory enrollment starting in 2010 for all six year olds in the 1st grade, but not in pre-school.


                                                                                                          12

4.       The objective of the overall FUNDESCOLA III was to improve educational attainment
and student outcomes in the Northeast, North and Center-West regions, while enhancing school
management performance in primary schools and that of Education Secretariats responsible for
them in the regions of reference. The FUNDESCOLA IIIA Project, in particular, sought to assist
targeted secretariats of education to reduce the disparities across their primary schools and
increase the effectiveness of these schools, within each local government's financial capacity.
FUNDESCOLA IIIB was expected to follow up with financing for the implementation, on an
even larger scale, of products, evaluations and activities aimed at fine tuning school-based
management and strengthening institutional capacity.

5.       At the time of project design, the Country Partnership Strategy for Brazil (CPS) focused
on promoting long-term sustainable development and economic growth, reducing poverty and
decreasing income inequality. According to the CPS, the weak educational performance of
children from low income backgrounds was among the most important constraints to reducing
poverty and inequality in Brazil. Accordingly, the CPS incorporated as a central goal the
provision of schooling opportunities for all school-age children and the completion of eight years
of basic education by 2007. In addition, the CPS included goals for improving student
achievement performance in Portuguese language and Mathematics. The FUNDESCOLA III
Program was designed contribute to achievement of these goals by: (i) providing assistance to
schools that had begun to introduce FUNDESCOLA's schooling improvement reforms to
consolidate these reforms under the responsibility and support of their Secretariats of Education,
(ii) expanding these reforms to thousands of additional schools, (iii) developing and applying a
new set of teaching/learning models for diverse types of schools and population groups, and (iv)
building the capacity of local Governments to support continuous improvement in schooling
quality, and through incentives and partnerships, promote the financial, administrative, and
managerial permanence of these reforms. Performance indicators to measure progress towards
achieving the goals included: (i) increasing average years of schooling for economically active
populations in targeted regions, (ii) increasing the percentage of youth that have completed
primary school in the Northeast, North and Center West regions, and (iii) reducing disparities in
schooling attainment between the Northeast, North, and Center West regions.4

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as originally
approved)

6.       FUNDESCOLA IIIA's Project Development Objective (PDO) aimed at assisting targeted
Education Secretariats in targeted micro regions to: (i) reduce disparities across primary schools
within their responsibility and (ii) increase school effectiveness taking into account the financing
capacity of individual local Governments.5

7.       FUNDESCOLA IIIA's key performance indicators, designed to be achieved by
December 30, 20066, focused on improving educational equity and effectiveness of schools, as
well as the capacity of beneficiary Education Secretariats to create and sustain improvements in
their educational systems. The specific indicators are as follows


4See FUNDESCOLA III Project Appraisal Document (PAD), May 17, 2002, page 4.
5ibid, pages 3 and 41.
6Key performance indicators were originally designed for each phase of FUNDESCOLA III that is, to be
achieved by December 2006 (FUNDESCOLA IIIA) and December 2010 (FUNDESCOLA IIIB). Indicators
for each phase were practically the same (varying only the goals). Some FUNDESCOLA IIIB indicators
were selected in association with student attainment. Triggers for launching FUNDESCOLA IIIB are
variations of FUNDESCOLA IIIA's performance indicators.


                                                                                                   13

        a) FUNDESCOLA IIIA - Key performance indicators (End of Phase I indicators):
        a.1) associated with equity in the educational systems:
            · Guidelines for Minimum Operational Standards in School (PMFE) disseminated
                to education secretariats in 50% of beneficiary micro-regions; and
            · At least 70% of primary education students enrolled in schools in the
                participating micro-regions operating with PMFE standards.

        a.2) associated with school effectiveness:
            · Designed school improvement products and complementary programs to enhance
                the effectiveness of Education Secretariats in implementing these products and
                complementary        programs.    Additionally,    evaluation   of    secretariat's
                implementation of these products as well as the impact of these products on
                schools and student outcomes; and
            · At least 70% of primary education students enrolled in schools in the
                participating micro-regions implementing one or more of these school
                improvement products with the support of the secretariats.

8.      It should be highlighted that according to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), none
of the key performance indicators for FUNDESCOLA IIIA were directly associated with learning
achievements for beneficiary students. The direct association was only established for the second
phase of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) which had been scheduled to end on 2010, as shown
below:

        b) FUNDESCOLA IIIB - Key performance indicator (End of Program indicators):
        b.1) associated with equity in the educational systems:
            · PMFE guidelines disseminated to at least 80% of the secretariats in the
                participating micro-regions; and
            · At least 90% of primary education students enrolled in targeted micro-regions
                operating under the PMFE standards.

        b.2) associated with schools effectiveness:
            · Updated/completed FUNDESCOLA-designed school improvement products
                along with complementary program for the Secretariats; and
            · At least 80% of primary students enrolled in targeted schools implementing at
                least one of FUNDESCOLA's schooling improvement strategies with the support
                of their secretariats.

        b.3) associated with attainment by primary education students:
            · Increased promotion rates to 85% in the participating micro-regions, from the
                average level, in 1997, of 64.2% in North, 64.7% in Northeast and 71.5% in
                Center-West regions;
            · Improved the proportion of 4th grade students achieving in the elementary level
                of proficiency as follows:
                         In Mathematics, increase the proportion reaching elementary proficiency
                         to at least: 62% in the North, 59% in the Northeast and 68% in the
                         Center-West regions (baseline proportions were 55%, 52% and 60%,
                         respectively);
                         In Portuguese language, increase the proportion reaching elementary
                         proficiency to at least 67% in the North region, 66% in the Northeast and
                         69% in the Center-West regions (baseline proportions in were to 59%,



                                                                                               14

                         58% and 62%, respectively).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, approved by implementing authorities

9.      There were no legal revisions of the PDOs throughout project implementation, in July
2006 the Bank and the Government of Brazil (GoB) approved minor revisions of some of the key
performance indicators. The review did not change the core of FUNDESCOLA IIIA key
performance indicators (see below), instead, it modified the way they were measured mainly for
clarity purposes. As a result, the indicators began to be measured in absolute rather than relative
numbers.    The project received two Loan closing extensions, the first one granted a Loan
extension of 12 months with a new closing date of December 2007 and a second one of 6 months
placing the closing date on June 30 2008. The indicators listed below refer to the last closing date
granted:

        a) FUNDESCOLA IIIA key performance indicators:
        a.1) associated with equity in educational systems:
             · PMFE guidelines disseminated in 201 education secretariats in beneficiary
                 micro-regions; and
             · 1,023,828 primary education students enrolled in beneficiary micro-regions
                 schools operating under PMFE.

        a.2) associated with schools effectiveness:
             · full development and test of each product for school improvement designed by
                 FUNDESCOLA, as well as of complementary programs to improve effectiveness
                 of secretariats to implement these products. Additionally, completion of
                 evaluations of these products and implementation of complementary programs by
                 the secretariats shall be completed along with the impact of these products on
                 schools and on student achievements; and
             · 1,023,828 primary education students enrolled in schools in beneficiary micro-
                 regions that implemented at least one of these school improvement products with
                 support from the Secretariats.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The main beneficiary population of FUNDESCOLA IIIA included primary education
students enrolled in schools covered by the Project in targeted micro-regions in 19 states in the
country. In addition to these beneficiaries, the Project incorporated additional children from
participating schools located outside of Priority Attention Zones (ZAP)-once the expansion in the
number of municipalities was implemented. In total, about 7.4 million school-age children from
approximately 12,000 primary education schools in the poorer regions of Brazil benefited from
the Program.

11.     Although FUNDESCOLA IIIA did not provide a direct subsidy to poor or disadvantaged
students, it targeted vulnerable children by focusing in poor areas and on the needs of schools
experiencing higher rates of inefficiency, student repetition and student dropouts.

1.5 Original Components

12.     The activities supported by FUNDESCOLA IIIA were grouped in three components as
follows (i) Raising schools to minimum operational standards; (ii) Establishing school




                                                                                                 15

development processes; and (iii) Strengthening the educational system. A detailed description of
each original component at the time of project appraisal follows.

Component 1 - Raising Schools to Minimum Operational Standards

13.     This component, in line with the PDO aimed to reduce inequality among beneficiary
education systems, was designed to provide technical support to the Education Secretariats in
States and Municipalities in the micro-regions covered by the project to raise teaching/learning
conditions according to agreed minimum operational standards -referred to as School's Minimum
Operational Standards (PMFE). Implementation of this component included the selection of a set
of essential school inputs and conditions (i.e. appropriate physical facilities, school equipment,
books and student learning materials) that were deemed minimally necessary to provide
satisfactory conditions to promote student learning. To evaluate the operational status of teaching
conditions, FUNDESCOLA financed an activity named in a School Facilities Survey (LSE)
carried out prior to finalizing the standards under the PMFE.

14.     The PMFE standards were used as a yardstick by beneficiary states and municipalities as
they assessed their current status and established their standards based on their operational
capabilities. This component was comprised of the following subcomponents (see Annex 2 for a
review of expected and achieved outputs):

        (i) School-managed Rehabilitation and Management Subprojects: supported technical
assistance to schools in need of rehabilitation to reach PMFE standards. The School
Rehabilitation Project (PAPE) provided the guidelines to carry our school based interventions to
strengthen school safety, school health and minimum operational conditions for effective
learning, without changing the overall construction site or alteration of internal spaces. The
subcomponent aimed to provide the minimum conditions necessary to prepare schools to receive
furniture and equipment to meet PMFE standards. The funds from FUNDESCOLA IIIA were
transferred to the school-based executing agencies (School Councils) who were responsible for
resource allocation, use and accountability oversight.

        (ii) Provision of Furniture and Equipment: the subcomponent financed classroom
furniture and teaching/learning equipment for the eligible schools targeted for PAPE
interventions.

        (iii) Provision of Reading Books: the subcomponent financed supplementary reading
books to schools that had adopted the FUNDESCOLA products, with priority given to multi-
grade rural schools using the Active School (Escola Ativa) pedagogical approach.

Component 2 - Establishing an Effective School-based Planning and Development Process

15.     This component, in line with the PDO to increase school effectiveness, was designed to
promote school-based planning activities targeting specific ways to improve student attainment.
The School Development Plan (PDE) was designed as the central tool to achieve better school-
based planning7. Beneficiary schools under FUNDESCOLA IIIA were encouraged to use the
PDE as a platform upon which to build a set of quality improvement actions to be incorporated


7The School Development Plan (PDE) should not be confused with the National Education Development
Plan (National PDE), which is the main strategy of the Government for education launched in 2007 with
the same acronym (PDE) as the FUNDESCOLA school strategic planning tool. While the National PDE
incorporates features of the PDE, the scope of the former is more embracing.


                                                                                                     16

into a School Improvement Plan (PME). The Program financed the implementation of PMEs as
well as the development of supporting tools (manuals and training material) to build capacity
among school and State and Municipal Education Secretariat staff. Finally the Program financed
the development and dissemination of teaching/learning models to support schools with activities
to improve student learning. This component was comprised of the following subcomponents (see
Annex 2 for a review of expected and achieved outputs):

          (i) School-based Strategic Planning Processes: financed the preparation, monitoring and
evaluation of PDEs in the schools, located within the beneficiary micro-regions, which had an
enrollment of at least 100 students. FUNDESCOLA IIIA supported the implementation of the
PDE (strategic planning processes carried out with community participation and coordinated by
the school leadership) in accordance with the guidelines developed and tested in previous phases
of the FUNDESCOLA Program.

          (ii) School Improvement Subprojects: financed PME activities, within the scope of PDE
implementation in beneficiaries' schools. As mentioned above, PME encompasses a set of goals
and activities that are considered essential to improve student learning. Key eligible activities
included teacher training and learning material. For this purpose, FUNDESCOLA IIIA
transferred funds to schools according to the absolute number of students enrolled.

          (iii) Implementation of Teaching Management and Learning Models: financed the design,
testing and implementation of pedagogical models intended to improve student learning through
changes in school management and organization, curriculum, and teaching methods.
FUNDESCOLA IIIA supported the completion and scaling up of two products: (the Active
School and the School Achievement Management Program for grades 1-4 ­ School Achievement
Management Program (GESTAR8), both of which had been under implementation since the
previous Program phases. In addition, the Program designed, tested and implemented new
products to fulfill emerging demands. It should be noted the School Management Model (Escola
de Gestores), which was designed within the scope of FUNDESCOLA IIIA, was further
developed and widely implemented with public resources from MEC.

Component 3 - Institutional Capacity Strengthening

16.       This component, in line with the PDO, aimed to promote the strengthening of beneficiary
educational systems through the technical support to schools and State Education Secretariats to
increase community participation and, consequently, civil society responsibility and
accountability. This component incorporated project management and research activities as well
as financing transferred directly to the schools to achieve the aforementioned activities (Direct
Support to Schools Program ­ PDDE). Byproducts sought with the PDDE included the
strengthening of school autonomy and management practice to improve routine processes and
improve school conditions for better teaching and learning. This component comprises the
following subcomponents (for a review of expected and achieved outputs see Annex 2):




8The Escola Ativa or Active School Model is a pedagogical approach developed for application in multi-
grade classrooms. The approach combines classroom management, school administration and a variety of
learning approaches for application in the classroom. The GESTAR model is a pedagogical approach and
tools to improve student achievement in Mathematics and in Portuguese language. The model incorporate
continued teacher education upgrading, methodologies to diagnose and evaluate students and an array of
activities to support learning.


                                                                                                      17

         (i) Institutional Development for State Education Secretariats: financed technical support
for members of the State and Municipal Education Secretariats' managers and technical staff to
design and implement the Strategic Planning for the Secretariat (PES)9. The adoption of State
Education Secretariats to the PES methodology was not compulsory. Nonetheless, the
implementation of the PES allowed Education secretariats to be informed and properly trained on
the products designed by FUNDESCOLA IIIA to make sure they could, in turn, promote the
implementation of the products within the educational systems under their responsibility.

         (ii) School Council Strengthening Subprojects: financed activities to increase parental
involvement and overall commitment level in the school improvement process. FUNDESCOLA
IIIA financed monetary transfers to schools with more than 20 students located in targeted micro-
regions to be managed by School Councils (comprised of parents and community representatives)
and used to purchase teaching and learning materials, small repairs and basic maintenance.

         (iii) Project Management, Monitoring and Research: financed project management
activities, including monitoring, supervision and provision of technical assistance to beneficiary
schools or State Education Secretariats while in close coordination with MEC, Local Government
and the World Bank. In addition, FUNDESCOLA IIIA financed several research studies and
evaluations to gauge implementation effectiveness, outcomes and impacts.

1.6 Revised Components

17.      The original project design was not modified throughout the implementation cycle.
Similarly, the Project's original PDOs remained intact. However, in December 2005 at the
request of MEC, the Loan Agreement was amended to: (i) finance a new subcomponent to build
new schools and to expand and rehabilitate physical facilities in existing schools; (ii) add a new
category of disbursement ("5 ­ Civil Works") with funds of 12.6 million; (iii) reallocate funds
among disbursement categories; and (iv) introduce a new modality for procurement ­ National
Competitive Bidding (NCB). This new subcomponent was integrated into the framework of the
original first component of the Project intended to Raise Schools to Minimum Operational
Standards.

18.      As background, the amendment was requested following the results of LSE and micro-
planning that identified specific situations where it would be more effective to build new schools
instead of rehabilitating existing facilities (according to PAPE/PMFE standards), in addition to
specific demands for school infrastructure programs from indigenous people. FUNDESCOLA
IIIA financed the construction of new schools in accordance with standard projects and
previously defined budgets as it was done in FUNDESCOLA I and FUNDESCOLA II.

19.      It is important to stress that, with the inclusion of this subcomponent, the environment
safeguards category of the Project changed from "C" to "B", prompting MEC to draft and present
an Environment Management Plan for Bank approval. The task was completed satisfactorily.

20.      The expected output indicator for the added subcomponents included the construction,
rehabilitation or expansion of 520 classrooms. Project funds were exclusively applied to construct
new classrooms.




9Referred to as the Secretariat Management Plan (PGS) in the PAD.


                                                                                                18

21.     The achieved output at loan closing date was the construction of 372 new classrooms. It
is worth noting that in June 2008 another 96 classrooms were under construction as reported in
Annex 2.

1.7 Additional Revisions to the Original Design

22.     In addition to the above mentioned amendment to the Loan Agreement, the GoB
requested extension to the loan's closing date on two occasions and minor revisions to the
threshold amounts in the disbursement categories on an additional two occasions.

23.     The loan's closing date was first extended to December 31, 2007 and later to June 30,
2008. Both extensions were requested by MEC and approved by the Bank in letters dated June 5,
2006 and of December 11, 2007. The first request was made to complete project implementation,
while the second extension was requested to complete classroom construction, procurement of
school furniture and equipment, procurement of supplementary reading books, implementation of
Teacher Training Program in Science and Technology, and carrying out an overall evaluation of
the FUNDESCOLA Federal Program.

24.     The first reallocation among disbursement categories was made within the scope of the
allowed changes in the Loan Agreement to include a subcomponent to build new schools. This
inclusion led to the need of creating category "5 - Civil Works" to provide support for recently
created subcomponent disbursements. The Bank approved this reallocation in December 2005, in
the same amendment that deals with the subcomponent incorporated into the Project.

25.     A Bank letter dated July 16, 2007 authorized the second reallocation of funds among
disbursement categories. Category "3 ­ Goods, works and services for parts A.1, B.2 and C.2
subprojects" had its allocation increased to about 25.8 million, funds coming from the remaining
categories of the Loan. MEC requested this reallocation considering: (i) a satisfactory
performance of the subcomponents financed with funds from the disbursement category to be
increased; (ii) the increased valuation of the Euro in relation to the US dollar; (iii) the proximity
of the project completion date; (iv) delays in implementing the subcomponent on school furniture
and equipment provision; and (v) the taking over of some of the project expenditures by MEC.
The objective was to avoid cancelling funds from the Loan but rather increasing in categories
disbursing well and whose impact on the PDOs was deemed substantial (PAPE, PME and
PDDE).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

26.     This section of the report analyzes the key factors and events that either contributed to the
achievement of planned outcomes or affected negatively the performance of the Project
throughout its implementation cycle.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27.     Background Analysis: FUNDESCOLA IIIA was designed in a context of successive
Loans extended by the Bank over the last years, including FUNDESCOLA I and II, the Northeast
Basic Education Projects I, II and III, and projects operating at the state level by the state
governments of Paraná, Minas Gerais, Bahia and Ceará. For the preparation of the
FUNDESCOLA IIIA, the design incorporated many of the lessons learned from these successive
Projects, with the exception of Bahia and Ceará which came on board after FUNDESCOLA IIIA.
Other key documents included publications from MEC, the World Bank and the United Nations


                                                                                                  19

Children's Fund (UNICEF). The design of FUNDESCOLA IIIA's is consistent with the
analytical findings in the aforementioned documents, that is, the Project is strongly focused in the
poorer regions of Brazil and its PDO is focused on improving the equity and effectiveness of
educational systems and schools in these poorer regions. Moreover, the explicit concern to
introduce methodologies to increase parental and community participation in school improvement
processes demonstrates a strong connection between the project design and the major educational
problems identified by the analytical research and reports in the mentioned regions.

28.      According to the ICR review team, the project background analysis may be assessed as
sound and consistent. It considered: (i) a clear conceptualization of the role of MEC in
strengthening school performance; (ii) previous Bank involvement in financing operations in the
educational sector in Brazil; (iii) project adherence to the CPS; and (iv) the main sector issues
under debate in Brazil at the time of project design, namely poor education quality (measured, for
example, by low student proficiency rates), high rates of repetition (particularly in the initial
grades), low primary education completion rates, and poverty impacts on student performance.

29.      As a result of the detailed and consistent analysis, it was possible to identify the key
obstacles to improving the performance of the educational system in Brazil. That is, the majority
of schools lacked effective models to improve teaching and learning and local governments were
not promoting policies to reduce inequity in the educational systems under their responsibilities.
Other problems associated with poor student results included a limited involvement of parents
and school communities in school improvement processes, the existing financing gap between
management processes and efforts to improve schools and the limited institutional capacity
observed at state, municipal and school levels.

30.      It is also worth noting the project carried out a detailed cost-benefit analysis to test
different scenarios, something not commonly done at the time. Similarly, the fiscal, technical and
institutional analyses were deemed satisfactory.

31.      The ICR analysis highlights two issues that could have been studied in greater depth
during the project design phase. These include strategies to evaluate impacts and assess risks
(more details on the section analyzing the project's monitoring and evaluation strategy). On the
first issue, it appears that previous experiences on how best to measure impacts from investments
in education projects, which are usually affected by a number of non-project related factors, were
not fully taken into account. The project did not establish a baseline to evaluate project impacts.
Interestingly, former task managers involved in FUNDESCOLA IIIA acknowledge there is not a
direct (or attributable) link between the project interventions and the project goals associated with
student achievements. The issue is of particular relevance since the first phase of the APL
(FUNDESCOLA IIIA) did not include target on student achievement, these were included only as
part of the second phase, which the Government decided not to carry out with Bank financing10.
A lesson learned for APL financed projects as there is always a possibility or risk of not moving
forward with subsequent phases of an APL.

32.      On the second issue regarding risks, although it was acknowledged FUNDESCOLA IIIA
would be implemented under a new administration, both at federal and state levels 11, the possible
impact may not have been analyzed or sufficiently taken into account. Indeed, past experience


10Previous projects (FUNDESCOLA I and II) used the traditional modality of Specific Investment Loan
(SIL).
11In Brazil, presidential and state gubernatorial elections are held every four years. Following the 2002
election, new governors were appointed for the term of 2003 - 2006.


                                                                                                         20

with political changes in Brazil indicate delays in implementation or substantive changes in
strategy or project intervention. In the case of FUNDESCOLA IIIA's, a review of the preparation
documents indicates greater concern with the continuity of decentralization and school
management policies, which, if not implemented would influence project outcomes.

33.      Project Design: FUNDESCOLA IIIA was designed taking into consideration the
implementation lessons from previous phases of the Program, most notably: (i) the need to
provide incentives to State and Municipal Education Secretariats to expand school development
process to all member schools in their networks; (ii) the importance of increasing parental
involvement and community participation in this process; and (iii) the importance of continuing
financial transfers to schools as a means to provide an incentive for them to improve the quality
of teaching and planning processes within individual schools.

34.      It is worth noting the design of FUNDESCOLA IIIA took into account results of
analytical research studies carried out by the National Institute of Educational Surveys and
Studies (INEP) in partnership with Stanford University12 on the impact of key interventions of
FUNDESCOLA I and FUNDESCOLA II, in addition to lessons from similar projects outside
Brazil. The INEP/Stanford study selected a sample of 158 schools (55 of them with PDE) in the
three beneficiary regions to analyze variables such as proficiency in Portuguese language and
Mathematics, teacher education profile levels, and socioeconomic indicators fro students and
parents. The findings indicate statistically significant evidence among students from schools with
PDE (better learning outcomes) and those without it.

35.      In addition, lessons from the United States, Chile, Uruguay and Colombia were
considered in the preparation of FUNDESCOLA IIIA. The cases of Chile and Uruguay were
instrumental to fine tune strategies to enhance stakeholders' participation in PDE preparation.
Similarly, the program Escuela Nueva (New Schools) from Colombia provided inputs for the
development of the Active School model and lessons from the New American Schools from the
United States influenced the project to use packages of adaptable school-based products and
selection of technical assistance strategies.

36.      The Northeast Basic Education Project contributed to the design of FUNDESCOLA IIIA
with lessons on teacher educating and capacity building initiatives in State Education Secretariats
taken from the Municipal Education Secretariats Support Program (PRASEM) and the Municipal
Education Managers Support Program (PRADIME).

37.      In terms of investment instrument, the preparation team carefully analyzed both the APL
and Specific Investment Loan (SIL) modalities, selecting the former for strategic reasons. The
consideration of an intervention approach that promoted demand for education and, at the same
time, improved the quality of the existing supply of education to encourage retention and promote
better learning conditions, particularly among children from poor households. Research in Brazil
is clear that poverty reduction is more likely to take root when children complete satisfactorily the
primary education cycle, at a minimum. Finally, the project worked in complementarity and
same direction as the Bolsa Escola program13 through the provision of support for the least
performing schools in targeted micro-regions.



12A paper entitled Preliminary Evaluation of MEC/Fundescola's School Development Plan Experience:
student achievement, attendance, attainment, degree of implementation and cost-benefit analysis presented
data from 1999 and 2000.
13The Federal Government Bolsa Família Program incorporated Bolsa Escola in 2003.


                                                                                                       21

38.      Constraints in the project design include weaknesses in: (i) incorporation of an impact
evaluation, including baseline and control group information, (ii) indicators that would measure
more closely project interventions and that would be more related to outcomes and impacts rather
than inputs as is the case in the project design, and (ii) more effective controls and penalty clauses
to ensure contracted international agencies comply according to official agreements. Although an
evaluation of the institutional capacity of the units responsible for coordinating implementation at
central (General Program Director ­ DGP), state (Project State Executive Coordination ­ COEP)
and school levels (School Development Group ­ GDE) was undertaken, mechanisms to ensure
full information flow to key international agencies (UNESCO and UNDP)14 that were selected to
act as partners during implementation were not built into the original project design. This fact
could have avoided delays in the submission of information on physical and financial data
regarding FUNDESCOLA activities by the aforementioned international agencies15.

39.      Government Commitment: GoB commitment to FUNDESCOLA has been strong from
the outset, from the initial publication that gave origin to the Program, "Brazil - a call to action:
combating school failure in the Northeast of Brazil" to the preparation of FUNDESCOLA IIIA.
Evidence to the commitment became even clearer when the Federal Government launched a
National Education Development Plan (PDE) and institutionalized a sizable proportion of
FUNDESCOLA strategies and products starting in late 2007 and early 2008.

2.2 Implementation

40.      FUNDESCOLA IIIA experienced a mix of slow and fast implementation periods, mainly
due to exogenous factors. Notwithstanding the situation, the project expected outputs have either
been achieved, or are expected to be achieved. The paragraphs below provide information on
factors that had an effect on the pace of implementation.

41.      Political Changes: A key factors that caused the pace in project implementation to slow
down included changes in the General Program Director (DGP) leadership (the DGP post was
occupied by five different professionals in 2003) and COEP technical staff. Changes to the DGP
structure, and to the project itself, were negotiated at the Federal level in 2003. It is worth
mentioning the replacement of the DGP leadership and technical team in 2003 was also due to a
regulation that went into effect at the time set forth by Decree No. 4748/2003 which provided
new guidelines for selecting professionals using an open and competitive process.

42.      Project Management: The FUNDESCOLA IIIA's management design was similar to
previous investment operations, including its coordination by a stand alone implementation unit
in MEC. In order to institutionalize fragmented programs, in June 2004 MEC transferred
FUNDESCOLA IIIA management to the National Education Development Fund (FNDE) in an
attempt to unify administrative procedures in all of its projects financed with external resources.
As a result, MEC created the Assistance Directorate for Special Programs (DIPRO), with
assigned responsibilities to coordinate, supervise and implement special programs under the
responsibility of FNDE. This change, also subject to Federal control, made project management
difficult at first due to the concentration of responsibilities and coordination in just one FNDE
Directorate.


14The international agencies that acted as partners during FUNDESCOLA IIIA included the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
15UNDP and UNESCO executed Project activities after formalizing partnerships with MEC referred to as
"PRODOC".


                                                                                                   22

43.     Procurement and Selection of Consultants: Another factor affecting negatively the pace
of implementation was related to the legal requirements to carry out procurement processes at
federal, state and municipal level. The procurement processes for goods and contracting services
may be subject to review by all three levels of government, depending on the procurement
arrangements, beneficiaries and implementation modalities, causing delays in implementation. In
some cases the State Attorneys General had to be involved, thus further exacerbating the
complexity of come processes. The lack of knowledge and experience with specific Bank
procurement guidelines -along with the excessive number of processes required in the State
Attorney General Office-, delayed implementation for some of the project's actions.

44.     Budget Availability: during the first two years of project implementation, the Federal
government imposed budget limitations resulting in a slow down in implementation. In 2003, the
Ministry of Finance set a limit on the Federal government annual expenditures which, combined
with the decrease in availability of counterpart funds, affected the project negatively.

45.     Change in Scope: in 2005 the MEC proposed to include all 2,704 municipalities of the
North, Northeast and Center-West regions of Brazil as project beneficiaries; thus, expanding the
limit that had been established of a total of 384 municipalities from beneficiary ZAPs. The
change affected two aspects of FUNDESCOLA IIIA. On the one hand, it required extraordinary
efforts to overcome challenges to provide technical assistance to a much larger base of
municipalities. On the other hand, the expansion contributed to the project's institutionalization as
it increased states and municipalities involvement in activities implementation and monitoring.
An amendment to the Loan Agreement to support the scaling up of scope and dissemination of
project products was not necessary.

46.     Model to Manage School-based Products: in 2004 the MEC proposed to adopt a matrix
model to manage products by function based on the product's life cycle phases instead of the
organic structure based only on products and used unchanged since the outset of FUNDESCOLA
I. The new model contributed to accelerating the implementation pace and sharpening focus by
DGP, which adopted a product development cycle with the following phases: design, testing,
evaluation, dissemination and monitoring. The functional structure of the DGP's was changed to
correspond to the new product development strategy. The change did not affect the PDOs or
components; hence the Loan Agreement did not require an amendment.

47.     Institutionalization: The institutionalization of the Program was a continuous concern
since the launch of FUNDESCOLA IIIA. This can be noted by the design of the PDO and its
third component, which had as one of its axis of action the institutional development of Municipal
and State Education Secretariat as a way to ensure they had the needed resources to support the
expansion of school development process.

Implementation Challenges by Component:

48.     Component 1 - Raising Schools to Minimum Operational Standards: This component was
perhaps the most challenging one to carry out during the implementation phase. The challenges
were exacerbated by amendments to the project, reflected in the Loan Agreement, to: (i) include a
subcomponent to build, rehabilitate or expand school infrastructure in existing schools and (ii)
incorporate school and classroom equipment and materials. The decentralized model selected for
the implementation of the infrastructure subcomponent made the day-to-day implementation
particularly challenging given the limited understanding of project procurement procedures at
local level and a high turn over of the technical staff responsible for coordinating subcomponents.


                                                                                                  23

These challenges were identified and addressed at various points during the implementation
cycle; nonetheless, the project was not able to overcome entirely some of the delays and closed
with a slight deficit in the expected physical milestones (see Annex 2).
49.     A structural issue which added to the complexity of implementation of a small works
infrastructure program at a decentralized level included ambiguities with the legal title to some of
the construction sites (whether new or existing).

50.     Component 2 - Establishing an Effective School-based Planning and Development
Process: This component, which is at the heart of improving school effectiveness, developed an
effective strategy to deliver technical assistance services to state and municipal institutions to
assist in the implementation of one of the pillars of FUNDESCOLA IIIA: the School
Development Plans (PDE). The expansion in the number of beneficiary municipalities, from 384
to a total of 2,704, however, presented an immediate implementation challenge as total staffing
levels to cater for the strategy implementation (in DGP and COEP) were not increased in tandem
to cover the massive scale-up.

51.     Component 3 - Institutional Capacity Strengthening: This component provided continuity
to the development of products and tools to strengthen the management capacity of Education
Secretariats as well as the information systems to strengthen project management and results
monitoring (Planning and Monitoring System ­ SPA). The project promoted the development of
automated information systems; however, some of these systems were developed in isolation or
out of sequence, which prevented the project from realizing the potential synergistic effect across
information sources. In some cases, this resulted in diminishing the role that information could
have played in improving implementation. The situation was aggravated in 2004 when the project
management was transferred to FNDE/DIPRO and some of the systems were shut down for a
period of time. A particular information challenge was the lack of compatibility and sufficient
information flows with the systems from UNDP and UNESCO, despite repeated requests for
regular information from FNDE/DIPRO staff in MEC.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Strategy and Implementation

52.     Design: The Project's M&E strategy design consisted on the following: (i) continuous
day-to-day supervision and monitoring from the DGP and COEP; (ii) selected surveys and
analytical studies to evaluate various FUNDESCOLA IIIA products; and (iii) beneficiary studies,
using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methodologies and analyses, to determine project
impacts and beneficiary perceptions on the FUNDESCOLA IIIA products and cumulative
achievements.

53.     With respect to the first point of the M&E strategy, the strategy is considered satisfactory
to monitor progress. In particular, the team highlights the importance of developing the SPA
information system, which had been used before in other partnerships between the World Bank
and the Government (Northeast Projects I and II, Basic Education Project, and later
FUNDESCOLA II and I). The SPA has been evaluated previously and deemed as an effective
tool to record financial information and generate project expenditure statements. In addition, the
SPA integrated project specific information which made it possible to rely in the system for
accurate and up to date fiduciary information (procurement, financial management and
disbursements), annual physical targets and intermediate output indicators.

54.     Similarly, the team evaluated the second part do the M&E strategy as satisfactory. The
analytical studies and surveys to evaluate specific products supported by FUNDESCOLA IIIA
provided evidence-based information for decision making, which had a positive spillover effect


                                                                                                 24

by eliciting the engagement of States and Municipalities that may had yet to be convinced on the
potential impacts of School-based quality improvement inputs to raise overall school
effectiveness and, ultimately, learning outcomes. By the time of loan closing, analyses had been
completed for the PDE, Active School and PES products and associated supporting materials.
The analyses on PAPE and GESTAR have not yet started.

55.      As mentioned above, stand alone studies were carried out to evaluate the impact of the
PDE, Active Schools and PES products. For the PDE analysis, the Government sought the
services of INEP in partnership with Stanford University and national experts. According to the
results, students attending schools with a PDE showed a statistically significant difference, albeit
small, in student achievement compared to students whose schools did not have a PDE in place.
Similarly, the a study carried out to evaluate the Active Schools product16 indicates an increase in
transition rates in participating schools, although dropout rates were not found to decrease as
would have been expected given the intervention. Finally, the analytical work on PES, carried
out in 200717, indicated the success of the product at school level depended on a coordinated
effort with the targeted State Education Secretariats to ensure product inputs area available on
time and technical teams are trained and supported before and during implementation.

56.      With respect to the beneficiary studies to gauge the overall impact of the Project
components on medium and longer term indicators, the team believes greater attention could have
been given to the following issues: (i) considering accumulated operational experience and
literature base on methodologies to measure the effects of education projects given the broad
range of exogenous factors that may sway results to no fault of the project; (ii) identifying a
baseline to evaluate impact; (iii) adopting more realistic and "intervention attributable"
indicators; (iv) specifying medium term goals at the end of an initial APL phase; (v) selecting
indicators that could have given information on expected changes at municipal level (i.e.
indicators on student proficiency in Mathematics and Portuguese Language were measured at
state level even though only some municipalities were included in the project); and (vi) selecting
a methodology to measure school-level impacts.

57.      In its supervision missions, the Bank noted repeatedly the issue of carrying out an impact
evaluation of the project. In May 2007 the Bank suggested to reflect on the use of data from the
National Basic Education Evaluation System (SAEB) since the system provides State level data,
thus making municipal level analyses not feasible. Irrespective of the type of analysis, however,
the Bank highlighted the importance of controlling for the quantity of products implemented (as
a proxy for intensity) as well as the time elapsed since their implementation in beneficiary school
and localities (as a proxy for length of product exposure).

58.      It should be highlighted that a series of seminars were convened from April to June 2008
to discuss preliminary results of the overall FUNDESCOLA Program and the specific project of
reference. In July 2008 the Government of Brazil, the Bank Task Management Team, researchers
from INEP and an education expert from the University of Sao Paulo met to reflect on evaluation
findings. The meeting reached consensus on the following conclusions: (i) the influence that
FUNDESCOLA series had in the institutionalization of the PDE as a strategic policy and

16 The study identified a positive effect in school attainment rates and transition rates and a reduction in the
drop-out rates in participating schools compared to non participating schools. The data for the analysis
ranged from 1996 to 2002.

planning methodology in all basic schools in Brazil, (ii) the need to analyze and identify
indicators of impacts at various levels of the system, depending on specific component
interventions, from the school to the Municipalities, to the States to the Federal level. (iii) the
need to consider the role of FUNDESCOLA IIIA in the overall analysis of the impacts of the
FUNDESCOLA series that is currently underway as it places a 2005 cut off date for the analysis,
even though the FUNDESCOLA IIIA loan closed in mid 2008, and (iv) the need to control for
student household and socioeconomic factors in the analysis of student performance, especially in
relation to measuring PDOs.

59.      Implementation: The appropriateness and periodicity of variables collected to monitor
FUNDESCOLA IIIA ICR were adequate. A challenge to the M&E system as such occurred
whenever a need to cross reference arose given the reliance on multiple information systems that
were not readily accessible or entirely compatible across each other.

60.      Use: Overall the M&E strategy provided useful information for analysis, fiduciary
oversight and decision-making. The two areas where difficulties were consistently recorded
included: (i) the flow of information from local authorities on the status of local partnership
agreements and (ii) the status of implementation agreements signed with UNESCO and UNDP.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

61.      Environmental safeguard compliance. With the inclusion in 2005 of a subcomponent on
school construction, the project environment category changed from a rating of "C" to "B". For
this purpose, the Borrower drafted and presented an Environment Management Plan, which was
approved by the Bank prior to completing the amendment.

62.      Fiduciary compliance. The required annual financial and procurement audits were carried
out on a timely basis by the Federal Internal Comptroller Secretariat (SFC) under the Office of
the Comptroller General of Brazil (CGU). Throughout its implementation, the project received
unqualified Audits to its financial statements, although recommendations to strengthen internal
controls were presented on several occasions. Bank internal reviews on Audit report findings
suggested ensuring full compatibility between the numbers shown in the Government's SPA and
the Bank system, which had minor discrepancies due to exchange rate fluctuations, especially in
2006.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

63.      From the outset, the Bank and the Borrower were concerned with ensuring there would
be mechanisms embedded in the project design (at national, state, and municipal level) to ensure
the institutionalization of the FUNDESCOLA Program series. The mechanisms have worked
gradually, mainly by promoting community participation and ownership of school-level
processes, and have culminated in the incorporation of various FUNDESCOLA products into a
national strategic planning program in education. By late 2007 and early 2008, all of the 5,563
municipalities in Brazil had adhered to the "Education for All" commitment, which is part of the
Education Development Plan (PDE) sponsored by the Federal government, and by mid 2008, a
total of 3,669 municipalities had already presented their individual planning 2008-2011 to MEC.
This attests to the widespread scaling up and dissemination of a strategic planning
culture/practice in the country. The Escola Ativa (Active School) model, for instance, which has
an internationally proven track record, is currently being implemented in approximately 53,000
multi-grade rural schools in Brazil. In terms of sustainability, it is clear the FUNDESCOLA
series has had a positive influence on national policy and programs.


                                                                                                26

64.      Although FUNDESCOLA IIIB was originally scheduled for implementation between
July 2006 and December 2010, the delays experienced with FUNDESCOLA IIIA in 2003 and
2004 pushed discussions on content and timing for FUNDESCOLA IIIB preparation into the
future. By late 2006, the Government began a scale up in the implementation of FUNDESCOLA
products (i.e. PDE, PES, LSE, PAPE and Active School) and by mid 2007 the Government made
the decision to not seek external financing for such national endeavor. The decision coincided
with the closing of the FUNDESCOLA IIIA Project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

65.      This section provides an evaluation of ratings for the FUNDESCOLA IIIA outcomes
using an analytical model that encompasses the overall relevance of the project's objectives,
accomplishments, effectiveness and various impacts and outcomes.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

66.      The objectives of FUNDESCOLA IIIA are still considered to be highly relevant to the
context in the North, Northeast and Center-West regions because: (i) they reflect the twin
priorities of reducing inequalities across primary schools and increasing school effectiveness both
of which remain high on the government agenda in these regions; (ii) they are firmly underpinned
in educational policies promoted by the Federal government; and (iii) they are lodged within the
priorities identified in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2008-2011. It is clear the
objectives are consistent the policy priorities and parameters set forth by the Government of
Brazil and with the overall direction and interventions agreed as part of the CPS to support the
Government to improve education sector performance, accountability and institutional
development to strengthen management practice at various levels.

67.      The overall design and implementation modality selected for FUNDESCOLA IIIA is also
considered as highly relevant to address the problems of the education sector in the three regions
selected for interventions. Indeed, the national Education Development Plan (PDE) launched by
the Federal Government incorporated elements of FUNDESCOLA IIIA for dissemination across
the national educational system. This action underscores the confidence placed on
FUNDESCOLA IIIA to transfer deign elements, implementation modalities and accumulated
experience to the country as a whole.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDOs)

68.      The evaluation of FUNDESCOLA IIIA achievement of higher level PDOs should take
into account that: (i) the Project was part of a two phase APL with higher level PDOs that went
beyond the implementation period of the first phase of the APL; (ii) the first phase of the APL
should have been completed by December 2006 and the second phase by December 2010; and
(iii) key indicators associated with student learning outcomes, which were agreed to be used to
evaluate at the completion of the second phase of the APL, were only set for FUNDESCOLA
IIIB. Considering these factors, the evaluation of FUNDESCOLA IIIA's role toward achieving
the higher level PDOs -for the complete APL Program- is compromised from an operational
standpoint.

69.      Interestingly, even if learning outcomes would have been a part of FUNDESCOLA IIIA,
it should be noted this would have not been entirely possible because of the structural changes in



                                                                                                27

testing instruments in standards that took place in 2005. The test used to estimate the baseline is
no longer in operation. Instead, it has been replaced with an index-type instrument (Índice de
Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica - IDEB) that provides a ranking based on performance on
an array of indicators. The IDEB was first out in practice in 2005 and followed with another
round in 2007. To date, IDEB it is widely known and applied across the country. Another factor
that could have affected the Project's impact on test results across the targeted regions, assuming
learning outcomes would have been also a part of FUNDESCOLA IIIA, the data are not
disaggregated by municipality or individual schools thus making correlations between Project
inputs and impacts difficult to attribute.

70.      Bearing these issues in mind, this section evaluates the accomplishment of
FUNDESCOLA IIIA PDOs related to the improvement of educational system's equity and school
effectiveness in participating schools. The table below illustrates the initial, revised and achieved
outcomes as set forth for FUNDESCOLA IIIA. An analysis of the scope of the student
achievement, provided mainly to contextualize the effect of FUNDESCOLA series on more in
depth outcomes, in assisted regions since 1998 can be found in section 3.5.

71.      Objective ­ to reduce inequalities among primary education schools: The achievement of
this goal is rated as satisfactory. One of the two targets established was surpassed while the other
missed its target by a narrow margin at the time of loan closing, although it is expected to be
completed. The Project surpassed the outcome on the dissemination of guidelines to implement
minimum standards in the Education Secretariats, although it lagged in increasing student
enrollment in schools adopting the minimum standards. As the indicators suggest
FUNDESCOLA IIIA contributed satisfactorily to the reduction in inequalities in primary
education schools in the selected poor regions of Brazil.

72.      Indicator ­ PMFE guidelines disseminated in 201 education secretariats in beneficiary
micro-regions: The goal of this indicator was to reach 201 Education Secretariats. The Project
reached 384 Secretariats as of June 2008, thus surpassing the original goal by 91%. Several
factors contributed to exceeding the goal, including the scaling up from 384 to 2,704
municipalities in the selected regions and the extended implementation period which provided an
additional 18 months for project implementation.

73.      Indicator ­ A total of 1,023,828 primary education students enrolled in beneficiary
micro-regions schools operating under PMFE: By June 2008, the Project had reached 809,254 or
the equivalent of 79% of the goal. The implementation gap is related to the delays experienced in
the in the implementation of the minimum standards (PMFE) given that these are required to be
in place before they have a sizable effect on changing enrollment levels. A delay in a pre-
requisite activity caused inevitable delays on subsequent activities such as efforts to increase
enrollment.

74.      In general, the delays to set the minimum standards are linked primarily to delays in
procurement processes to the implementation of PAPE, particularly in terms of infrastructure for
classrooms and sanitary facilities upgrading. The delays experienced with procurement processes
to purchase school equipment to bring identified classrooms to minimum operational standards
compounded overall delays. Procurement processes were particularly affected by: (i) a high turn-
over in procurement staff within the State Education Secretariats; by the time capacity was ripe,
technical staff would be rotated; (ii) a slow pace in the quality assurance process to certify the
quality of equipment and school furniture; and (iii) cumbersome bureaucratic requirement to
carry out procurement processes with several state level Government authorities.

75.      A positive learning experience worth highlighting is that of equipment where the project
set an important precedent by establishing uniform technical specifications for equipment which
has resulted in better furniture that responds to learning and ergonomic standards. The technical
specifications were officially approved by the Institute for Technological Research in the State of
Sao Paulo (IPT) and the National Institute of Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality
(INMETRO). The standards are used regularly within the education context in Brazil.

76.      Objective ­ to increase primary schools effectiveness: The achievement of this goal is
rated as satisfactory. The Project surpassed the goal to increase student enrollment in schools in
the targeted micro regions that had at least one FUNDESCOLA product under implementation.
The goal of having a set of products developed, tested and evaluated was partially achieved since
there were some products (as of June 2008) still going through the evaluation phase, though the
activities continue under the auspices of MEC and are expected to be completed in due course.
Based on document analysis and consultation at state level, it is clear FUNDESCOLA IIIA had a
role in increasing school-based interventions and contributing to improvements in system
effectiveness in selected regions.



                                                                                                 30

77.      Indicator ­ complete the full cycle (development, test, evaluation) for each of the
products designed by FUNDESCOLA, along with the complementary programs designed to
support the implementation of the products. Moreover, ensure secretariats complete evaluations
of the products as well as the impacts of the products on schools and student learning outcomes.
The goal was partially achieved by loan closing and is expected to be achieved in the near future.
The full cycle was completed for three products, namely the PDE, PES and Active School. By
June 2008, another five products (PAPE, GESTAR I, GESTAR II, PRALER and Indigenous
Active School) had completed the development and testing phase and were in the process of
evaluation. After loan closing the following products were incorporated to the educational
technology guide from MEC: PDE, PES, Escola Ativa, PAPE, PRALER, GESTAR I and II.

78.      Indicator ­ A total of 1,023,828 primary education students enrolled in schools in
beneficiary micro-regions that were implementing at least one school improvement product with
support from the Secretariats. The Project reached 1,156,257 students; thus, surpassing the goal
by 13% as of through June 2008. As was the case with the achievement of the goals related to
PMFE, the scaling up to 2,704 municipalities and the extension in the length of implementation
contributed to implementation efforts and to surpassing targets. The difficulties inherent in the
implementation of school improvement products, coupled with the challenges to launch school-
based incentives and strategies to motivate parents and students in the respective beneficiary
schools, cannot be underestimated and perhaps point the real merits of achieving this goal.

3.3 Efficiency

79.      A thorough economic analysis of costs and benefits was carried out during the
preparation of the FUNDESCOLA III; a level of detail not commonly seen at the time the project
was being designed (See Annex 3 for details on the economic analysis on costs and benefits for
the operation). The efficiency and effectiveness of distinct educational systems in the targeted
micro-regions took center stage in the analysis. Since most educational systems were found
lacking in experience and capacity to implement large-scale interventions the analysis performed
a sensitivity analysis with to cater to different scenarios and implementation pace possibilities.

80.      The sensitivity analysis carried out to estimate the Net Present Value (NPV) and the
Internal Return Rate (IRR) for the overall operation, considered a set of 12 possible scenarios
composed of a series of indicators, including potential productivity increases (reflected as wage
increases) and improved retention flows. The estimated IRR were satisfactory for all scenarios,
ranging from 19.2% to 29.8% and surpassing the Bank standard discount rate set of 10%-12% set
as cut off for decision-making. The outcomes did not vary much across scenarios, which
suggested the possibility of expecting gains above the minimum necessary for investment return.
The next table shows the outcomes for the 12 scenarios:

81.     The sensitivity analysis attempted to identify the variables (and their values) that would
make NPV equal to zero or the IRR equivalent to the discount rate of 12%. The analysis found
that the student income flow would have to decrease by more than 36% to make the NPV
negative (all others variables kept constant), while direct costs would need to increase by of 57%
to make the IRR equivalent to the discount rate. Based on the results, it was concluded that
FUNDESCOLA III was a viable investment and that it did not present economic risk. Specific
assumptions used to determine the costs and benefits for FUNDESCOLA from 2002 ­ 2010 as
well as the direct costs and financing sources are included in Annex 3.

82.     Although it would have been informative and useful to carry out a cost benefit analysis at
Loan closing to compare the original estimates with the reality, this was not possible for several
reasons. First, the initial analysis covered the two APL phases of FUNDESCOLA III. Second,
there was no baseline established to track these types of impacts, or a tracer study to reconstruct a
cohort and test assumptions, particularly those related to increase in income.

83.     In terms of efficiency, although the project achieved partially the goal of increasing
transition rates in the targeted micro-regions, analysis of other equally important efficiency
indicators to improve effectiveness point to a reduction in the age-grade distortions in the targeted
micro-regions. Although the project did not target the age-grade distortion specifically, the
combination of actions to raise minimum standards and promote the implementation of school
based products had the indirect effect of improving this indicator in particular and student flows
more generally. The importance of these direct impacts cannot be underestimated: international
evidence is clear on the negative impact of age-grade distortions on school repetition, drop out
and student achievement. As illustrated in the table below, from 2002 to 2006 the age-grade
distortion in primary education decreased in the North, Northeast and Center-West regions of
Brazil (see additional comments in Annex 3):

84.     In terms of public finance, the effect of the project was small. The overall financial
envelope for the implementation of the FUNDESCOLA Program was US$ 1.3 billion, which in
2001 represented about 0.5% of the net public debt and 0.8% of the Federal Government debt. As
proportion of the budget envelope available to MEC, counterpart expenditures for
FUNDESCOLA IIIA's first year of implementation represented less than 1% of Federal
Government total expenditures on education.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

85.     FUNDESCOLA IIIA's overall outcome was rated satisfactory considering the continued
relevance of the project objective's satisfactory achievement. The analysis of results indicates that
by meeting its objectives FUNDESCOLA IIIA contributed to implement interventions to reduce
inequalities across primary education schools and increased school effectiveness.

86.     It should be highlighted that although the designed was comprehensive and took into
account lessons learned from previous operations in the sector, some design elements could have
benefited from further refinement. In particular, the establishment of overarching goals could
have had a more direct or attributable connection with the planned intervention. An illustration to



                                                                                                  32

the lose connection is seen in the goals that were set for student learning outcomes. Three factors
contributed to the apparent disconnect. First, data exist only at aggregate levels (State) while the
project interventions had a more restricted geographic parameter (Municipalities). Given the
myriad of factors affecting learning outcomes, it would seem impractical to use aggregate data to
measure location-specific project impacts on beneficiaries. Second, there were changes in the
learning measurements and standards as of 2005, thus changing the goal posts mid way through
the implementation process. Third, the project did not establish a baseline with its corresponding
control group; thus making it difficult to isolate project impacts.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

87.      Poverty Impacts and Social Development: the interventions to raise minimum
operational standards in schools represented a fundamental change in the way in which
Government implemented social policy. That is, from strategies that provided equal resources to
all, irrespective of conditions, to differentiated strategies that took into account income
inequalities. In this vein, FUNDESCOLA IIIA followed the direction set for the Bolsa Família
Program, by focusing on strengthening schools whose physical plant, equipment levels and
classroom conditions were severely dilapidated and below quality standards, since these schools
cater to the bulk of students from low income and vulnerable households.

88.      More broadly, the project interventions aimed at improving school effectiveness in the
North, Northeast and Center-West regions may, in the long term, contribute to increase school
attainment levels of young people from poor families providing them therefore with the necessary
foundation skills to gain employment and make a living. Since the Project did not establish a
baseline it is difficult to prove empirically the assumption on this dimension.

89.      An important by-product from the implementation of FUNDESCOLA IIIA is the
project's influence on parental and community involvement in school development planning and
school affairs. The importance of reaching out to parents and the community members cannot be
underscored. The international literature indicates clearly that involved communities and parents
are an essential ingredient to improving the school's effectiveness, accountability and overall
learning environment.

90.      The consultations carried out for the preparation of the ICR took into account
perspectives from parents, communities and schools representatives. The findings indicate
communities felt they had a greater role and a voice in decision-making in the schools
participating in FUNDESCOLA.

91.      Indigenous Education: the Project contributed significantly to the advancement of
products specifically designed to cater to the needs and context of indigenous groups. The Active
School product was customized to support indigenous multi-grade schools (Indigenous Active
School product). The positive evaluations of the product encouraged the expansion of the
Indigenous Active Schools to the states of Amazonas, Ceará, Paraíba and Roraima. By loan
closing approximately 550 indigenous teachers had received extensive training on the
implementation of this product and associated materials. This achievement may be added as
another of the positive byproducts of FUNDESCOLA IIIA.

92.      Analysis of the overall FUNDESCOLA Program Series: Given the relevance, size
and goals that had been set for the achievement of the FUNDESCOLA Program series by 2010
(of which the current ICR is a part of), the table below attempts to analyze the Program's longer
term expected goals and achievements.


                                                                                                 33

93.      Objective ­ improve student learning achievement in beneficiary micro-regions: Given
the decision not to proceed with FUNDESCOLA IIIB, which was the phase with specific targets
on student learning outcomes by 2010, the ICR did not make an assessment of the factors
affecting the achievement of such indicators, although it did provide preliminary information on
the trends of such indicators as of 2003, the latest year for which entirely compatible data are
available. The paragraphs below focus on the analysis of achievement of the indicators included
as part of the FUNDESCOLA IIIA design, although not included in the first phase of the APL
and therefore not entirely attributable to the implementation of FUNDESCOLA IIIA..

94.      Indicator ­ increase average transition rates to 85% in primary education schools in
targeted micro-regions: This goal was partially achieved this goal in the three regions. The partial
achievement of this indicator may be explained by the following two factors: (i) the initial
repetition rates were very high (25% on average) and (ii) school-based planning tools, products
and materials placed an emphasis on student and parental participation and discouraged
premature drop outs.

95.      With respect to the average transition rates, it should be noted that between 1999 and
2005, the North regions registered improvements above the average for Brazil. While the
Brazilian average transition rate had a positive increase of 1.2 percent point (from 78.3% to
79.5%), in the Center-West and North regions the increases reached an average of 4.6 points
(from 75,1% to 79,7%) and 3.2 points (from 69,9% to 73,1%) respectively. This shows an
elasticity approximately 3 times higher that the average for Brazil. For reference, in the
Northeast, the increase was just 0.7 percent points (from 70.7% to 71.4%) over the same period.



                                                                                                 34

96.       Indicator ­ Proportion of 4th grade students in targeted micro-regions attaining at least
elementary level of proficiency in Mathematics as follows: 62% in the North, 59% in the
Northeast and 68% in the Center-West: Based on the data available, the Project did not achieve
the established goals. Alas, the pattern occurred was opposite to the expected direction.

97.       Indicator ­ Proportion of 4th grade students in targeted micro-regions attaining at least
elementary level of proficiency in Portuguese Language as follows: 67% in the North, 66% in the
Northeast and 69% in the Center-West: Similar to the findings immediately above, the project did
not achieve the established goals. As was the case with the results for Mathematic, a decrease in
the proportion was recorded.

98.       The following observations may be useful to explain, albeit partially, the behavior
observed in the proportion of students not reaching proficiency goals in Mathematics and
Portuguese Language. First, proficiency goals were established to be achieved by 2010, upon
completion of FUNDESCOLA IIIB. However, the data presented by MEC to assess progress to
date comes from SAEB 2003 and Prova Brasil for 2005, though the latter is not entirely
compatible. Since the loan closing was June 2008, there is, in essence, a seven year period of the
FUNDESCOLA series, including most of the implementation of FUNDESCOLA IIIA, which is
not being considered when measuring the impacts because the data are dated. In other words the
indicators are not covering the period of implementation. Interestingly, the IDEB indicator does
show improvements from 2005 to 2007, though admittedly, it is a different indicator (even though
it includes learning outcomes) and it cannot be entirely attributed to the Project.18 Another factor
that may have affected the trends on proficiency levels (positively or otherwise) may be
associated with the intensity of interventions at school level (a combination of the number of
products and length of implementation). It would be expected the longer the experience with the
implementation of FUNDESCOLA products the greater the variations in student learning
outcomes. Also, since municipality participation was voluntary, preliminary evaluation analyses
on learning outcome trends need to consider the opportunity issue19. Finally, as mentioned
previously, the SAEB data are available only at state level yet FUNDESCOLA interventions are
targeted to micro-regions and use schools as the unit of implementation and analysis. A more
refined measurement and assessment tool to capture school-level differences across participating
and non-participating schools would probably have been more appropriate20.

3.6 Summary of Findings from Stakeholder Workshops

99.       Annex 6 to the ICR provides detailed analysis and results from several workshops
undertaken with stakeholders in FUNDESCOLA IIIA. This section includes a summary of key
results.

100.      GESTAR and PRALER are products that respond to key educational problems: Feedback
from stakeholders in the Center-West region revealed these products had a practical positive
effect on the municipal education secretariats and as tool to assist individual schools.


18 See Summary of Borrower's performance in Annex 7.
19 During the conference in which FUNDESCOLA's overall evaluation was discussed in July 2008, MEC
informed the opportunity issue would be considered in a Government report currently under preparation to
determine the impacts of FUNDESCOLA program.
20 The IPEA, which was the organization responsible for the FUNDESCOLA program evaluation at the
time, is fully aware of the limitation using these indicators, it is expected therefore that such limitation will
be appropriately addressed in their final report.


                                                                                                              35

101.     Institutionalization of PDE at Sate level: the strategic planning model developed by
FUNDESCOLA was adopted by the educational system in the state of Goiás reducing
complexities and preparation time in the development of the Action Plan (PAR). The State
Education Secretariat in Goiás reported it intends to use the tools from PDE to monitor their
action plan.

102.     Institutionalization of Project activities: The case of Teresina, capital of Piauí, provides
insightful lessons on the role that FUNDESCOLA played in improving a series of education
indicators. It is clear the rhetoric around the need to increase the effectiveness of management
practice and efficiency is consistent with the practice. The Municipal Education Secretariat
followed closely the guidelines established for the implementation of FUNDESCOLA products.
Teresina improved most education indicators and achieved the highest score in the 2007 ranking
of the Basic Education Development Index (Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica -
IDEB)) for Northeastern capitals and the third best score among Brazilian state capitals.

103.     Articulation of COEPs:      The consultations in State Education Secretariats in Piauí,
Alagoas and Amazonas indicate the COEP is still seen as distant from these institutions, although
in the case of Teresina-PI this finding went in the opposite direction. An analysis of specific cases
and circumstances provides a range of factors that either promotes or inhibits local level
articulation with the Municipal and State Education Secretariats.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible to Low

104.     This section evaluates inherent risks and, based on the findings, assigns a rating to the
sustainability of the project. In general, an evaluation of changes in sector policy and priorities
did not pose a high risk to the concept and objectives supported by the project or the project
implementation. While there were delays observed during Government administration transitions,
the project had gather robust evidence through the evaluation of its products and methodologies
and had strong support from targeted micro-regions. Throughout the implementation period, the
Government continued to sharpen its measurement tools to ensure available information is
disaggregated and allow for results to be provided by different unit of analysis.

105.     Regarding the project design, an assessment of project documents indicate that sufficient
attention was given to provide technical support and advisory services to the State Education
secretariats and municipalities to ensure the principles and products supported by
FUNDESCOLA were mainstreamed into their local planning structures while respecting local
specificities. The support was essential to launch the work at the local level given the limited
institutional capacity or lack of exposure with institutional and school-based management
improvement products.

106.     An assessment of external factors affecting the project indicates a low risk, particularly
since the tenets of the FUNDESCOLA program have been incorporated into national policy and
disseminated across the country. This denotes institutional backing to continue supporting the
achievement of the project's most relevant outcomes and the Federal Government's commitment
to the objectives of FUNDESCOLA IIIA.

107.     The risks related to changes or reductions in the continuity of the Government of Brazil
financing FUNDESCOLA-type programs that target schools-based management initiatives and


                                                                                                  36

improvements on student learning outcomes is low. There is evidence the Government is moving
aggressively towards refining measurement tools to gauge educational performance, raising
educational attainment and improving the quality of education and the internal efficiency of the
system. A clear financing commitment to better measurement is the introduction of IDEB and the
launch of the Education Development Plan and the regulation of the National Wage Baseline for
Teachers.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

108.    This section evaluates and assigns a rating to the Bank and Borrower's performances in
the design, implementation and oversight of the FUNDESCOLA IIIA Project.

5.1 Bank Performance

5.1.1 Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

109.    The Bank team carried out in-depth technical analyses before launching the design phase
of the project. The analyses were deemed to be of quality and relevant to the preparation the third
intervention of FUNDESCOLA series. The project design ensured lessons form implementation
were incorporated in this third phase of the series. The only exception to this assessment is in the
areas of monitoring and evaluation to reach a better balance between attribution and contribution
to overall education sector goals and design of an impact evaluation to measure more rigorously
school-based interventions.

110.    The preparation phase lasted eight months, almost on track with the planned length of
preparation established for the project, which was seven months. Throughout the preparation the
Bank team coordinated closely with the Government to make sure all stakeholders involved in the
implementation of the project would participate and be informed of their roles and
responsibilities. A series of challenges were identifies before project launch to make sure these
were mitigated to the extent possible prior to entering the implementation phase.

111.    As mentioned previously, the PDOs selected during the design phase were relevant by
responding directly to issues identifies in the sector, namely inefficiency, inequality and poor
student learning outcomes. While there have been improvements in key national education
indicators since the design of the FUNDESCOLA IIIA Project, the principles behind the PDOs
remain relevant today. The one caveat that merits highlighting in this report relates to the lack of
proactive and forward planning to incorporate impact evaluation, along with baseline information
and control groups, and risk evaluation strategies. The specifics shortcoming of some elements of
the M&E strategy, disconnection between the project intervention and indicators selected to
measure progress/success, and the lack of impact evaluations were discussed in previous section.

5.1.2 Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

112.    The quality of Bank supervision is rated as satisfactory. The ICR analysis identified the
system to measure student assessment, the level of integration across information systems and the
establishment of a baseline and control groups as elements of project design that could have



                                                                                                 37

benefited from refinement from the outset.        A review of project documentation and Aide
Memoire indicate the Bank team's awareness of the importance of the elements mentioned above,
albeit less so on the issue of establishment of a baseline and control group, and a proactive
approach to the identification of issues that could potentially compromise the fulfillment of the
PDOs or physical and financial targets. The Aide Memoire make suggestions to pout in place
measures to mitigate their potential impacts on the project.

113.     An illustrative example of the creativeness of supervision missions relates to the
recommendations included in the Implementation Supervision Reports (ISR) throughout the
difficulties experienced in 2003 and 2004 when (i) Government changes in the administration
slowed the pace of project implementation, (ii) there was a high turn over in project leadership
and technical implementation teams as a result of DGP to FNDE and (iii) the Federal
Government provided very strict budget ceilings. The continued dialogue with the Borrower,
coupled with the agreed recommendations to get the project on an implementation track, were
instrumental to realigning the project back to its tenets and ensuring the new Administration was
well informed on project achievements and implementation strategy, including a new role of the
DGP and COEP, to bring actions to the local level. Similarly, in 2004 the Bank supervision team
recommended that DGP/FDNE become more selective in the development of new school-based
management products to ensure these would go through a full evaluation before being expanded.
As a result, a more effective organization on the production of FUNDESCOLA "products" was
agreed and a functional structure emerged to support such organization. This allowed a more
focused and strategic approach to product development and in depth analysis of their results in
the classroom.

5.1.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

114.     The Bank team performed satisfactorily through the project design and supervision
phases of FUNDESCOLA IIIA. The project design phase incorporated lessons from experience
in Brazil and internationally. The design team also performed due diligence with the economic
and financial analyses to justify and fine tune the operation, particularly with a concern of
maximizing sustainability. During the implementation phase, the supervision team remained a
close technical partnership with the Borrower to customize approaches while maintaining a sharp
focus on achieving the PDOs.

5.2 Borrower Performance

5.2.1 Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

115.     The Government performance is rated as satisfactory. The Borrower worked in close
coordination with the Bank design team to prepare FUNDESCOLA IIIA in record time. Although
some fiduciary and administrative processes, which were subject to the control of the Federal
Government, affected the pace of project implementation in 2003 and 2004 as mentioned above,
the project implementation team ensured communication links remained open with the Bank and
Government entities at various levels to resolve impasses and reinitiate implementation
immediately upon agreement was reached with new Administrative authorities. The importance
of strong leadership in DGP/FNDE to play a brokering role, in good faith, across stakeholders
cannot be underestimated.


                                                                                              38

116.     The project was rated unsatisfactory in its Implementation (IP) rating almost
consecutively for a period of 18 months from June 2003 to December 2004. The rating assigned
at that time reflected the continuous changes in project management leadership, key staffing
positions at various levels and the lack of a sufficient budgetary allocation from the federal level.
The observations were discussed with the Borrower on several occasions and recorded in the
Aide Memoire filed in the system. The technical team and the Borrower reached an agreement in
late 2004 which allowed for an effective operational response and, as a result, a turn around of
implementation.

117.     In general, the Government's commitment to FUNDESCOLA IIIA is palpable from the
early stages when the publication "Brazil - a call to action: combating school failure in the
Northeast of Brazil", played a pivotal role in the conceptualization of a Program focused on
reducing inequalities, improving institutional capacity using a decentralized model and promoting
school-based change with "proven" classroom technologies and tools. At the same time, the
Federal Government continued its program of financing school directly to purchase "quality"
interventions that fit their local school-development plan.

118.     Commitment to longer term sustainability was cemented in 2007 with the launch of the
National PDE by the Federal Government and concomitant financing requirement using the
public budget. Since then, all 5,563 municipalities in Brazil have committed to achieving
Education for All and to applying strategic planning tools to improve effectiveness an reduce
inequities across states and municipalities.

119.     The State and Municipal Governments cooperated fully with project implementation,
although a high turnover was observed in the COEP and the Municipal Education Secretariats. At
times the changes resulted in having to extend partnership agreements to ensure the full
implementation of some aspects of the FUNDESCOLA IIIA that had been agreed to be
implemented at local level.

5.2.2 Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

120.     A review of project documents and ISRs, coupled with the partial completion of the goals
established under Component 1, the performance rating assigned to the implementing agencies is
moderately satisfactory. At times procurement delays and bureaucratic procedures exacerbated
the problem.

121.     The performance and leadership of the DGP is commendable. Despite the disturbances of
2003 and 2004, the team maintained leadership and a strong core of technical staff that supported
the States and Municipalities to operationalize products at local level. The performance of the
Municipal and State level staff was also solid even though their commitment was at times limited
given the high turnover of staff, the lack of understanding of the tenets of FUNDESCOLA, the
inertia to continue to plan using outdated institutional modalities and the fear of the unknown
with a project that challenged the status quo on planning practice.

122.     A weakness in the role of implementation agencies that is worth highlighting is the
limited coordination between the DGP and the international agencies (UNDP and UNESCO) that
were selected to partner with the GoB in the implementation of various project activities.
Although the partnerships with these international agencies, formalized through official Project
Documents (PRODOCs), were monitored closely. Nonetheless, weaknesses were identified with


                                                                                                 39

the periodicity and comprehensiveness of information submitted by the international agencies.
The lack of information on PRODOC implementation status was a recurrent theme despite
repeated requests from the DGP and World Bank leadership to submit relevant information.

123.     Another weakness was observed in the institutional capacity of the COEPs to monitor
and maintain fiduciary information, and associated reports, up to date. Although the project
supervision records show proactiveness from the part of the DGP to strengthen the institutional
capacity in the COEPs to carry out project activities and submit information as required per the
Legal Agreement, the high turn over in the States and Municipalities, coupled with a stretched
capacity in the DGP, compromised the efforts. The fiduciary oversight became quite complex
when carrying out decentralized procurement as the process involved a number of state level
stakeholders including State Attorney General Offices.       Finally, the lack of an integrated
communication and information system to ease and accelerate information flows across
stakeholders exacerbated the weaknesses.

5.2.3 Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

124.     The assessment on the overall Borrower's performance takes into account the ratings on
the Borrower's performance as well as the ratings assigned to the Implementing Agencies
contracted by Government on a long term basis to carry out specific project related activities. The
overall rating assigned is moderately satisfactory. While the Federal Government has shown
strong commitment to FUNDESCOLA IIIA and introduced corrective measures at critical
junctures over the implementation period, the same cannot be said for the Implementation
Agencies involved in the project. Despite repeated attempts to resolve the situation and promote a
culture of cooperation with the Agencies, the Borrower had difficulties in obtaining relevant
information on a timely basis. The effect of the latter compromised the achievement of planned
goals, particularly on the establishment of the minimum operational standards.

6. Lessons Learned

125.     This section presents an analysis and reflection of key implementation lessons.

126.     Institutionalization and Outputs: The ICR analysis identified the Municipal Education
Secretariats of Teresina and Acre as having high level of commitment and outstanding results in
their educational indicators over the period of reference. Upon a closer look and consultations in
situ, it was noted Teresina implemented the PDE in all primary schools and ensured PME
financing would be available to all schools. They report improvements in the retention rate in
grades 1-4 was from approximately 72% (in 2002) to 83% (in 2005). Other indicators that moved
in an ascending and steep direction in Teresina included the IDEB in 2007 when Teresina
achieved the first ranking among the Northeastern capitals and the third place among Brazilian
capitals. A clear lesson displayed with the example of Teresina is that even in States that have
adverse socio economic conditions in place, it is possible to improve indicators when there is
continued commitment and leadership in place.

127.     Product Development Strategy: The FUNDESCOLA IIIA had a clear strategy for
product development, which ranged from design to evaluation and dissemination of products. The
importance of testing and evaluating products proved to be essential in the scaling up of the
project. In addition, the dissemination of results within Brazil and beyond served to galvanize
support around a school-based strategy to improve quality, efficiency and learning outcomes.


                                                                                                40

Indeed, the Federal Government acknowledged the proven track record of the FUNDESCOLA
products was among the factors that motivated them to scale up the implementation of some of
the products within the umbrella of the national PDE. A lesson on the importance of focused
interventions that carefully develop, test and evaluate products before taking them to scale and
while going to scale continuously disseminating information.

128.     Bottom-up Approach to Strategic Planning: The FUNDESCOLA approach to strategic
planning uses a bottom-up framework rather than a top-down approach. This approach is central
to the successful implementation of the project given that behavior change is more likely to take
place when there is genuine self-reflection on issues and local leadership to plan a way forward to
make changes. The FUNDESCOLA IIIA places the responsibility on individual schools to
identify their needs and draft their own solutions, while providing products, tool and reference
materials to assist individual schools or to technical staff providing support. The approach has
now taken root in Brazil and has served to galvanize Federal Government support around it to
ensure future programs are guided by a bottom-up principle.

129.     Quality Assurance Processes of Technical Specifications: An important lesson may be
extracted   from    the  quality  assurance    and    certification process    implemented     under
FUNDESCOLA IIIA to ensure contracts for school furniture met robust technical and
ergonometric standards. The development of standards was coordinated with industry while
quality control was assured by a certification process led by several national independent
authorities. The technical specifications and standards have become a reference point to other
projects and programs in Brazil, thus reducing the transaction time for purchasing school
furniture and improving the quality of equipment in the classroom. The availability of
specifications that comply with recognized standards has resulted in better quality purchases and
reduced transactions time and costs related to the development of specifications.

130.     Information Systems, Data Sources and Baseline Information: The FUNDESCOLA
IIIA's design could have been refined further to include a strategy to integrate information
systems and include base line and control group information. The lack of consistent information
presented a challenge at the stage of gathering a global analysis of results. In addition to the data
sources, it is worth noting again that the indicators selected to measure the project objectives for
the FUNDESCOLA III project in its totality had the shortcoming of being too broad (Statewide)
to use them as a meaningful indicator to measure project outcomes and impacts. At the time of
the design phase it could have been useful to reflect further on the proposed data sources to
determine a better balance between project attribution (in which case should be very narrowly
tied to interventions) and contribution (in which case there is a logical link, although the is not a
causal relationship).

131.     Political Changes and Project Management: The 2002 elections, which brought a new
administration from 2003 to 2006 resulted in changes in DGP and COEP technical staff. As
mentioned previously, the changes had a slow down effect on implementation. Although
preparations had been made to ensure a smooth transition between Government administrations,
the project could not be entirely shielded from the political climate and associated changes in
Government structures, including Bank financed projects. It would be important to identify these
types of risks more precisely and agree on different types of mitigation measures to minimize
disruptions on implementation.

132.     Implementation Pace and Stakeholders' Motivation: An interesting finding from the
stakeholder consultations carried out for the preparation of this ICR indicates stakeholders
(including teachers and school principals) tended to lose motivation whenever the implementation


                                                                                                  41

phase began to slow down. It is essential to maintain momentum to move efficiency along and
gain the trust of stakeholders who are ones carrying out the day to day work. Also, as was noted
during the field consultations, it is essential that once products are adopted for implementation,
there is consistency in their use; otherwise there is a risk of losing the audience after a brief try to
the program.

There was no change involving products conceived during FUNDESCOLA IIIA preparation. The
only difference that exists between products indicated in the table below, as well as in the
relevant tables in the PAD refers, to inclusion of a new item (product/output), of the
subcomponent added to the project in 2005, related to construction, expansion or rehabilitation of
520 new classrooms. The initial expectation was to build 650 new classrooms, but due to a
realistic cost analysis, it was established the goal of 520 new classrooms was established.

1.       The evaluation of FUNDESCOLA III carried out an analysis of costs and benefits of the
overall intervention23, which was not common practice at the time of the preparation of the
Project. The Educational system's effectiveness issue in beneficiary regions was part of this
economic analysis. It took into account that beneficiary regions lacked at the time of appraisal
integrated large-scale interventions, despite improvements noted in these years in the regions,
particularly with respect to educational access. The cost and benefit analysis, already mentioned,
undertaken in accordance with methodology described below, included a sensitivity analysis for
distinct scenarios:
                   FUNDESCOLA III costs were estimated;
                   A flow model was estimated for each beneficiary region;
                   A historical trend was applied to each flow model, considering methodology
                   designed by Ruben Klein (1995)24, to determine what would be the flow of
                   students without FUNDESCOLA III interventions;
                   FUNDESCOLA III's impact on flow was estimated for 2010 considering four
                   possible scenarios based on the percentage of schools that rose to minimum
                   operational standards;
                   The number of graduating students in each grade was projected and the
                   difference between flows with and without FUNDESCOLA was determined;
                   from these differences, out of school benefits were computed using private return
                   rates for each grade, and productivity accrual related to the ratio increase of
                   schools achieve SAEB learning standards;
                   the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), by means of
                   the sensitivity analysis, were computed and tested in different scenarios.

2.       The sensitivity analysis undertaken to compute NPV and IRR considered a set of 12
possible scenarios, based in the potential outcomes of productive increase and attainment flows.
IRR were satisfactory for all scenarios, varying between 19.16% and 29.84% and, consequently,
surpassed the discount standard rate of the Bank that is around 10% and 12%. Thus, the Project
potential to yield substantive benefits can be seen. The outcomes do not vary much between
scenarios, suggesting the possibility of gains over the minimum necessary for the return of the
investment. The table below shows the outcomes related to the 12 referred scenarios:

3.       Major premises used in FUNDESCOLA cost and benefits forecasts through time (2002 ­
2010) were the following:
                   average currency exchange used US$ 1.00 = R$ 2,80;
                   estimated marginal cost, unemployment rate and students ratio who study and
                   work kept constant all the time;
                   for each grade, a large number of children out of school would likely occupy
                   openings generated by student promotion within the system. Consequently, a
                   reduction in the number of schooling years due to higher promotion rates would
                   not reduce the overall number of enrolled students. This premise is based on
                   exceeding demand and considering the net and Gross rates of enrollment in the
                   three beneficiary regions at the time, that is, during this period it is possible that
                   an number of children desiring to enter the system always existed;

24For information on the detailed method of reference, see Klein, R. (1995) "Production and Use of Education
Indicators" That method considers the promotion, repetition and drop out rates, as proportion of the students transferred
from other systems or enrolled late.



                                                                                                                      46

                wage increase due to productivity gains is proportional to scores in SAEM tests;
                expected income gains, related to educational level may be set by mincerian
                return rate estimates.

4.      FUNDESCOLA III costs estimated for 2002-2010, considering the above mentioned
exchange rate and purchase power parity. In million of Real (R$), these cost estimates are as
follows:

 Costs

5.      In terms of cost distribution (current value in Real) of FUNDESCOLA III by financing
source, we have the following table:

6.      FUNDESCOLA III benefits were computed, as referred previously, based on student
improvement flows and productivity gains. In relation to gains, due to the weak relation between
outcomes measured from proficiency tests and income accrual, the option to undertake a
sensitivity analysis involving multiple scenarios and increased work revenue (0%, 1% and 2%) as
a productive growth proxy since FUNDESCOLA III implementation.

7.      In the sensitivity analysis, attempts were made to identify which variables ­ and their
values ­ would make NPV equal to zero or IRR equivalent to a 12% discount rate. For this
purpose, student income flow decreased over 36% to make negative NPV (all the remaining
variables kept constant), while an increase in direct costs of 57% would make IRR equivalent to
the discount rate. Consequently, it was possible to conclude that FUNDESCOLA III did not
present many risks in terms of its values. The results showed (see Table 1 of this Annex) that,
even in the worst scenario, FUNDESCOLA III's return rates surpassed the standard discount rate
of the Bank.

8.      A cost and benefit analysis was not carried out at the conclusion of FUNDESCOLA IIIA
because the analysis in previous paragraphs refers to the FUNDESCOLA III APL two phases.
However, FUNDESCOLA IIIB was not contracted by decision of the Government of Brazil.
Thus, some of the identified and discussed costs and benefits at the time of project appraisal were
not made (costs) or perceived (benefits). On the other hand, outcomes from FUNDESCOLA
IIIA's impact evaluation, not available at the time this report was completed, could provide
additional information s on efficiency and economic analysis relevant to this Project.

9.      In relation to efficiency, despite partial achievement of expected outcome in approval
average rates of beneficiary regions (section 3.5 of the main text), it is possible to discuss
FUNDESCOLA IIIA's probable contribution to reduction in the average age-grade distortion
rates in these regions. This Project did not specifically target age-grade distortion alleviation.



                                                                                                47

However, by financing components that raised schools to the minimum operational standards, and
the establishment of a school based development process, it fomented more favorable
environments for teaching and learning. In addition, it fostered the conditions that favor student
retention in schools and incentives to progress in the system,. Therefore, it indirectly worked
toward a better schooling flow. International studies show that school recurrence feeds age-grade
distortion and atrophy of teaching systems, substantially decreasing their efficiency. The reality is
that, in the North, Northeast and Center-West regions of Brazil between 2002 and 2006 the age-
grade distortion rates decreased as shown in table below:

10.      It can be seen by analyzing the table above, in regions where FUNDESCOLA assisted
between 2002 and 2006, age-grade distortion average rates decreased more than the Brazilian
average, except in Center-West region for the initial grades. This situation in the Center-West
region, however, instead of signaling a backlash, points to a scenario totally opposite, since in this
region the 2006 average rate for initial grades is lower than the national average (21.1% against
25.1%). The declines were higher in the Northeast (15.2 percentage points for the final grades and
11.1 percentage points for the initial grades), where rates were higher at the beginning of the
Project, which points to the correct focus of Project interventions.

11.      Some of the additional benefits inherent to FUNDESCOLA IIIA interventions may still
be mentioned, although they are not quantified in this ICR. We have, for example, the savings
from cut costs in the educational systems ­ improving internal efficiency of systems ­ of
beneficiary regions as result of the above-mentioned decrease in age-grade distortions and Project
interventions favoring the strengthening of these systems management. They contribute to a more
efficient use of financial resources made available to this end. In addition, considering that
society as a whole benefited rather than students alone, we can consider as Project benefits a
greater income distribution and health improvements derived from the positive changes in the
education level of families.

12.      Concerning the economic analysis, a study on impacts of FUNDESCOLA IIIA could
point to, if it dealt with disaggregated data at schools level, Project contributions in terms of
productivity. In view of the educational quality improvement, students tend to not only progress
faster in fundamental (and secondary) education, but also enter earlier into the job market instead
of dropping out of school. The variation analysis in age-grade distortions, as seen above, points to



                                                                                                   48

the possibility of FUNDESCOLA IIIA contributing to improving schooling flows in the regions
of its actions and, thus, favoring increments in terms of productivity of its beneficiaries.
13.      It is necessary to stress that, concerning finance analysis, FUNDESCOLA IIIA's
interventions to strengthen schools and local government management resulted in education
expenditures being more efficient in the systems of beneficiary regions. Therefore, as Project
activities begin to produce effects, FUNDEF resources, for example, were more efficiently used,
illustrating a clear financial affect on states and municipalities.

14.      In terms of public finance, the Project's effect was small. The FUNDESCOLA Program's
total resources amounted to US$ 1.3 billion (including all three phases and Government
counterpart funds), at the time of appraisal of FUNDESCOLA IIA representing approximately
0.5% of the net public debt, and 0.8% of the Federal government debt. Considering the MEC
budget and constitutional mandate, FUNDESCOLA IIIA's total counterpart expenditures
represented less than 1% of Federal government total expenditures on education.

15.      During the Project post implementation period, incorporation of FUNDESCOLA's
actions within Federal government public policies for the sector (see Education Development
Plan) shows that these actions are cost-effective, even when implemented at national level.

1.     The preparation of the ICR included a series of consultative workshops with stakeholders
involved in FUNDESCOLA IIIA carried out in July 2008. The consultations included discussions
with Federal Government representatives on the successful and unsuccessful experiences within
the scope of the Project and visits to select beneficiary states and municipalities. Meetings
undertaken in these localities included, in some places, visits to schools, education secretariats
and implementation agencies. The ICR team held semi-structured interviews and consultations.
The table below shows where these stakeholders interviews and consultations took place.

Outcomes from Consultations in the Center-West Region:

3.      GESTAR and PRALER: ready-made products for key-problems­ statements collected in
Aparecida de Goiania-GO evidenced one of FUNDESCOLA IIIA's practical effects on municipal
education secretariats, which identified the greatest difficulties faced by its schools, but did not
have technology to address them. GESTAR and PRALER were mentioned as examples of
products developed by the Project and made available to municipal education secretariats that
assisted their schools.

4.      COEP policy and work ­ stakeholders that were heard in Goias reported how political-
partisan issues affected the Project's M&E model including the direct and indirect coordination of
COEPs with municipal education secretariats. Evidence collected shows how good strategies
designed during project preparation, are not always, complied with during implementation
including for political reasons. In this kind of situations the solution adopted involved a direct
coordination between municipal education secretariats and DGP technical staff.

5.      State-municipalities partnership ­ the subcomponent execution to build schools in Goiás
is an example of a typical situation of state-municipal partnership once the bidding process to
build five schools financed by the Project in this state were managed by municipalities, but the
whole monitoring cycle of works was undertaken by the Goiás State Education Secretariat. This
was a useful arrangement to compensate for the lack of institutional capacity at municipal level
and to allow for effective monitoring of the Project.

6.      PDE institutionalization ­ the strategic planning model developed by FUNDESCOLA is
internalized in such way in the Goiás state educational system that the preparation of articulated
action plans (PAR) was undertaken in a speedy and easy manner in this state. In addition, the
Goiás Education Secretariat advised that it will use PDE's own tools to monitor this action plan.

Outcomes from Consultations in the Northeast region:

7.      Institutionalization of Project activities - Project institutionalization at Teresina-PI
Municipal Education Secretariat (SEMEC) was one of the most successful experiences among all
the beneficiary municipalities. Comparing the case of Teresina-PI with those of other state
capitals, which are, theoretically, municipalities with better conditions to incorporate Project
technology, considering institutional capacity of beneficiary education secretariats. Based on
results from workshops,effective management of the educational systems, including schools, is
not part of a subjective dimension, but intertwined with attitudes, behaviors and actions of
SEMEC leaders and technical staff. To achieve the planned outcomes, this secretariat followed
the designed syllabus integrally during Project preparation. As a result, products such as PDE,
PMFE and Active Schools were incorporated, before Project completion, into the range of
solutions offered by SEMEC to schools for tackling their problems, expanding the offer of these
products beyond the limit of FUNDESCOLA IIIA. Educational indicators significantly improved
during the Project's life between 2002 and 2007, drop-out rate decreased from 1.95% to 0.99%,
the age/grade distortion decreased from 21.01% to 7.41%, and the approval rate increase from
80.85% to 89% (these are SEMEC data); in addition, Teresina-PI achieved the best IDEB in 2007
of Northeastern capitals and the third best outcome among Brazilian capitals.

8.      GESTAR and evaluation culture ­ GESTAR implementation within theTeresina-PI
municipal network was reported as helped disseminate an evaluation culture in this network.
Teachers who participated in GESTAR capacity building activities passed on to their peers, after
returning to their original school, the acquired knowledge regarding evaluation. In addition,


                                                                                                 53

representatives of workshops undertaken in Teresina-PI recorded the "non-speller" nature of
GESTAR, in other words this product design allows adjustments to the learning realities of each
of the beneficiary schools during implementation.

9.       Active School ­ Teresina-PI represents a successful case for the Active School model
implementation and sustainability. The factor that explains the success of this product, according
to stakeholders, is the monitoring and evaluation strategies practiced by the Municipal Education
Secretariat since FUNDESCOLA IIIA's proposal. As part of this education network, the number
communities involved with multi-grade schools implementing the Active School is high and
parents themselves are taught to read and write in these schools.

10.      Articulation of the COEPs ­ statements gathered from the Piaui State Education
Secretariat and COEP representatives show a distancing from the Project state implementation
agency regarding the articulation role that is expected from it (pointed out as a "parallel
structure"), in favor of Project activities institutionalization. This scenario was exactly the
opposite of what was found at the Teresina Education Secretariat. Analyzing both situations and
stakeholders` statements gathered at the workshops, the complex basket of factors that explains
the success or not of local FUNDESCOLA IIIA implementation agencies articulation with the
state and municipal education secretariats is apparent.

11.      The above-mentioned distancing of COEP was reported by Alagoas, and Amazonas
Education Secretariats representatives (see next topic).

12.      Political interferences ­ consulted stakeholders in the Northeast interior reported that
changes in school management due to political indications made PDE implementation in
municipal schools difficult. It was mentioned that some schools had their principal changed four
times in just one year.

13.      Flexibility of the product Active School ­ in Alagoas, the migration of rural families to
the Southeast region during the sugarcane (typical crop in the state) non-harvesting season
significantly affects the school routine since children follow their agriculture worker parents,
returning to classrooms during harvesting season. School Active methodology was implemented
at rural schools respecting this reality and, in a flexible manner, allowing students to attend
classes according to the standard migratory flow of the region.

14.      Fiduciary issues and beneficiaries' perception ­ in Alagoas, Project beneficiaries reported
that school equipment and furniture distribution did not happen simultaneously for all schools.
This was later confirmed. Delays in the bidding processes for these goods caused this problem,
which negatively affected stakeholders' perception in this state.

Outcomes from Consultations in the North region:

15.      Articulation of the COEPs ­ in Amazonas and Alagoas, State Education Secretariat
representatives pointed to distancing of COEP as one of the crucial factors that made
FUNDSCOLA IIIA implementation difficult. In this state, this situation was worsened by the
high turn-over of staff in the COEP team, including the general coordination unit. Such difficulty
in communication with the implementation agency made full use of the opportunity to expand
Project activities difficult with the end of ZAP.

16.      Expansion of Project assistance and quality of technical assistance ­ expansion of ZAPs
limits, approved in 2005, has a peculiar effect in Amazonas and in Acre, in face of transportation


                                                                                                 54

difficulties typical in these states. Due to the increase in the number of municipalities technically
assisted and transportation hardships, the frequency of technical assistance to schools and
municipalities decreased.

17.      Strategic planning facilitating decision-making process ­ the implementation of strategic
planning in Amazonas State Education Secretariat and, mainly, in schools of this state, left a very
striking legacy in the educational systems, according to stakeholders' opinion. These
representatives stressed that decision-making processes became more flexible and timely, in
addition to being based on technical and transparent criteria.

18.      Difficulties in contracting good consultants ­ stakeholders in Amazonas stressed the
difficulties faced (at municipal and school levels) in contracting good consultants using Project
resources for two reasons: first, due lack of consultants with quality in the state, namely in the
interior; and second, due to the World Bank guidelines for contracting consultants' services that
regulates (and makes it difficult) to hire professionals who have links with public universities, for
example.

       Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

I - DADOS DO PROJETO


Conforme apresentados no RCI elaborado pelo Banco.

II ­ APRESENTAÇÃO

1.      Este Relatório analisa o Projeto Fundescola IIIA destacando seus objetivos, componentes,
subcomponentes, produtos e resultados esperados e obtidos; aspectos financeiros relevantes; e os
principais fatores que afetaram sua implementação. Além disso, destaca as mais significativas
lições aprendidas ao longo de todo o processo, desde sua elaboração até sua conclusão. Ao final
destaca comentários ao RCI elaborado pelo Banco.

III ­ INTRODUÇÃO

2.      De todos os projetos da série do Programa Fundescola, o Fundescola IIIA era o que
apresentava características mais específicas. Em primeiro lugar, com sua implementação, além de
dar continuidade à maioria das ações voltadas para as escolas e constantes dos Projetos anteriores,
pretendia-se iniciar uma segunda fase do Programa, voltada para a absorção de suas práticas pelas
secretarias de educação. Esse movimento se daria, basicamente, em duas etapas: a primeira,
disseminando os instrumentos de planejamento, monitoramento e avaliação desenhados para a
atuação de determinadas secretarias que manifestassem interesse e compromisso em adotá-los. A
etapa seguinte pretendia disseminar em larga escala, para a grande maioria das secretarias de
educação das regiões atendidas pelo Programa, os produtos consolidados na etapa anterior. A
passagem de uma etapa para outra se daria por meio do cumprimento de metas intermediárias.

IV ­ MISSÃO / OBJETIVOS DE DESENVOLVIMENTO DO PROGRAMA / PROJETO

3.      A análise dos objetivos deve levar em consideração as características peculiares do
Projeto, e concentra-se em sua consistência, hierarquia e grau de cumprimento, nos termos em
que foram estabelecidos nos documentos de referência do Projeto. O primeiro cuidado na análise
é distinguir quais objetivos seriam factíveis de serem cumpridos no âmbito das ações do
Fundescola IIIA e quais estariam, por definição, além de sua responsabilidade, uma vez que
foram projetados para um horizonte de tempo mais longo (2010), e, portanto, deveriam ser
atingidos na segunda fase (Fundescola IIIB), que não foi pactuada. Outra cautela diz respeito a
alguns indicadores construídos a partir do desenho inicial, que adotaram percentuais ou índices
para quantificar os resultados obtidos e que necessitariam de atualização, utilizando-se as mais
recentes bases de dados disponíveis, de forma a representarem, da melhor maneira possível, os
resultados obtidos.

4.      Essa expectativa é reiterada pelos Objetivos do Desenvolvimento do Programa:
        - Fortalecer as escolas primárias e instituições públicas responsáveis pelas escolas em
        conformidade com uma rede coordenada de administração, como forma de contribuir
        para o Propósito do Programa (em 2010):
        - Melhorar os resultados educacionais das crianças matriculadas em escolas públicas de
        ensino fundamental nas microrregiões-alvo do norte, nordeste e centro-oeste.

5.      Destaca-se que a expectativa de melhoria do desempenho educacional deveria ser
observada em 2010, e, exclusivamente, em relação a alunos matriculados nas escolas situadas nas
microrregiões, preferencialmente naquelas que tenham sido beneficiadas pelo Programa.
A descrição dos indicadores abaixo confirma essa afirmação:


                                                                                                56

Indicadores de Fim do Programa
    (1) Guias de PMFE disseminados para 80% das secretarias de educação das microrregiões.
    (2) 90% dos alunos do ensino fundamental matriculados em escolas localizadas nas
        microrregiões que tenham PMFE
    (3) Cada produto do Fundescola para melhoria da escola e das secretarias de educação
        desenvolvido, testado e avaliado.
    (4) Uma ou mais estratégias para disseminar os produtos do Fundescola desenvolvida e
        testada.
    (5) 80% dos alunos do ensino fundamental matriculados em escolas das microrregiões que
        tenham implementado um ou mais produtos de melhoria da escola ou de apoio à
        secretaria de educação.
    (6) Taxas de aprovação dos alunos do ensino fundamental regular, matriculados nas escolas
        das microrregiões no ano de 1997 estabelecida em 64,2% para o norte, 64,7% para o
        nordeste e 71,5% para o centro-oeste, aumentada para 85%, em 2010.
    (7) Nível de Proficiência em matemática dos alunos da 4ª série nas áreas-alvo do Projeto
        aumentada de 55%, 52% e 60% no norte, nordeste e centro-oeste, em 1997, para 62%,
        59% e 68% no norte, nordeste e centro-oeste, em 2010.
    (8) Nível de Proficiência em português dos alunos da 4ª série nas áreas-alvo do Projeto
        aumentada de 59%, 58% e 62% no norte, nordeste e centro-oeste, em 1997, para 67%,
        66% e 69% no norte, nordeste e centro-oeste, em 2010.

6.      Dentro dessa concepção, o papel do primeiro projeto seria o de oferecer condições para
que esses resultados fossem obtidos, como se pode verificar nos termos de seu Objetivo de
Desenvolvimento do Projeto Fundescola IIIA: Assistir as secretarias de educação-alvo na
redução das disparidades entre as suas escolas de ensino fundamental e aumentar a eficácia
dessas escolas, no âmbito da capacidade financeira de cada governo local. Os indicadores e
metas traçados permitem medir o grau de cumprimento do Objetivo de Desenvolvimento do
Projeto em duas dimensões: a eqüidade e a eficácia.

7.      A utilização do IDEB para aferir o cumprimento do Resultado/Impacto do Projeto
Fundescola IIIA pode ser sintetizada nas considerações abaixo:
a. Nas regiões atendidas pelo Programa, o IDEB, tanto das séries iniciais como das finais do
ensino fundamental, variou de maneira positiva, como em todo o Brasil. A média nacional foi de
10% de crescimento para as séries iniciais e de 8,5% para as finais, no período de 2005 a 2007.
b. Nas regiões do Projeto, o nordeste registrou maior crescimento nas séries iniciais (20,7%), o
que representou o maior crescimento de todo o país, seguido da região norte, com 13,3%, e da
região centro-oeste, com 10%


Indicadores de Resultado/Impacto

      Equidade
            1 ­ Guias de PMFE disseminados para 50% das secretarias de educação das
            microrregiões (áreas alvo do Projeto). Nos termos da Ajuda Memória da Missão do
            Banco realizada em setembro/2007, a meta foi quantificada em 201 secretarias.
            Resultado Final: 384 secretarias, correspondendo a um incremento de 90% da meta
            estabelecida.
            2 ­ 70% dos alunos de ensino fundamental matriculados em escolas localizadas nas
            microrregiões (áreas alvo do Projeto) que tenham os PMFE. Conforme a Ajuda
            Memória de setembro/2007, a meta foi quantificada em 1.023.828 alunos. Resultado
            Final: 809.254 alunos, o que significa cerca de 80% da meta.

            educação desenvolvido e testado e avaliado
         o Resultado Final
            ·   Produtos desenvolvidos: PDE, PES, PAPE, Escola Ativa, GESTAR I e
                PRALER.

            ·   Produtos em desenvolvimento: GESTAR II, Escola Ativa Indígena.

            4 ­ 70% dos alunos do ensino fundamental matriculados em escolas das
            microrregiões (áreas alvo do Projeto) que tenham implementado um ou mais
            produtos de melhoria da escola ou de apoio à secretaria de educação. A Missão de
            setembro/2007 quantificou esta meta em 1.023.828 alunos
            ·   Resultado Final: 1.156.257 alunos, superando a meta em aproximadamente
                13%.
            ·   5 ­ Taxas de aprovação dos alunos do ensino fundamental regular Norte =
                64,2%, Nordeste = 64,7%, Centro-oeste = 71,5%, para 85% em 2010.
            ·   Resultado Atual (2006): norte = 73,1%; centro-oeste = 79,7% e nordeste =
                71,4%.
            ·   6 - Nível 175 de proficiência em matemática dos alunos de 4ª série nas áreas-
                alvo do projeto ­ medido pelo SAEB25: norte = 55%, nordeste = 52%, centro-
                oeste = 60%; para norte = 62%, nordeste = 59%, centro-oeste = 68%, em 2010.
            ·   Resultado Atual (2003): norte = 33,9%; nordeste = 30,6% e centro-oeste =
                52,3%.
            ·   7 - Nível 175 de proficiência em português dos alunos de 4ª série nas áreas-alvo
                do projeto ­medido pelo SAEB26: norte = 59%, nordeste = 58%, centro-oeste =
                62%; para norte = 67%, nordeste = 66%, centro-oeste = 69%, em 2010.
            ·   Resultado Atual (2003): norte = 33,6%; nordeste = 28,9% e centro-oeste =
                47,5%.
            ·   A verificação do cumprimento dessas metas somente seria possível, em princípio,
                se ambos os Projetos (FIIIA e FIIIB) fossem implementados e concluídos
                conforme previsto, ou seja, em 2010. A conclusão do Fundescola IIIA com um
                ano de prorrogação e o cancelamento do Fundescola IIIB não oferece as
                condições mínimas necessárias para se observar, em 2008, os ganhos
                educacionais pretendidos pelo Programa. Agregam-se a isso, as dificuldades
                metodológicas na tentativa de realizar comparações ao longo do tempo dos
                índices de proficiência do SAEB. Além disso, as amostras do SAEB são
                realizadas no nível estadual, não permitindo a medição no nível dos municípios e,
                conseqüentemente, das microrregiões, áreas alvo do Projeto. Na impossibilidade
                de utilizarem-se esses parâmetros para uma verificação dos resultados
                educacionais obtidos pelo Projeto Fundescola IIIA, propõe-se uma solução que
                permita, pelo menos, uma aproximação na identificação dos ganhos obtidos nas




25SAEB: Sistema de Avaliação da Educação Básica. (OBS: Nível 175 = estágios intermediário + adequado no
SAEB 2003).

                regiões atendidas e nas microrregiões alvo, para os quais o Projeto possa ter
                contribuído.

8.      A escolha do IDEB apresenta algumas vantagens nesse sentido:
            Trata-se de um indicador oficial do Ministério da Educação que permite comparações
            ao longo do tempo e entre diversos níveis de agregação: por escola, por município,
            por microrregião, por estado, por região geográfica.
            Incorpora em sua construção os dois tipos de indicadores com os quais se pretendia
            medir os resultados do Programa: a) taxa de aprovação; b) proficiência em português
            e matemática.
            Atende ao ensino fundamental, desagregando-o nos níveis de 1ª a 4ª séries e 5ª a 8ª
            séries.
            Encontra-se atualizado com dados de 2007 (ano estabelecido para fechamento dos
            dados censitários do projeto), podendo ser comparado com 2005 (ano de início
            efetivo do Projeto Fundescola IIIA).

9.      É interessante notar que, nas regiões onde o Fundescola atendeu um maior número de
alunos, os resultados medidos pelo IDEB foram maiores para as primeiras séries do ensino
fundamental. Em particular, nos estados no Nordeste que possuíam os menores índices de 1ª a 4ª
série, em 2005, como Alagoas e Rio Grande do Norte, por exemplo, o crescimento do IDEB foi
da ordem de 32% e 26%, respectivamente, com coberturas de 65% e 62%. Essa constatação
reforça o potencial de redução de desigualdades regionais e locais dos produtos do Fundescola,
sem deixar de levar em conta outros instrumentos e políticas para o Ensino Fundamental voltados
para a equidade como o FUNDEF (em 2005) e o FUNDEB (a partir de 2007) e as próprias
políticas estaduais e municipais que podem ter contribuído para esse resultado, sem dúvida,
significativo.

V ­ DESENHO E RESULTADOS DO PROJETO

10.     O Projeto Fundescola IIIA foi estruturado em três componentes desdobrados em dez
subcomponentes, que proporcionaram um conjunto de produtos, tecnologias, metodologias e
modelos, tanto no âmbito gerencial como no pedagógico. A seguir, são apresentados os
componentes e subcomponentes, suas principais características, resultados esperados e obtidos:
11.
12.     Componente 1-Elevação das Escolas de Ensino Fundamental a Padrões Mínimos de
Funcionamento. Esse componente englobou um conjunto de atividades voltadas para as questões
de equidade do sistema educacional nas áreas-alvo do Projeto. A concepção, desenho e estratégia
de implementação dos Padrões Mínimos de Funcionamento da Escola ­ PMFE ao longo do
Programa visavam contribuir para a redução da desigualdade na oferta de serviços educacionais,
incluindo recursos materiais e humanos. Sua atuação no Projeto Fundescola IIIA se concentrou
no financiamento de insumos físicos essenciais que contribuíssem para que as unidades escolares
menos favorecidas pudessem atingir padrões mínimos de funcionamento. A escolha do objeto de
intervenção (sala de aula e sanitários dos alunos) reiterou o foco no aluno, garantindo-lhe
melhores condições ambientais, de segurança e salubridade, que pudessem contribuir para seu
melhor desempenho escolar.
13.
14.     Subcomponente 1A-Adequação Física Gerenciada Pela Escola. O principal produto
fornecido por esse subcomponente é o Projeto de Adequação de Prédios Escolares ­ PAPE que
consiste, basicamente, na adequação das salas de aulas de escolas selecionadas, de acordo com
parâmetros técnicos que proporcionem mais segurança, salubridade, estabilidade e funcionalidade



                                                                                              59

ao mais importante ambiente da escola para o processo ensino-aprendizagem, sem alteração de
sua área construída ou da disposição de seus espaços internos.
            Resultados Esperados: Pelo menos 10.000 salas de aula nas regiões-alvo
            beneficiadas com adequação física, além da adequação dos módulos sanitários.
            Resultados Obtidos: 8.941 salas de aula (89% da meta) e respectivos sanitários
            adequados o que equivale a intervenções em 1.817 escolas, beneficiando 631.982
            alunos.
            O não cumprimento integral da meta deveu-se às dificuldades na realização das
            licitações para que as adequações fossem concluídas em tempo hábil, incluindo os
            riscos inerentes ao atraso na instalação do mobiliário e equipamento para os alunos e
            professores.

15.     Subcomponente 1B-Provisão de Equipamento e Mobiliário. Promoveu a aquisição de
móveis e equipamentos básicos para a utilização adequada das salas de aula adequadas pelo
PAPE. Os itens adquiridos incluíram: conjunto aluno e conjunto professor, compostos de mesas e
cadeiras; conjunto professor, armário de aço e ventilador.
            Resultados Esperados: Pelo menos 10.000 salas de aula das regiões atendidas pelo
            FUNDESCOLA beneficiadas com o mobiliário e equipamento escolar necessários
            para elevar as escolas aos Padrões Mínimos de Funcionamento.
            Resultados Obtidos: 6.989 salas de aula atendidas (cerca de 70% do total previsto
            e 81% das salas adequadas).
            A dificuldade do cumprimento da meta deveu-se a alguns aspectos específicos,
            dentre eles:
                 ·  a.A desestruturação de algumas Comissões de Licitação, que, com as
                    mudanças administrativas estaduais em decorrência da mudança de governo
                    em 2003, perderam colaboradores experientes e com amplo conhecimento
                    dos procedimentos de licitações internacionais;
                 ·  b.A morosidade, ainda presente, em certos processos de certificação da
                    qualidade dos equipamentos e mobiliários adquiridos;
                 ·  c.A distância de determinadas escolas da capital do estado, pela própria
                    ampliação do raio de abrangência do Projeto, o que dificultou o acesso para
                    distribuição dos bens adquiridos.

16.     No sentido de garantir as condições de durabilidade, flexibilidade e ergonomia, o
processo de especificação e aquisição desses bens fomentou a criação, no âmbito do Programa
Fundescola, do Programa de Melhoria da Qualidade do Mobiliário e Equipamento Escolar ­
PMQE e promoveu a regulamentação da produção desses itens, por meio da NBR 14006/97, a
realização de um controle de qualidade pelo IPT e a obrigatoriedade da certificação pelo
INMETRO, quando da aquisição do conjunto aluno.

17.     Subcomponente 1C-Provisão de Livros de Leitura Suplementar. Esse componente
proveria livros de leitura suplementar para as escolas que adotaram os modelos pedagógicos do
Programa fundescola, com prioridade para as escolas com a proposta Escola Ativa. Esse
Componente não foi implementado da forma proposta, uma vez que o Ministério da Educação,
por intermédio do FNDE, assumiu, com recursos próprios, a aquisição e distribuição dos livros no
âmbito do Programa Nacional do Livro Didático ­ PNLD.
            Resultados Esperados: 5.000 conjuntos de livros de leitura suplementar
            beneficiando escolas com os modelos pedagógicos da aprendizagem do
            FUNDESCOLA.
            Resultado Final (maio 2008): 0 com recursos do projeto.



                                                                                              60

18.     Subcomponente 1D-Construção de Novas Escolas. Esse subcomponente foi retomado
pelo Fundescola IIIA, uma vez que, de acordo com o resultado do Levantamento da Situação
Escolar ­ LSE, persistia o problema de escolas em situação precária ou inadequada, para as quais
não seria economicamente viável sua adequação nos termos dos PMFE. Em outros casos,
mostrou-se conveniente substituir escolas alugadas por escolas novas, e, ainda em determinadas
situações, a disponibilidade de terreno e a demanda específica localizada, como a de aldeias
indígenas, ensejou a construção de unidades escolares.
            Resultados Esperados: 520 salas de aula construídas.
            Resultados Obtidos: 372 salas concluídas até junho de 2008 (71,5% do total),
            correspondendo a 68 escolas; 96 salas em execução (18,5% do total) correspondendo
            a 26 Escolas, com previsão de conclusão para dezembro de 2008, e 42 salas não
            executadas (10% do total) correspondendo a 07 escolas, por decisão do governo
            local em função do atraso no cumprimento dos prazos licitatórios.

19.     Os principais motivos do não cumprimento da meta são a inexperiência dos municípios
em licitações e a dificuldade na regularização dos terrenos. Cabe ressaltar que as construções e
aquisições de bens das escolas novas, que não terminaram no prazo de vigência do Projeto, serão
concluídas com recursos próprios do FNDE, garantindo, assim, o cumprimento integral das metas
físicas do Projeto.
20.     Componente 2-Estabelecimento de um Processo de Desenvolvimento baseado na
escola. Esse componente pretendeu promover o desenvolvimento de processos gerenciais e
pedagógicos que contribuíssem, de maneira efetiva, para que a unidade escolar cumprisse seu
papel institucional. Desde o primeiro Projeto, esse componente vem se consolidando como a mais
bem sucedida iniciativa do Programa Fundescola.

21.     Subcomponente 2ª-Apoio ao Processo de Desenvolvimento da Escola. Esse
subcomponente engloba o conjunto de atividades necessárias para a elaboração do mais
importante instrumento gerencial do Fundescola, o Plano de Desenvolvimento da Escola ­ PDE.
O Projeto Fundescola IIIA deu prosseguimento a essa estratégia, ampliando a área de abrangência
do Projeto para municípios além das microrregiões-alvo e promovendo a capacitação das equipes
técnicas das secretarias na orientação, supervisão e monitoramento das escolas que manifestassem
interesse na adoção do PDE.
            Resultados Esperados: 2.000 escolas com 100 alunos ou mais, com PDE elaborado
            e implementado.
            Resultados Obtidos: 8.714 escolas (435% acima da meta original). Além dessas,
            mais 10.683 escolas já implementaram o PDE na expansão autônoma, totalizando
            19.397 escolas.
            A superação dessa meta deve-se à expansão, a partir de 2006, da área de atendimento
            do Projeto para 2.704 municípios das regiões norte, nordeste e centro-oeste. Os
            resultados obtidos com a implantação do PDE revelam um aprimoramento na
            organização da escola e seu ambiente escolar, uma maior participação dos pais nas
            decisões escolares, além de uma ampla superação das metas previstas de difusão e
            disseminação, levando à universalização como política do Ministério da Educação.

22.     Subcomponente 2B-Financiamento dos Projetos de Melhoria da Escola. Esse
subcomponente envolve as atividades de seleção, análise, financiamento e monitoramento dos
Projetos de Melhoria da Escola ­ PME, que são planos de ação identificados no PDE que
contribuem para o cumprimento de suas metas estratégicas.
            Resultados Esperados: 2.000 escolas com o PME implementado na fase inicial.




                                                                                              61

            Resultado Atual: 7.520 escolas (incremento de 376%). Com a expansão da área de
            atendimento do Projeto para 2.704 municípios a meta do PME também foi
            amplamente superada.

23.     Subcomponente 2C-Desenvolvimento, Teste e Implementação de Modelos de Gestão
da Aprendizagem. Os modelos pedagógicos preconizados pelo Fundescola são a última etapa no
processo de desenvolvimento baseado na escola e são estratégias e metodologias complementares
para a melhoria das práticas pedagógicas na sala de aula. O significativo papel do Projeto
Fundescola IIIA na implementação desse componente foi o de consolidar alguns modelos que já
vinham sendo implementados em Projetos anteriores e desenvolver, testar e disseminar novos, no
sentido de atender a uma demanda cada vez mais crescente. Dos seis modelos pedagógicos
desenvolvidos no âmbito do Programa Fundescola, dois foram disseminados e quatro novos
foram desenvolvidos e testados pelo Projeto Fundescola IIIA:
24.
25.     1) Escola Ativa - Estratégia metodológica voltada para as escolas multisseriadas, em
especial as rurais. Combina abordagens pedagógicas e gerenciais no sentido de combater o
fracasso escolar, requer supervisores e professores capacitados nos Guias de Aprendizagem,
capazes de desenvolver estratégias em sala de aula que envolvem aprendizado cooperativo,
avaliação contínua, trabalhos de grupo. Outros elementos que caracterizam a Escola Ativa são o
governo estudantil, a participação dos pais e da comunidade, os cantinhos de leitura e de ciências,
e o equipamento da escola com os kits pedagógicos.
            Resultados Esperados: 2.500 escolas multisseriadas com a proposta da Escola Ativa
            implementada.
            Resultado Atual: 3.748 escolas (149% da meta). Além das 3.748 escolas ativas
            atendidas diretamente pelo Fundescola IIIA, existem 2.467 que implementaram a
            metodologia na expansão autônoma, totalizando 6.215 escolas.-

26.     2) GESTAR I - Programa de Gestão de Aprendizagem Escolar, para as 1ª a 4ª séries.
Consiste numa estratégia pedagógica desenvolvida em razão de demanda PDE, partindo de
avaliações diagnósticas do processo ensino-aprendizagem para desenvolver um conjunto
estruturado de atividades pedagógicas que incluem discussões prático-teóricas e sugestões de
atividades de apoio entre outras. Envolve a produção e distribuição de Guias de Aprendizagem,
provas e materiais didáticos específicos para as disciplinas de Português e Matemática e inclui a
capacitação de formadores tendo em vista a formação continuada de professores nas modalidades
presencial e semipresencial.
        Resultado Esperado: 700 escolas com PDE implementando o Gestar I.
        Resultado Atual: 742 escolas (106% da meta). Além das 742 escolas atendidas
        diretamente pelo Fundescola IIIA, existem 10.403 que implementaram o Gestar na
        expansão autônoma, com o apoio do Programa, totalizando 11.145 escolas.

27.     3) GESTAR II - Programa de Gestão de Aprendizagem Escolar em português e
matemática para as 5ª a 8ª séries. Adota, basicamente, a mesma metodologia do Gestar I,
desenvolvido no Fundescola IIIA e testado na Bahia.

28.     4) PRALER - Programa de apoio à leitura e à escrita para a fase final de alfabetização. O
Programa foi disponibilizado aos professores com formação no Gestar I e pilotado em quatro
estados (Bahia, Roraima, Goiás e Mato Grosso) durante o Fundescola IIIA, tendo obtido bons
resultados.

29.     5) Escola Ativa Indígena. Estratégia pedagógica, similar ao modelo para escola
multisseriada, desenvolvida e adaptada para o atendimento da diversidade das culturas indígenas.


                                                                                                62

O processo de testagem se desenvolveu nos estados do Amazonas, Paraíba e na cidade de
Fortaleza, incluiu duas etapas de capacitação com a realização de sete oficinas e, atualmente,
encontra-se na terceira etapa, envolvendo ações de retro-alimentação, capacitação de supervisores
e monitoramento das ações.

30.     6) Escola de Gestores. Esse programa foi desenhado no Fundescola IIIA e desenvolvido e
implementado com recursos da Secretaria de Educação Básica.
        Resultado Esperado: dois ou mais novos modelos pedagógicos desenvolvidos e
        testados pelo Fundescola.
        Resultado Atual: Quatro novos modelos, sendo dois desenvolvidos e testados
        (GESTAR II, PRALER), um desenvolvido e em processo de testagem (Escola Ativa
        Indígena) e um desenvolvido e implementado com recursos da SEB (Escola de
        Gestores)

31.     Componente 3-Fortalecimento do Sistema Educacional Esse componente engloba o
conjunto de atividades que apóiam a gestão dos produtos e modelos implementados nas escolas,
pelas secretarias de educação, e também as atividades gerenciais para a coordenação geral do
Projeto Fundescola IIIA no MEC/FNDE. Além disso, inclui o Programa Dinheiro Direto na
Escola, programa de transferência financeira diretamente às escolas públicas, que contribui para o
engajamento social no apoio à gestão escolar.

32.     Subcomponente 3A-Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Organizacional das Secretarias de
Educação. Esse subcomponente visou proporcionar às Secretarias de Educação Estaduais e
Municipais a oportunidade de desenvolver e adotar um instrumental técnico/gerencial de apoio ao
aprimoramento de suas funções de planejamento, monitoramento e avaliação, na perspectiva de
incorporar às suas políticas e procedimentos a focalização no desenvolvimento de sua rede
escolar. A adesão da secretaria de educação à metodologia do PES, caracterizada por uma
parceria, implica no compromisso de implementação, por conta própria, dos produtos do
FUNDESCOLA e contribui para garantir a sustentabilidade da política de fortalecimento da
escola e das ações já em desenvolvimento por meio da adoção de sistemas (estrutura, pessoas,
procedimentos,    estratégias  e  recursos   financeiros)   que  dêem    suporte   aos   produtos
FUNDESCOLA e da adoção, por lei, de mecanismos de transferência direta de recursos
financeiros para as escolas, em caráter permanente.
            Resultados Esperados: Planejamento Estratégico da Secretaria implementado em 30
            secretarias de educação.
            Resultado Atual: 724 Secretarias (superando a meta em 2400%) implementaram o
            PES em todas as suas etapas, sendo que 3.026 secretarias foram qualificadas e
            implementaram alguma etapa.
            Resultados Esperados: 20 ou mais Secretarias de Educação adotando pelo menos
            um dos seguintes instrumentos e/ou sistemas.
            Resultado Atual:
              · Sistema de apoio ao PDE/PME ­ 19 Secretarias.
              · Sistemas de apoio ao PAPE (LSE) ­ 355 secretarias, sendo que 96 municípios e
                15 estados receberam o manual e sistema informatizado do LSE.
              · Sistemas de Avaliação e Monitoramento das Escolas e Desempenho do Aluno ­
                sistema único desenvolvido para o GESTAR, contemplando os módulos de
                avaliação, monitoramento das escolas e desempenho do aluno, implementado na
                Bahia.
              · d)Sistema de Apoio à Implementação de Modelos de Ensino Aprendizagem ­
                sistema informatizado do GESTAR desenvolvido e testado na Bahia.



                                                                                               63

33.     Subcomponente 3B-Financiamento Direto à Escola para Apoiar suas Necessidades
Básicas. Promove maior autonomia da escola fornecendo um pequeno orçamento transferido pelo
FNDE, com base no número de matrículas, para todas as escolas com mais de 20 alunos nas
regiões Norte, Nordeste e Centro-Oeste. O objetivo deste subcomponente é estimular o
engajamento dos pais e professores na administração escolar, uma vez que esses recursos são
repassados diretamente às Unidades Executoras das escolas, administradas pelos Conselhos
Escolares e se destinam a pequenas despesas de bens e serviços, principalmente para uso didático.
             Resultados Esperados: 85% das escolas com mais de 20 alunos, nas áreas alvo do
             Projeto, recebendo recursos financeiros do Programa Dinheiro Direto na Escola -
             PDDE.
             Resultado Atual: 100% das escolas com mais de 20 alunos recebem PDDE.

34.     Subcomponente 3C-Administração, Monitoramento e Pesquisas do Projeto. Esse
subcomponente apoiou a coordenação geral do Projeto nas suas atividades gerenciais como
análises, estudos, pesquisas, além do monitoramento e da avaliação de seus produtos e o impacto
do Programa. No âmbito desse subcomponente foram produzidos relatórios gerenciais de
progresso do Projeto e desenvolvidos estudos e pesquisas avaliativas, visando dimensionar e
analisar as intervenções e os resultados obtidos com a execução do Fundescola IIIA.
        Resultados Esperados: Relatórios Trimestrais de Progresso com indicadores de
        implementação, monitoramento e impacto do Projeto. O Banco e a DIPRO/FNDE
        acordaram que os Relatórios de Progresso poderiam ser semestrais ou anuais, conforme
        descrito na Ajuda Memória da Missão realizada em 01/08/2002.
        Resultado Atual: Relatórios elaborados
        Resultados Esperados: Pelo menos 4 estudos avaliando a implementação, expansão,
        sustentabilidade e impacto dos diversos produtos e estratégias do Fundescola.
        Resultado Atual: 3 estudos realizados e uma avaliação em andamento.
35.     As avaliações do PDE, da Escola Ativa e do PES foram finalizadas e seus resultados
podem ser resumidos nas descrições abaixo:
        O PDE mereceu uma pesquisa específica realizada pela Universidade de Stanford com
        consultores nacionais associados, e dados e informações dos anos de 1999 e 2000. As
        conclusões apontam para uma pequena, mas significativa, diferença nos resultados nas
        escolas com PDE, tendo sido considerados critérios de escolha das escolas, volume de
        recursos alocados e tempo de implementação da experiência.
        A Escola Ativa foi objeto de um estudo do consultor Creso Franco. Essa pesquisa
        compara os resultados da Escola Ativa com outras escolas como grupos de controle. O
        texto foi publicado em 2005 e trabalha com dados do período de 1996 a 2002. As
        principais conclusões a que chegam os estudos apontam para um aumento na taxa de
        aprovação relacionado com o efeito do Projeto em reduzir a reprovação, embora a taxa de
        abandono, declinante no período, pareça resistente à intervenção da Escola Ativa.
        O PES foi o mais recente estudo concluído, datado de 2007 e elaborado por Maria
        Dolores Bombardelli Kappel. O relatório final contém os produtos da avaliação,
        indicação de dificuldades, avanços observados a partir da implementação do PES,
        conclusões e recomendações. As principais conclusões apontam para o prejuízo que pode
        ter sido causado pela interrupção do programa em 2004 e 2005 e, que o sucesso na
        implementação do PES requer um esforço coordenado na Secretaria e sugere, ao final,
        um conjunto de recomendações de aprimoramento do manual, dos processos de
        comunicação e a capacitação das equipes previamente e durante sua implementação.




                                                                                              64

VI ­ MONITORAMENTO, AVALIAÇÃO E SUSTENTABILIDADE

36.     O monitoramento e a avaliação foram desafios presentes desde o desenho do Fundescola
IIIA, sendo inclusive um de seus subcomponentes. Para garantir a sustentabilidade das ações já
testadas e preservar o foco na escola, o Projeto passou a apoiar mais estrategicamente as
secretarias estaduais e municipais, auxiliando-as a fortalecer seus sistemas de ensino para que
pudessem incorporar às suas políticas as metodologias e produtos desenvolvidos pelo Programa.

37.     Em 2005, o Fundescola IIIA estabeleceu que suas ações exitosas e adequadas poderiam
ser disseminadas para todos os municípios das regiões norte, nordeste e centro-oeste, de acordo
com critérios definidos e aprovados pelo Banco Mundial. Dessa forma, as ações do Fundescola
IIIA, testadas e avaliadas nos 384 municípios das ZAPs, passaram a ser disseminadas para 2.704
municípios das três regiões, por meio da disponibilização da tecnologia e assistência financeira,
ou apenas pela disponibilização da tecnologia. Essa mudança na área de abrangência do Projeto
ao mesmo tempo em que provocou dificuldades no monitoramento das ações, possibilitou a
internalização das ações desenvolvidas, na medida em que os estados e municípios se tornaram
responsáveis efetivos pela sua implementação.

38.     Dessa forma, pode-se analisar que a capacidade do Projeto em manter válidos seus
resultados ao longo do tempo se estruturou em torno de cinco considerações, que, se visualizadas
de forma interdependente, poderão ter um papel vital, quais sejam: a estratégia de focalização na
gestão da escola e no aprendizado do aluno; o desenho do Projeto baseado em produtos; o efeito
demonstração das iniciativas bem sucedidas, o apoio do BIRD nas novas iniciativas locais; e a
complementaridade do Projeto com as políticas educacionais vigentes.
39.     Visando ainda a sustentabilidade do Projeto, o Ministério da Educação absorveu como
política pública, por meio do Plano de Desenvolvimento da Educação ­ PDE, os produtos
desenhados e implementados pelo Fundescola e, assim, o papel de disseminação desses produtos
aos estados e municípios, com a finalização do Projeto, passa a ser desempenhado pelo MEC.

VII ­ PRINCIPAIS PROBLEMAS ENCONTRADOS NA IMPLEMENTAÇÃO DO
PROJETO

40.     Mudanças governamentais nas esferas federal, estaduais e municipais e de diretores
do Projeto: as mudanças de dirigentes no governo federal e as conseqüentes alterações de
diretores do Projeto, tanto quanto as mudanças de dirigentes estaduais e municipais, provocaram
descontinuidade das ações desenvolvidas pelo Projeto, num primeiro momento. Entretanto,
especificamente no segundo semestre de 2004 a implementação do Projeto foi retomada e de um
modo geral houve não apenas cumprimento, mas ampliação dos resultados esperados.
Efetivamente, o Fundescola IIIA tornou-se um instrumento do novo governo a partir de 2006, que
promoveu uma análise de seus principais produtos e os incorporou no Programa de Governo
"Plano de Desenvolvimento da Educação ­ PDE" lançado em 2007.

41.     Alteração da Política Macroeconômica e da Relação com os Organismos
Multilaterais: a política econômica adotada pelo governo federal que inclui a manutenção de
superávit primário, a taxa de câmbio valorizando o real em relação ao dólar e as altas taxas de
juros tiveram repercussão direta em dois momentos importantes da execução do Fundescola IIIA.
No início do Projeto, a decisão do governo federal de priorizar a arrecadação para pagamento do
serviço da dívida repercutiu no contingenciamento orçamentário das contas, em particular nos
investimentos, reduzindo drasticamente a capacidade de sua execução financeira. Uma vez obtido
o patamar desejado de superávit, a União dispunha de divisas suficientes para saldar suas
operações de crédito externas e encerrar seus Acordos com o Fundo Monetário Internacional.


                                                                                              65

Apesar dessa decisão, o Projeto não sofreu solução de continuidade uma vez que o governo
federal optou por concluir os Acordos de Empréstimo que estavam em andamento.

42.     Atrasos e paralisação dos processos licitatórios para a aquisição de mobiliário
escolar: os atrasos nas licitações para aquisições de equipamentos e mobiliário devem-se,
principalmente ao fato de que a maioria dos estados participantes tem estruturas burocráticas
complexas relacionadas à atividade de licitações e contratos, exigindo aprovação do processo em
diversas instâncias até a contratação, o que torna o processo extremamente lento. A estratégia
adotada pelo Fundescola de controle de qualidade do mobiliário e sua certificação pelo
INMETRO, muito contribuiu para o estabelecimento de um padrão ergonômico e de qualidade de
projeto e construção de mobiliário escolar no Brasil, entretanto a morosidade desse processo e sua
interrupção nos anos de 2003 e 2004, por questões judiciais, concorreu para o atraso das
aquisições e prejudicou o cumprimento das metas estabelecidas e o atendimento adequado e
necessário aos alunos do ensino fundamental.

43.     Rotatividade da equipe técnica do Projeto: com o advento do Decreto nº 4748/2003
que determinou a substituição da equipe base por contratados sob o regime da Lei nº 8745/93 e do
Decreto nº 5151/2004 a maioria dos profissionais responsáveis pelo gerenciamento do Projeto foi
substituída, o que impactou na capacidade de executar o Fundescola IIIA com agilidade. Essa
substituição sem planejamento não permitiu a capacitação da nova equipe, uma vez que os novos
contratados não dispunham de experiência em gerenciamento e do conhecimento e memória do
Projeto.

44.     Sistemas de Informações Gerenciais Diferenciados: muito embora tenham sido
elaborados no âmbito do Programa Fundescola e desenhados para atender suas demandas, os
sistemas informatizados para gerenciamento dos Projetos, em particular do Fundescola IIIA,
apresentavam vários níveis de consistência e dificuldades de articulação. Estes sistemas, se por
um lado permitiam a elaboração a contento para o Banco Mundial dos Relatórios Financeiros
Gerenciais (FMR), por outro dispunham de pouca comunicação entre si. Além disso, com a
transferência do Projeto para a gestão do FNDE, alguns sistemas deixaram de funcionar o que
dificultou a elaboração precisa dos Relatórios de Progresso e das análises gerenciais para os
eventuais ajustes no rumo do Projeto.

VIII - ASPECTOS FINANCEIROS

45.     O valor total do Projeto Fundescola IIIA é de EUR 182,800,000.00 (Cento e oitenta e
dois milhões e oitocentos mil euros) correspondentes a USD 282,709,340.00 (Duzentos e oitenta
e dois milhões setecentos e nove mil trezentos e quarenta dólares). Foram desembolsados até essa
data (11/06/2008) o montante de EUR 179, 066, 932.88 (cento e setenta e nove milhões, sessenta
e seis mil, novecentos e trinta e dois dólares e oitenta e oito centavos), correspondentes a USD
276, 935, 965.05 (duzentos e setenta e seis milhões novecentos e trinta e cinco mil novecentos e
sessenta e cinco dólares e cinco centavos), o que equivale a 97,96% dos recursos do Acordo de
Empréstimo. Cabe ressaltar que foi acordado com o Banco Mundial um período de graça de 04
meses e que até (30/10/08) serão desembolsados 100% dos recursos do Acordo de Empréstimo.

46.     Como contrapartida do governo brasileiro foi executado o montante de USD 235, 678,
019.38 (duzentos e trinta e cinco milhões seiscentos e setenta e oito mil dezenove dólares e trinta
e oito centavos), equivalentes a R$ 544.616.887,00 (quinhentos e quarenta e quatro milhões
seiscentos e dezesseis mil oitocentos e oitenta e sete reais). Os custos do Projeto por componente,
subcomponente e categoria de despesas são apresentados na conclusão dos desembolsos.



                                                                                                66

47.     No escopo do Programa havia a previsão de gastos com a administração do Projeto,
descrita no Subcomponente 3C. Foi executado nesse subcomponente o montante de USD 3,3
milhões por intermédio do Prodoc BRA/00/027, celebrado com o Programa das Nações Unidas
para o Desenvolvimento ­ PNUD e cerca de R$ 27,8 milhões por meio do Prodoc 914BRA1111
celebrado com a UNESCO. Nos Prodoc, previamente aprovados pelo Banco Mundial, foram
estabelecidas a concepção, a finalidade, os objetivos, os resultados e os planos das ações a serem
desenvolvidos no período de vigência do estabelecido.

48.     A execução centralizada dos recursos do Acordo de Empréstimo por meio de Prodoc é
imprescindível para a viabilização da assistência técnica prestada pela equipe do Projeto aos
estados, municípios e escolas na implementação das ações. Todos os recursos gastos nos Prodoc
tinham correspondência com algum componente ou subcomponente do Acordo.

IX ­ LIÇÕES APRENDIDAS

49.     As principais lições aprendidas na implementação do Projeto Fundescola IIIA, do ponto
de vista da direção do Projeto, podem ser sintetizadas nas proposições abaixo:
            As escolas respondem mais rapidamente às mudanças gerenciais que as secretarias de
            educação.
            As capacidades institucionais e políticas das secretarias de educação de absorverem
            os produtos do Fundescola é bastante variada.
            As secretarias municipais foram as que mais se beneficiaram dos produtos do
            Fundescola, principalmente a partir da possibilidade de universalização do
            atendimento promovida durante o Projeto Fundescola IIIA.
            As capacidades técnicas e operacionais, na maioria das secretarias de educação, são
            limitadas para conduzir um processo de fortalecimento da escola, nos moldes do
            Fundescola.
            A estratégia de iniciar e manter a atuação do Programa diretamente às escolas até sua
            conclusão revelou-se positiva.
            A estratégia de facultar a adesão das secretarias na incorporação dos produtos do
            Fundescola às suas políticas mostrou-se adequada.
            desenvolvimento de uma cultura de qualidade dos insumos escolares, especialmente
            mobiliário e equipamento, requer uma atuação mais ampla na cadeia produtiva.
            Programa Fundescola, por seus aspectos inovadores, complexos e de grande
            abrangência territorial, necessitava de um consistente e articulado sistema de
            monitoramento e avaliação.
            desenvolvimento do Programa através de uma série de Projetos que se superpunham
            em suas fases iniciais e finais evitava solução de continuidade e não segmentava o
            Programa em função de mandatos governamentais.
            conceito de Fundo, adotado no Programa Fundescola, se consolidou como opção
            adequada à agilidade na aplicação dos recursos financeiros.

X ­ CONCLUSÕES

50.     O Projeto Fundescola IIIA antecipou o encerramento do ciclo de Projetos do Programa
Fundescola financiados pelo Banco Mundial e cumpriu um papel primordial e único em todo este
processo. Podem-se destacar três importantes características do Fundescola IIIA:
        Superou, em muito, as metas previstas dos principais produtos do Fundescola, ainda sob
        sua responsabilidade de implementação. Essa superação de metas, agregada às obtidas
        nos Projetos anteriores, comprovou o sucesso das iniciativas junto aos beneficiários.



                                                                                                67

        Promoveu a internalização no Ministério da Educação dos produtos desenvolvidos,
        avaliados e testados em campo.
        Estendeu largamente o atendimento aos municípios para além das microrregiões já
        contempladas desde o início do Programa.
        Contribuiu para a redução das desigualdades regionais no âmbito do ensino fundamental
        e de melhoria do rendimento dos alunos nas séries iniciais.
        Serviu como referencial para o desenho da nova política do MEC.

XI ­ COMENTÁRIOS AO RCI DO BANCO

51.     A análise da versão do RCI elaborada pelo Banco, embora apresente uma abrangente
visão do Projeto Fundescola IIIA, como resultado do entendimento conjunto obtido na reunião
para revisão do documento, merece comentários adicionais sobre três importantes aspectos que
estiveram presentes em nossos debates, mas não nos parece suficientemente traduzidos no
conteúdo dos documentos e que gostaríamos de enfatizar em nosso Relatório:
           O Programa foi um importante instrumento na política adotada em meados da década
           de 1990, para consolidar o processo conduzido nacionalmente pelo MEC de
           descentralização para a escola no âmbito do Ensino Fundamental e de redução das
           desigualdades regionais pelo fortalecimento da gestão escolar nas regiões mais
           pobres do país. O Fundescola veio, portanto, reforçar o PDDE (Programa Dinheiro
           Direto na Escola) e a atuar no contexto do FUNDEF (Fundo de Desenvolvimento do
           Ensino Fundamental e Valorização do Magistério) colaborando decisivamente na
           tendência de municipalização do Ensino Fundamental no Brasil. A conclusão do
           Programa volta a inseri-lo em um novo contexto das políticas vigentes para a
           Educação Básica, na medida em que seus principais produtos foram incorporados ao
           Plano de Desenvolvimento da Educação. Dessa forma, a importância da trajetória do
           Fundescola se traduz pelo seu significativo papel nas Reformas Educacionais em
           curso no Brasil ao longo de sua existência de praticamente 10 anos.
           A tentativa de análise do alcance dos objetivos do Programa Fundescola, poderia
           utilizar outros indicadores e dados mais atualizados, contemplando as intervenções
           bem sucedidas do Projeto Fundescola IIIA. A análise poderia considerar novas
           tendências, tomando como exemplo: a) a evolução do IDEB, apresentada no RCI do
           Mutuário (pag. 50); b) a taxa de aprovação da região Centro-Oeste, em 2007 segundo
           o INEP/MEC era de 89% para as séries iniciais do Ensino Fundamental, já superando
           a meta de 85% do Programa para 2010. Nesse sentido, entendemos que seria mais
           adequado tratar o tema avaliação ou análise dos objetivos do Programa Fundescola
           com o IEG do Banco Mundial, em outra oportunidade.
           Queremos ressaltar o entendimento, fruto de nossa reunião de revisão do RCI, que
           estamos envidando esforços tendo em vista a continuidade, pelo Mutuário, da
           avaliação do Programa Fundescola, com o aprimoramento do relatório final do
           Programa, até então desenvolvido por equipe de consultores. Nosso objetivo é que o
           documento represente, por um lado, uma efetiva visão global, atual e abrangente do
           Programa Fundescola e, por outro, que represente um valioso instrumento gerencial
           capaz de promover, de forma contextualizada, uma abordagem de seus princípios e
           resultados, fomentando os ajustes e correções eventualmente necessários em seus
           instrumentos, tecnologias e produtos, contribuindo, ainda mais, para sua
           institucionalização no âmbito das políticas educacionais brasileiras.

52.     Finalmente, queremos agradecer, em nome de toda a equipe do MEC que trabalhou no
Fundescola IIIA, e que agregou seu empenho para que chegássemos a bom termo na
implementação do Projeto, a rara oportunidade que tivemos de participar dos procedimentos de


                                                                                          68

sua conclusão, com essa mais que qualificada equipe do Banco Mundial, mas que principalmente
se destaca pela sensibilidade em reconhecer o que representa o encerramento bem sucedido do
Fundescola IIIA.
