As requested by the Government,\n            the amendment to the Loan Agreement will include a new\n            subcomponent to support the rehabilitation and construction\n            of schools. Consequently, the following changes will apply:\n            a) inclusion of category of works in Schedule 1 of the Loan\n            Agreement; 2) inclusion of National Competitive Bidding-NCB-\n            procurement method to contract works; and, 3) reallocation\n            of loan proceeds among categories to support this new\n            financing. These changes are reflected in Schedule I to the\n            Amendment, attached herewith. The core of the proposed\n            amendment is to adjust the Project in order to ensure it\n            will achieve its objectives. The proposed Loan amendment\n            complies with the Articles of Agreement, and it is thus\n            recommended for approval."}, "docdt": "2005-09-09T00:00:00Z"}
