outcome\n            were negligible to low, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the FUNDESCOLA\n            IIIA had a clear strategy for product development, which\n            ranged from design to evaluation and dissemination of\n            products. The importance of testing and evaluating products\n            proved to be essential in the scaling up of the project. In\n            addition, the dissemination of results within Brazil and\n            beyond served to galvanize support around a school-based\n            strategy to improve quality, efficiency and learning\n            outcomes. Indeed, the federal government acknowledged the\n            proven track record of the FUNDESCOLA products was among the\n            factors that motivated them to scale up the implementation\n            of some of the products within the umbrella of the national\n            School Development Plan (PDE). The FUNDESCOLA approach to\n            strategic planning uses a bottom-up framework rather than a\n            top-down approach. This approach is central to the\n            successful implementation of the project given that behavior\n            change is more likely to take place when there is genuine\n            self-reflection on issues and local leadership to plan a way\n            forward to make changes. The FUNDESCOLA IIIA places the\n            responsibility on individual schools to identify their needs\n            and draft their own solutions, while providing products,\n            tool and reference materials to assist individual schools or\n            to technical staff providing support. The approach has now\n            taken root in Brazil and has served to galvanize federal\n            government support around it to ensure future programs are\n            guided by a bottom-up principle."}, "docdt": "2008-12-03T00:00:00Z"}
