medium-scale industries by importing modern\n            technology and (b) further institutional strengthening of\n            the China Investment Bank (CIB). The latter objective is\n            essential to CIB so that it can effectively perform as a\n            model development finance institution and a catalyst in the\n            ongoing reform of the investment design and selection system\n            in China. The project further intends to enhance the\n            capability of CIB to mobilize foreign currency resources\n            from international capital markets to provide financing for\n            the industrial sector. This is due to the fact that about\n            175 state and collective enterprises largely in the light\n            industry sector will receive subloans for modernization and expansion."}, "docdt": "1987-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
