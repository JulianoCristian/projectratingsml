Lessons learned from the project: The project\n            faced a number of implementation challenges as a result of\n            the low institutional base at the start of the project and\n            the complexity of project design. In countries such as\n            Swaziland loans should be denominated in South African Rands\n            (legal tender in Swaziland) rather than USD. During the\n            supervision of projects, project progress needs to be\n            assessed against a number of variables  rather than using\n            the rate of Loan disbursement as the sole indicator.\n            Finally, the complex design of the project reflected the\n            complex urban development challenges facing the Swazis in\n            the early 90s."}, "docdt": "2005-10-04T00:00:00Z"}
