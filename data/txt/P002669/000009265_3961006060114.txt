MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMNATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE KINGDOM OF SWAZIAN
FOR AN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Kingdom of Swaziland for the equivalent of US$29 million to help finance an urban development
project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years
including 5 years grace and would help fimance rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure (water,
sewage, solid waste), on site infrastructure for housing sites and institutional strengthening of sector
agencies.
2.    Background. Swaziland, a small landlocked country bordered mainly by South Africa, has a
population of about 0.9 million and a per capita GNP of US$1090(1992). Its strong economic links with
South Africa are due not only to geographical proximity but also to its membership in the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) and the Common Monetary Area (CMA). South Africa accounts for
80% of merchandise imports and 30% of merchandise exports. SACU receipts contribute about half the
fiscal revenues. In addition, workers' remittances, mostly from Swazis employed in South African mines,
account for over 15% of GNP.
3.    With the political and social changes underway in the region, providing employment opportunities
for, and improving living standards of, a rapidly growing population are major challenges for Swaziland.
An urban base with an efficient and well maintained infrastructure will be essential for future growth.
The population in the Mbabane/MatsaphafMaini corridor (roughly 50% of the urban population) is
estimated to be increasing at between 5% and 6% per annum. More than 60% of the population in the
corridor lives in informal communities in substandard structures; less than 50% of this population has
access to safe water; less than 20% is served by the sewerage network. Uncontrolled and rapid
development on steep land, together with a lack of bic urban services, is leading to severe
environmental problems.
4.    Effective management of the urbanization process has been constrained by the absence of clear
sector policies, a pervasive lack of institutional capacity, jurisdictiona4 overlaps among a nultiplicity of
responsible agencies, and inconsistencies and conflicts among relevant national legislation and policies.
The most common form of land tenure, Swazi Nation Land (SNL), has severely curtailed development
of formal housing and extension of urban services.  Sector agencies lack financial resources and
adequately trained personnel. For example, unaccounted-for-water in Mbabane and Manzini is estimated
at about 45% of that produced by the Swaziland Water and Sewerage Board (SWSB) due to (i) illegal
connections; and (ii) systems losses arising from lack of access to capital to replace and upgrade assets
and poor operations and maintenance. The ;ity councils of Mbabane and Manzini require institutional
strengthening, and the financial performance of several sector agencies is weak. Sector agencies,
including the Swaziland National Housing Board (SNHB), have no experience with low income housing;
formal housing provided is only affordable to households in the upper 30% of the urban income
distribution.
5.    The Govermnent's long-term urban development strategy that has evolved over the course of
project preparation, emphasizes: (a) integrated development of urban housing and infrastructure stressing
efficiency, cost recovery and affordability; (b) employment generation; (c) access to basic infrastructure
and social services for disadvantaged groups; and (d) addressing urban enviromneal problems. Policy
and institutional developmnt were emphasized during project preparation. The King has approved use



-2 -
of SNL for urban development; a National Housing Policy and a Statement of Sectoral policy have been
adopted by Government.(GOS); SWSE has been restructured as a Water Services Corporation (SWSC)
with the assistance of a twinning arrangement that is also helping to streitgthen finance and operations
management; and a series of technical assistance programs have helped to build SNHB's institutional
capacit3. Recommendations of several diagnostic studies carried out during project preparation have
shaped these assistance programs and provided the basis for further institutional strengthening during
project implementation.
6.    Project Objectives. 'IThe project is the first phase of a long term urban development program
aimed at increasing urban management efficiency and improving living conditions of low income urban
households by providing basic urban services and housing. The project, to be implemented FY94/95 -
FY97/98, would: (a) provide a basis for sustainable urban sector development through its emphasis on
institutional development, pilot land reform, participatory development, and housing solutions for low and
moderate income groups; and (b) address critical infrastructure needs (water, sanitation, waste disposal
and roads).
7.    Project Description. The project would include: (a) policy and institutional reform (US$4.2
million or 10% of project base cost), including: (i) policy development (urban and peri-urban land
policies, establishment of an urban government policy framework, assessment of the feasibility of
establishing a secondary mortgage market and development of a housing policy implementation plan, and
review of legislation/regulations relating to physical planning and development control, building
regulations, town planning and land administration; and (ii) capacity building and institutional support
for sector institutions including funding for long term twinning arrangements, staff training, focused short-
term specialist assistance and use of local expertise; (b) rehabilitation and expansion of city roads (about
11 kIn), development of new solid waste sites, provision of solid waste equipment and relocation of 15
km of power lines (US$9.3 million or 21% of project base cost); (c) rehabilitation and expansion of
water and sewerage services including refurbishing existing and constructing new sewage treatment and
water supply facilities and a water loss reduction program (US$19.1 million or 43% of project base cost);
(d) residential housing sites including on-site infrastructure for 5000 upgraded and in-fill housing sites
(US$7.6 million or 17% of project base cost); and (e) implementation assistance (US$2.5 million or 6%
of project base cost). Project costs also include US$1.5 million to refinance two Bank PPFs. A summary
of the project costs and financing plan is provided in Schedule A. Procurement arrangements and the
disbursement schedule are summarized in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing steps and the status
of Bank group operations in Swaziland are provided in Schedules C, and D respectively. Staff appraisal
report No. 12753-SW dated July 27, 1994, and Maps IBRD Nos. 25602 and 25604 are attached.
8.    Project  plementation. Project preparation has been managed by a Project Steering Committee
(PSC), chaired by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MHUD), with members from all
involved agencies and supported by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). These arrangements will continue
during implementation. Other implementing agencies, under MHUD's jurisdiction, include: SWSC (water
and sewerage reticulation), SNHB (residential sites including on-site infrastructure), Mbabane and Manzini
City Councils (primary roads and city services). Supporting insttutions include the Surveyor General's
office (cadastral surveys), the Electricity Board (power line relocation), the Deeds Registry (registration
of deeds) and the Swaziland Building Society (SBS) (mortgage and loan financing). Beneficiary
communities have established project steering committees to work with implementing agencies :hrough
design and implementation. A Technical Support Unit (TSU) and supervisory engineers will assist the
PCU and implementing agencies during implementation. Detailed design and preparation of bidding
documents are substantially completed with the exception of contracts for on-site infrastructure arnd for
facilities where land acquisition is still pending. A project launch workshop will be held within two
monfts of loan effectiveness. Annual and mid term reviews will include participants from implementing



- 3-
agencies, supporting institutions, certral government agencies and conmmunity representatives.
9.    Sustanabilit. Capacity building is a primary project objective and has been a major focus of
project preparation; several assistance programs for urban sector institutions are already in place. The
project has been designed to take into account the financial and operational capacity of implementing
agencies and affordable options for project beneficiaries. Cost recovery will be ensured through tariff
adjustments for SWSC, changes in the Rating Act to facilitate adjustment and collection of rates by the
City Councils, and by full cost recovery pricing of serviced plots.
10.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. Bank experience with a previous water project in
Swaziland, approved in 1974, has highlighted the importance of cost recovery and institutional autonomy.
Bank experience with urban projects shows that: (i) borrower support and commitment is critical to the
project's success (especially for complex projects) and to achievement of institutional development
objectives; (ii) cost recovery is key to project sustainability; and (iii) beneficiary involvement is essential
for successful upgrading of informal settlements. These lessons are reflected in both the preparation
process and the design of the project.
11.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. Bank support to Swaziland has been relatively limited; the
last Bank loan was in 1985. A 1993 Public Expenditure Review that assessed inter alia public sector
support for private sector development, confirmed that poor physical infrastructure and a shortage of
skilled manpower, particularly in the public sector, are increasingly constraining private sector growth.
These issues are of particular concern in urban areas. GOS has specifically requested Bank support for
preparation and implementation of the proposed project and has taken steps to deal with the politically
sensitive land issue. During project preparation "'e Bank, based on its substantial experience with similar
issues in other countries, has been able to assist the Govemment in identifying sector issues and
constraints and initiating actions, such as institutional strengthening and policy development, to address
areas of concern. By supporting the implementation effort, the Bank will be in a position to further assist
the Government in carrying out its long-term strategy for development of urban housing and infrastructure
which emphasizes sustainability, cost recovery and affordability.
12.   Link to Country Assstance Strategy. The project will contribute to several key policy
objectives. The emphasis on cost recovery versus subsidized pricing of facilities and services and on
increasing the internal efficiency of sector agencies will reduce budgetary subventions to the sector and
improve fiscal management. Rehabilitation and expansion of water, sanitation and urban services will
improve the investme climate and living conditions of the urban poor. Upgraded solid waste and sewage
treatment facilities, planned development in sensitive areas, and technical assistance for the Swaziland
Environmental Authority (SEA) will improve urban environmental management. The project will also
(a) help diversify the products of the financial sector by facilitating increased mortgage lending and
piloting a non-conventional loan scheme for low income households and (b) pilot land reform, by
introducing a leasehold agreement for SNL.
13.   Actions Agreed.      Conditions of Loan effectiveness i-clude: (a) Enactment of a new Rating
Act; (b) GOS approval of the Leasehold agreement for SNL land; (c) acquisition of required land for
sewage treatment facilities in Mbabane and Manzini; (d) execution of subsidiary loan agreements between
GOS, SWSC, SNHB and Mbabane and Manzini City Councils; (e) appointment of key staff of the PCU
and the TSU with experience, qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; and (f)
completion of a project implementation manual.
14.   Conditions of loan disbursement for specific project components include:  (a) for on-site.
infrastructure for housing sites-submission of specific resettlement and compensation plans, satisfactory



-4-
to the Bank, for each housing site; and (b) for solid waste disposal civil works for Manzini atd solid
waste equipment contracts-acquisition of land required for the Manzini solid waste disposal site.
15. During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following: (a) GOS will ensure that the
project is carried out in accordance with its resettement and compensation policy; prior to the stat of
construction, resettlement and compensation plans satisfactory to the Bank will be prepared for each
upgrading site where SNHB will mobilize after the completion of disbursement of Bank funds; (b) GOS
and inplementing agencies widl make adequate budgetauy provisions for their share of project costs; (c)
GOS will maiain organizational strucures, funcions and stAing of the PCU and TSU in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank throughout project implementation; (d) a project launch workshop will be held
within two months of loan eff*ctiveness as well as a mid-term review by Decenber 30, 1996, and annual
reviews during project implementation: (e) institutional action plans and performance targets satisory
to the Bank will be reflected in the subsidiary loan agreement between GOS and each implementing
agency; (f) for FY95/96 and PY96/97, GOS will provide a mix of real tariff increases and subventions
to allow SWSC to cover all operating cost and interest expense and to achieve this target from FY97/98
onwards without subventions or real tariff increases (with the exception of subventions for the direct
recurrent expenses of water supply schemes in Siteki and Nhlangano); (g) For FY95/96 and FY96/97,
SWSC would consult with GOS and the Bank prior to incurring ary new long term debt; from FY97198
onwards, SWSC would maintain a mnimm  debt service coverage of 1.5; and (h) GOS and the City
Councils will agree on an Urban Government Policy framework satisfactory to the Bank by February 1st
1995. In addition (i) the Councils would consult with the Govermment and the Bank prior to incuring
any new long term debt obligation, and (ii) from PY95/96 onwards GOS would ensure adequate
adjustnents to solid waste user charges to enable the Councils to cover operating costs and interest
expense.
16.   Envhonmeutal Aspects. The project, an EA category B. is designed to alleviate enironental
degradation in urban and pei-urban areas by improving and expanding access to sanitation and upgrading
informal settlements. Environmental planning and assessment of environmental impacts have been an
integral part of project design. An environental impact assessmeit has been completed for all project
components and baseline environmental data established. No significant negative environmental impact
is anticipated. Environmental mitigation plans specify management and control, site supervision
requirements and rehabilitation standards. Mitigation actions required during construction have been
incorporated into contract documents. The project is designed to minimize displacement of people;
planning for site specific infstructure has aimed to minimize relocation and compensation and
resettlement costs by accommodating existing structures and land usage and adjisting service standards
to ensure plot costs are affordable to existing households.
17.   Progm  Objective Categories. The project will improve living conditions of the urban
population close to the poverty line, contribute to private sector growth by providing employment
opportnties and build institutional capacity of sector agencies.
18.   Benecatry Involvement. Key project beneficiaries, i.e. current residents of infomial settlements
to be upgraded under the project, have been closely involved in project design. Socioeconomic
information about the beneficiaries, obtained through a Land and Housing Market Study was used to
structure the participation proces- to ensure equitable representation of all groups. A series of meetings,
convened by community leaders were held prior to and during preliminary engineering design to engage
residents in discussions of service options and costs and placement of roads, services, community
facilities. In depth consultations with beneficiaries were also irtiated through the use of focus groups.
The participating communities subsequently appointed Project b.eering Committees who are working with
the implementing agencies and design engineers in the detailed derign phase. This arrangement wil



-5
continue through project implementation.
19.   Project Benefits. The project will be the first initiative in S%Aziland to provide affordable
housing and access to urban services for low income households. About five thousand low ar.l moderate
income households would become property owners with secure tenure. Health, hygiene and general living
conditions will be improved through provision of potable piped water supply, waste-water disposal, solid
waste disposal and improved road access to the target communities, in particular, and to the urban
population as whole. The policy and legislative reform project component will provide the basis for a
well functioning urban sector in the medium term. Strengtiened sector agencies will increase the
efficiency of urban management. Infrastructure invesunents will help to improve Swaziland's investment
climate and to alleviate envir l problems. Employment opportunities would be created through
the construction of roads, buildings and other infrastructure, most of which is expeted to be undertaken
by local contractors and/or subcontractors.
20.   Project Risks. A maigr prjec risk, is that lengthy decision making processes could delay
project implementation. This risk has been minimized by ensuring that most actions essential to project
success and sustainability, in particular those that require approval by Cabinet and/or Parliment, are
taken prior to loan effectiveness. Loan covenants require timely initiation of remaining actions to allow
sufficient lead time for the approval process. A second risk is that capacity building objectives may not
be achieved. To minimize this risk, the investment component of the project has been reduced to allow
for modest/phased improvements in institutional capacity, institution building programs have been initiated
during project preparation, and institutional action plans have been prepared for key implementing
agencies. A thW risk is that upgrading sites may not be affordable or communities may be unwilling to
participate in the project. This risk has been minimized by taking into account the income of target
groups in all aspects of project design and ensuring close involvement and participation of project
beneficiaries throughout project preparation and implementation. Finallv, there is the risk of slow
implementation of project components. This risk has been minimized through detailed planning and
preparation for implementation by the executing agencies and the design consultants (on-going) and up
front action on procurement. Technical support to the project coordination unit and annual and a mid- ern
project review will firthe mmi  tis risk.
21.   Rn . I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
