The project\n            includes four components: (a) the continued rehabilitation\n            of the SGMC (State Gold Mining Corporation) mines to\n            increase their output, improve efficiency and reduce safety\n            hazards; (b) the provision of technical assistance to\n            promote the sector which could be used to attract private\n            capital and mineral exploration to investigate gold\n            prospects; and (c) the provision of technical assistance to\n            strengthen the major governmental institutions dealing with\n            the mining sector. It also entails: (d) the improved\n            operations of small scale miners through technical\n            assistance, and help with regularization of their operations."}, "docdt": "1988-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
