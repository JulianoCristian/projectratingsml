Rehabilitation Project for Ghana were as follows: outcomes\n            were highly satisfactory, project sustainability was likely,\n            Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            implementation experience demonstrated that an appropriate\n            policy, legal and institutional framework is essential for\n            sustainable development of the mining sector. The\n            privatization of state-owned mines could not have taken\n            place without these elements. Open lines of communication,\n            positive attitudes and constructive working methods\n            developed by Bank task team and the staff of key\n            implementing agencies of the Borrower, contributed\n            significantly to successful project implementation leading\n            to almost total disbursement of the International\n            Development Association (IDA) Credit. Implementation\n            experience revealed the need for skills enhancement within\n            sectoral agencies as well in the private sector. An urgent\n            need exists for technical, economic, legal and environmental\n            skills pertaining to mining, to be developed in the private\n            sector. The flexibility in project design was a major factor\n            which allowed the achievement of all stated project\n            objectives. It also enabled the implementation team to make\n            necessary improvements in the project design to meet\n            operational realities on the ground. As Bank and Government\n            policy related to privatization and private sector\n            development underwent significant changes during the life of\n            the project, the project design also needed complementary modifications."}, "docdt": "1997-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
