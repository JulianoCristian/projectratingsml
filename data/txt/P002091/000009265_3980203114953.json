The main objectives of the project were: (a)\n            strengthening State and local government institutional and\n            financial capacity to plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate\n            policies and programs for health, nutrition, and family\n            planning; and (b) improving the quality, effectiveness, and\n            utilization of State and local services for health and\n            family planning. Bank's performance was not\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (a) the need to involve\n            communities from the beginning which will create a sense of\n            ownership;( b) the need to re-examine the requirements of\n            community matching grants in cash; (c) the importance of\n            building into the project design,a component or mechanism\n            for maintenance and (d) the importance of good planning for\n            civil works taking into account seasonality."}, "docdt": "1997-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
