The project\n            achieved its core objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was substantial, sustainability is uncertain,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the project clearly demonstrates the need\n            for a carefully designed, comprehensive institutional\n            development plan, accompanied by a pragmatic implementation\n            strategy. In its absence, capacity building could end up as\n            a non-sustainable ad hoc exercise. Second, while TA is an\n            essential ingredient for getting institutional strengthening\n            measures underway, the socio-political climate and policy\n            environment should be carefully weighed and factored in at\n            the time of designing a project. Third, the comprehensive\n            and effective reform of the public sector, including the\n            civil service, is essential for supporting development\n            interventions such as ASMP. Fourth, as budget\n            rationalization is an on-going process, measures to improve\n            the budgetary process and overall quality of the budget have\n            to constantly be instituted. Fifth, for projects containing\n            a substantial training component, there should be a clear\n            assignment of responsibilities for the implementation of the\n            training program, with special attention given to the\n            design. Finally, project implementation arrangements should\n            be reviewed periodically."}, "docdt": "1994-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
