         Project for Cambodia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            introduced direct disbursements from the Project Management\n            Unit (PMU) to provincial accounts, speeding up the process,\n            and also revised financial arrangements to permit second\n            generation accounts. Innovative solutions such as this are\n            often needed, especially in sector-wide operations, to\n            remove bureaucratic bottlenecks. The challenge then is how\n            to convince government to adopt these more efficient methods\n            into existing systems. While Health Sector Support Project\n            (HSSP) preparation focused on health sector issues and\n            addressed them well, problems and delays in implementation\n            often arose because of systemic issues in the partner\n            government that were not fully appreciated or taken into\n            account during the design. It is important that a technical\n            sectoral analysis is matched with a political economy\n            analysis of government systems and structures in order to\n            help clarify risks and select appropriate implementation\n            arrangements and strategies."}, "docdt": "2012-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
