Profile talks about\n            improving health services for the poor in Cambodia. Some of\n            the challenges faced by Cambodia included significant health\n            inequities among the socio-economic groups creating an\n            impact largely on maternal and child health outcomes. It was\n            particularly difficult for the remote and rural populations\n            to access health services. The Health Sector Support Project\n            improved both the accessibility and the quality of health\n            services in Cambodia. In 2008, an estimated 2.3 million poor\n            people were covered by the Health Equity Fund (HEF) schemes.\n            The project\u2019s support for national disease control programs\n            contributed to reduce dengue fever outbreaks, TB and Malaria\n            infection, and mortality."}, "docdt": "2010-09-24T08:24:02Z"}
