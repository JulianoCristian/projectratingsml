                         The objective of this project is to contribute to the improvement of the health status of the population by: (a) increasing the accessibility and the quality of
                         health services; and (b) assisting the Kingdom of Cambodia to implement its Health Sector Strategic Plan and strengthen the sector's capacity to manage
                         resources efficiently.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project restructuring was approved on 28, December 2010, and closing date was extended to December 31, 2011 to (i) enable construction completion of 8 clinics (3 health
                         centers and 5 health post) (ii) construction of Preah Vihear hospital; (ii) purchase of furniture and medical equipment; and (iii) construction of 12 HCs originally planned under the
                         Project.

                         An independent consultant assessment report commissioned by MOH in 2010 records these positive project outcomes. The project was instrumental in improving access through
                         expansion of health facilities, it funded the construction of over 92 new/renovated health centers, 9 referral hospitals, 61 health centers and 12 health posts (built under all donors

                         involved in HSSP I program including IDA). The Project financed expanded human resource capacity building which coincided with improved utilization of public facilities and with
                         client satisfaction rated at over 90%. Project implementation coincided with improvements in a number of health outcomes include reduction of (i) infant and child mortality rates; (ii)
                         HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, (iii) fertility rate, (iii) high TB detection and cure rate; and (iv) reduction in incidence of communicable diseases and case fatality rates. Cambodia is close
                         to achieving its CMDG targets for HIV/AIDs, TB and malaria. However, use of modern contraceptives remain low and reduction of child malnutrition and maternal morality rates have
                         made little progress. The changes cannot all be attributed to the project, however, but it may have contributed. The number of Operational Districts for Health Equity Funds (HEFs)
                         increased from 16 to 50 (by 2008) with over 1.1 million beneficiaries. Most of the HEFs started under HSSP I have transitioned to HSSP II, with 2.83 million covered by the scheme.
