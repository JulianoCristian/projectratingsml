PROPOSED PROJECT RESTRUCTURING  
OF  
THE FIRST HEALTH SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT (HSSP1) 
 
(CREDIT 
–
3728) 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1. 
The proposed changes concern: (i) a 12 month extension of the Credit closing 
date from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011; and (ii) reallocation of the Credit 
proceeds.  The proposed changes will enable the project to complete ongoing civil works 
in Preah Vihear Province (including the referral hospital, three health centers, and five 
health posts); construct 12 health centers; complete procurement of medical equipment 
and furniture for these facilities; and complete the design of the effluent treatment system 
for the National Drugs Quality Control Laboratory (NDQLC).  The Borrower has 
prepared an acceptable action plan to complete the Project activities under the extension 
period. 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
2. 
The objective of this project is to contribute to the improvement of the health 
status of the population by: (a) increasing the accessibility and the quality of health 
services; and (b) assisting the Kingdom of Cambodia to implement its Health Sector 
Strategic Plan and strengthen the sector's capacity to manage resources efficiently. The 
Project is co-financed with a DfID Trust Fund of US$1.84 million, and two IDA Grants:  
H0150 and H0160 of US$7.80 million and US$2.00 million, respectively.  All project 
activities under these co-financing grants have been completed and were closed on 
December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2009, respectively. IDA Credit 3728 has 
disbursed SDR10.90 million of an approved SDR 13.10 million, with an undisbursed 
balance of SDR 2.20 million.  There are currently no outstanding audit reports.  
3. 
Progress towards achieving the Project development objective is rated as 
moderately satisfactory in the ISR of April 2010.  Most indicators exceed the national 
targets and include: (i) reducing total fertility; (ii) reducing infant and under 5 mortality 
rates; (iii) lowering dengue outbreaks and reducing the number of dengue case fatality 
rates through preventive measures; (iv) lowering the incidence of malaria and case 
fatality rates; (v) increasing TB detection and cure rate; and (vi) reducing HIV/AIDS 
prevalence among the population aged 15-49 years. Progress has been slow, however, on 
another key indicator i.e., reducing maternal mortality and child malnutrition, and these 
remain off track for meeting the MDGs. The delayed civil works have impacted on 
project benefits; and project implementation is rated as moderately satisfactory because 
of this.

4. 
In anticipation of Project closing, the Ministry of Health (MOH) commissioned an 
independent evaluation of HSSP1, which concluded that the Project was likely to achieve 
its overall development objectives.
 
5. 
The remaining activities to be carried out under the Project consist of civil works 
program, equipment, furniture, and completion of the design of the effluent treatment 
system for the NDQCL. Thus far, four referral hospitals, a training building for the 
National Malaria Center, an Information Center for the National AIDS Authority and 18 
new health center construction and 6 health center renovations have been completed. 
Procurement of equipment for these hospitals is underway, and is likely to be delivered 
by March 2011.  The overall civil works program for the Project was negatively affected 
by factors outside the control of the MOH, including a 40 percent increase in the cost of 
building materials in 2008, and bid failures for several large contracts.  The remaining 
civil works and reasons for delays are briefly summarized below: 
·
Construction of Tbeng Meanchey referral hospital, three Health Centers and five 
Health Posts in Preah Vihear Province
.
This contract initially was awarded in 
November 2007, but the contractor stopped working in 2008 when the prices of 
building materials increased, and abandoned the site in January 2009. Following 
unsuccessful efforts to convince the contractor to resume work, the MOH 
terminated the contract in February 2010.  MOH submitted revised design and 
cost estimates for World Bank review in October 2009. Following extensive 
review and revision of designs and cost estimates, the package was submitted to 
the Independent Procurement Agent (IPA), and the contract was awarded (for 
US$2.3 million) in September 2010. The hospital, three health centers and five 
health posts are under construction with the latter expected to be completed by 
June 2011, and the former expected to be completed in March 2012. MOH and 
HSSP2 cofinancing partners have agreed that HSSP2 will finance any remaining 
costs for completion of the hospital after closure of HSSP1.  
·
Construction of health centers
.
Packages for construction of an addition 27 
Health Center went through two unsuccessful rounds of bidding. In December 
2008, there were either no bid submissions or those submitted were 20 percent 
higher than the estimated costs. Another round of re-bidding was also carried out 
by the then IPA in February 2009, but subsequently cancelled when the bid prices 
were significantly higher than estimates.  A review by MOH and IPA of the 
causes for the bid failure concluded that the packages should be revised to allow 
more locally based firms to bid. The government has requested that HSSP1 
finance 12 of these health centers, at an estimated cost of US$700,000.  The 
packages were submitted to the IPA in December 2010, with an estimated 
contract completion time of 6 months. The Bank has indicated that these health 
centers will be financed by HSSP1 only contracts if the contracts are signed by 
April 30, 2011.  
·
Procurement of medical equipment and furniture. 
The medical equipment bid 
evaluations are under review by the Bank and expected to be delivered to the 
respective hospitals by March, 2011. Technical specifications for the furniture are 
Page  6

being prepared and will be procured by MOH. The estimated cost of the medical 
equipment is US$ 1,043,920 and US$ 40,000 for furniture. 
·
Finalization of design for effluent treatment system for
 
NDQCL.
 This involves a 
short term consultancy of US$ 15,000 for completion of design of the effluent 
treatment system making the NDQCL an internationally certified Lab. As agreed 
by all concerned development partners, the construction of the Lab will be 
financed under HSSP2. 
·
Civil works supervision. 
The supervision and contract management at MOH has 
been enhanced with the recruitment of an experienced engineer, site supervisors 
under the direct management of the Ministry and an additional engineer is being 
hired. This has improved the technical and administrative oversight and 
accountability mechanism within MOH, whereas previously, it relied solely on a 
single out-sourced firm. The estimated cost of civil works supervision during the 
one-year extension is US$160,000. 
6. 
To ensure achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDOs), MOH has 
proposed to extend HSSP1 by one year in order to complete the remaining activities as 
described above. Preah Vihear is one of the most remote provinces, which has been 
without a hospital for over two years.  Similarly, the proposed health centers are located 
in the most remote and underserved areas of the country. The construction of these will 
not only improve referrals in the province but improve access to basic health care 
services to an estimated population of 120,000 particularly the poor, women and children, 
thereby contributing to improvements in quality and access to maternal and child health 
services, which are important PDOs. The Borrower has prepared an acceptable action 
plan to complete the Project activities during the extension period. 
PROPOSED CHANGES
 
7. 
Reallocation: The proposed reallocation of Credit proceeds involves reallocation 
from goods (SDR 185,000), training (SDR 270,000) and incremental operating costs 
(SDR 23,000) to civil works and consultant services. The proposed reallocation is 
necessary to complete the planned and ongoing civil works and to further the overall 
project development objectives achievement for equitable access and quality of primary 
health care services.  Consultant services are required for enhanced supervision; quality 
control and management of constructions; and cost of design for the effluent treatment 
system for the NDQCL. 
8. 
Project Closing: An extension of the credit closing date from December 31, 2010 
to December 31, 2011, will help achievement of the Project Development Objectives 
(PDOs); and enable the government to complete: (i) ongoing civil works; (ii) purchase 
and delivery of much needed medical equipment and furniture; (iii) planned construction 
of 12 health centers; and (iv) complete the design of the effluent treatment system of the 
NDQCL. The Project was extended twice to December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2010, 
respectively, which would result in a cumulative extension period of 4 years.

P070542 
 CREDIT 3728-KH 
 
1. 
The closing date for the 
Cambodia Health Sector Support Project (Credit 3728-
KH, P070542) 
will be extended
 
from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2011.   
2. 
 Progress in implementing the Project has improved with the completion of four 
hospitals, contracting of the referral hospital, health centers and health posts in Preah 
Vihear, and submission of the package to construct 12 health centers to the Independent 
Procurement Agent (IPA) for bidding.  The bid evaluations for medical equipment are 
currently under review by the Bank.  
3. 
The proposed changes will enable the project to complete the ongoing civil works 
in Preah Vihear province (including the referral hospital, three health centers, and five 
health posts); construct 12 health centers; and complete procurement of medical 
equipment and furniture for these hospitals.  The extension will help the Project achieve 
greater progress towards the overall project development objectives of increased and 
equitable access to primary health care, particularly the poor, women and children.  
 
4. 
Preah Vihear is one of the remote provinces of Cambodia and has been without a 
hospital for over two years.  Similarly, the proposed health centers that the Project 
supports are located in the most remote and underserved areas of the country. The 
construction of these health centers will improve access to basic health care services to an 
estimated population of 120,000, and particularly the poor, women and children. The 
extension will also enable completion of the design of the effluent treatment system of 
the NDQCL making it an internationally certified Lab.
 
5. 
  The Borrower has submitted an action plan and capacity will be sufficiently 
enhanced to accelerate implementation and completion of activities under the project 
extension period. 
6. 
 
This will be the third extension of the Project.
 
The Project was extended twice to 
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2010, respectively, which would result in a 
cumulative extension period of 4 years.
