SECOND EDUCATION PROJEC-T (LOAN 1007-ES)
PROJECT COKPLETt0O' REPORT
Preface
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Education Project in El Salvador, for which Loan 1007-ES was
approved on lune 4, 1974 in the sum of US$17.0 million. The
closing date was July 22, 1983. US$1,543,895.53 of the Loan amount
was not disbursed and cancelled on. this date.
The PCR and Highlights resune were prepaxed by UNESCO and
reviewed and finalized by the Bank. GrotxpIs Latin America and
Caribbean Regional Office.  The PCR is based on: (a) the findings
of the UJNESCO Project Completion 1i.asion orich visited San SaLvador
in February 1983 and met with proje,t officials and other staff
concerned in the Ministry of Education; and (b) xaterial in the
Bank's files relating to this project, including the ALppraisaL
Report (380a-ES) dated May 16, 1974; the President's Report
(P-1407a-ES) dated May 23, 1974; and the Loan kgreenent, dated June
14, 1974.
Due tc the current unsettled conditions in the country,
the mission was restricted to consultations in San Salvador, the
capital city.  No project school. visits were undertaken.  The PCR
which tlhe Borrower was expected to prepare was not ready at the
time of the visit for comment.
The Operations Evaluation Departnent decided not to audit
the project and sent the PCR to the Governzment in August 1983.  The
Government replied on September 29, 1983, stating that they had no
observation of importance to make.  A translation of their cable is
reproduced as Attachment 1.

El, SALVADOR
Second Education Pro ect (Loan 1007-ES)
Project Com letion Report
HIGHLIGHTS
A loan oE US$17.0 million to assist in financing the Second
Education Project in El Salvador was approved and signed on 14 June 1974.
Total project cost was estimated at US$24.25 million. The project included
the establishment of 143 rural basic education schools, the replacement of
299 unsuitable schools, the expansion of 121 existing schools, and the
equipping of 146 workshops. The teacher training coLlege was to be provided
with additional classrooms, workshops and laboratories. For non-forma]. rural.
training, the Bank loan was expected to provide funds for the pilot phase of
a national mobile training scheme and to cover operational Costs during a
three-year period (para 1.05).
The project has been completed after undergoing significant
reductions during the implementation period. Completion was delayed by four
years (paras 2.01 and 2.02). The Loan was not totally disbursed, US$1.54
million was cancelled on July 22, 1983.  Total costs for the redujced project
amount to US$22,889,000 which is 5.6% below the appraisal estimate (para
3.01, 3.05 and 3.06).
The implementation delay and the project reduction were produced by
three categories of major factors which caused effects of varying
proportions, in each phase of implementation:
(a)  Technical factors incluaing, among others, site acquisition
(para 2.10), decisions on pedagogic aspects of each project
component (para 2.02), and the structure and operational
pattern of the project implementation unit (para 2.04),
considerably delayed the initiation of the project. At the
end of 1976 about US$2.0 million from the Loan had been
disbursed instead of the foreseen US$11.0 million.
(b)  Administrative factors, influential during tl  8-1/2 years of
project implementation, were particularly felt from 1977 on.
These included frequent changes of Ministers of Educatio;n and
their Vice Ministers (para 2.01), and also the three
successive changesin the structulre of the Project
Implementation Unit (para 2.04).
(c)  From 1979, project implementation was affected by the internal
state of unrest, leading to frequent changes in project school
sites (para 2.15), occupation of the Teacher Training College
by the a my (para 4.12), a two-year interruption of
Supervisi n Missions by the Bank, and a five month suspension
of disbursements (para 2.0).



VA.
Despite the important reductions imposed on all. project components,
the project has proved a positive contribution to Lhe educational progress of
El Salvador (para 5.01).  In addition to the 48,000 puPil places proxided,
the project has led to the development of a school design combining lower
cost and better use of space (para 2.17); it has contributed to a realistic
assessment of the financial feasibility, economic advisability, and staff
capacity for a nation-wide pre-vocational programme in Grades 7-9 (para
4.07); it has paved the way for a national non-formal adult training
programme (para 4.16); it has led to a more. appropriate structure of Project
Implementation Unit (para 2.06) than those often found elsewhere; it has
developed awareness of the conditions required for national coordination of
technical assistance (para 2032), a need usually overlooked in project
implementation.
The experience in implementing this project highlights the
following matters of importance to those responsible for education in El.
Salvador.
(a)  Proposals for changes in original project elements, if
required at all, should be preceded by definitive
identification of their nature, justification and implications
(para 5.09).
(b)  The Project Implementation Unit should be staffed to enable it
to monitor and continually assess the variety of conditions
involved in all contracts made during project implementation
(paras 2.09 and 5.15).
(c)  The Project Implementation Unit should develop periodic
cumulative records of each aspect of the project (sites,
architectural designs, educational statistics, educational
software, contracts, equipment, payments, implementation
schedule, etc.) as well as of the whole project (para 5.10).
For the Bank, this project suggests several points which deserve
attention (paras 5.13 and 5.15):
(a)  a more realistic assessment of the time required for overall
project implementation;
(b)  careful assessment of the time needed for decisions affecting
the project;
(c)  the importance for the PIU of combining self-sufficiency,
direct connections with the highest levels of education
decision-makers, and structured links with the specialized
technical services of the Ministry of Education relevant to
the project.

I. PROJECT BACKGROUNI)
1.01      In the early seventies, within the cont;,xt of an inter-sectoral
concerted effort towards improvement of the coriditions prevailing in rural
areas, the Government of El Salvador assigned to the educatiorn sector the
triple task of:
(a)  providing a larger number of children with a longer period of
a more appropriate general basic eduication (Grades 1-9) than
had been the case in the past;
(b)  developing flexible schemnes for rural adult vocational
training adapted to the needs of individual groups;
(c)  contributing througlh tlhe schools to rural. communtity
development.
Such educational priority was maintained in the second (1973-1977) and third
(1978-1982) five year education plans, as well. as in the current triennial
plan (1931-1983).
1.02      It was also early in the seventies that the Bank begaa to provide
financial support to projects for primary education, programmes for rural
development, and increased emphasis on qualitative improvement of eductional
activities.
1.03      The Second Educatior. Project, signed by E1 Salvador and the Bank in
June 1974,, was the first to be exclusively focused on primary and non-formal
education. Its aims were contribute:
(a) to the development of an economical and efficient
infrastructure or network of rural schools for basic
education;
(b)  to the introduction of a general basic education curi-iculuin
including pre-vocational training;
(c) to the expansion and imnprovement of the national teacher
training capacity; and
(d)  to the trial and establishment of a non-formal mobill  adultL
training scheme.
Project Generation
1.04      Sector work was carried out by a Unesco mission in February 1972.
However, none of the four projects recommended in the report were included in
the Second Education Project. Preparation was jointly conducted by the
Ministry of Education and the Bank. Appraisal work foillowed in October
1973. Negotiations were held in May 1974, and the Signing of the loan took
place on 14 June, 1974.  The Loan became effective on 11 October, 1974.

1.05      To attain the general. objectives listed above, the following
project components were appraised and actualLy implemented:
A.   (i)  Construction of new, replacement arid extended basic education
schools (for Grades 1-4/1-6/1-9) including the following
numiber of pupil-places, laboratories, workshops anA housing
units for teacners:

(ii) Provision of equipment for 146 existing workshops. This item
was later deleted from the project as few of these workshops
actually disted.
(iii) Expansion of the consolidated teacher training centre, Ciudad
Normal, by 500 places through the addition of 6 classrooms, 4
laboratories and 4 workshops. The 4 workshops were deleted
during implementation.
B.   (i)  A pilot phase and eventual expansion of a non-formal rural
training programme for adults. This project element was
finally reduced to the pilot phase.
(ii)  In-service teacher training courses to prepare 1,700 teachers
for the project schools.
C.        Technical assistanice for both teacher training and non-formal
rural adult training, including specialists and fellowships as
follows:

1.06      The component relating to general basic educaLion, in addition to
oxpanding physical capacity, aimed to contribute (a) to laying down the basis
for a nuclear type of rural. school network; (b) to the development of a basicH
education curriculum better adapted to rural areas, particularly in Grades
7-9, for which provision of about 125 'aboratories and workshops as well as
equipment for 146 existing workshops .as foreseen; (c) to the experimental
provision of housing units for teacherp in ordler to facilitate their
i;ntegration ijtto the community and their contribution to adult education
programmes.
The implementation of this component was dependent -upon (a)
specific criteria laid down for the selection of sites and for the location
of the project schools; (b) an agreed curriculum For basic education,
particularly for the practical areas in Grades 7-9; (c, the e-aluation
findings on the use made of the first 30 teachers' hotusing units.
1.0/       The teacher training component, in addition to the expansion of
physical capacity', aimed to strengthen the articula:ion between the various
types of teacher training required by t:he four schoel stages (1, 2 and 3 of
basic education as well as secondary education), ainming at different purpose,'
(pre- and in-service training), covering different areas (general, scientific
or practic-al), ani provided by different establishments (institutee arn,d
universities). The implementation of this part: of the project was dependent
upon the suibmission to the Bank of an overall plan for fuiture teacher
training deveiopment, and a scheme for the coordinat:'orA of the various
training arrangemienits,
1.08      The project contribution to the non-formal mobile rural trUning
programme was mostly of a qualitative charact:er, facilitating during the
pilot phese the- development of its conternt, identification of expected
outcomes, praparation of evaluation criteria, and operational procedures.
The foreseen extension and generalization of the programme was dependent upon
the continuious evalLtation (If the pilot phase and its final outco-,aes.
1.09      The technical assistance component of the pi:oject was to be a major
input for the planning of the supply of teachers and 1or curriculum
development in pre-vocational areas as well as for the non-formal. rural
traininrg programmne. The implementatiorn of thf.s project component was subject
to the submission to the Banik of an ovqirall pirogramme including the areas,
the specialists a-id the per::ods of technical assistance as well as the areas,
specializations, Lnteaded places and candidates for fEllowships.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Delays i" Implementation
2,01      The implementation of the project required 8.5 years instead of the
estimated 4.5 years. Three major categories of factors have led to this
delay, relating either to the national context or to the required sectoral
policy decisions or to operational aspects of project implementation.
National events affecting the course of the project included: six different
Ministers of Education with the usual changes of Vice-Ministers; increasing
unrest in the country, particularly from 1978 on, isolating several provinces
in which a substantial number of project ite.- were located; two years
Interruption of Bank Supervision Missions (1980-1981); five months
interruption oE disburseD,ents (first half of 1981), occupancy by the army of
the main teacher training institute (Ciudad Normal) which under the
consolidation programme of teacher training institutions was to become the
only "Normal" school in the country.
2X02      The education policy decisions envisaged by the Appraisal Mission
as a prerequisite for implementstion of each one of the project components
either were never made, or were made too late, or were insufficient in
scope. This applies, for instance, to the submission of the curriculum for
practical work in Grades 7-9, required for workshop construction and
equipment. Since it was late and insufficient, this project item was
deleted. This has been the case regarding the late and incomplete plan for
the supply of teachers and coordination of their training, as required for
the expansion of Ciudad Normal. Similarly, the decision for expansion of the
non-formal rural adult training programme could never be made due to
insufficient evaluation of the pilot phase. Finally, significant delays were
also experienced in reaching a decision on the use of loan funds for
specialists' services and fellowships allocated both to teacher training and
curriculum development.
2.03      Among the operational factors which have interfered with the smooth
and timely implementation of the project are included all those relating to
its physical aspects. They wil be commented on in more detail in the
following paragraphs.
Project Management
2.04      The project was managed under three different organizational
schemes, namely:
(a)  Project Implementation Unit identified with two already
existing units, i.e. DAE (Department of Educational
Architecture) and ODEPOR (Bureau cf Educational Planning and
Coordination);
(b)  new Project Implementation Unit totally independent from the
two above, though to be assisted by them, and placed directly
under the Minister of Education;



- 5 -
(c)  the same as (b) but physically and personally linked (same
director) with DAE.
(i) 1974-1978
2.05      Under the Loan Agreement, the DAE withli the Ministry of Education,
was responsible for construction, equipment and furniture procurement, and
ODEPOR, also within the Ministry of Education, was made responsible for the
technical assi,-tance programme, preparing equipment lists and coordinating
the educational aspects and decisions required by the project.  The position
of Pro4ect Coordinator was established in ODEPOR, and the Project Director in
DAE. During this period, the administration of the project posed some
difficulties and only 35% of total foreseen investment was carried. These
difficulties were mainly due to: (i) lack of interest of bidders more
attracted by the large amount of civil engineering work. offered in the
private sector and in other public sectors; (ii) turnover of key DAE
personnel at an average of one change every two years, mainly as a result of
its low salaries, between 40-70% lower than in the private sector; (iii)
scarcity of construction materials; (iv) some delays in Govrerniment
disbursemients and Bank reimbursements; (v) delays in education decisions
required by the project elements.
(ii) 1979-1980
2^06      Difficulties of coordination in the above scheme and the large
number oF additional projects under DAE's responsibility led to the creation,
in 1979, of a small autonomous Project Implementation Unit, e-xcltsivelv
responsible for the Second Education Project.  Physically located outside
DAEh, it was attached to the office of the Minister of Education. It included
a general coordinator, an architect, an educator, a procurement officer, an
accountant, and supporting staff, with salaries totally financed by project
funds. No institutional links were established with ODEPOR and DAE, but they
were to provide technical support to the UJnit in carryinlg out its duties.
2.07      During this period, adminiL2ratio- of the project improved, with
better cost control of siteworks and physical contingencies. Site
feasibility and preparation of project documents were contracted with private
firms which successfully replacred DAE's previous contribution in this area.
Total dibursements from the Loani Account reached over 60% of the total actual
loan.
(iUi)    1981-1982
2.08      Difficulties in obtaining DAE's and ODEPOR's cooperation led to a
third scheme. Since April 1981, the PIU shares physical facilities and
director with OCPE (Coordinating Unit tor all education projects) which
replaced DAE. The PIU, however, remained autonomous in its responsibilities
for the Second Education Project in its staff salaries, which continue to be
financed from project funds, and in its direct connection with the Minister
of Education.



- 6 -
2.09      Since then, the PIU has been able to invest more funds, to complete
the Second Education Project and to monitor the Fourth Education Project
reasonably well. In addition to greater stability and experience of the key
personnel of the PIU as well as it more appropriate organization, two main
reasons may be adduced for this:  (i) a general slow-down in the construction
industry which made bidders more interested in participating in the project;
(ii) a reduction in DAE and later OCPE activities, enabling its staff to
cooperate more freely and advantageously with the PIU.
Sites
2.10      The provision of sites for the new schools became one of the major
difficulties in project implementation. Only about 10 out of the projected
143 new schools were built during the first phase in 1975. Most of the
remaining 70 out of the 80 new schools actually completed were built during
the period 1979-1982. The main reason for this performance was the
difficulty in obtaining sites for new schools as a con,soquence of: (i) high
population densitv in rural areas (450 inhabitants per arable km2); (ii)
complicated bureaucratic steps to obtain legal title to land; (iii) lack of
adequate conditions on the available sites.
2.11      Despite the criteria recommended in Schedule 7 of the Loan
Agreement, the sites selected were not generally flat, and sice development
costs during the period 1974-77 were well above the original estimates.
2.12      A reduction in the standard size of school sites was agreed during
the Supervision Mission of February 1978. The sizes were reduced to 600 m2
instead of 1,500 m2 for 2-classroom schools, to 900 m2 instead of 1,500 m2
for 3-classroom schools, and to 1,200 m2 instead of 4,000 n2 for larger
schools. This decision considerably facilitated site selection.
2.13      Later, private firms were contracted to prepare site feasibility
studies.  The resulting layout plans made it possible to have a complete and
precise description of every proposed site, including information about
topography, accessibility, sub-soil conditions, orientation, availability of
electricity and water services, etc.
2.14      The average percentage share of siteworks costs in construction
costs decreased from 41% in the period 1974-77 to 21% in the period 1978-82,
resulting in an average of 28% for the total period 1974-82, which is
comparable with the originally estimated 29% (Annexes 4 and 5).
2.15      The criginal location of some sites was altered on an ad hoc basis
due to the increasing state of unrest in some regions where project schools
were to have been provided. As a consequence, about 18% of the schools
planned for the eastern region have been changed to the central or western
regions of the country (Annex 1).



-7-
Designs
2.16      Designs For new and replacement schools were simple but
appropriate. They included learning areas, a covered multi-purpose area (to
be used for non-formal and practical tr-aining or other commitnity activities),
and ancillary facilities   When new classrooms were added to existing
facilities (extensions) they were disposed adjacently with an overhanging
roof.
2. 7      The combination of low unit cost with low unit gross area has
compensated for the high percentage of physical and price contingencies
making it possible to cover a total number of pupil places only 15% lower
than foreseen by the appraisal report. (Annexes 6, 7 and 9j.

2.18      School buildings were not visited by the Completion Mission, but
from opinions gathered in the country, photographs available in the Project
Unit and visits carried out by Bank architects on previous Supervision
Missions, it was judged that the quality of construction was acceptable.
Supervision
2.19      Construction supervision was contracted with private architects
during the first phase and with consultant firms for the rest. Neither DAF
nor the private architects were able to supervise the construction contracts
adequately, particularly in terms of controlling costs and consis.ency with
the orders, during the period 1974-77.
Construction Contracts
2.20      During the execution of Phases I-III of the project (i974-77) the
DAE unilaterally approved the execution of additional works and the
readjustment of construction prices, all of which caused a large increase in
physical contingenciec.  During that period, the percentage share of physical
contingencies in main construction contract costs reached 50% (up to 87% in
one case) instead of the 5% originally estimated (see Annexes 4 and 5).



2.21      This situation was analyzed critically by the Supervision Mission
of February 1978, and agreements reached and later confirmed by the Bank in
April 1978, were as follows:  (i) adjustments due to increase in labour and
material prices should not go beyond 15% of the basic contract; (ii)
additional works could be accepted only on excavations and foundations of
buildings; (iii) siteworks costs should not go beyond 50% of construction
costs.
2.22      As a consequence, the percentage share of phystcal contingencies in
construction contract costs decreased From 50% during the first three phases
(1974-1977) to a more reasonable average of 7.5% for rhe last four phases of
the project (1978-1982) (Annexes 4 and 5). Table 2.2 below sumnarizes the
variations of physical contingencies:

Furniture and Equipment
2.23      The aniount originally assigned for equipmaent (particuLarly for
practical a.d/or pre-vocational activities) has been reduced substantially as
a resuilt of the following reducticns in project scope requesced by the
Government:
(a) deletion of 62 new workshops from 125 foreseen for the basic
education schools to be either newly constructed, rebuilt or
expanded;
(b)  deletion of the four workshops foreseen for the teacher
training center (Ciudad Norual);
(c)  deletion of the equipment foreseen for 146 allegedLy existing
workshops;
(d)  scaling down of the equipment for the 63 workshops
constructed, to the level of siumple manual tools;
(e)  deletion of the expansion phase of the non-fornial rural adult
training programme, for which several mobile units with
equipment for a variety of training programmes had been
foreseen.



2.24      As a consequence, the cost of equipmenr (in constant prices) went
down to US$0.6 million instead of the US$3.0 million foreseen.  In current
prices and including the contingencies the cost was US$1.2 million Lnstead of
the US$4.3 million planned (Annex 11).
2.25      In general terms, procurement of equipment seems to have beer
smooth. However, on several occasions lack of coordination has been evident,
causing serious disturbances, for instance:
(a)  on sonme occasions the transit through custons has been
unreasonably delayed due to the lack of required approval by
the Minister of Finance;
(b)  the equip,dent was not yet available for the in-service
training programmes for teachers of pre-vocational courses in
project schools; and
(c)  teachers for pre-vocational areas, after finishing their
in-service training course, could not be contracted due to
lack of equipment in the schools, resulting in the teachers
applying for other positions from which they could not easily
be transferred when needed.
2.26      Oral information transmitted to the mission indicates that
furniture and equipment received for the project schools are adequate and
functional.  The furniture produced in the country is deemed econonical.
Technical Assistance
2.27      The technical assistance to be provided by the project was in the
areas of non-forimal rural education and of teacher training/currictiLum.  It
was expected to be coordinated by ILO and UNESCO respectiveLy.
2.28      As early as late 1974, the request was nade by the Ministry of
Education to coordinate directly the technical assistance for non-formal
rural education.  A compromise was accepted by June 1975, involving technical
assistance directly coordinated by the Ministry of Education but provided
under contract by SENA (Colombia).
2.29      The Ministry of Education also requested, aind the Bank agreed in
late 1975, to the direct national coordination of technical assistance for
teacher training and cuLrriculum development.
2.30      The process of recruiting specialists and programning felLowships
for the non-formal rural programme through SENA was snoohch. The quality of
the specialists it provided as well as the training opportunities it secured
are considered outstanding.  Serious reservations to the contrary are
expressed in El Salvador about the technical assistance directly recruited by
the Ministry of Education for teacher training and curriculum development.
The recruitment process was slow, the sources of candidates limited, and the
outcomes not always satisfactory.
2.31      The implemontation of technical assistance in the Second Education
Project in El Salvador provided a two-fold experience.  Latin kmerican



- 10 -
national institutions such as S3NA are in a position to provided appropriate
technical assistance rapidly -.a their area of specialization, a: a cost
apparently lower than the in ernational agenciee.  A direct search arid
contracting procedure for technical assistance by the Ministry of Educatioa
may lead to appropriate results only if a mechanism existed aLn the hinistry
which would:  (a) facilitate the flnding of speciaLists; (b) ptovide elesients
for judgement; and (c) ensure that all legal aspects to be included in the
contracts with foreign specialists are taken Lnto account.
2.32      Under either of the two arrangements (externaL or internal
coordination) a comprehensive planning foT the iepLementation oF technical
assistance (spec_alists and fellowships) is indispensabLe.  Despire the
continuous insistence of the Bank, a comprehensive prograrnme of techLical
assistance in the areas of teacher training and curricuLur.i development was
never submitted.
Special Covenants
2.33      The performance of the Borrower Ls coraplyirig with the special
covenants contained in the Loan Agreement has not been as e*cpected (Anine-
3). On the other hand, the large number oF detailed covenants in general,
and of those which have on3.y been partly complied with, raises a doubt about
their justification in a document such es the Loan Agreement.  It would bave
been more appropriate to replace them by fewer and more substantive ones of
less detailed character.

3.02      The difference between the actual and originalLy estimated costs is
the result of sevcral factor's which affected the project by either increasing
or decreasing project cost.
3.03      Factors which increased project costs were the following:
(i)  both the doubling of the required time needed to implement the
project and higher-tlian-estimated inflation rates increased
price contingencies to US$10.42 million, or about US$5.54
rnillion (113x) more than the originally estimated US$4.88
million (See Annexes 9, 10, 11);
(ii) as a result of inadequate decisions in the first three phases
of implementation, physical contingency costs rose to US$1.43
million, or about US$0.84 million (142'!) more than the
originally estimated US$0.59 million (<Ainex 11);
(iii)  increased allocation to project admanistration which, as a
whole, and including contingencies, rose to US$3.13 million or
about US$0.8 (34%) mnore than the originally estimated US$2.33
million (Annex 11);
(iv)  an allocation of US$50,000 not foreseen at Appraisal, tc
finance expenditures for selection of the first sites for
schools to be built under toaji 1738-ES.
3.04      Factors which decreased project costs have been the modification of
some project elements an- the reduction of some unit costs.  Among the
deletions from the original project some have appeared expLicitly in the Loan
Agreement amenddents (made in 1979, in 1980 and in 1982), and others becamie
apparent only during the completion mission.
3.05      Modified project elements and lower unit costs have decreased
project cost as follows:
{i)  reduction in equipment costs by about US$3.09 million or 72X
less than the originally estimated US$4.Z8 million, due to
deletion of the equipment for 146 workshops/laboratories
(Annex 11);
(ii)  reduction in teachers' housing costs by about US$1.0 rnillionn
following deletion of 150 teachers' housing units out of the
foreseen 180 (Annex 7);
(iii)  reduction in new schools cost by about US$1.0 million due to
deletion of 63 new schools representing about 41% less area
built than originalLy foreseen for new schools (Annex 7);
(iv)  reduction in replacement schools cost by about US$1.3 million
following the construction of smaller schools resulting in
about 13% less area built under this category of construction
(Annex 7);



- 13 -
(v)  reduction in new workshops/laboratortes cost by about US$1.5
million following deletion of 62 out of the 125 #orkshops and
29 out of 125 laboratories originially foreseen.
(vi)  reduction of the unit construction cost per area (at January
1974 prices) by about 23% of that originally estimated due to
more economic school designs (Annex 6).
3.08      As a consequence of the above variations in the total project cost
the financing of the project has been modified as follows: the Government of
El Salvador has increased its share by US$0.18 million, and the Loan has been
decreased by US$1.54 million.  Of this amount, US$1.3 million was caacelled
on August 25, 1982 (Annex 8)n

3.07      The Loan proceeds, originally estimated at 70% of total project
cost, finally covered 67.5% of the cost of the reduced proj(,ct mainly because
the Government financed the civil works overruns during the initial phases of
project implementation, and in spite of the increase in Bank financing under
all categories to 100% of the later phase implementation (from August 1982).

IV. OPERATION OF PROJECT INSTITUTIONS
Overview
4.01      In general terms the Second Education ProjLct has contributed
substantially to the education development of El Salvador.  The fouir areas to
which the project has contributed concinue to be recognized by the education
auithorities as priority areas of concern (parr.. 2.03). In at least three out
of the four project areas the Ministry of Education is consistently Collowing
the guidelines laid down for the project implementation, as is the case in:
(a) the organization of all rural basic education schools on the model of
the school nucleus, (b) the development of a basic education curriculum (1-9)
includirig simple pre-vocational areas; (c) the coordination and planning of
teacher training. In the case of the non-formal mobi'e adult training
scheme, despite its importance, the model adopted by The project has been
discountinued.
Basic Education
4.02      Physical Expansion:   The project has added 47,600 places providing
room for an enrollment equivalent, when used on double shift, to 13% of the
1982 jasic educationl enrollment (Grades 1-9).  However, there was a
considerable decline of the basic education enrollment in 1980 and 1931 as a
consequenice of the internal strife (population migration, absence of teachers
and/or pupils, and the interruption of communications with the Ministry of
Education). The enrollment in those years was equivalent respectively to 93%
and 79% of that reached in 1979 and to 92% and 76% of the projections which
were used as a basis for the Appraisal Report and were contained in the
Second (1973-1977) and Third (1978-1982) Education Plans.  Enrollment began
to rise slightly in 1982, without, however, reaching the level of 1976. Due
to thp current conflict, 23% of the 511 project schools were closed in 1982,
and no information was available on an additional 14%. Out of the remaining
322 schools only 8% were operating on a one-shift systeom, and the rest on a
double-shift system, including about 80 with a use factor above 100%
(estimated on the double-shift in Grades 1-6).
4.03      As foreseen in the project design, the two-shift system has allowed
savings in investment (two-classroom schools and two teachers for four
grades; three-classroom schools and three teachers for six grades;
six-classroom schools and six teacheTs for nine grades). It has also
facilitated savings in operational costs (teachers received a monthly
additional sum of 150 Colones (US$60) for the afternoon shift in Grades 1-6).
4.04      The savings expected by the Appraisal Report through the
substitution of rented schools by new schools are not made in the foreseen
proportions because: (a) only 98 percent of the replaced rented schools
belong to the group of 299 specifically foreseen for it, due to the
impossibility of obtaining new land for their replacement; (b) the rent which
has been paid for most of the actually replaced rented schools was very low.
4.05      Nuclearization.  The project has made an important contribution to
the development of a network of basic education schools in rural areas
following the  school nucleus  scheme.  The criteria developed and tried out



- 15 --
for the definition of the cat chmeint area, for the d.stance between schools
and for the 'ocation of Grades 7-9 in the Second Project, proved to be
valuable for the FouArth Education Project on szhool nuacleus' signed ill
1979.  In that year, about 579,000 pupils, equivalent to 85% of the Gc9ch^
1-9 enrollments, were astimat;ed to be "formaJ.ly" distributed among 330
"nucleos", which included 2,872 schools.  At present a detailed school maop is
under preparation, aiming at a more comprehensive and comiplete identification
*         of each  nucleo" in order to appoint the heads of "niucleos" (with an
additional mnonthly salary of 150 Colones) to put them into full operation.
4.06      Nuclearization has led to closer coordination among schools which
were isolated in the past.  It has also considerably facilitated the current
process of decentralization of the educational administration into three
major regions.  Furthermcre, it has brought the decision-making process
closer to the operational level by allrwing a more active participation of
the communities in certain school-related decisions,
4.C7      Practical Subjects in Grades 7-9.  The contribution made by the
project to the various curriculum aspects of basic education, particularly in
Grades 7-9, is not quite clear.  The firm stand taken by the Bank on the
submission of a curriculum, including definitions of objectives, content,
timetable and equipment list, before initiating the construction and/or
equipment of workshops, has evidently led to the preparation of a
curriculuam, It has al-o contributed to the development of a growing
awareness of the financial implications, of the staff requirements and of the
economic preconditions demanded for a nationwide compulsory pre-vocational
programme for Grades 7-9.  A1 a consequence, the present curriculum, with its
three weekly periods in Grades 1-9 in manual, practical or pre-vocational
areas, focused on the use of manual tools, is still considered by the
Ministry of Education as experimental and cransitional. However, the issue
of the focus to be given to education in general and practical subjects, in
particular in Grades 7-9, remains very controversial in El Salvador due to
the three co-existing schools of thought emphasizing respectively a
vocational focus, a pre-vocation-l orientation and the conventional general
education preparing for furthar studies.
4.08      The contribution to curriculum  development expected from the
inclusion of TV sets (under the national education budget) in all project
schools did not materialize,  Only one quarter of the project schools are
actually equipped with an operational TV set as a consequence of: (a) insuf-
ficient funding for TV sets; (b) vandalism; (c) absence of electric power;
and (d) limited reach for the TV transrnitters. Even where these negative
conditons do not exist, teachers are not always enthusiastic about using TV
programmes, either due to the discipline required. or as a consequence of the
programme gradually taking on a routine character.
4.09      Teachers' Housing.  The provision of teachers' housing units has
been foreseeni as a qualitat4ve contribution to rural basic education (para.
2.06). Unfortuantely, the carefully designed sequence (limited experimen-
tation - evaluation - generalization), was followed by a half-hearted
implementation (the pilot phase was not evaluated as foreseen), and ended in
the cancellation of the further expansion of the scheme.  The informal



- 16 -
assessment made on the pilot phase (the criteria arnd i.nstruments for final
eval.uation were prepared by CONESCAL) revealed the c.omplexity of a teaotherss'
housing scl:heme under Llin conditionis in El. Salvador.  Cultural norms constrain
unmitarried female teachers Crom living away froum tlheir families, and the
nuniber of staff housing constructed was reoducod a,, a resul.t. Moreover, thL
smTall size of thiic coun)try and the availability of transportation m.de thesO
unneces6ary .
Teacher Traininf
4.10      Pre-Serv.i.ce Training.  The conitribution made by the project Lo pre-
service teacher training in El Salvador througih thle Second fiducation Project
has been modest. The foreseen support to pre(->service training of teachers in
practical or pre-vocational. areas cidl not materi.alize, since the four
workshops for Ciudad Normal wete never built.  Such training has not yet been
provided in El Salvador.
4.11      Support for thie pre-service training of science teachers has onily
Dartially materialized.  Although four laboratories were added to Ciudad
Normal in 1978/79, the equipment (arriving later thani foreseen) was assigned
to the four technological institutes which, since 1981, have opened pedagogic
units offering teacher training (Sani Salvador, Santa Ana, San Miguel and San
Vicente). 1/
4.12      The consolidation of pre--service teacher training in one insticu-
tioni (Ciudad Normal) accomiplished in 1968 was expected to be reinforced tinider
the project. This reinforcement did not materialize.  Already, in 1976, the
technological institute of San Mliguel was offering pre-servicE. teacher
training courses.  In 1982, when Ciudad Normal was put at the service of the
Army, there was a total of seven technological institutes and three private
colleges offering various types of teacher training programmes.
4.13      The planning of the supply of teachers according to foreseen needs
remains a major weakness of El Salvador's education system and it was an
issue of major concern during the project implementation. The forecast of
teachers annually supplied by the training institutions for the period 1982-
1985 is irregular: about 2,040 in 1982, about 480 in 1983, ebout 2,380 in
1984 and about 1,230 in 1985. Such variations are not related to the basic
education enrollment fluctuations observed iTI recent years. The "open",
"inductive", "qualitative", planning as it is practiced currently in the
Minitry of Education will not Facilitate the provision of a regular flow of
new trained teachers.
4.14      In-Service Teacher Training.   The contribution of the Second
Education Project to in-service teacher training has gained more importance
through support provided to the very dynamic PPMs (tn-Service Teacbers'
Programrne for Professional Development), and the financing of an ad-hoc
in-seivice programme for 120 teachers in 1976/77 and for 600 supervisors,
1,300 non-certified and 5,000 certified teachers in 1982.
1/   The Bank agreed to this redistribucion, as the equipment had already
been delivere wheni the Ciudad Normal was put at the service of the
Army.



- 17-
4.15      Awareness of the rather confused situatioo prevailing. in teacher
training already felt during Appraisa.l has ;recently been felt again and l.ed
to the creation of the Comiston Nacional de Capacitincte,n Docente (National
Conmmission of Teacher lEducation) in the Ministry of Edtication to coordiLiate
all. pre-servic.e and in-service teacher trairiing actLvtties.
Non-Fornial Adult Trainig Pgromme for Rural Areas
4.16      The contribution made by the Second Educationl Project to the
development of a non-formnal adult train:lng programme for rural areas through
the support provided in this pilot phase was significant, although, due to
several factors, the expected generalization of the programme did not take
place.
4.17      Current aiisessmetnt of the pilot phase is positive, when it is
focused on the conception of the courses offered, on the theoretical scope of
its audience, and on the instruments proposed for its evaluation.  Less
positive was the opiai,3n expressed during the pilot phase on the capacity of
the Ministry of Educati.n to handle a programme o' that type if it were to be
generalized throughout the country.  Finally, there are surprisingly few
comments contained ..n the documentation of the Ministry of Education dealing
with the actual achievements and outcomes of the pilot phase, in the four
main areas of training.   The achievements and outcomes are deemed signifi-
cant in cooperatives and artisan training (totalling 16% of all partici-
pants), but they were found questionable in construction training and not
substantial in agricultural training. The final evaluation of the pilot
phase foreseen in the Loan Agreement was never made for the following
reasons: (a) delays within ODEPOR; (b) civil strife in the area; and (c)
lack of financial resources.
4,18      In spite of these reservations, the experience of the pilot ?hasa
of this programme, combined with the conclusions of a similar one conducted
in urban areas under USAID auspices, has facilitated the creation of a
current very modest national programme for rural and urban adult training
(PROHAMO), under the General Directorate of Adult Educaion.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
5.01      Project implementation, under the conditions referred to above
(para. 2.01), was difficult. In spite of the reductions and deletions which
have taken place (para. 1.05) the project makes an important contribution to
education in El Salvador in the context of the intended outcomes (para.
1.03).
5.02      The project has led to the development and use of a very complete
outline for site development (para. 2.1.3), of a locally adapted school design
(para. 2.16), of a suitable and economic school furniture model (para. 1.06),
and of a functional structure of the Project Implementation Unit (paras.
2.04-2.09). Under the project, the Ministry of Education has gained valuable
experience in the coordination of technical assistance (para. 2.31).
5.03      In addition to contributing to the physical expansion necessary for
rural basic education (para. 4.02) the project has reinforced the use of the
two-shift system and confirmed its value for savings in investment and in
operational costs (paras. 4.03-4.04).   Two major benefits of the basic
education component of the project are the norms developed and tried out for
the establishment of "school nucleus" (para. 4.05) and the general awareness
in the Ministry of Education of the implications of a nationwide programmme
of pre-vocational educatioa in Grades 7-9 (para. 4.07).
5.04      The project has made some contribution to the establishment of a
national programme of in-service teacher training (para. 4.14) and to the
establishment of a national non-formal adult training programme (para. 4.18).
5.05      The Borrower has performed well within the context of the difficult
conditions prevailing during the implementation period (para. 2.01). There
are, however, certain performance aspects which do not necessarily depend
upon the current extraordinary conditions, and in which performance could
have been better, as summarized in Annex 3, referred to in para. 2,33 and as
mentioned in para. 2.02.   The problem met in obt:aining as foreseen the
required policy decisions, which were to be coordinated and stimulated by
ODEPOR, raises the question of the potential of ODEPOR for such functions
(para. 2.05).
5.06      The Bank has shown flexibility in adapting quickly to new
conditions as shown in the acceptance of changes in the PIU (para. 2.04-a),
in the site size (para. 2.12), in site development (para. 2.13), in the
location of schools (para. 2.15), in the coordination of technical assistance
(paras. 2-27-2.28).
5.07      On the other hand, the Bank has shown the required firmness when
concrssions could not be made, as was the case regarding additional construc-
tion works (para. 2.20), curriculum of practical subjects (para. 4.07),
evaluation of the pilot phase of the teachers' housing programme (para.
4.09), planning and coordination of teacher training (para. 4.13), and
evaluation of the pilot phase of the non-formal rural adult training
(paras. 4.16-4.17).



-- 19 -
5.08      On a few occasions, however, the performance of the Bank was not as
expected. This is the case in the too many and detailed convenants (para.
2.33), in the insufficient assistance provided during the period of major
policy decisions affecting all project components (paras. 2.06-2.08), and in
agreeing to technical assistance coordinated by the Ministry of Education of
the Project Implementation Un4t without sufficient insight into their
capacity to assume such tasks (paras. 2.28-2.29).
Recommendations
5.09      Proposals for changes in original project elements, if required at
all, should be preceded by careful identification of their nature, justifi-
cation and implications.  The Ministry of Education, and specifically the
Project Implementation Unit, has shown a considerable degree of initiative in
adjusting to emerging conditions, and in identifying alternative means of
attaining the project objectives. It is not evident, however, that in all
these cases there was a need to change the original agreements. Furthermore,
on several occasions, the alternatives proposed to the Bank were not
supported by satisfactory evidence of justification, scop..:, benefits,
implications and feasibility. In some cases (workshops to be equipped did
not exist) it became apparent that the alternative put forward was not
feasible or appropriate after the study required by the Bank had been made.
As a result, the necessary arrangements were delayed, the search for more
appropriate and feasible alternatives postpored, and the project item finally
cancelled because its implementation would have exceeded the deadline for
project termination, which had already been pushed back.
5.10      The procedures used by the Project Implementation Unit for
collecting, processing and recording data should be considerably improved and
expanded.   Steps should be taken to secure comprehensive, cumulative (by
phase or year), up-to-date, easily accessible information on the project as a
whole, as well as on its components. The present practice of going back to
original contracts, questionnaires filled in by the schools, correspondence
with the Bank, every time cumulative information is required, is
unnecessarily time-consuming, creates errors (due to the pressure under which
it is done) leading to inconsistency in the limited available cumulative
data, and does not facilitate a complete overview of the project and its
position at a given moment.
5.11      Finally, the Project Implementation Unit should make a practice of
carefully analyzing the various contracts related to the project, including a
stricter control of: (a) the conditions under which these contracts have to
be carried out; (b) their implications in terms of time, assurances and
funds; and (c) their implementation.
5.12      Improvements recommended in the above three paragraphs will be
greatly facilitated by the preparation of operational guides, which the PIU
should be able to develop by virtue of its past involvement with several
externally-financed education projects.
5.13      A characteristic feature of the Second Education Project of El
Salvador was the subordination of each one of the major items to a still
pending decision at the moment of the Loan signature:



- 20 -
(a)  basic education schools were dependent upon a decision to be
made on the curriculum in pre-vocational areas as well as upon
the expansion of the proposed teachers' housing scheme;
(b) the additions to Ciudad Normal were subject to the decisions
regarding teacher supply and coordination of their training;
(c)  the expansion of non-formal adult rural education was
conditional upon the decision to be made on the basis of the
outcome of the pilot phase;
(d) the technical assistance component was to be preceded by a
comprehensive plan for specialists and fellowships in each of
the two areas of technical assistance.
In all. cases, the decision-making process demanded more time than was
available, and exceeded the capability of the PIU and the office responsible
for facilitating such a process (ODEPOR). As a consequence, the submitted
elements were of a transitional character (curriculum), or not totally
satisfactory (teacher training plan), or never presented (evaluation of the
teachers' housing scheme and of the pilot phase of non-formal rural
education, as well as the plan for technical assistance). There is no reason
to be critical about project items being made to depend upon decisions yet to
be taken; however, it is clear that the necessary steps should be included,
where necessary, to assist in the decision-making process. involved.  In the
case of El Salvador, however, despite the importance of the educational
policy decisions, in the five Supervision Missions which took place until the
end of 1975, no educator participated. The visit of an education specialist
would, however, have contributed considerably to speeding up the decisions on
many of these items, and could also have assisted the Ministry of Education
in the approach used for defining the required curriculum.
5.14      The Second Education Project in El Salvador was one of the first
projects supported by the Bank which included mainly primary schools. The
difficulties encountered in securing the large number of sites in so many
different rural communites were not encountered in preceding projects dealing
with secondary schools. The legal procedures for the acquisition of land
(donation, purchase, exchange) for schools under uncomplicated circumstances
(which are not the prevailing ones) take a minimum of two months in the case
of donations9 and four months in the other two cases. Expropriation
proceedings take considerably longer. As a consequence, project implementa-
tion was significantly delayed. Since there is little possibility of
reducing the time required for the identification and legal acquisition of
land, the only way to is to advance this procedure. Such advancement,
possible only within certain limits, could be obtained through the inclusion,
in some projects (with follow-up possibilities) of funds for site surveys for
the following project, as was done in the revision of Loan 1007-ES in August
1°79.
5.15      Th(e phases through which the PIU evolved during the Second
Education Project have demonstrated the importance to be attached to four
structural features of the unit:



- 21 -
(i) autonomy and self-sufficiency in terms of staff salaries,
operational budget and decision-making regarding project
implementation;
(ii) direct communication with the highest levels of the sector
decision makers (Minister and Secretary);
(iii)  close connection with and privileged attention by the
technical services required for project implementation (school
architects, statistical office);
(iv) stability of the key staff members of the PIU, such as the
Director, architect, educator, procurement officer,
accountant, data supervisor.
The three structures gradually applied in this project emphasized successive-
ly feature (iii) when the PIU was part of the DAE and ODEPOR, or features (i)
and (ii) when it became autonomous and directly under the Minister without
structured links with DAE, or (i), (ii) and (iii) when the PIU, keeping its
autonomy and having direct contact with the Minister and Secretary, was
provided also with structured links with DAE (parase 2.04-2.09).
5.16       Conditions vary from project to project.  In the case of this
project, the detailed description of the functions of the two main bodies
responsible for project implementation (DAE and ODEPOR) proved operationally
irrelevant, could not be implemented and seem inappropriate for inclusion in
a document such as the Loan Agreement. Bank assistance in the preparation of
an operational manual would have been more useful.
