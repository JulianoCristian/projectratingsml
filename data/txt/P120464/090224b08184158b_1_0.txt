                         After decades of conflict, massive displacement of the population, widespread insecurity, and lack of consistent funding, the health care system and the health status of the
                         population in South Sudan was alarmingly poor at the time of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005. In response to this situation, the international community decided

                         to provide support to the health sector with the aim of improving availability and access to Basic Health Services.

                         The World Bank was involved in this process as the Manager of the Multi-Donors Trust Fund established by a group of countries to provide sustained support to the country in the
                         interim period. Thus, the World Bank supported the design and the implementation of Umbrella Program for Health System Development (UPHSD) - phase 1(2006-2010 at the cost of

                         US$60,0 million ) and phase 2 (2010-2012 at the cost of US$ 71,5 million).

                         The Umbrella Program for Health System Development, phase 2 was approved in March 3, 2010 and became effective in April 27, 2010. During the implementation period, the client
                         twice requested additional financial support. Following these requests, the project was granted for a total cost of US$ 8, 5 million which has increased the total cost of the project from
                         US$ 63 million to US$ 71,5 million.

                         The purpose of the additional financing was to fill the financing gap of costs associated with: (i) the procurement of essential medicines including ART drugs and (ii) the delivery of
                         Basic Health Services in one county of Jonglei State of South Sudan.

                         The original completion of the project was extended from June 2012 to December 2012. Although, in June 2012, the project had completed most of the planned activities, the MOH
                         requested the extension of the closing date in order to maintain at the basic level delivery of health services in Jonglei and Upper Nile until the launching of the new health project and
                         to ensure proper reception and distribution of the remaining lot of essential drugs.

                         The implementation of the project has been completed and all planned activities have been implemented.

                         As of December 7, 2012, all funds allocated under the project were fully committed and a total of 99, 6% out of the US$ 71, 5 million had been disbursed.

                         By project closing, the key stewardship functions were strengthened, the role and responsibility of different levels of the MOH (central, state and county) were revised and approved,
                         the management team in charge of coordination and monitoring of project activities as well as activities funded by others donors was established and performed relatively well. In
                         2011, in order to improve coordination and mutual accountability and ensure equitable distribution of basic health services throughout the country, the MOH and development
                         partners agreed to restructure the support to the health sector and to opt for geographical focus. According to this agreement, each development partners will concentrate its support
                         to the defined geographical area (one or more states). It obvious, that this geographical approach will contribute to reduce gaps in services and some duplication of effort.

                         The following monitoring and evaluation activities under the project have been completed: development of Health Management Information System and Quantitative Supervisory
                         Checklist, conduct of Lot Quality Assurance Sampling Survey and Health Facility Assessment. The data collected through various means helped MOH as well development partners
                         to identify priorities, recognize successes, and appreciate gaps.

                         The procurement and distribution of drugs has been implemented successfully, The last shipment of the drugs arrived in the country at the end of November 2012 and is currently
                         under distribution.

                         Delivery of a Basic Package of Health Services through Lead agencies in four project supported states (Upper Nile, Jonglei, Central Equatoria and Eastern Equatoria) has been
