 IEGWBMission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporatesthe comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Banks Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWBwebsite: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized).Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Poverty Alleviation
and Capacity BuildingProject (Cr.3 176) inThe Gambia, for which the World Bank
approved a Credit of US$15.0 million equivalent on March 16, 1999. A Supplemental
Credit o f US$4.0 million equivalent was approved on June 21,2005. The Credit was
closed on December 31,2006, three years later than planned, when US$73,656
equivalent was cancelled.

The report i s based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion Report, Appraisal Report, legal documents and project files, and on
discussions held with Bank staff involved inthe project. An IEGmission visited The
Gambia inNovember 2007 to review project results and met with over 50 interlocutors
including officials o f the central and local governments, members o f the national
assembly, municipal councilors, consultants, contractors, community leaders and other
beneficiaries. The IEGmission traveled to Banjul, Kanifing, Brikama, Basse,
Janjanbureh, Kerewan and Mansakonko councils and visited 33 out o fthe 79 sub-projects
completed underthe project including roads, markets, car parks, water supply projects,
schools and the solid waste dumpsite inBakoteh. IEG gratefully acknowledges the
courtesies and attention given by all these interlocutors, as well as the excellent planning
and logistical support received from The Gambian Agency for the Management o f Public
Works (Gamworks), the Department o f State for Local Government and Lands
(DoSLGL), and the Bank's country office inBanjul.

IEGselected this project for a PPAR field assessment, as recommendedat the ICR
Reviewstage, to verify outcomes andprovide aninputinto IEG's ongoing special study
into municipal management.

Following standard IEGprocedures, copies o f the draft PPAR were sent to government
officials and agencies for their review and comments. Their comments are presented in
Annex B.

Summary

The Gambia i s one o f the smallest countries inAfrica, and also one o f its poorest with
more than 60 percent o f its 1.6 million inhabitants living inpoverty. Rural to urban
migration i s high. More than 53 percent o fthis population now lives inurban areas.
Rapid urbanizationhas increased pressure for more basic infrastructure.

According to the development credit agreement (DCA), The Gambia Poverty Alleviation
and Capacity BuildingProject (Cr.3 176) hadthree objectives, namely: (A) to reduce the
backlog o f public infrastructure and assets and improve their maintenance; (B) to
alleviate poverty through the creation o f temporary jobs, and (C) to strengthen the
technical and managerial capacity of local government authorities (LGAs), local private
construction firms, local consulting firms and The Gambian Agency for the Management
o f Public Works (Gamworks-the project implementing agency). Clarity o f purpose
sufferedfurther when a mid-2005 amendment ledto ostensibly "new" objectives, which
were essentially re-drafts o fthe original ones. The "new" ones underscored the original
Objectives' intent, while (A) gave more emphasis to the demand-driven approach to
infrastructure provision, (B) remained unchanged, and (C) focused more narrowly upon
municipalities and their finances. Despite this the objectives o f the project remain
substantially relevant to both country and Bank priorities inThe Gambia.

To achieve the objectives, the project deliveredphysical investments inroads, markets,
car parks, water supply, solid waste management, electricity, and education ineight local
council areas throughout the country. A capacity building component provided training
and technical assistance to local municipalities and to Gamworks. This project design
was modestly relevant. It included investment, capacity building and studies components
that could all indeed contribute to meeting the objectives. But the design did not include
an effective means to monitor and evaluate project achievements.

Indeed, project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) i s rated negligible. The initial M&E
designwas very weak, notably with no explicit baseline data or targets for poverty
alleviation-a   strikingomission for a project with "poverty alleviation" inits name.
Beneficiary assessments and external consultant assignments provided some information,
but not always data relatedto the project achievements.
Despite nearly on-time effectiveness, disbursementwas only at 50 percent o f target by
the mid-termreview (MTR) inMay 2001, After that, implementation stalled again
following a management crisis at Gamworks, triggered by the unlawfil removal and
replacement o f its Director General. With that problem resolved, the pace o f
implementation accelerated rapidly and the original credit was fully disbursed by 2005.
This opened the way for an expansion ofthe project and for the Supplementary Credit.

By providing infrastructurethrough stronger municipalities, the project did help improve
the living conditions o f 378,000 urban residents, above the targeted 360,000, according to
Gamwork's figures. The efficacy o f achieving objective (A) o f reducing the infrastructure
backlog and improving maintenance was modest. The project helpedfinance additional

                                               X


infrastructure, but provided no evidence on the clearance o f existing infrastructure
deficits that the operation intended to reduce.
Alleviating poverty through temporary job creation, objective (B) was substantially
achieved through the creation of 29,275 personmonths o f employment for unskilled
labor (presumed to be poor) exceeding the 27,000 revisedtarget (itself considerably
higher than the original 20,000 appraisal target). Butthe extent to which this resulted in
mediumandlong-term poverty reduction is unknown.
Objective (C), strengthening the financial, technical and managerial capacity o f LGAs
(including the 2005 municipal resource mobilization variant), local contractors and
consultants and Gamworks was substantially achieved. Municipalrevenues rose by 9
percent per annum over 2000-2006 inreal terms, well above the intended targets o f 5-6
percent. At their own request, 367 staff o f local consultants and contractors were trained
through the project, well above the 240 expected. Altogether 70 percent o f the
competitively bidworks contracts under this project were awarded to local firms.
Gamworks itself became a stronger, more open agency thanks to intense project training
andproject support. Itwas able to surviveandremaineffective after anunforeseeable
crisis inits leadership.
Overall, the outcome o f the project i s ratedmoderately satisfactory, as there were
moderate shortcomings inthe achievement o f the objectives o f this operation. On
balance, efficacy i s ratedsubstantial especially through temporary job creation to
alleviate poverty and strengthening the managerial capacity o f local governments.
Efficiency i s ratedmodest;higheconomic rates o f returnwere reported for roads
subprojects and are likely for some other sub-projects for which IEG saw evidence o f a
buoyant demand. But project implementation itself was less efficient as delays and
extensions added considerably to project administration costs.
The Riskto Development Outcome is ratedsignificant because o f lack o f funding
mechanisms to continue to reduce the infrastructure backlog into the future on the one
hand, and stronger LGA finances on the other, while continuing poverty alleviation from
temporary employment creation has ended as far as this operation i s concerned.
Bank Performance is ratedModerately Satisfactory, through project design work that
failed to incorporate M&E, and inconsistent project objectives inproject and legal
documents raising doubts about the precise purpose o f this operation, shortcomings that
were partly overcome during supervision. Borrower Performance was Moderately
Satisfactory, mainly because implementing agencies were able to effectively manage a
diverseportfolio o f investments, meet implementationtargets, and Government
maintained its support, but only after a slow start and a subsequent leadership crisis in
Gamworks ,(itself an indicator o f weak Borrower performance).
The assessmentpoints to the following lessons:

0   Where local government lacks the experience inhandling works contracts, a
    specialized agency such as Gamworks can provide the contract management services
    needed for the local delivery o f infrastructure and urbanservices. Creating a single
    core group o f specialists within such an agency makesparticular sense ina small
    country with highattrition rates among local government staff.

                                              xi


0 When project objectives focus on directly assisting the poor, the project designshould
  facilitate identifying the poor clients and their priority needs as.well as sound M&Eto
  monitor the progress o f poverty alleviation. The Bank i s ina good position to deploy
  technical expertise for this purpose inthe Gambia by drawing from its extensive
  global experience inthis area.

0 When municipal technical capacity and resources to maintain asphalt roads i s limited,
  sub-project investments should consider engineering designs such as interlocking
  paving blocks, which requireminimal maintenance.

0 Also when LGA technical capacity i s weak, municipalities need more technical
  assistance and training for staff at all levels. Service staff can hone basic technical
  skills such as those needed for maintenance and record keeping, for instance. At the
  leadership level, training o f LGA managers and councilors can help make them more
  aware o f the need for planning and budgetingo f municipal services.

million. InWest Africa, it occupies a 25-50 km strip o f land along both banks o f 350 kmo f
The Gambia River.The economy is predominantly agricultural and untilthe late 1 9 9 0 was    ~ ~
susceptible to external shocks such as drought and commodity price shifts, particularly o f
groundnutsthe main product. Agriculture still accounts for about 33 percent o f GDP and an
estimated 75 percent o f employment. Since 2003 the country has achieved a real GDP
growth averaging 6.4 percent per year, helped by incipient tourism, construction, and
telecommunications sectors. GDP per capita, measured interms o f purchasingpower parity
(PPP) at US$l,110 in2006, significantly below the Sub-Saharan Africa average o f
US$1,681.

1.2         Despite this strong economic growth inrecent years, The Gambia remains among
the poorest countries inthe World, and ranks 155 out o f 177 countries inthe UNDP Human
Development Index (HDI).According to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of
2006, more than 60 percent o f the population i s poor. Poverty i s prevalent inboth urban and
rural areas-affecting    57 percent and 63 percent o f the respective populations. It varies
considerably across the country's diverseregions from a rate o f 10 percent o f the population
inthe capital city Banjul, to as muchas 92 percent inthe country's least urbanized Kuntaur
area inthe central river division (details Annex C).

1.3         Many years o f increasing rural to urbanmigration have ledto 53.9 percent o f The
Gambia's population living inurbanareas today, compared to about 37 percent a decade ago.
Immigration from neighboring countries has also contributed to the highurbanization rate.
Nearly all o f this urbanpopulation i s concentrated inthe Local Government Areas (LGA) o f
the capital Banjul, and inneighboring Kanifing and Brikama.

1.4         Administratively, The Gambia i s divided into eight LGAswhich comprise o f a
city council (Banjul), a municipal council (Kanifing) and 6 area councils. After many years
o f what can be termed "decentralization by default", the quality o f government services
declined dramatically and those o f non-governmental organizations took their place.
Decentralization was eventually formalized by the Local Government Act o f 2002 and the
Local Government Finance and Audit Act o f 2004. These Acts devolved the responsibility
for providing many public services from the Government o f The Gambia (GOTG) to the
LGAs.However, there has been little tangible progress inimplementingthese laws as
GOTG's Departmentso f State continue to decide sector policy, including allocation o f
resources and responsibilities (IMF, 2006:6). Inmany sectors, including health, education,
water resources and road infrastructure, the formal powers o f LGA councils are not
acknowledgedinpractice by some central government departments.As a consequence,
LGAs still exert little influence inthe definition o fpolicy inthese areas (Government of The
Gambia, 2006).

1.5         The World Bankhas beenactive inThe Gambia since 1970, and IDA has
financed 31 projects there through credits totaling some US$296 million equivalent to date.
The Gambia Poverty Alleviation andCapacity BuildingProject (PACAB Cr. 3176) assessed

                                                 2


inthis report is a follow-on project to The GambiaPublic Works and Capacity Building
Project (Cr.2554-GM, FY94- FY98), rated Satisfactory by IEG. The Bank i s one among
more than 15 active donors inThe Gambia. Inan effort to help coordinate donor activity in
the country, the Bank finalized a Joint Assistance Strategy for The Gambia inpartnership
with the African Development Bank inFebruary, 2008.

2. Objectives and Design

2.1         According to the project's Development Credit Agreement (DCA), which
provides the clearer formulation, this operation, knownby its acronym "PACAB", had three
objectives: (A) to reduce the backlog o f public infrastructure assets, and improve their
maintenance; (B) to alleviate poverty through creation o f temporary jobs; and (C) to
strengthen the financial, technical and managerial capacity o f LGAs, local private
construction firms, local consulting firms and The Gambian Agency for the Management o f
Public Works-Gamworks,         the project executing agency (Box 1.)Less clearly, the PAD
describes how the project also aimed to achieve the "sustainable provision" of infrastructure
and to develop an "enabling environment" for municipal investment financing and
employment creation. IEG's assessment, as the ICR's, is based upon the better focused D C A
formulation o f the objectives and upon the subsequent amendment (see below).

2.2         As a Supplementary Credit o fUS$4.0 millionwas approvedinmid-2005, so too
were the projects revised. But the "revision" consisted o f minor re-drafting o fthe original
objectives (A) and (C). Inthe words o f theAgreement Amending the Development Credit
Agreement, the two "new" objectives were: "provision o fpublic infrastructure and services
based on demand and on fulfillment o f clearly defined criteria" and "implementation o f a
capacity building program aimed at improving the LGA's resource mobilization and
management". The processing o f the amendment was heavy, but the changes were very light.

2.3         For all the difficulties informulation and revision, the project objectives are
substantiallyrelevant to the infrastructureprovision and employment generation priorities o f
the Government ofThe Gambia (GOTG) and Bank strategy inthe country. Reducingthe
backlog o f public infrastructure, the focus o f Objectives A, supports one o f the five pillars o f
GOTG's current PRSP, known as the Strategy for Poverty Alleviation-to         provide for more
o f the unmet basic needs o f the poor. Similarly, the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) o f 2003 and the Joint Assistance Strategy finalized in2008, focus on enhancing equity
and the quality o fpublic services. The employment creation focus o f Objective B supports
the PRSP pillar enhancing the productive capacity o fthe poor. Strengthening LGAs and the
local construction industry supports the CAS focus on promoting private sector growth and
also building LGA capacity, the latter part o fthe CAS priority o f strengtheningpublic
expenditure management.

2.4           The project designis ratedmodestly relevant. Onthe positive side, the design
included investment and institutional components o f the type needed to achieve the project
objectives, on the other hand, the relevance of the design was weakened by a poor M&E.
Individual subprojects under the investments component (which accounted for more than 70
percent o f appraisal estimates) had not been identified up-front at the design stage. Instead,
LGAswere to choose from a menuo feligible sub-projects (e.g. water, roads andmarkets
focused upon the poor with the largest possible number o f end-user beneficiaries). While the
project components were not changed by the 2005 Amendment, the scope o f each one was
increased.

2.5         The design o f the ImplementationArrangements recognized the limitedcapacity
inThe Gambiafor LGAsto execute the necessary works bythemselves. The arrangements
gave responsibility for implementationto central level institutions such as Gamworks and the
Department o f State for Local Government and Lands (DoSLGL), whose Permanent
Secretary acts as deputy chairman o f Gamworks' highlevel Steering Committee. The
chairman i s the Permanent Secretary o f the Department o f State for Finance and Economic
Affairs. Project implementationresponsibility was Gamworks', through a "delegated
management" framework, typical o f AGETIP arrangements found inneighboring countries.
Created in 1993, Gamworks i s an independent, non governmental and non-profit agency that
has important experience o f other IDA-fundedprojects. By locating project implementation
withinsuch an existingagency with proven capacity, PACAB also avoided a recurring
problem inThe Gambia: how to reintegrate special project implementing units (PIUs) back
into the formal government system upon implementation completion.

3. Implementationand Costs
3.1         Despite almost on-time effectiveness, the project got off to a slow start disbursing
only US$2 million by June 2000 when US$5.4 million had been expected by then. However,
the targets were overly ambitious given the context. Inparticular, the priority investment
programs (PIPS) which were the basis for identifyingsubprojects inLGAs, could only be
prepared well into project implementation itself. The project was restructuredat mid-term
review inNovember 2001,to speed implementation by reducingthe number o f subprojects
from 110to 75.Almost immediately after, however, project implementationstalled for
almost two-years due to a leadership crisis at Gamworks, triggered by the allegedly unlawful
removal o f its Director General. By April 2004, with the establishment o f a new management
team at Gamworks acceptable to both GOTG and the Bank, project implementation resumed
and accelerated rapidly. Through a 2005 Amendment the Bank approved a Supplemental
Credit o f US$4 million. This required further extendingthe project closing date to 2006,
thereby accumulating a delay o f three years.

3.2         PACAB's implementationarrangements worked well inThe Gambian context. In
particular, the Project Coordinating Unitlocated inDoSLGL helpedLGAs better understand
and accept Gamworks' activities. Most subprojects were implemented inthe three urban
LGAs of Banjul,Kanifing and Brikama, but some others were infar-flung LGAs such as
Basse and Mansakonko. Gamworks hiredthe contractors and supervision consultants to
implement the project through competitive tenders inaccordance with Bankprocurement
guidelines. Overall, more than 70 percent o f subprojects were awarded to local contractors,
thereby helping to build local capacity. Where local contractor knowledge and experience
was unavailable, such as for asphalting roads, for instance, contract packages were bundled
together inorder to attract international firms, some o f which were awarded the contracts.
There i s no evidence to suggest that local contractors' costs were significantly different from
foreign firms. What local firms lacked ineconomies o f scale, they made up through the
efficient use o f local labor-intensivemethods that they were familiar with.

3.3         Safeguards: IEGfound no evidence o f a lack o f compliance with Bank
safeguards duringproject implementation. Most sub-projects-particularly      road and street

                                                 5


paving, drainage, water supply and solid waste management-made          positive contributions to
the environment, for instance. Solid waste disposal, a sensitive environmental issue inmost
cities, was not contentious inthis project as it focused upon improving the operations o f a
site already inuse. Indeedthese sub-projects helped reduce environmental hazards from
uncontrolled dumpingfor its surrounding residential urban neighborhood. Through
rehabilitating existing infrastructure and services safeguard issues relatedto involuntary
resettlement and deforestationdid not arise.


4. Monitoring and Evaluation

4.1         The initial M&E designwas very weak. It had no explicit baseline data or targets
for poverty alleviation-a   strikingomission for a project with "poverty alleviation" inits
name. Project M&E offered only two unclear indicators to measure progress inachieving
three different project objectives. Neither one was appropriate. For example, performance in
relation to creating an enabling environment for employment creation and income generation
was to be assessedby looking at "the production o f guidance to local authorities that they
approach investment designand realizationwith the objective of mobilizing local firms and
contractors.. .". Achieving the objective o f improving the living conditions o f the urban
population and the poor inparticular, was to be assessedby the M&E simply counting the
number o fpriority investment plans adopted by the LGAs (PAD p.25). At the mid-term
review, the M&E design was revisedandnew, more appropriate indicators, such as the
increase inresource mobilization by LGAs, were identified.However, the lack o f baseline
data regarding access to public infrastructure and facilities was not rectified, leaving the
before- or after- project situations undocumented.

4.2         The effective implementationand utilization o f M&E was preventedby
inadequate information on reductions of service deficits andthe share o f the poor among the
beneficiaries. Beneficiary assessments and external consultant assignments provided some
additional data, but not always related to project achievements.

4.3         Inutilizing the M&E, external consultants carried out a number o fbeneficiary and
impact assessments that provided considerable data, going some way toward filling some
gaps inthe original M&E framework. Data was collected through key person interviews with
LGA staff and focus group discussions withbeneficiaries. Some data collected by project
staff, such as on employment, hadto be extensively cleaned by external consultants. A final
impact study found that responsiveness o f subproject selection to community needs -an
issue identifiedthrough these assessments-had improved during the second half o f the
project (ADCO, 2006:51). Other results are not so persuasive. For instance, the Borrower
ICR informs that "the project was able to provide 399,000 persons with access to at least one
sub-project which i s a clear indication o f poverty alleviation" (Borrower's ICR, p.8).

Municipality told the IEGmission that only about one third o f the solid waste produced
locally i s collected and disposed o f at the site inBakoteh.

5.2          The project had some success inimproving the maintenance ofbasic
infrastructure. InLGAs, separate operation and maintenance (O&M) accounts were created
to provide additional funds for maintaining PACAB-provided infrastructure. However, while
all LGAs have O&M budgetlines inplace, the LGAs face constraints o f equipmentand
technical experience inundertaking the necessary maintenance work. They only have
comprehensive maintenance plans for revenue generating infrastructure, such as marketsand
car parks. As a result, these facilities are generally well maintained. Other project
infrastructure, mainly pavedroads, i s already showing signs o f severe wear and tear. Kayupa
Street (1.2 km, approximate cost US$0.9 million) inKanifing, which was completed less
than one year ago, i s already almost impassable due to large potholes inthe middle o f the
roadway. On Perseverance Street (0.8km) also inBanjul, large potholes inthe middleo fthe
street are covered with old tires to prevent people from falling into them. The use o f
interlocking concrete paving blocks inBanjul city addressed the limitedmaintenance
capacity inLGAs because this method required limited and low cost maintenance. Overall,
however, most LGAs still do not have comprehensive maintenance plans inplace. InBanjul
City Council for example forward-looking preventative roadmaintenance i s not carried out.
It is mainly done after officials see that a road surface is already broken.

B.ALLEVIATEPOVERTY THROUGH CREATIONOFTEMPORARYJOBS
5.3          Substantially achievedthrough temporarily creating 29,725 personmonths o f
unskilled work (presumedto be for the poor) exceeding the revisedtarget o f 27,000 (itself
raised from the appraisal target o f 20,000 when additional funding was made available by the
Supplemental Credit). On average, employment was provided for 5-6 months. Local
contractors told the IEGmissionthat they do try to reemploy the same workers on later jobs.
There i s however no concrete evidence to show that provision o f such employment has ledto
medium or long-term changes inpoverty, but doing so was beyondthe stated objective o f
this operation. The 2005 beneficiary assessment interviews (conducted with community
members employed for PACAB subprojects) identified a number o f other benefits o f the
program. These included the opportunity for beneficiaries to earn additional income, learn
new skills and accessto newjob opportunities, allowing themto purchase food, pay
children's school fees and generally improve their living conditions (SAHEL. 2005:34).

c.STRENGTHEN        CAPACITY OF LGAS,LOCAL          CONTRACTORS, CONSULTANTSAND
GAMWORKS
5.4          Substantially achievedoverall, with details as follows:

5.5          LGAs: Thanks inpart to the project, local finances are now stronger and better
managed. Municipal revenues rose inreal terms by 9 percent per annum over the 2000-2006
period, well above the project targets o f 5-6 percent. Other LGA revenues, such as annual
market fees also rose. InKerewan, for instance, they increased from US$4,000 in2000 to
US$200,000 in2006. As mentioned earlier, LGAs assisted by PACAB established and
funded special O&M accounts, where there hadbeennone beforethe project. This was made
possible through-project provision o ftraining and technical assistance infinancial

                                                   8


management especially. About 100 days o f training were provided to about 240 staff inthe 8
LGAs incomputer literacy, financial management and O&M of LGA assets (details Annex
F).Some ofthese skills, notably computer literacy, have beenusedto improve LGA
accounting generally. However, ina number o f cases insufficient staff were available to take
the training to fillthe numberofplaces offered bythe courses. Inrural LGAsthese skills are
still in short supply due to high attrition rates. The project also provided desks and chairs for
LGA treasury departments, and motor cycles for revenuecollectors, which are largely still in
use. Local officials noted that having basic facilities improved their working environment
and productivity. PACAB also provided 1-2 computers per LGA and basic computer
training, but the effective use o f computers remains limited to the more advanced LGAs such
as Kanifingwhich has its own computer lab. LGAs also received some training from project
external consultants for Revenue IncreasingAction Plans, physical, management and
financial audits as well as aerial mapping o f their areas. Most o f it went to central
government staff inDoSLGL, however. The IEGmission could see the greater impact upon
GOTG agencies and the more limited LGA results.

5.6         Contractors and Consultants: The number o f private contracting and consulting
companies able to provide quality works inThe Gambia has increased. The PACAB
experience provided them with opportunities to bid for (and sometimes win) contracts ina
transparent manner.Under the project, 29 days o f training were provided to 367 staff such as
clerks o f works and foremen from construction firms. The actual enrolment was well above
the 240 expected. The firms themselves reportedthe sessions to be useful andrelevant. In
addition, project workshops were organized through the Gambian Association o f
Construction Contractors (GACCON). There are now about 15 consultancy firms active in
infrastructure planning and design inThe Gambia. Most o f these firms get their business
from Gamworks, still their biggest client. The firms appreciated the openness o f the
procurement process and the timely decisions (and eventual payments!) as positive outcomes
o f PACAB that have helped their own development. However some private firms,
particularly inrural areas such as Farafenni, are finding it difficult to stay inbusiness. Under
PACAB itself 70 percent o f the competitively bid works contracts under the project were
awarded to local firms, a much higher share than under earlier externally funded projects in
the Gambia.

5.7         Gamworks: As a result o f the project, this formerly introspective agency
developed a more overt approach to its partners and its work, openly marketing its products
and services to municipalities and publishinga regular newsletter about its activities.
PACAB provided Gamworks with substantial training, technical assistance and financial
support. With a complement o fjust 20 staff, Gamworks received 427 days o f training, some
overseas, ina number o f skill areas such as procurement, project management, financial
management, office management, development o f a management information system (MIS)
and use o f related software, communications. By implementingtwo IDA projects back-to-
back, Gamworks has developedto the level that it now generates its own concept notes to
source new fundingfor public infrastructure projects inThe Gambia. Additionally, the
ongoing support o f the Bank to Gamworks during its leadership crisis in2004 helped to
strengthen the agency as an independent institution.

EFFICIENCY
5.8          The project was fully implemented within the overall cost envelope established at
appraisal, an efficient result, but one that was underminedthe three-year delay incompletion.
This delay helps explain the 66 percent overrun o f Gamworks' costs inproject administration
(Box 1). On the project's investment side, all sub-projects hadto achieve a minimum
estimated economic rate o f return(ERR) o f 12 percent. At completion, high ex-post ERRs in
the 34-42 percent range were estimated for project road investments accounting for one
quarter o f total project costs. But no ERR estimates were reported for other sub-projects in
markets, water supply, electricity and solid waste accounting for 60 percent o f total costs and
that are equally amenable to cost benefit analysis. Since the worksheets and other data were
not available locally, IEGwas unable to either verify the analysis behind the reported ERRs,
or make first-time ERR estimates where previously there had beennone. Duringvisits to the
sites o f these sub-projects, the IEG mission could observe their intensiveuse, inferring the
existence o f a strong demand needed to drive a good rate o f return.

5.9          Temporary employment generation was more efficiently provided than expected.
Overall, 49 percent morejobs were created than expected at appraisal through the execution
o f project works, while actual funding for them increased only 25 percent. There i s also
evidence that project costs were kept under control. An impact assessment conducted for
Gamworks in2006 found that the unit costs o f PACAB subprojects, while maintaining good
quality finishing, completion and detailing, were lower than those o f similar non-PACAB
projects (ADCO Development Consultancy, 2006: 12). This result supports Gamworks' other
finding reportedearlier inthis PPARthat local contractors were as efficient as foreign firms
as they were able to compete on price with them for works contracts.

6. Ratings

0UTC0ME
6.1          Project outcome i s rated moderatelysatisfactory, because there were moderate
shortcomings inthe achievement o f the objectives o f this operation. Thus, project
infrastructure achieved service improvements and better maintenance, but how this reduced
the "backlog" to be cleared i s not evident. As intended,the project provided temporary jobs
for poverty alleviation-indeed     at a 49 percent higher level than targeted. The most
significant project improvement, with substantial efficacy, came from strengthening the
management capacity o f LGAs.As noted earlier, efficacy inachieving the infrastructure and
emergency employment objectives was modest. Overall, project efficacy inachieving its
objectives i s rated substantiaL On balance, efficiency i s rated modest, beingstronger inthe
provision o f road investments and temporary employment, and weaker inadministration and
implementation o f the project itself.

RISKTO DEVELOPMENTOUTCOME
6.2           This risk is ratedas Signzjjcant.For continuing inthe future to reduce the
infrastructure and service backlog, the project did not provide any long-term financing
mechanism to help overcome GOTG's and LGA's inherent budgetweaknesses for
investment inthese areas. Onthe other hand LGAs did establish and fund O&M accounts
that can help them pay for ongoing maintenance o f their existing infrastructure endowments.
Evenwith money available though, several LGAsinThe Gambia still needs to improve their
technical services for maintenance and acquire more o f the necessary equipment. On the
employment side, the risks to continuing poverty alleviation are obviously high, as further
inroads depend upon greater budgetary allocations for more labor-intensive works than the
fiscal constraints o f GOTG might permit.The financial risk i s lower on the LGA side o f this
project, particularly buildingon the revenue gains already made. But outside the larger urban
LGAs such as Kanifingand Brikama, technical andmanagerialaspects o fLGA capacity
remain limited.

BANKPERFORMANCE
6.3           BankPerformanceis ratedModerately Satisfactory. Project design, while
incorporating relevant objectives and components needed to achieve them, would have been
stronger (and clearer) with consistent objective statements inthe D C A and PAD. Inevitably,
the differences raised doubts about the purpose and direction o fthis operation. Nor was
M&Eadequately incorporatedinto the design, leaving itunable to measure progress in
reducing The Gambia's infrastructure deficit and inpoverty alleviation, two key project
objectives. The project implementation arrangements, on the other hand, were appropriate
taking into account the country context and its management capacity constraints. Bank
supervision was effective inidentifying and partly correcting some design issues at mid-term
review and also inretaining the project focus on development effectiveness during and after
the Gamworks' leadership crisis. The Bank's firm stand during the crisis has helpedto
strengthenGamworks' independence and effectiveness inthe long term.

BORROWERPERFORMANCE
6.4         The performance o f the Borrower and the implementingagencies i s rated
Moderately Satisfactory. Gamworks as the implementation agency was able to manage a
diverse portfolio o f works by contractors with varying levels o f capacity, but only after a
slow start and further interruptions caused by its management crisis. O nthe other hand,
GOTG support varied over the life o f the project, with strong support to complete the project
once the management crisis at Gamworks was resolved. Of course, allowing this crisis to
erupt and fester for so long i s itself a shortcoming o f Borrower performance.

7. Findingsand Lessons

   Where local government lacks the experience inhandling works contracts, a specialized
   agency such as Gamworks can provide the contract management services needed for the
   local delivery o f infrastructure and urban services. Creating a single core group o f
   specialists within such an agency makes particular sense ina small country with high
   attrition rates among local government staff.

   Whenproject objectives focus on directly assisting the poor, the project designshould
   facilitate identifyingthe poor clients and their priority needs as well as sound M&Eto
   monitor the progress o f poverty alleviation. The Bank i s ina good position to deploy
   technical expertise for this purpose inthe Gambia by drawing from its extensive global
   experience inthis area.

   Whenmunicipal technical capacity and resources to maintainasphalt roads is limited, ,
   sub-project investments should consider engineering designs such as interlockingpaving
   blocks, which requireminimal maintenance.

   Also when LGA technical capacity is weak, municipalities needmore technical
   assistance and training for staff at all levels. Service staff can hone basic technical skills
   such as those needed for maintenance and record keeping, for instance. At the leadership
   level, training o f LGA managers and councilors can help make them more aware o f the
   need for planningand budgeting o f municipal services.

 Bank Comments

 Project outcome is rated moderately satisfactory, because there were
 moderate shortcomings in the achievement of the objectives of this
 operation. Thus project infrastructure achieved service improvements and           .
 better maintenance, but how this reduced the "backlog" to be cleared is not
 evident ......
 Borrower Comments          .

 The review misses the point that the backlog was due to the demand from
 the preceeding project, the Public Works and Capacity Building Project
 (PWCBP). Due to the fact that there were more than I00 sub-projects that
 were priority and were qualified for funding from PWCBP but were shelved
 due to limited funds in the old project, then it became necessary for the
 PACABP as a follow-up project to reduce this backlog. This review is not
 taking this backdrop into consideration that PACABP was a follow-up on
 PWCBP to consolidate the gains made previously.

 Having done 79 priority sub-projects really has reduced the backlog
'significantly and this objective of reducing backlog on public infrastructure
 has been significantly achieved.

 If the above comments are taken into consideration, one could say that the
 Projectoutcome should be rated Satisfactory.

Annex D: Eligibility Criteria for Sub-projects

Original EligibilityCriteria (PAD)

A. Guiding Principles
1, For the PACB Project, it is recommended that sub-projects to be financed using proceeds of the IDA Credit
satisfy inter alia the following requirements. They should:
     (0        be targeted towards increasing the service levels in the basic infrastructure services that contribute
               to the improved quality of living in the communities    -- which,in turn, will increase the population's
               confidence in the ability of local government, and their willingness to pay for the services delivered;
     (ii)       have the largest possible number of end-user beneficiaries;
     (iii)     target (wherever possible) lower income group beneficiaries;
     (iv)      be designed in such a way that their delivery be labor-intensive and provide maximum employment
               opportunities within sound economic parameters; and
     (VI        be designed so that their future operation and maintenance (O&M) be sustainable.

B. Eligibility Criteria for subprojects
2. To satisfy the requirement "i"above, the sub-project should include the provision (or
rehabilitation) of one of the basic infrastructure services defined below:
    0          Water Supply;
    0          Facilities (e.g. markets) for the acquisition of basic necessities (e.9. food);
     0         Access/mobility (roads and footpaths);
    0          Human waste disposal (sewerage);
    0          Solid waste management;
     0         Storm water drainage;
     0         Safety Lighting.

Source: Project Appraisal Document

Eligibility Criteria after updating at mid-term review

To be eligible, a sub-project shall meet the following criteria
