Some lessons learned\n            included: when project objectives focus on directly\n            assisting the poor, the project design should facilitate\n            identifying the poor clients and their priority needs as\n            well as sound monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to monitor\n            the progress of poverty alleviation. The Bank is in a good\n            position to deploy technical expertise for this purpose in\n            the Gambia by drawing from its extensive global experience\n            in this area. When municipal technical capacity and\n            resources to maintain asphalt roads is limited, sub-project\n            investments should consider engineering designs such as\n            interlocking paving blocks, which require minimal\n            maintenance. Also when Local Government Authority (LGA)\n            technical capacity is weak, municipalities need more\n            technical assistance and training for staff at all levels.\n            Service staff can hone basic technical skills such as those\n            needed for maintenance and record keeping, for instance. At\n            the leadership level, training of LGA managers and\n            councilors can help make them more aware of the need for\n            planning and budgeting of municipal services."}, "docdt": "2009-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
