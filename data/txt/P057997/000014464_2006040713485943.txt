“SCHEDULE 5 
Special Account 
1. 
For the purposes of this Schedule: 
 (a) 
the term “eligible Categories” means the Categories set forth in the table in 
paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; 
 
(b) 
the term “eligible expenditures” means expenditures in respect of the reasonable 
cost of goods, works and services required for the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds 
of the Credit allocated from time to time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the 
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and 
 
(c) 
the term “Authorized Allocation” means an amount equivalent to $1,200,000 in 
respect of Special Account A to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited into 
Special Account A pursuant to paragraph 3(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless 
the Association shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an amount 
equivalent to $600,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Credit Account plus 
the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association pursuant 
to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of 
SDR1,000,000.    
2. 
Payments out of Special Account A shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures in 
accordance with the provisions of this Schedule. 
3. 
After the Association has received evidence satisfactory to it that Special Account A has 
been duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to 
replenish Special Account A shall be made as follows: 
 
(a) 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower shall furnish to the 
Association a request or requests for deposit into the Special Account A of an amount or amounts 
which do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such 
request or requests, the Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit 
Account and deposit into Special Account A such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have 
requested. 
 
(b) 
(i) 
For replenishment of Special Account A, the Borrower shall furnish to 
 
the Association requests for deposits into Special Account A at such 
 
intervals as the Association shall specify. 
 
(ii) 
Prior to or at the time of each such request, the Borrower shall furnish to 
 
the Association the documents and other evidence required pursuant to 
 
paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of  
Page  10
-
9
-
which replenishment is requested. On the basis of each such request, the 
 
Association shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Credit 
 
Account and deposit into Special Account A such amount as the 
 
Borrower shall have requested and as shall have been shown by said 
 
documents and other evidence to have been paid out of Special Account 
 
A
for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the 
 
Association from the Credit Account under the respective eligible 
 
Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been 
 
justified by said documents and other evidence. 
4. 
For each payment made by the Borrower out of Special Account A, the Borrower shall, at 
such time as the Association shall reasonably request, furnish to the Association such documents 
and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively for eligible expenditures. 
5. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Schedule, the Association shall not 
be required to make further deposits into Special Account A: 
 
(a) 
if, at any time, the Association shall have determined that all further withdrawals 
should be made by the Borrower directly from the Credit Account in accordance with the 
provisions of Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this 
Agreement; 
 
(b) 
if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the Association, within the period 
of time specified in Section 4.01 (b)(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be 
furnished to the Association pursuant to said Section in respect of the audit of the records and 
accounts for Special Account A; 
 
(c) 
if, at any time, the Association shall have notified the Borrower of its intention to 
suspend in whole or in part the right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit 
Account pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General Conditions; or 
 
(d) 
once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to the eligible 
Categories for Special Account A minus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments 
entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to 
the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation. 
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of the 
Credit allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Association shall 
specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the 
extent that the Association shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in 
Special Account A as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible 
expenditures. 
6. 
(a) 
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any payment out of 
Special Account A: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Association, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Association: (A) provide such 
Page  11
-
10
-
additional evidence as the Association may request; or (B) deposit into Special Account A (or, if 
the Association shall so request, refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount of 
such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Association shall 
otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Association into Special Account A shall be made until 
the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be. 
 
(b) 
If the Association shall have determined at any time that any amount outstanding 
in Special Account A will not be required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the 
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association such 
outstanding amount. 
 
(c) 
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Association, refund to the Association all 
or any portion of the funds on deposit in Special Account A. 
 
(d) 
Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a), (b) and (c) of this 
Schedule shall be credited to the Credit Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, includ
ing the General Conditions.”
