REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation   on a proposed
loan of IB$23 million equivalent *and a development credit of US$20 million
equivalent to the Republic of Korea to help finance an education project.
The proceeds of the loan/credit would be lent to the Government for a term
of 30 years including 10 years of grace, with interest at 7½ percent per
annum for the US$23 million equivalent loan and on standard IDA terms for
the.US$20 million equivalent credit.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report ("The Economic Situation and Prospects
of the Republic of Korea", EAP-33a, distributed under cover of R72-243,
dated November 9, 1972) comments on Korea's commendable achievement in
economic development, particularly since the middle of the 1960's, and notes
that Korea's economy is in transition from a pattern of high investment and
growth to one of more moderate growth and greater stability. The most
important feature of the transitional phase has been a slowdown in economic
activity since the middle of 1971, partly as a result of the governmentis
stabilization policy. GNP growth in 1972 was 7.9 percent compared with the
average 11.4 percent in the previous five years. The 1972 growth rate was
the lowest since 1966, mainly because of slower expansion of industrial
production (16 percent, compared with the average 21 percent during the
previous five year period), and a downturn in investment (which was 5 percent
less than in 1971).
3.        The government's stabilization efforts, particularly the neasures
taken last August to stop inflation and to moderate the disruptive financial
impacts of the slowdown on Korea's industrial sector, seem to be working
successfully to bring about a favorable environment for stable growth.
Prices have been stable since last August, compared to increases of 13 per-
cent in 1971 and Og percent in 1972.   Recent international currency revalu-
ations may, however, cause some unavoidable upward pressure, but this
should not jeopardize basic price stabilization provided the government
continues to follow its stabilization program. Signs of recovery in
industrial production and investment were visible towards the end of 1972
and a somewhat higher pace of economic expansion is expected for 1973.
The external trading environment also seems favorable and is expected to
accommodate expansion without a recurrence of balance of payments
difficulties.
4.        Two aspects of stabilization policy require continued emphasis in
the future. First, domestic savings mobilization which has emerged as a



major constraint on future economic development, must be pursued with vigor.
In the process of economic slowdown in the past two years the savings ratio
dropped from 18 percent in 1969-70 to 14½ percent. Undoubtedly it will
recover somewhat this year, as the pace of business activity accelerates,
but long-run improvement depends very much on further refinement of the
financial system, particularly the development of capital markets and, more
important, continued success in controlling inflation. The government is
already making valuable contributions to this end through a restrained 1973
budget and through measures aimed at improving and diversifying savings
instruments. Second, in the light of the expected investment revival, it
is important to keep overall investment under restraint for some time to
come so that the objectives of the stabilization poLicies are not jeopardized.
The government's investment policy for 1973 takes this into account and
emphasizes increases in agricultural and manufacturing investment while
restraining investment in social overhead and services. In view of the need
to strengthen further the industrial structure and also to correct urban/
rural incomae disparities through increased rural development, this investment
policy stance is appropriate and should be maintained.
5.        If the economy is managed along the lines discussed above, a
gradual but definite improvement in the balance of payments can be expected
in the coming years. With strong import demands from the United States and
Japan - Korea's major export markets - exports increased by about 40 percent
in 1972. They are expected to continue to expand rapidly in 1973, although
perhaps not at the 1972 rate. A larger and more diversified industrial
sector will be able to provide the needed export capability and to assist
import substitution efforts, particularly in intermediate industrial goods.
Although increases in imports also are expected as the economy recovers,
the trend towards closing the trade gap seems already established. With
some loss in exchange earnings related to the military establishment in
Korea and Vietnam and also with the increase in debt payments, external
borrowing requirements are expected to be particularly large in the next
two years, about $900 million gross a year. At this level they will remain
within manageable limits, both in terms of Korea?s debt-carrying capacity
and the availability of external finance. Borrowing requirements could
begin to decline after 1975 and the debt service ratio, now at about 18 per-
cent, is expected to decrease gradually to the neighborhood of 14-15 percent
by 1976, due mainly to the favorable export outlook.
6.        The government's external borrowing policy aims at increasing the
proportion of external finance provided by official lenders to the agri-
cultural and social sectors with a view to improving further the average
borrowing terms.   This policy is also intended to accommodate changing
resource requirements.   Also, with more modest growth targets, increased
emphasis on rural works and a gradual shift towards producing its own
capi-tal goods, Korea's need for external loans to finance imported machinery
and equipment for large projects will be reduced, although the total amount



-3-
of industrial investment and the foreign exchange requirements thereof,
will remain high in absolute amounts.   Thus, lending for industrial
investment through development finance companies, as in the KDFC loan
also being presented today, will be a particularly appropriate way to
assist the Korean economy over the next few years.
7.        At the same time, a higher proportion of official loans in total
borrowing will require greater efforts by the government to prepare projects;
and official lenders will need to provide a larger proportion of their
financial assistance in a form usable for local expenditure.   In these
circumstances, some local currency expenditure financing by the Bank Group
is appropriate.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN KOREA
8.        As of April 30 Korea had received 15 Bank loans and IDA credits
amounting to US$267.5 million in loans and US$87.0 million in credits (taking
into account cancellations and the refinancing of one IDA credit in a
subsequent Bank loan).
9.        Of the us$354.5 mlllion, US$174.2 million has been for the transport
sector - US$119.7 million for railways and US$54.5 million for highways.   The
Korea Development and Finance Corporation has received US$55 milliorn in Bank
loans for relending to private industry.   US$U10.5 million has gone to agri-
cultural projects and the balance of US$14.8 million to the education sector.
10.       IFC has made four investments in Korea and its holdings amount
to US$8.1 m411ion in loans and shares.  IFC made its first equity investment
in KDFC, of US$0.7 million or 14 percent of KDFC's paid-in capital, at the
time the Bank made its first loan to KDFC.   The latest investment of IFC,
in 1971, was a purchase of US$0.6 million of the shares of the Korean Investment
and Finance Corporation - a new institution whose function is to assist in
the development of the capital and money markets.   Prospects for further IFC
investments in Korea are good.
11.       Of total Bank and IDA lending, US$201.7 million remained undisbursed
as of March 31, 1973.   This large amount is mainly attributable to the fact
that withdrawals under several of the large loans made within the past two
years are starting only now.   The disbursement picture has, however, improved
considerably as the rate of disbursement has increased substantially over
the past year.
12.       Generally these projects are progressing satisfactorily.    Delay
in the provision of local finance has been a problem with the Pyongtaek-
Kumgang and Yong San Gang irrigation projects but adequate provisions have
been made for this calendar year and the requirements for future years will
be discussed by a supervision mission this summer.    Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments as of
March 31, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



13.       Three projects will be submitted to the Executive Directors
this month (May 1973). In addition to the proposed project, these include
the US$40 million proposed fourth loan for the KDFC and a US$80 million
loan for a Ports Project. If approved by the Executive Directors, these
loans and credits would bring total Bank/IDA lending to Korea to US$517.5
million - US$b10.5 for the Bank and US$107.0 for IDA.
I4.       The two major emphases of Koreats Third Plan - correction of the
income disparities between the urban industrial sector and the rural agri-
cultural sector through increased agricultural investments and a program to
move from light to heavy industrial development - are supported by the Bank's
economic analysis and the proposed lending program therefore concentrates on
the agricultural and industrial sectors. Also, infrastructure will need to
be developed concurrently.  Even though the tansport sector will receive
less emphasis than in the past, the absolute amounts of investment required
are large and thus there is also considerable support for the transport
sector in the program.
15.       Seven projects are tentatively in the operations program for F   19T7h.
Three of these, a seeds production project, a tourism project and a highways
project, have already been appraised.    The remaining four (an agricultural
products processing project, the Korean Development Bank project, an industry
project, and an urban development project) are expected to be appraised before
the end of calendar year 1973.
16.       The annual level of Bank Group support through FY 1976 is forecast to be
appreciably above the level of the past three years. As indicated in Part I,
the resource gap and consequently the necessary aid flows may decline after
1976.   The government has the option,however, to seek a higher growth path based
on continued net aid inflows.
17.       The Consultative Group in Korea continues to be active.    It appears
that adequate official external finance will be available for the next two
years at least.   The U.S. and Japan are expected to continue to be the princi-
pal bilateral sources for external finance.
PART III - THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR IN KOREA
18.       Formal education in Korea has grown rapidly in recent years.
Primary school enrollment is virtually universal and enrollment ratios at
other education levels are comparatively high. About 60 percent of university
errollment is in engineering, medical, scientific, agricultural and business
studies. Korean students are diligent and well-motivated which is reflected
in repetition and dropout rates of less than 10 percent at any level.
19.       The educational systemts capability to meet urgent manpower
requirements and long-term socio-economic needs can be improved significantly.
Although a surplus of liberal arts and social science graduates and certain
categories of engineering and natural science graduates may occur over the
197T-36 period, shortages will continue to exist in some specific skill
categories, such as craftsmen, technicians, production engineers and secondary
school teachers. In addition, instruction tends to bDe too theoretical at all
veS3  , 



20.       Cooperation among the Ministries and agencies involved in education
and training (Ministries of Education, Agriculture, Social Affairs and Science
and Technology, and the Korean Education Development Institute) and between
the sector and industry has improved considerably but is not yet sufficiently
effective and must be strengthened if the system is to become an integral
part of the programs to accelerate transformation of agriculture and industry.
21.       Government emphasis in the education and training sector is on
reform, redirection and improvement programs and on the appropriate equipping and
efficient utilization of the available resources. Expansion at the secondary and
post secondary level is envisaged only to meet proven skill needs, Priority is
given to (i) expanding and improving sub-professional training, (ii) improving
high school education, (iii) balancing university education and (iv) moving
towards a universal basic education of nine years.
22.       In support of the government's program, Bank efforts are aimed at
expanding and improving vocational, technical and professional training and
at reorienting teacher education, with a view to modernizing and giving a more
practical emphasis to the education aector. The first education project, which
financed obvious high priority investment items pending a Bank sector mission
to formulate future investment programs, supports secondary and post-secondary
agricultural and technical education and touches on teacher education. The
Bank carried out an education sector review in 1971. Extensive discussions
with the government led to this proposed second project which would promote
needed curricula, organizational and teacher education improvements.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       The proposed project was appraised in October-November 1972 and was
negotiated in April 1973 with a government team led by Mr. S. K. Lee of the
Economic Planning Bureau, and including Messrs. H. K. Lee and Song of the
Ministry of Education. The project would support the first stage of reforms
planned to direct education and training more closely to the needs of a
rapidly expanding economy in which agriculture and industry are undergoing
wide transformation.  Specifically, it would: (a) extend the training
capability of a selected number of agricultural and technical high schools;
(b) expand and improve higher schools/Junior colleges for sub-professional
training; (c) strengthen university education in the fields of agriculture,
engineering, natural sciences and merchant marine; (d) expand and reorient
teacher education; and (e) assist in completing the programming of planned
educational reforms.
24.       The project institutions would have a total of 77,220 student
places, of which 5,900 would be nww. The number of new places would be
small because emphasis would be on improvement of the quality of the output
and fficiency and productivity in the sector rather than on expansion.
25.       The improvement program of the agricultural and iechnical high
schools (grades 10-12) provides for the introduction of new and more practical
curricula and the establishment of closer ties with the agricultural
extension service and industry. To meet the needs of local agricultural and
manufacturing development, in addition to their regular three-year programs,
the schools would conduct accelerated training and evening courses.



-6-
26.       The project would assist the re-organization of six higher schools
(grades 10-14 at present) to provide two-year post-secondary technician
courses (grades 13-14) and the improvement of four schools of nursing
(grades 13-15).
27.       The colleges of agriculture in the project would provide teaching
and research support to other agriculture colleges and emphasize instruction
and research in animal production and high yielding rice varities, two
fields of special significance to increase food production.  In the colleges
of engineering and sciences curricula would be modernized in support of the
planned development of heavy and chemical industry. Equipment for the
college of merchant marine is to update instruction in navigation and marine
engineering techniques in line with plans to promote the shipping industry.
28.       Ten primary teacher training colleges would 'be equipped to assist
training programs designed to prepare the teachers for wider responsibilities
in community development aid in the use of modern instructional techniques.
The twelve colleges of education, once equipped and expanded, would increase
the supply of secondary teachers in accord with estimated needs and promote
the institutional and administrative changes required to give pedagogical
training to the increasing number of graduates from other colleges (liberal
arts and sciences, engineering, agriculture) expected to enter the teaching
profession.
29.       Specialist ser ices and fellowships would be included for carrying
out two pre-investment studies in the fields of health and management
education respectively and for assisting staff development in the project
institutions at the university level.
30.       Annex III contains the loan/credit and project summary.  The report
"Appraisal of a Second Education Project in the Republic of Korea" is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
31.       The existing Project Unit in the Ministry of' Education would be
responsible for the overall supervision of the project and liaison with the
Bank. It would be strengthened to supervise adequately the cesign of civil
works and the preparation of equipment lists, execution of construction and
delivery and installation of equipment. Equipment delivery and installation
would be scheduled to be complete in June, 1977; the closing date would be
December 31, 1977.
32.       Civil works generally would follow the space standards of the
schools of the first project for similar institutions and be acceptable to
the Bank in all other cases. Similarly, equipment lists for the technical
and agricultural high and higher schools would be based on the master lists
of the first project for similar institutions.  In all cases, designs of
civil works and lists of furniture and quipment would be reviewed by the
Bank before procurement.



-7-
33.       The total project cost is estimated at US$70.2 million equivalent
of which US$47.0 million is foreign exchange and US$23.2 million is local
currency.   The loan/credit would finance the estimated foreign exchange cost
(including contingencies) of equipment and specialist services and fellowships,
or about 61 percent of total project cost.   The government wishes to finance
from its own resources the other major categories of civil works and furniture,
including about US$3.3 million foreign exchange required for these catgories.
The estimated foreign exchange cost of the equipment has been calculated
assuming that all equipment contracts will be awarded to foreign manufacturers;
the local cost component of this category would arise from installation and
transportation charges.   Domestic manufacturers are becoming competitive in
selected areas of simple science equipment, and it is possible that domestic
suppliers, after international competitive bidding, may win contracts for up
to 5 percent of the estimated total equipment cost.   Financing of local expendi-
tures of up to about US$2.0 million thus may be required.
34.       Contracts for civil works and furniture would be financed by the
government and would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding following
advertising in national publications.   This bidding procedure is justified
because of the small size of the contracts involved at each institution and
the difficulty of "packaging" them to attract foreign bidders.
35.       Procurement of equipment would follow the Bank guidelines for
international competitive bidding.   Domestic manufacturers would be allowed
a preferential margin of 15 percent or the existing customs duty, whichever
is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing imports.   Many different types
of equipment are involved, the customs duties for which range from 10 to 100
percent. Host exceed the 15 percent preferential margin.
36.       The proceeds of the loan/credit would be disbursed in the following
four ways:
(a) 100 percent of the c.i.f. costs of directly imported equipment;
(b)  70 percent of the ex-warehouse or ex-store cost of imported
but locally procured equipment (this percentage approximates
the foreign exchange cost excluding taxes, duties, etc.);
(c) 100 percent of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
equipment; and
(d) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of specialists' ser-
vices and fellowships.
The above percentages would be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursements
over the implementation of the project and to ensure full disbursement.   The
Bank loan would be disbursed after full disbursement of the IDA credit.
37.       The project would assist most of the priorities of education
strategy consistent with Korea's socio-economic needs.   By providing
functionally-designed and well-equipped facilities and reorienting teacher
training, the project would promote the application of relevant curricula



and support administrative and organizational improvements throughout the
sector.   As a result, education would have a more practical emphasis which
would increase its capability of supplying outputs with the skills and
attitudes required by an expending econony and increased labor mobility by
sector, level and type of employment.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement and the draft Development Credit Agreement
between the Republic of Korea and the Bank and the Association respectively,
as well as the report and recommendation of the Committees provided for by
Article  III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and by
Article V Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
respectively, and the text of Resolutions approving the proposed loan and
development credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Loan and Credit Agreements conform generally to the pattern of Agree-
ments for projects of this kind.
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
40.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan
and credit.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
1.        Loan No. 600     Pyongtaek-KuEang Irrization Project; US$hg.o million
Loan of May 23, 1969
Closing Date: June 305 1975
This is the first major irrigation project constructed in Korea.   It
will irrigate 35,250 ha of land, improve drainage and roads, consolidate all
paddy fields, bench all upland and reclaim 4,400 ha of tidal land with the project.
T4e start of construction was postponed by a major reorganization of the executing
agency and delay in hiring consultants; the project is now one year behind
schedule.   Disbursement is 50 percent behind even when a one-year postponement
is applied to the appraisal report schedule.Construction, however, is now progress-
ing satisfactorily.   A well-planned agricultural development program is being
implemented.   Shortfalls and delays in Won appropriation caused some delays in
the past.   After strong Bank requests to the Economic Planning Board for correc-
tive action, adequate funds for 1973 have been provided and the requirements and
provisions for future years will be reviewed this summer.
2.        Credit No. 151   First Education Project; US$14.8 million Credit of
Junme h, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 197h
This project provides for the expansion and equipment of 27 technical
high schools, 5 post secondary technical schools and 4 university teacher training
departments.   It also includes 26 man-years of technical assistance, 20 man-years
of overseas fellowships to support developments agricultural and/or technical
education and to assist educational planning.   The project is about 18 months
behind schedule because, in the initial stages of project implementation, delays
occurred in organizing the project unit, selecting and appointing the consultant
architects and establishing equipment procurement procedures.   The project is now
progressing satisfactorily, but it is expected that, because of the initial delays,
it will be completed about one year later than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This may require an extension of the Closing Date by about six months to June 30,
1975.
3.        Loan No. 669     Third Railway Project;  US$40.0 million Loan and
Credit No. 183   MS-5.0 million Credit of M    14, 1970

satisfactorily.   To date, nearly 200 Korean farmers are participating;  two
international purchases of 1,600 dairy heifers have been completed; international
competitive bidding for dairy processing equipment (close to US$1 million) has
been accomplished; planning and construction of civil works for two dairy
processing plants are well underway; technical services are.being strengthened;
and applied research for livestock production is already bringing significant
results.
5.        Loan No. 622 &   Second and Third KDFC Projects; US$20.0 and US$30.0
Loan No. 735     million Loans of June 26, 1969 and May 17, 1971
