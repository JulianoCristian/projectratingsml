{"cdata!": "The Second Structural Adjustment Credit\n            for Zimbabwe achieved a satisfactory overall outcome.\n            Substantial progress was achieved in improving the business\n            environment by reforming the exchange rate and trade regime,\n            deregulating foreign and local investment, and liberalizing\n            markets. However, the fiscal deficit was not brought down;\n            deficits led to high nominal and real interest rates; the\n            private sector was crowded out from domestic credit;\n            increasing public debt service constrained allocations for\n            the social sectors; and there was inadequate employment\n            creation and poverty reduction. Program sustainability is\n            rated as uncertain. Further progress is needed in\n            expenditure rationalization, revenue enhancement, and asset\n            and liability management. It will be necessary to foster a\n            more equitable distribution of reform program benefits to\n            maintain public support. Bank performance is rated as\n            satisfactory, although noted issues include the operation\n            design, economic strategy, and lack of explicit conditions\n            on social sector spending. Borrower performance is rated as\n            satisfactory in preparation and early implementation, but\n            became uneven in later stages. Performance was poor in\n            fiscal management; coordination of monetary, fiscal,\n            exchange rate policies; and covenant compliance. The primary\n            lesson learned is that, while the structural reform elements\n            of the project were largely achieved and produced the\n            expected results, such reforms cannot be fully effective in\n            unstable macroeconomic conditions. Other lessons learned\n            include: there is a need to link the adjustment operation\n            more explicitly to the Bank's poverty reduction\n            strategy; the ultimate success of the program will rely on\n            the confidence of the private sector and civil society; and\n            the systematic monitoring of the impact of reforms could\n            have been more strongly supported as a condition for an\n            adjustment operation."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
