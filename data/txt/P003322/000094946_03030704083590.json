{"cdata!": "This Project Performance Assessment\n            Report (PPAR) downgrades the Evaluation Summary outcome\n            rating, from marginally satisfactory to highly\n            unsatisfactory, institutional development from modest to\n            negligible, sustainability from uncertain to highly\n            unlikely, borrower performance from unsatisfactory to highly\n            unsatisfactory, and, Bank performance from satisfactory to\n            unsatisfactory. These ratings result from the fact that the\n            objectives of restoring macroeconomic stability, improving\n            public sector management, and shielding the poor from the\n            transitional impact of adjustment, were not met. As for\n            institutional development impacts, the project targeted\n            reforms in the parastatal sector, where results were\n            disappointing. Furthermore, the 1998-2000 period has been\n            one of macroeconomic destabilization, with slippages in\n            structural reforms, and forcible land acquisition, which has\n            destroyed private sector confidence, and the core of\n            efficient agriculture. Although the Bank correctly focused\n            on liberalizing the economy, constraining parastatal losses,\n            and on agricultural marketing reforms, it overestimated\n            Government ownership of this project's reforms, and\n            underestimated the risk to stabilization, and to private\n            sector confidence. In addition, early analytic work to\n            assist in public expenditure management was not planned, and\n            the social impact of reforms not monitored. Regrettably, the\n            Borrower, following 1997, reversed many of the reforms\n            already implemented under the project. Lessons suggest a\n            public expenditure review should have been undertaken early\n            on; political dialogue and consensus built, rather than\n            relying on commitments; and, tranche releases should be\n            based on results, taking into account that poverty reduction\n            is paramount in adjustment operations, particularly in\n            low-income countries."}, "docdt": "2003-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
