program. Given good progress in the first phase of the\n            program and taking into account the effects of the 1992\n            drought, this support is appropriate and in line with the\n            Bank's assistance strategy for Zimbabwe. The credit\n            focuses on generating more rapid supply response, while\n            continuing efforts to restore macroeconomic stability,\n            improve public sector management and shield poor and\n            vulnerable groups from harsh transitional effects arising\n            from adjustment. To achieve the rapid increase in investment\n            and exports which are vital to the sustainability and\n            success of structural adjustment in Zimbabawe, the credit\n            will support: (a) further trade policy reform to promote\n            exports; (b) investment delicensing to facilitate an\n            increase in private investment; and (c) agricultural\n            marketing and price reform to broaden private sector\n            involvement and competition."}, "docdt": "1993-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
