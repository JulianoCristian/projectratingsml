  The 2010/11 target (88 percent) followed the trajectory of the 2008 actual (78.6 percent) and the 2009/10 target (82
percent). By the time the actual of 2009/10 was available, in October 2010, the CPAF was locked for 2010/11, hence
no target adjustments that considers the already overachievement was possible anymore. The April 2011 review
needed to adjust all forward-looking targets to reflect the shift in Government policy from 6 to 9 year basic
education in 2009, combining primary and lower secondary into basic education. Given that the first cohort of pupils
will exit the new 9YBE in 2011/12, the indicator is measuring now not anymore transition from 6th to 7th grade but
from 9th to 10th grade, i.e. basic to upper secondary education. As such it is expected that the proportion of pupils
transitioning is decreasing, reflected in revised targets 2011/12 onwards.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal



At appraisal, Rwanda continued its ambitious reform program. The Government implemented
reforms in the agriculture, infrastructure, education, the financial sectors, and the management of
public resources, with support from the preceding, second Poverty Reduction Support Financing
(PRSF) series 4-7. The proposed PRSF series (PRSFs 8-10) was designed to provide continued
support in the areas covered under the previous series.

Rwanda’s macroeconomic performance was remarkably strong with average annual GDP growth
rate at 7.5 percent in 2008-10. The high growth rate had been achieved by public investments
financed by foreign aid. Although the 2009 growth rate decelerated to 6.2 percent due to the
global financial crisis, the impact was contained due to timely Government actions to stimulate
domestic demand through fiscal policy and limited link between Rwanda and the rest of the
world. After having peaked at 22.3 percent at the end of 2008 due to the global commodity price
hikes, inflation continued to fall to 7.5% by August 2011. Moreover, the latest national
household survey (as of FY2005/06) available during the program approval showed that 56.9
percent of the population remained below the national poverty line with over 90 percent of the
poor was in rural areas.

Despite the drop in poverty, Rwanda was unlikely to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development
Goal target on poverty and hunger eradication (MDG-1), but gender-related vulnerabilities
decreased. Rwanda made progress in terms of achieving food security but results indicated that
more investments were needed to sustain this progress. It is notable that the observed decline in
poverty between FY2005/06 and FY2010/11 was accompanied by a decline in the proportion of
female headed household among the poorest income quintiles. This was pointing towards
decreased vulnerability of female-headed households, which corroborates the excellent
performance of Rwanda in regard to the achievement of MDG-3, on gender equality. With
regard to MDG-7 on environmental sustainability, Rwanda faced pressures on its natural
resources from the growing population, most evident in land degradation, soil erosion, a decline
in soil fertility, deforestation, wetland degradation and loss of biodiversity. There was the risk
that further economic development would increase these environmental pressures through more
energy consumption, pollution and urbanization. Progress in increasing the proportion of
population that had access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities was too slow
to reach the set targets.

Although Rwanda made great strides toward addressing its development challenges, private
sector investment remained insufficient to support sustained growth. The Government articulated
a long-term vision to transform Rwanda from a low-income agrarian economy to a medium-
income export-oriented economy, operating as a knowledge-based service hub by 2020.
Rwanda’s success in establishing a sound investment climate demonstrated in the Bank’s Doing
Business, however, did not result in increase in foreign direct investment (FDI). The private
sector was still overwhelmingly informal and played a limited role in contributing to economic
growth. Private sector investment accounted for 12 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in
                                                12
2010, compared to 14 percent in the region. Although Rwanda’s agriculture growth and land
productivity were high, labor productivity remained low, needing greater private sector
involvement to realize sustainable productivity increases and better food security. Poor physical
infrastructure, particularly electricity and transport, was another major binding constraint to
increasing and diversifying exports of goods and services and further enhancing competitiveness.
Rwanda also experienced significant capacity and skills gaps in the private sector and across the
Government agencies that were expected to play significant roles in establishing the policy
environment for private sector development.

The second PRSF series (PRSFs 4-7) proved to be effective in advancing Government-owned
reforms, providing substantial financing and fostering better donor coordination. The PRSF
series provided important support to the Government to operationalize its ambitious medium-
term development strategy by translating its objectives into priority actions. The PRSF series
also provided substantial financing to Rwanda’s budget, totaling US$370.2 million between
2008 and 2011. Since Rwanda depended on highly concessional financing, not just to finance an
ambitious investment program, but also to finance parts of the recurrent budget expenditures,
budget support grants provided a preferred contribution to Rwanda’s overall financing needs,
and were spent well to make important advances. The Government relied on the World Bank and
other Development Partners as a source of continued financing in meeting these needs. Finally,
the PRSF series improved harmonization and reinforced support for reforms among the country’s
budget support donors. Against this backdrop, budget support was regarded as a highly
appropriate instrument at the time of appraisal for the Bank as well as other Development
Partners.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

The Government completed and adopted its second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),
the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) in September 2007. The
EDPRS covered the period 2008-2012 and provided a medium-term framework for achieving the
country’s long-term development aspirations as articulated in the Vision 2020, launched in 2000.
It described the Government’s development objectives of consolidating the achievements in
rehabilitation and reconstruction and accelerating the transformation to a middle-income nation
with a knowledge-based economy. It presented a strategy focused on growth and human
development, with an emphasis on decentralization, and a greater role for the private sector.

The proposed operation was in full alignment with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), discussed by the Board in August 2008. The FY2009-13 CAS was framed around two
strategic pillars: (i) promoting economic transformation and growth; and (ii) reducing social
vulnerability. It was also closely aligned with the above-mentioned EDPRS and followed the
Government’s preferences for engagement with the Bank in coordination with other
development partners.

The focus of the proposed PRSF series was aligned with the first CAS strategic theme:
promoting Rwanda’s economic transformation for sustained growth. Within this theme, the
proposed PRSF would support the CAS outcome indicators (i) agricultural production,
particularly for food crops, sustainably raised; (ii) improved access to and quality of key


                                               13
infrastructure services; (iii) improved environment for private sector development; and (iv)
capacity to manage public resources, at central and local levels, strengthened.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Program Development Objective (PDO) of a programmatic series was to adopt policies that
facilitate increased private sector investment and involvement and ease constraints to broad
based growth. 2

The PRSF series was designed to support Rwanda’s policies and institutions aimed at attaining
the sustainable growth needed to become a middle-income country by 2020. Other supported
reforms include those needed to increase efficiency, transparency and accountability in the
public sector so as to ensure that resources are used more efficiently and effectively to benefit all
parts of the population, including the poor. The PRSF series was designed to support the
following policy areas:

    (i)        Enhancing business climate to improve the general business environment and
               investment climate;
    (ii)       Building economic infrastructure to improve road conditions of the district network,
               to increase access to electricity, and to ensure efficiency and sustainability of
               increased energy generation;
    (iii)      Increasing agricultural productivity to foster the role of the private sector in
               agricultural input provision and to increase the production of food security crops;
    (iv)       Enhancing population skills to increase the quality and relevance of the education
               and a Technical and Vocational Training (TVET) system in the long term; and
    (v)        Improving public accountability to improve service delivery in the public sector and
               increasing effectiveness of payroll control, and enhancing public financial
               management (PFM) to increase effectiveness, transparency and accountability of the
               budget process, and to improve internal audit.

The Government Policy Matrix and Results Framework in Annex 2 of the Program Document
(PD) specified key indicators. These were:

    (i) Enhancing Business Climate:
              Index on business environment;
              Score of investor perceptions;

    (ii)       Building Economic Infrastructure:
              Number of households and firms with access to electricity;

  The PDO was stated slightly differently in different parts of the Program Document. For example, in the operation
and program summary table in page 1 and paragraph 3 in page 3, the objective was to “support the development of
policies” instead of “adopt policies”.

The PDO and key indicators were not revised.
1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The Program addressed five policy areas which were aligned with the EDPRS. The policy areas
are listed below:

    (i)        Enhancing Business Climate:

            Enhancing business climate was intended to improve the general business environment
            and investment climate. Despite Rwanda’s achievement in establishing a regulatory
            framework for businesses, the private sector was overwhelmingly informal and its
            contribution to economic activity remained limited. Streamlining and rationalizing the
            operations of customs entry processing, along with clarifying Rwanda’s land ownership
            for new and smaller firms were major issues. The operation supported trade facilitation

3
  The composite indicator assesses capacity building initiatives in four top priority sectors (agriculture, energy,
mining, and private sector investment). The composite indicator, for instance, includes a percentage of technicians
trained against target number of trained technicians.


                                                         15
        through improved trade logistics at the border, and improved access and reduced cost of
        land to reduce key constraints to private sector development.

(ii)      Building Economic Infrastructure:

        This component intended to improve conditions of the district road network, to increase
        access to electricity, and to ensure efficiency and sustainability of increased energy
        generation. Previous PRSF series had supported reforms to ensure financing of road
        maintenance by increasing the fuel levy collected through the Road Maintenance Fund
        (RMF). This operation aimed at supporting a reform to ensure sustainability of district-
        level road maintenance and the optimal use of the increased fuel levy. Specifically, the
        operation would support the adoption of a policy and institutional framework forming
        the basis of performance contracts between the RMF and beneficiary districts. In 2010,
        the Government set ambitious targets on increasing access and generation capacity to be
        achieved by 2017, as well as took steps to increase private sector participation in the
        energy sector. This required operationalization of a strong institutional framework to
        make the energy sector financially viable. To achieve these objectives, the operation
        supported the revision in the electricity tariff structure and the development of a
        strategic and costed action plan to maximize the local private sector involvement in the
        construction and maintenance of the electricity distribution system, as well as the
        adoption of a policy and institutional framework forming the basis of performance
        contracts between Government and the energy utility, and establishment of a unit for
        monitoring of Lake Kivu stability and sustainable exploitation of methane gas.

(iii)     Increasing Agriculture Productivity:

        The operation sought to foster the role of the private sector in agricultural input
        provision and to increase the production of food security crops. Due to its large
        employment weight and contribution to growth, growth in the agriculture sector
        remained a key for attaining Rwanda’s development vision of sustainable growth and
        accelerated poverty reduction. The Government was heavily involved in agricultural
        input provision and subsidization to increase productivity. To meet its target on
        increasing agriculture production and productivity, however, greater private sector
        involvement was needed. In addition, poor post-harvest management resulted in the loss
        of up to 15 percent of total production. This required the reform of post-harvest
        management to increase food security crops production. In this regard, the operation
        supported the publication of an independent evaluation of the implementation of the
        fertilizer strategy, the amendment of the fertilizer strategy, and the enactment of a
        regulatory framework for fertilizer importers/wholesalers, dealers and retailers in
        Rwanda. Furthermore, the operation was to assist in the establishment of a National
        Plant Protection Service unit in the Ministry of Agriculture, and the establishment of a
        functional secretariat to oversee the implementation of the post-harvest strategy.

(iv)      Enhancing Population Skills:




                                                 16
      In order to enhance population skills, the Government sought to increase the quality and
      relevance of education and develop a TVET system in the long term. Despite Rwanda’s
      success in providing universal access to primary education, challenges remained in
      regard to the quality of education. The existing Education Management Information
      System (EMIS) provided centrally-administrated data on education inputs and outputs
      but lacked capacity to provide data on learning outcomes at the district level. In spite of
      the support provided under the previous PRSF series, the TVET system remained
      underdeveloped, there was a clear need to improve its quality and relevance, strengthen
      the links to the industrial sectors and better respond to the needs of the private sector. To
      that end, the operation supported the reform of the EMIS and increased interaction and
      cooperation between the TVET system and the private sector. The operation supported
      the installation of an education management system and the development of a tool for
      monitoring learning achievement in literacy and numeracy, as well as the publication of
      a survey of employers’ satisfaction with skills of TVET graduates and the design of a
      minimum of 5 TVET curricula with private sector participation.

(v)     Improving Public Accountability:

      The operation supported improvements in public accountability and PFM so as to
      enhance service delivery and increase the effectiveness of payroll controls. Rwanda
      experienced significant capacity and skills gaps across the Government agencies that
      were expected to play significant roles in establishing the policy environment for private
      sector development. Despite Rwanda’s success in public sector reforms, the challenge to
      develop a coherent civil service reform agenda remained. Staff turnover was high while
      staff motivation was low, related to highly variable and inequitable pay levels. With
      support from the Africa Governance Initiative and the World Bank, the Government had
      developed a Strategic Capacity Building Initiative (SCBI) to address staffing and skills
      gap and strengthen the center of Government. The SCBI needed to enhance its long-term
      sustainability through complementary public sector reforms covering, for example,
      human resource management and pay and retention. The operation supported these
      objectives by focusing on measures to improve service delivery in the public sector and
      to increase effectiveness in payroll control. Specifically, the operation supported the
      finalization of the Pay and Retention Policy. The integration of the Integrated Payroll
      and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) and the Human Resource (HR) modules,
      supported by the operation, aimed to ensure accurate and transparent salary payment.
      The IPPIS was deployed to all Central Government ministries and achieved full
      coverage of public servants.

      The operation also supported PFM reforms to increase effectiveness, transparency and
      accountability of the budget process, and to improve internal audit. Despite remarkable
      improvements in the 2010 Public Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA), the
      multi-year perspective in fiscal planning budgeting and internal audit remained weak.
      This required the development of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
      into an instrument ensuring a strategic allocation of resources and fiscal sustainability,
      as well as a substantial increase in the percentage of budget agencies submitting internal
      audit. The operation supported the revitalization of the MTEF and the integration of it

                                              17
         into the budget process, and an increase in transparency and accountability of the budget
         process by posting on the MINECOFIN website key budget documents, along with the
         adoption of a regulatory framework for the implementation of Audit Committees and the
         establishment of pilots of Audit Committees in ministries and districts.

There were no other significant changes regarding the policy areas for the operation.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance:

The Board approved PRSF-8 in November 2011. It became effective and disbursed in December
2011.

The successor operation (PRSF-9) was prepared, negotiated and ready for presentation to the
Board. Government fulfilled all prior actions for the PRSF-9.4 The operation, however, was not
brought to the Board in 2012 for reasons discussed in the next subsection. The programmatic
series lapsed as no subsequent operation was presented to the Board 24 months after the Board
approval of the previous operation in the series.

The PRSF-9 draft didn’t change the

                                   In the draft PRSF-9, eight out of nine triggers set under the
PRSF-8 became prior actions. One trigger, on electricity tariff, was reformulated since the
approval of the PRSF-8. The original prior action, “a revised electricity tariff structure that
ensures positive rate of return on Energy Water Sanitation Authority (EWSA) assets is adopted
by Rwanda Utility Regulation Agency (RURA) and effected on all customers”, was replaced with
a key reform action towards the achievement of it: “the Recipient’s Ministry of Infrastructure
has approved a roadmap for the adoption of a cost-reflective electricity tariff by the Energy
Water and Sanitation Authority”.

The draft PRSF-9 reduced the number of triggers for the PRSF-10 from twelve in the PRSF-8 to
eight in the interest of selectivity, even though all policy actions remain imbedded in the
medium-term Government reform program. The four triggers were: (i) Establishing one-stop
border services at four out of seven main borders; (ii) Development of a strategic and costed
action plan to maximize local private sector participation in the construction and maintenance of
the electricity distribution system; (iii) IPPIS achieves full coverage of civil servants by end of

FY2011/12; and (iv) Pilot establishment of audit committees in Ministries and districts.
Government fulfilled all but one triggers and partially fulfilled the remaining trigger for the
PRSF-10 even though the operation was not prepared.5

Even though the PRSFs 9 and 10 did not materialize, the Government and the Bank continued
monitoring implementation progress for the triggers and respective development outcomes
through Joint Sector Reviews (JSRs) of relevant sectors.

Status of the prior actions in the PRSFs 8 and 9 and triggers for the PRSF 10 is summarized in
Table 1, 2 and 3. All of the prior actions of the PRSFs 8 and 9 have been met. On the triggers of
the PRSF 10, 7 out of 8 have been met.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The PRSF-8, the first loan of the programmatic PRSF series, was implemented satisfactorily
thanks to several factors discussed below. The PRSF-8 was also a part of a program to be
extended even further in time, with an anticipated PRSFs 9 and 10. In the event, the
Development Policy Lending (DPL) for these two operations were deferred and not bought to the
Board. This was for reasons not connected to the substance of the operations. Rather as
assessment was made that donors (and Board stakeholders) views had changed at that time and
they were refraining from general budget support.

The substance of the programs, however, continued to move forward strongly. All required
triggers of the PRSF-9 were fully met (Table 2). Similarly, all but one of triggers for PRSF-10
were completed (Table 3). The achievements can be attributable to the Government commitment
to and ownership of its reform program. The Bank’s program was strongly aligned with the
Government’s development priorities. Moreover, the Bank provided continued support through
various operations and by means of the JSR monitoring mechanism.

    As of April 2014, the Public-Private Partnership law was drafted but has not been approved.

                                                          21
The following sections cover issues pertaining to the preparation and design of the series
including all three operations, i.e., PRSFs 8, 9 and 10. As stated above, while the substantive on-
the-ground program was implemented, the follow-up operations were not presented to the Board.
In this regard, the discussion on the PRSFs 9 and 10 provided here is for information and
illustrative purposes.

Program Design. The program’s prior actions and accompanying results indicators were fully
aligned with policy actions in the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF), which
designed and monitored progress in selected policy actions to implement the EDPRS jointly by
the Government and Development Partners, including the Bank. The PRSF series was aligned
with the CPAF and the associated dialogue between the Government and Development Partners
to strengthen policy prioritization and coordination. Therefore, the reform program supported
under the operation realistically reflected both the opportunities for change and the
Government’s capacity to design and implement reforms.

Analytical Work. The program was also strongly underpinned by analytical work that had gone
into the program design, as well as in the context of the World Bank and other Development
Partners’ support for the EDPRS and the CPAF. Some of the selected analytical works
fundamentally related to specific areas of the PRSF-8 are summarized below:

   The 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) highlighted the importance of agriculture
    in sustaining economic growth, and together with the 2007 Agriculture Policy Note (APN)
    identified low input use, poor water management and soil conservation along with
    insufficient capacity support as major critical constraints to raise productivity;

   The CEM also identified the lack of skilled workers, particularly vocational training, as one
    of the underlying causes of the low profitability in the agriculture sector. The poor state of
    infrastructure, particularly electricity, transport, and water, limited the development of the
    manufacturing and services sectors while the low base of skilled labor and limited access to
    finance were cross-cutting issues in all sectors;

   The 2009 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) pointed out that the lower productivity in
    manufacturing sector, coupled with higher wage premium from skill shortages, led to higher
    labor costs and reduced competitiveness of Rwandan firms in the regional market;

   The 2005 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) stressed the need to build and maintain
    the stock of infrastructure and skills, to increase access to finance in order to sustain
    economic growth; and

   The 2010 Education Country Status Report highlighted as a strategic priority to achieve the
    education sector objectives, the expansion of access to the high-quality and demand-driven
    Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET).


Government Commitment. Government commitment to reduce poverty and foster sustainable
growth was evidenced in Government’s initiatives and ownership in the formulation of the

                                                22
EDPRS, the establishment of the CPAF and accompanying monitoring mechanism through the
JSRs and Joint Budget Support Reviews (JBSRs). The Government commitment was consistent
with its past reform performance, supported by the previous PRSF series, and further envisaged
by the fact that the Government achieved the most of the targets even after the follow-up
operations were not materialized. Evidence of the Government commitment is also reinforced by
achievements in development targets in the EDPRS which were not employed in the CPAF.

Relevance of Risks Identified. The PRSF-8 identified three risks that could jeopardize the
expected development outcome. These include: (i) regional and country-specific risk; (ii)
vulnerabilities to external shocks; and (iii) program-specific risks. Regional and country-specific
risk includes political commitment, macroeconomic management and limited capacity.
Vulnerabilities to external shocks range from macroeconomic risks due to large aid dependency,
the country is moderate level of debt distress and exposure to global economic shocks. Program
risks include fiduciary risks and implementation risks.

      Regional and country-specific risks. At the time of the PRSF-8 operation, regional and
       country-specific risks were moderate to significant. Volatility emerged in the Great Lakes
       Region in 2012 and increased fighting in the eastern DRC posed a risk to Rwanda’s
       economic stability and its ambitious development program. It could have had a severe
       adverse impact on macroeconomic management, and decelerated the Government’s
       reform program. However, the following factors mitigated the risks: (i) the Government’s
       commitment to the reform; (ii) sound macroeconomic management evidenced through
       satisfactory completion of the fourth review under the IMF Policy Support Instrument
       (PSI); and (iii) the PRSF-8 contribution to macroeconomic stability through medium-
       term fiscal framework.

      Vulnerabilities to external shocks. The risk of vulnerabilities to external shocks due to
       large trade imbalances and heave reliance on donor assistance in Rwanda was moderate
       to significant. Heightened uncertainty in the global economy, including volatile
       commodity prices and export demand and potential adverse impacts of the sovereign debt
       crises in Europe would impede the reform process in Rwanda. The Government prudent
       macroeconomic management, supported by the Bank and the IMF, proved to mitigate the
       risk. According to the 2013 joint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the Bank and the
       IMF, the risk of debt distress has actually been reduced from moderate to low.

      Program-specific risks. Program-specific risks including implementation risks and
       fiduciary risks were low to negligible. The Government showed in the past reform
       leadership and established a good track record of reforms, which were successfully
       supported under the previous PRSF operations. The PRSF-8 further mitigated these
       program-specific risks with prior actions that were aligned with the CPAF, as part of the
       EDPRS monitoring matrix and thus directly part of the reform program the Government
       committed itself. The PRSF-8 supported measures to reduce fiduciary risks by increasing
       transparency and accountability in public financial management, and implementation

        in the areas supported by the PRSF-8 under the support of ongoing Bank projects.7

Other Bank’s operations. Other Bank’s operations continued to contribute to the reforms. The
current IDA portfolio in Rwanda comprises 8 IDA projects and 3 budget support operations with
net commitment of US$ 575 million as of April 2014. The key operations include: the Second
and Third Support to Social Protection System (P131666 and P146302); the Quality of
Decentralized Service Delivery Support Development Policy Operation (P145114); the
Agriculture Growth Corridors Program (P148927); and the Statistics for Results (P124129).


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Design. M&E of the PRSF series relied on Government’s own M&E systems and arrangements
with the aim of strengthening Government capacity and institutions. The Government developed
in close collaboration with Development Partners, including the Bank, a results and performance
framework integrated into the planning and budgeting processes for monitoring the EDPRS as
well as the principle of joint monitoring of policy actions and expected outcomes through the
CPAF around two annual JBSRs, one forward-looking and one backward-looking.
With this background, a key success factor of the PRSF series design was the joint monitoring
process with the Government and Development Partners, which relied on the CPAF. The results
framework was shared and jointly monitored by the Government and Development Partners at
sector level, i.e., the JSRs and subsequently validated by the JBSRs. Another important factor
was the selection of indicators that were aligned with the CPAF indicators, which was tightly
linked to the EDPRS, and to which the Government was committed.
As the M&E mechanism was established by the Government and Development Partners for
jointly monitoring implementation of policy actions in the EDPRS, the JSRs and JBSRs
continued to monitor the reform progress regardless of deferment and subsequent shelving of the
PRSFs 9 and 10.
Implementation. The Bank team closely monitored progress with implementation of the reform
program, at each sector level through the JSRs and the JBSRs with the Government and
Development Partners. The backward-looking JSRs reported implementation status, challenges
and agreed measures to move forward. Bank’s sector specialists not only participated to the JSRs
and the JBSRs in their respective areas, but led some of the areas as a lead donor.
Utilization. Based on the backward-looking JSRs and the JBSRs, the forward-looking JSRs,
jointly prepared by the Government and Development Partners, served to deliver the monitoring
information to identify areas of particular challenge and to develop measures to address them.
Overall, the M&E design, implementation and utilization benefited from a commitment and
initiatives by the Government to the reforms.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

After the deferment and subsequent shelving of follow-up operations, the PRSFs 9 and 10,
general budget support was interrupted while other Bank’s operations continued to contribute to
the reforms. The key operations include: Second and Third Support to Social Protection System
(P131666 and P146302); Quality of Decentralized Service Delivery Support Development Policy
Operation (P145114); Agriculture Growth Corridors Program (P148927); Public Governance
Program for Result (P149095); the Statistics for Results (P124129); Sustainable Energy
Development Project (P097818); Electricity Access Scale-up Project (P111567); Skills
Development Project (P118101); Third Rural Sector Support Project (P126440) and;
Governance and Competitiveness Technical Assistance Project (P127105).

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

Objectives. The original objective of the PRSF series remains highly relevant to the priorities of
the Government’s Second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2)
and the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the period FY2014-18.8 Despite
Rwanda’s rapid advances in regulatory reforms, the objective remains highly relevant to
developing ways to further improve the investment climate, especially infrastructure. The private
sector was largely informal, its investment levels remained low and its role and contribution to
economic activity remained limited. With Rwanda’s aspiration to become a middle-income
country by 2020, increased private sector investment and involvement and broad-based growth
are needed to attain sustainable growth.

Design. The design of the PRSF series, in terms of the policy areas and actions, remain highly
relevant. The PRSF series was built upon and closely aligned with the CPAF and the EDPRS.
The PRSF series envisaged significant achievements in all policy areas. High relevance of the
program is further evidenced by the fact that the Government continued to implement all prior
actions and all but one triggers for the deferment and subsequent shelving PRSFs 9 and 10,
respectively.

Implementation. The success in implementation of all but one planned reform actions is mainly
attributable to the Government’s strong commitment to the reform process, which was
supplemented by engagements by Development Partners, including the Bank. MINECOFIN
successfully monitored reforms, organized reviews with Development Partners and coordinated
actions with all line ministries and agencies.

(i)    Enhancing Business Climate: Substantially Achieved

Over the course of the PRSF series, the Government made progress in improving the regulatory
environment for business activity, evidenced in the improved index of business environment9
(supported by a prior action in the PRSF-8) and scores of investor perceptions (supported by a
prior action in the PRSF-9). The index of business environment improved from the baseline, 36.0
in 2006, to 60.1 in FY2010/11, 60.6 in FY2011/12 and 65.5 in FY2012/13, respectively,
although the index of FY2011/12 was slightly below the target of 65.6. Scores of investor
perceptions exceeded the target of 72 by the actual of 74.4 in FY2011/12. The improvement in
business climate is validated by similar indicators in the Global Competitiveness Report by the
World Economic Forum and Bank’s Country Policy Institutional Assessments (CPIA). In the
2014 CPIA, Rwanda’s score on business regulatory environment improved to 4.5 out of 6
whereas the average for IDA countries was 3 and only 7 percent of IDA countries raised their
scores. The Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided complementary support
for the achievement of the objective under this component through the Competitiveness and
Enterprise Development Project (CEDP, P057295), Competition Policy Assessment (P147655)
and the Rwanda Investment Climate Reform Project (RICRP), respectively.


(ii)   Building Economic Infrastructure: Substantially Achieved

The PRSF series supported improving infrastructure in roads and electricity. Two of the three
targets set for development outcome indicators have been met and the remaining one has been
improving. The triggers that originally had been set for PRSFs 9 and 10 were met even if these
operations were cancelled. The Bank, however, continued to support these with alternative
operations.

Significant improvements have taken place in the capacity to generate electricity and the access
to both the population and businesses. Support for improving the generating capacity initially
came through the Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP), which contributed to making
the 20 MW Heavy Fuel Power Plant operational in May 2009. Following this success, the
operation helped the Government’s policy and institutional framework for performance contracts
to increase efficiency and ensure electricity access targets. The development outcome indicator,
Megawatt (MW) of electricity generated (supported by a prior action in the PRSF-9) increased
from 45 MW in the baseline year to 112 MW in FY2012/13. Together with the follow-up
operation to UERP, Rwanda’s Electricity Access Rollout Program (EARP), whose objective is to
increase the number of households connected to the electricity, the development outcome
indicator, number of households and firms with access to electricity (supported by a prior action
in the PRSF-9), exceeded the target of 270,000 households in FY2011/12 by 308,326 households
in FY2011/12.

  The index of business environment is computed by equally weighing six Doing Business indicators from the World
Bank. The Doing Business categories covered under the business environment index are: starting a business,
registering property, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and dealing with construction permits.

                                                         26
Improvements in road rehabilitation are facilitating market access and helping reduce indirect
transport costs due to breakage. A trigger foreseen for PRSF-10 on ensuring the sustainability of
district-level road maintenance and the optimal use of resources resulting from the fuel levy
increase was met. The Bank also provided financing for key road rehabilitation under the
Transport Sector Development Project (P079414). The related CPAF indicator, percentage of
classified district road network in good condition, exceeded the target of 37 percent set for the
development outcome in 2011/12 (it reached 37.1 percent).10

(iii) Increasing Agriculture Productivity: Fully Achieved

The PRSF series supported increasing agricultural productivity. Given that 85 percent of
Rwandan working adults work in agriculture, increasing agricultural productivity would be
critical to achieving Rwanda’s development goals. The available information shows that between
2008 and 2011, aggregate agricultural production increased by 50 percent. Moreover, during the
same period, the yields (production per hectare) in selected products increased maize by 225
percent, rice by 34 percent, wheat by 129 percent, cassava by 90 percent, potatoes by 66 percent,
and bananas by 62 percent.11

On the outcome indicators, mineral fertilizer used (supported by a prior action in the PRSF-8)
and production of key food security crops (supported by a prior action in the PRSF-9), exceeded
the target. Mineral fertilizer used increased from the baseline of 14,000 MT in 2006 to 44,000
MT in FY2010/11 while the target was 39,200. Similarly, production of key food security crops
expanded from 1,612 MT in 2006 to 3,113 MT in FY2010/11, exceeding the target at 3,100 MT.
Besides the PRSF, various Bank’s investment lending projects, supported the Government to
ensure sustainability in productivity growth and ultimately better food security. For instance, the
second Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP 2, P105176) focused on intensifying production in
the marshland, and the Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH,
P124785) Project focused on increasing productivity. These operations encouraged farmers to
adopt sustainable intensification technologies, including appropriate use of fertilizers, leading to
achievements in the outcome indicators through the development of a private sector-led fertilizer
distribution system.

(iv) Enhancing Population Skills: Substantially Achieved

The PRSF series support for enhancing the skills of the population focused on improving the
effectiveness of basic education and increasing the relevance of education to build a skilled
workforce, i.e. improving the quality of education and building a labor market responsive TVET
system. The outcome indicators on improving the effectiveness of basic education, transition
from basic to upper secondary education (supported by a prior action in the PRSF-8) and primary
school completion rate (supported by a prior action in the PRSF-9), exceeded their targets; the
first, 94 percent in FY2010/11 versus a target of 88 percent, and, the second 78.6 percent
compared to a target of 78 percent. Information is not available regarding the other outcome
indicator, percent of employer satisfied with performance of TVET graduates (supported by a

   These improvements in infrastructure are also evidenced by the Global Competitiveness Report by the World
Economic Forum. Rwanda’s quality of overall infrastructure is ranked at 48 in 2012/13, rising from 67 in 2010/11.

prior action in the PRSF-8). Because the coverage of the supporting survey was narrow, it was
decided to carry out a broader survey of employers. Progress is underway on implementing this
new survey; the design had been completed and a proposal submitted to the National Institute of
Statistics Rwanda (NISR) to undertake the survey. This said, improvement in vocational training
is validated by the Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum. For instance,
score on availability of training services improved from 3.17 out of 7 in 2011 to 3.64 in 2014.

In addition, the Bank supported the development of a mechanism to enable policy makers to
monitor learning achievements by collecting relevant data of acceptable quality. Education
statistics are being used for planning and monitoring sector performance. Support came through
World Bank’s Skills Development Project (P118101), as well as Governance and
Competitiveness Technical Assistance Project (P127105), supported to establish M&E
mechanism and develop M&E information system for informing strategic policy decisions and
policy reforms.


(v)      Improving Public Accountability and Enhancing Public Financial Management:
         Substantially Achieved

The PRSF series, as well as the Bank’s Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP,
P066386), supported the reform of the civil service with emphasis on improving accountability
and transparency. The main instrument was the deployment of the IPPIS, which helped to
minimize the risk of “ghost workers” who are recorded on the payroll but do not work actually.
The support for upgrading the IPPIS on pay, leave, promotion, and termination has allowed the
Government to ensure that wages and salaries are captured accurately, potential manual entry
errors or data manipulations are eliminated, and the respective information matches with data
captured in the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) managed by
MINECOFIN. The PSCBP also formalized the IPPIS user group and trained 282 members from
public institutions on how to use the IPPIS. The training included Human Resource Directors,
Directors of planning and IT officers. Although the initially designed outcome indicator, index of
effectiveness of payroll controls, Public Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA) indicator
PI-181213 (supported by a prior action in the PRSF-8), is not available at the time of the ICR, the
number of roll-out of the system to public agencies increased from 25 in August 2009 to 124 in
July 2012. A quality assurance review of the IPPIS was also done and validated, and the JSRs
closely monitored the progress. Development of the IFMIS also led to an increase in the number
of agencies that complete annual financial reports. The National Budget Directorate reports on
spending of the budget and related outputs. These achievements are reflected in the outcome
indicator, percentage of internal audit reports submitted (supported by a prior action in the
PRSF-8), exceeding the target of 45 percent in FY2010/11 and 60 percent in FY2011/12: 65
percent in FY2010/11 and 70 percent in FY2011/12.


12
   PEFA indicator PI-18 is assessed by following categories: (i) degree of integration and reconciliation
between personnel records and payroll data; (ii) timeliness of changes to personnel records and the payroll;
 (iii) internal controls of changes to personnel records and the payroll; and (iv) existence of payroll audits to
identify control weaknesses and/or ghost workers.
13
     Indicator is not due for assessment until the second half of 2014.

                                                            28
The PRSF series also supported the development of the Rwanda Public Sector Pay and Retention
Policy and Implementation Strategy that the Cabinet adopted in January 2012. The policy
addresses structural issues of public service pay policy priorities and the critical issue of staff
turnover in the public service, which have been continuously identified as an obstacle to
achieving the Government’s development objectives. The establishment of a Public Sector
Capacity Building Secretariat14 by Government, supported by the PRSF series and the PSCBP,
has assisted in coordinating and mainstreaming capacity building into Government and donor
programs. The achievement is evidenced in the outcome indicator, percentage of planned outputs
achieved in 4 selected Strategic Capacity Initiative (SCBI) priority areas15 (supported by a prior
action in the PRSF-8), increasing to 71 percent in FY2010/11 and 75 percent in FY2011/12
while the target was set at 60 percent in FY2010/11.

The PRSF series supported the Government’s PFM reforms to develop the MTEF and increase
transparency and accountability of the budget process. The Government continues efforts to
strengthen and consolidate the implementation of the MTEF. Since 2008, MINECOFIN has put
in place National Planning Budgeting and MTEF guidelines with a forecast of two years beyond
the currently planned budget. Districts have also adopted the MTEF approach under the Budget
Call Circulars guideline.

Although the outcome indicator, Index for multiyear perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure
policy and budgeting PEFA indicator PI-1216 (supported by a prior action in the PRSF-8), is not
available, the National Budget Directorate ensures that sector spending plans are incorporated
into the macro-MTEF, and budget. The Government prepares forecasts of fiscal aggregates for
two years on a rolling annual basis, and conducts its own debt sustainability analysis. Most
sector strategy plans include costing exercises for the investment projects, which are reflected in
forward budget estimates.17




14
   The name has been changed to the National Capacity Building Secretariat (NCBS).
15
   The related outcome indicator percentage of planned outputs achieved in the selected 4 SCBI priority areas is new,
replacing the one which was in place until April 2011: percentage of performing budget agencies, which aimed at
addressing capacity issues in budget agencies. The new outcome indicator will also focus on capacity building, but
narrower linked to the Government’s new SCBI service delivery sectors. The Pay and Retention Policy will be a
crucial overarching public service framework and will contribute to the success of the SCBI by harmonizing the
pay-scale and benefit and performance system. It is this expected to contribute to improvements in the new indicator
over time.
16
   Indicator is not due for assessment until the second half of 2014. The index covers following criteria: (i) multi-
year fiscal forecasts and functional allocations; (ii) scope and frequency of debt sustainability analysis; (iii)
existence of costed sector strategies; and (iv) linkages between investment budgets and forward expenditure
estimates.

Note 1. The 2009/10 actual (23 percent) and 2012/13 target (25 percent) are based on the International Roughness Index (IRI). The
original method of measurement was visual inspection. The Government officially employed the IRI method in 2012.
Note 2. The 2010/11 target (59 percent) followed the trajectory of the 2008 actual (53 percent) and the 2009/10 target (56 percent).
By the time the actual of 2009/10 was available, in October 2010, the CPAF was locked for 2010/11, hence no target adjustments that
considers the already overachievement was possible anymore. The 2011/12 and onwards targets reflect the earliest possible revision
opportunity of April 2011.
Note 3. The 2010/11 target (88 percent) followed the trajectory of the 2008 actual (78.6 percent) and the 2009/10 target (82 percent).
By the time the actual of 2009/10 was available, in October 2010, the CPAF was locked for 2010/11, hence no target adjustments that
considers the already overachievement was possible anymore. The April 2011 review needed to adjust all forward-looking targets to
reflect the shift in Government policy from 6 to 9 year basic education in 2009, combining primary and lower secondary into basic
education. Given that the first cohort of pupils will exit the new 9YBE in 2011/12, the indicator is measuring now not anymore
transition from 6th to 7th grade but from 9th to 10th grade, i.e. basic to upper secondary education. As such it is expected that the
proportion of pupils transitioning is decreasing, reflected in revised targets 2011/12 onwards.
Note 4. The related outcome indicator percentage of planned outputs achieved in the selected 4 SCBI priority areas is new, replacing
the one which was in place until April 2011: percentage of performing budget agencies, which aimed at addressing capacity issues in
budget agencies. The new outcome indicator will also focus on capacity building, but narrower linked to the Government’s new SCBI
service delivery sectors. The Pay and Retention Policy will be a crucial overarching public service framework and will contribute to
the success of the SCBI by harmonizing the pay-scale and benefit and performance system. It is this expected to contribute to
improvements in the new indicator over time.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The ICR rates the achievement of the development outcomes as satisfactory, given the strong
achievement of stated outcome targets and the transformational nature of the majority of the
reforms. The expectation of impact on private economic activity is likely to materialize over the
medium term, given the continuation of policies and efforts.

Out of 11 available development outcome indicators set under the original PRSF series, 8
indicators were fully achieved and the remaining 3 indicators are significantly achieved. The
Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum also independently confirms the
achievement. For instance, quality of public institutions is ranked at 15 in FY2011/12 in the
world. Quality of overall infrastructure showed an improvement as seen by the ranking
improving from 67 in FY2010/11 to 48 to FY2012/13. Criteria related to business environment
are ranked high and show significant improvements. This is remarkable achievement given that
the two of three operations did not materialize and highlights the commitments of all
stakeholders to the programs.

Preliminary estimates by the first review under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports that private investment as a percent of GDP has
slightly increased from 10.7 percent in 2011 to 12.4 percent in 2012.

Despite the achievement of the PRSF outcome indicators, the fact that private sector investment
has increased only modestly is attributable to several factors beyond the influence of the reform
agenda. First, impact of the achievements under the PRSF series on private sector activity and
investment will be materialized beyond the period of the operation. In fact, the IMF’s PSI
forecasts private sector investment reaching 14.4 percent of GDP in 2018 from 10.7 percent in
2011, suggesting that the on-going reform effort, including the policy areas supported by this
operation, will have an impact in the long-term. Second, the policy reforms supported by this
operation need to be continued to assure sustained impact in the long-term. This is indeed the
case, as evidenced by the agenda the Bank supports under the recently approved CPS. Third,
additional efforts are needed to increase access to finance and to build capacity in the private
sector, and to promote required integration, which is also a key for a small and landlocked
economy. Given the breath of the agenda, continued support in these areas is much needed.

It should be noted, however, that World Bank, IFC and MIGA have all been active in the
financial sector to enhance access to finance. For instance, CEDP’s initial financing contributed
to improved service delivery of the financial sector. A series of technical assistance projects,
such as the first and second Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), supported the financial
sector development. These achievements are reflected to Rwanda’s ranking in financial market
development by the Global Competitiveness Report, rising from 69 in FY2010/11 to 49 to
FY2012/13.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
                                                31
In the last five years, the high rate of economic growth has contributed to reduce poverty in
Rwanda. The poverty headcount dropped, with the share of population living below the national
poverty line falling from 59 percent in FY2000/01 to 45 percent in FY2010/11. In Kigali, home
to 10 percent of Rwanda’s population, the incidence of poverty decreased by six percentage
points, from 22.7 percent in FY2000/01 to 16.8 percent in FY2010/11. Starting from a much
higher base, the rest of the country experienced a 15-percentage point drop in poverty. Poverty in
rural areas has decreased jointly with the increase in land productivity and the production of
basic foodstuffs. The poverty gap ratio, which takes into account the distance separating the poor
from the poverty line, dropped by almost 10 percentage points, from 24.4 percent in FY2000/01
to 14.8 percent in FY2010/11. This implies that those who still live below the poverty line are
now closer to the poverty line than they were in FY2000/01, which bodes well for future poverty
reduction. Inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, reduced from 0.52 to 0.49.

The PRSF series was designed with the view to have an impact on poverty and social
development. The financing provided to the Government through the PRSF-8 for implementing
priorities of its strategy, narrowed the gap between resources available from Government’s
revenues and other donor support. Also, the alignment of the operation design with the EDPRS
and background analytical work, such as the CEM assured the relevance for growth and poverty
reduction of investments and reforms to ease infrastructure constraints (particularly in rural
areas), and improve agriculture productivity. Specifically, the PRSF series targeted support for
poverty reduction and social outcomes through:

   (i)     Measures aimed at enhancing the business climate and build economic infrastructure
           to address key constraints to economic growth and private investment and to provide
           productive employment and income opportunities for broader segments of the
           population;
   (ii)    Actions to increase agriculture productivity by improving the livelihood of farmers
           and to ensure sustainability in productivity growth and ultimately better food security;
   (iii)   Measures aimed at enhancing the skills base of the population to positively affect
           through more productive opportunities for the working population, especially the poor,
           contributing to increasing the likelihood of employment and income; and
   (iv)    Measures aimed at improving public accountability and enhanced public financial
           management to impact positively all segments of the population. The improved
           MTEF and budget process ensure better medium-term fiscal planning and priority
           setting for resources on poverty-related expenditure and infrastructure. Increasing
           effectiveness of payroll control and improving internal audit functions are likely to
           have similar gains. The support to civil services reform and the SCBI are also likely
           to improve service delivery and will directly benefit motivated public servants.

The achievement of the development outcomes set under the PRSF in each of these areas
suggests a positive impact on poverty reduction of the operation (even if truncated) and the
complementary operations that came in support of delivery these development objectives.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening



                                                32
The PRSF series has helped the institutions involved strengthen visible capacity through the
exchange of knowledge and the adoption of best practices over the term of the operation. For
instance, the operation supported the Government to develop SCBI to strengthen the center of
Government, and to design engagement by the private sector in the distribution of fertilizers.

This subsection is not applicable because there were no other unintended outcomes and impacts.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

This subsection is not applicable because there were no beneficiary survey or stakeholder
workshops.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
Risks to development outcome arise from variable climatic conditions, and the private sector
response to government reforms. Agriculture is the main employer and driver of poverty
reduction but remains vulnerable to the vicissitudes of unpredictable weather patterns and
regional droughts and floods, which can significantly affect output and progress on poverty
reduction. Bank operations continue to support measures to make agriculture more climate-
resilient, for instance through the construction of irrigation facilities and terracing. Continued
support for the private sector is targeted at taking advantage of a better business environment.

The main external risks relate to more-rapid-than-expected tapering of donor inflows, and a
prolonged slump in the global economy. In addition, heightened uncertainty in the global
economy, including volatile commodity prices and export demand and potential adverse impacts
of the sovereign debt crises in Europe would impede the reform process in Rwanda. Rwanda’s
high reliance on foreign aid makes its development strategy vulnerable to reductions in aid flows.
While Rwanda is fairly insulated from the global economy a prolonged slump would
nevertheless have a negative impact on growth prospects through more constrained availability
of external financing. The Bank seeks to mitigate the risks on the exposure to fluctuations in aid
flows through the choice of instruments and the aid dependence through measures to improve
domestic revenues. It should be noted, however, the Government’s sound macroeconomic
management, evidenced through satisfactory completion of the fourth review under the IMF’s
PSI, proved to mitigate the risks.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

   Rating: Satisfactory



                                                 33
The Bank’s overall performance in ensuring quality at entry was satisfactory. The Bank’s effort
to improve the results framework through the CPAF and coordination with Development
Partners through the JSRs and the JBSRs proved effective. The preparation of the PRSF series
was built upon comprehensive analytical works and lessons learned from the previous PRSF
series (i.e., advancing Government-owned reforms, providing substantial financing and fostering
better donor coordination). The analytical works informed preparation for Government medium-
term development strategy, i.e., the EDPRS. The Bank staff continued to participate in the Sector
Working Groups (SWGs) and took a leading role to translate the EDPRS objectives into prior
actions and coordinate the policy actions under the CPAF to which the PRSF series was closely
aligned.

(b) Quality of Supervision

   Rating: Satisfactory

The Government and Development Partners undertook semi-annual JSRs and JBSR as part of
the harmonized budget support framework in Rwanda. The review is based on the indicator and
policy action M&E framework of the CPAF to which all budget donors adhere and the
Government committed itself. The review process provided the Bank an opportunity to closely
monitor reform progress and to address key issues in coordination with the Government and
Development Partners. Despite the unavailability of data on some of indicators, this close
supervision process enabled the Bank to monitor progress in these indicators. As the M&E
mechanism was established by the Government and Development Partners for jointly monitoring
implementation of policy actions in the EDPRS, the reviews continued to monitor the reform
progress regardless of deferment and subsequent shelving of the PRSFs 9 and 10. The
Government fulfilled all prior actions of the PRSF-9 and all but one of triggers of the PRSF-10,
which the Bank monitored through the reviews. Lastly, the Bank continued its support for the
achievement of most development objectives through dialogue, technical assistance and
alternative operations.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
   Rating: Satisfactory

Given that both the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and quality supervision were
rated satisfactory, the overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory in accordance with the
harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines for the ICR.

5.2 Borrower Performance
 (a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

Government ownership and commitment to the reform were strong, leading to timely
implementation of prior actions and achievement of results indicators for the PRSF-8. The
commitment continued after the cancelation of the operation as evidenced by the fact that the
Government fulfilled all prior actions of the PRSF-9 and all but one of triggers of the PRSF-10,
and achieved most of the development outcomes. The Government coordinated well with

                                               34
Development Partners, including the Bank, further contributing to the effectiveness of the
operation. The Government took initiatives to arrange the M&E mechanisms, establishing the
principle of joint monitoring of policy actions and expected outcomes with Development
Partners, including the Bank, through the CPAF around two annual JBSRs, one forward-looking
and one backward-looking.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating:

According to harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines for the ICR, where the government and
implementing agency are indistinguishable, particularly for development policy lending
operations, only an overall rating is necessary taking into account relevant criteria for
government and implementing agency’s performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

As the Government performance is rated Satisfactory, and as the Government and Implementing
Agency are indistinguishable, the overall Borrower Performance is rated as Satisfactory in
accordance with harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines for the ICR.

6. Lessons Learned

The key lesson learned from the PRSF series was that the Government’s commitment and
ownership were essential to advance the reforms. This was especially evident after the deferment
and subsequent shelving of follow-up operations as the Government achieved 9 out of 11
observable outcome indicators in target years. One of the remaining two met in the following
years and progress towards achieving the other one is steadily improving.
Bank’s support to translating the Government’s ambitious development objectives into policy
actions and M&E proved to be effective. Bank was instrumental in supporting the formulation of
the CPAF policy actions. Promoting coordination under the CPAF framework helped to reduce
tensions against the Government and Development Partners over the choice and timing of the
CPAF policy actions. Bank’s close coordination and alignment with the EDPRS and the CPAF,
and close interaction with Development Partners provided a high likelihood that the planned
development outcomes would be achieved.
Given the complex and time-compressed process, presence of respective sector staff in-country
is crucial to contribute to progress in the reform process. Bank sector staff continued to
participate in policy discussions within sector SWGs during the biannual JSRs. The sector staff’s
participation to the SWGs during the biannual the JSRs greatly facilitated program management
and monitoring of progress of reform implementation. The participation to forward-looking
JSRs in April each year was especially important because policy actions could be defined for the
upcoming two years.
The release of the report by the Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo,
appointed by UN Security Council Resolution, led to change in attitudes towards budget support

                                               35
by Development Partners. This change in attitudes, coupled with the shelving of the PRSF-9,
negatively affected the Government’s fiscal space. Against this backdrop, the Government has
asked the Bank to consider alternative, more predictable modalities for delivering IDA support in
the future. The CPS anticipates different combinations of instruments that might both protect the
Government from volatility in financing flows and, at the same time, still offer some flexibility
in the financing that is delivered. While the previous CAS was anchored around budget support,
this new CPS proposes less emphasis on development policy instruments. In its place, the
Government has requested that the Bank disburse part of their IDA17 allocation in the form of
program for results (PforR) operations. While the previous CAS disbursed 66 percent in the form
of budget support, this CPS is likely to disburse the same proportion as a mix of PforR and
development policy operations.

Annex 2. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Government of Rwanda (the Government) appreciates this opportunity to express our views
on the implementation of the PRSF-8. We note that Rwanda’s economy has recorded strong
growth (exceeding 7% on average) in the last 3 years, although 2013 growth decelerated to
below 5% due to the aid shortfall in 2012. Estimates from the third Household Survey (EICV 3)
conducted in 2012 show that poverty declined from 60 to 45 percent between 2000 and 2011.
The resources under the PRSF-8 and the preceding PRSF 4 to 7 supported measures to achieve
the decline.

Support from our Development Partners has been cardinal, including the PRSF-8 resources from
the World Bank (the Bank). The preceding PRSF 4 to 7 series supported priority areas in the
second PRSP, the EDPRS such as the agriculture, infrastructure, education, financial sectors, as
well as public financial management (PFM). The PRSF-8, providing total support of US$120
million (equivalent to Rwf 72 billion), was designed to provide continued support in these
priority areas. More specifically, the PRSF 8 placed greater emphasis on (1) private sector
development; (2) improvement in access to and quality of socio-economic services, mainly in
education and infrastructure; and (3) improvement of economic and financial governance.

Overall, the Government views that the PRSF-8 was thoughtfully designed to tackle to critical
issues that confronted Rwanda supported by a solid analytic foundation. The PRSF-8 was
designed with the following principles:
       Relevant to the country’s development priorities;
       Achievable in the expected timeframe in most cases; and
       Consistent with the Bank’s CAS.

The Government commends the quality of dialogue with the Bank during the PRSF-8 design,
appraisal missions and the day-to-day business. The consultations with the Government and the
Bank were effectively aligned with and supported the national strategies and the Bank’s CAS.
The PRSF-8 stimulated dialogue between lines ministries, raising the latter’s accountability. The
Bank significantly contributed to policy discussions within the community of Development
Partners through mechanisms such as Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF)
and the Sector-Wide Approaches (SWAps) particularly in the sectors where the Bank was a lead
donor.

The PRSF-8 sought to increase the Government’s capacity to deliver on its priorities. The
conditions for disbursement included prior actions (critical to the success of a Government’s
program) which were satisfactory fulfilled before presentation of the program to the Board. The
triggers for the PRSF-9, embedded in the PRSF-8, not only stimulated the Government to adopt
and implemented policy reforms but also served as a benchmark against which the Government
delivered and contributed to institutional strengthening in many ways, particularly in
coordination and ensuring that line Ministries deliver on the commitments.

Bank Performance




                                               39
Overall, the Government views that Bank’s performance has been satisfactory as regards to
alignment with the EDPRS, engagement and valuable policy discussion and performance vis-à-
vis the general principles of making aid effective. The Bank has also been catalytic mostly in
critical areas where Rwanda was in sheer need of support including capacity building, social
protection, strengthening PFM systems and importantly as well in agriculture and private sector
development. The Bank was offered relentlessly implementation support to Government
institutions in the delivery of the key programs. The Bank has also been innovative in creating
synergies to attract required financing in the areas where resources are needed to stimulate policy
actions.

Government Performance (Borrower Performance)

The Government’s performance was rated satisfactory in the quality of implementation of
programs as well as coordination with Development Partners, toward the achievement of
development outcomes. This is evidenced by the delivery on outputs and outcomes that the
Government agreed with the Bank when the PRSF-8 was designed, and the monitoring and
evaluation mechanism that the Government jointly reviewed progress with Development
Partners.

In delivering on the programs supported by the Bank, Government’s commitment to
development outcomes has been catalytic to yield positive results that have impacted the
livelihoods of the people. For example, agriculture performance and improved business climate
and PFM stand out as a testimony to what financial support, combined with strong technical
follow-up by the Bank and commitment by the Government, could lead to strong results. In
addition to development outcomes that the Government and the Bank traced, external
evaluations by, for instance, the Global Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum
and Independent Evaluation of the Implementation of the PFM Reform Strategy 2008-2012,
validate the above progress.

Progress has also continued in relation to coordinating with Development Partners. Rwanda
stands out in enhancing aid effectiveness principles, particularly facilitating policy dialogue and
regular assessments on the performance of Government as well as Development Partners in the
commonly agreed frameworks of the CPAF and the Donor Performance Assessment Framework
arrangements.
