Program Development      The Financing of SDR 77.7 million (US$125.0 million equivalent) supports the
Objective(s) and         implementation of the Government of Rwanda’s (Government) medium-term
Contribution to the      development strategy—the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy
Country Assistance       (EDPRS) —within the context of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The
Strategy (CAS)           purpose of the proposed series of operations is to support Rwanda’s policies and
                         institutions aimed at attaining the sustainable growth needed to become a middle-
                         income country by 2020. The program development objective is to support the
                         development of policies that facilitate increased private sector investment and
                         involvement and ease constraints to broad based growth. Other supported reforms
                         include those needed to increase efficiency, transparency and accountability in the
                         public sector so as to ensure that resources are used more efficiently and effectively
                         to benefit all parts of the population, including the poor.
                         The proposed operation contributes to the strategic outcomes of the Country
                         Assistance Strategy (CAS) in the area of promoting economic growth, in particular
                         promoting sustainable growth and private sector development and continuing to
                         support improvements in service delivery with a focus on infrastructure services and
                         on increasing the availability of skilled labor. The operation will be complemented by
                         a planned sector budget support for social protection, to support the implementation
                         of the Government’s main social safety net program,Vision 2020 Umurenge (VUP),
                         as well as other investment and technical assistance operations. Policies supported
                         by the PRSF-8 draw on the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF)
                         for monitoring the EDPRS, to which all budget support donors in Rwanda adhere.

Risks and Risk   Key risks that could jeopardize the expected program outcomes and benefits are: (i)
Mitigation       regional and country-specific risks, (ii) vulnerabilities to external shocks and (iii)
                 program-specific risks.
                 Although stability has returned to the Great Lakes Region and Rwanda’s internal
                 security and political situation has also stabilized, a flare up of the conflict or changes
                 in the international perception about the state of political governance and human
                 rights in Rwanda could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic management,
                 including through a reduction in aid flows. Success in addressing this risk will depend
                 on the continued strong engagement of regional governments and the international
                 community. The Bank’s support for strengthened governance will continue within the
                 parameters laid down in its 2007 Governance and Anticorruption Strategy, including
                 collaborating on the finalization of the Joint Governance Assessment (JGA), and
                 support to strengthening the capacity of civil society and private sector actors.
                 Rwanda’s short to medium term outlook is vulnerable to external shocks as large
                 trade imbalances and heavy reliance on donor assistance persists. Government
                 recently developed an Export Strategy to address trade imbalances and is committed
                 to continue to protect priority spending from any potential reductions in overall
                 spending by redoubling revenue mobilization efforts. Financing provided through the
                 proposed PRSF is of discretionary nature and would enable Government to react to
                 external shocks. Although Rwanda is not directly affected by the drought that is
                 impacting other Eastern African countries, the situation is being carefully monitored
                 by the Authorities and the 2011/12 budget composition and spending remains flexible
                 to accommodate social safety net enhancements, if necessary. The PRSF can also
                 help mitigate some associated risk by contributing to macroeconomic stability
                 (through fiscal sustainability), supporting private sector development, and
                 maintaining a focus on key reforms. In the context of the Low-Income Country (LIC)
                 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) framework, the Bank will continue to monitor
                 the evolution of Rwanda’s debt indicators which are currently below set thresholds.
                 Implementation risks (e.g. lack of reform ownership, weak capacity) and fiduciary
                 risks are deemed low, given that Rwanda has established a very good track record of
                 reforms. Also, the proposed PRSF mitigates these risks with prior actions that are
                 aligned with the CPAF, as part of the EDPRS monitoring matrix and are thus directly
                 part of the reform program to which Government commits itself within each fiscal
                 year. International Development Association (IDA) supported projects provide direct
                 support to the Government’s fiduciary systems and contribute to higher fiduciary
                 standards for all Government transactions. Capacity constraints will be addressed
                 through the recently launched SCBI with support from the Africa Governance
                 Initiative and the World Bank to improve service delivery in key sectors, and
                 Government’s commitment to the broader civil service reform agenda. Additionally,
                 reforms with the goal of increasing the skills base of the population are supported by
                 the proposed PRSF.

               PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED EIGHTH
                  POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT FINANCING
                       TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA


                                         I.     INTRODUCTION
1.      The proposed Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Financing (PRSF-8) supports the
Government of Rwanda (Government) as it implements its medium-term strategy towards the
attainment of the Vision 2020. It supports the Government’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The EDPRS covers the
period 2008-2012 and provides a medium-term framework for achieving the country’s long-term
development aspirations as articulated in the Vision 2020. It describes the Government’s development
objectives of consolidating the achievements in rehabilitation and reconstruction and accelerating the
transformation to a middle-income nation with a knowledge-based economy. It presents a strategy
focused on growth and human development, with an emphasis on decentralization, and a greater role for
the private sector. The EDPRS priorities are articulated through three flagship programs aimed at
promoting sustainable growth and poverty reduction and improving governance.
2.       The proposed PRSF series anchors the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Rwanda, approved by the Board of Executive Directors on September 26, 2008. The core themes of the
proposed series are linked to the World Bank strategy for Africa: Africa’s Future and the World Bank’s
Support to It (2011), namely, the Competitiveness and Employment theme and the underlying foundation
of Governance and Public Sector Capacity. The PRSF-8 is the first of a proposed third programmatic
series of three PRSF operations. The Rwanda PRSF series is the Bank’s key policy dialogue instrument
and it provides a broad framework to support the reform process in Rwanda. In addition, it leverages
other Bank operations in areas supported under this series. The most recent, second, PRSF series 4-7
provided US$370.2 million between 2008 and 2011, supporting reforms in the agriculture sector,
infrastructure, education, the financial sector, and the management of public resources.1 The proposed
new PRSF series represents a continuation of the overall reform program supported under PRSF4-7, as it
carries on supporting the same underlying national development strategy.
3.       The program development objective is to adopt policies that facilitate increased private
sector investment and involvement and ease constraints to broad based growth. Supported reforms
to increase efficiency, transparency and accountability in the public sector include public financial
management to ensure that resources are used more efficiently and effectively to benefit all parts of the
population, including the poor. During the PRSF8-10 series priority will go to measures aimed at: (i)
supporting the facilitation of trade and investments; (ii) increasing access to electricity and improved
infrastructure services; (iii) raising private sector participation in the agricultural sector; (iv) increasing
the quality and relevance of education to build a skilled workforce; (v) improving service delivery
through focused and strategic civil service reform; and (vi) strengthening the management of public
resources, including increasing transparency and accountability.
 4.    In Rwanda a number of other donors provide general or sector budget support, the African
Development Bank (AfDB), the European Union (EU), Germany, the Netherlands, and the United

  The outcomes of the second PRSF series were assessed in the context of an Implementation Completion and Results Report
(ICR) and its main findings are summarized under the lessons learned section of this document. The second PRSF series was
supplemented with resources from the Crisis Response Window and complemented by the sector budget support, Community
Living Standards Credit (CLSC), to support reforms in health and the implementation of the Vision Umurenge Program (VUP).

Kingdom. In December 2008, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Government and
originally seven Development Partners was signed which governs the provision of budget support to
Rwanda. This MoU established the principle of joint monitoring of policy actions and expected outcomes
through the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) around two annual Joint Budget
Support Reviews (JBSRs), one forward-looking and one backward-looking. Since the signing of the MoU
all budget support donors, including the Bank, rely on the CPAF to design and monitor their budget
support programs. The PRSF 8 to 10 is aligned to the country’s CPAF. Prior actions for PRSF-8 were
agreed with the Government and are all part of the CPAF.
5.      The Rwandan economy is growing at a good pace, but continues to depend heavily on
agriculture activity and large public investments, financed by substantial foreign aid flows. Despite
the impact of the recent global economic crisis the average growth rate since 2008 is estimated at 7.6
percent annually. In 2010 growth reached 7.5 percent and is expected at 7.0 percent for 2011. The average
growth remained slightly below the EDPRS target of 8 percent and much of it is driven by spending
related to large aid-flows, heavy public investments and agriculture production. Existing sources of
growth need to be broadened to a more diverse and sustainable set of growth drivers. Rwanda did not
experience a drought, while other Eastern African countries are being seriously affected. Government’s
continued monitoring of the situation, together with already implemented macroeconomic policies and
contingency plans, address adequately potential impacts of global fuel and food price developments.
6.       Rwanda has made great strides toward addressing its development challenges in recent
years, yet private sector investment is insufficient to support sustained growth. The Government’s
articulated long-term vision is to transform Rwanda from a low-income agrarian economy to a medium-
income export-oriented economy, operating as a knowledge-based service hub by 2020. Despite
Rwanda’s success in having established a sound investment climate, foreign direct investments remain
low. The private sector is still overwhelmingly informal and plays a limited role in contributing to
economic growth. Private sector investment accounts for 12 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
compared to 14 percent in the region. Poor physical infrastructure is another major binding constraint to
increasing and diversifying exports of goods and services and further enhancing competitiveness. Rwanda
also experiences significant capacity and skills gaps in the private sector and across the Government
agencies that play significant roles in establishing the policy environment for private sector development.
 7.     Poverty still affects a large part of the population in Rwanda. According to the most recent
national household survey, carried out in 2006, 56.8 percent of the population in Rwanda lived below the
national poverty line. The majority of poor people live in rural areas. Overall, the provision of social
services and public goods is steadily improving, which is reflected in laudable achievements in the
extension of the provision of health and education services and significant progress towards the
achievement of related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
 8.     The Government of Rwanda is widely recognized as an ambitious reformer, but concerns of
partial citizen’s voice and accountability persist. Governance indicators are favorable and Rwanda is
known for its low levels of corruption. However, for some bilateral donors, issues of democratic
governance, political and media freedom and equal access to justice remain discussion items with the
Government and are regarded as factors in determining funding levels, including for budget support.
 9.      In June 2010, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) for Rwanda. It aims to consolidate macroeconomic stability while reducing
Rwanda’s aid dependency by: (i) maintaining a sustainable fiscal position through improved revenue
mobilization; (ii) strengthening monetary and exchange rate policies to ensure low and stable inflation;
(iii) reducing financial sector vulnerability by strengthening banking supervision and deepening the
financial sector by enhancing access to credit; and (iv) diversifying the export base and improving the
business environment. The second PSI review was completed successfully in June 2011.

                                           COUNTRY CONTEXT

10.     Rwanda continued in the 2010 post-election year its ambitious reform program. Results of
the February 2011 Government Kivu-retreat on strategic directions for the new fiscal year confirmed
continuity in key Government strategic areas. Successful macroeconomic management in the face of an
adverse external environment has strengthened Rwanda’s foundation. The Government presented a solid
2011/12 budget with continued emphasis on high public investment, with flexibility to address new
external threats and highlighting the importance of improving public services. The investment climate
agenda is continued to be implemented, while public financial management reforms will place additional
focus on improved budget execution and addressing fiduciary weaknesses.
11.     The bi-annual Government and Development Partners Meeting in November 2010 renewed
their mutual commitment with focus on enhancing quality and effectiveness of aid and acceleration
of private sector development to enable Rwanda to achieve its EDPRS targets. Progress has been
made in enhancing aid effectiveness, as measured through its Donor Performance Assessment Framework
(DPAF). However, Development Partners (DPs) are under considerable constraints to meet their global
aid commitments.
12.     The latest backward-looking JBSR, held early October 2010, concluded that Rwanda is
making good progress in terms of EDPRS implementation as targeted through indicators of the
CPAF. Overall progress on CPAF targets was reported as satisfactory with 75 percent of indicators fully
achieved and 5 percent partially achieved. Achievement of policy actions was also satisfactory with 80
percent achieved and 17 percent partially achieved.
13.      In November 2010, the Government organized with World Bank support a high level
investment forum emphasizing Rwanda’s attractiveness as an investment destination for
horticulture and tea. The event demonstrated Government’s efforts to accelerate Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) remain as of to date low, despite Rwanda’s continued strong ratings in investment
climate indicators. Since the forum the focus remains on facilitating investment deals for horticulture and
tea and on alleviating the continuing major constraints, including access to land, product certification, air
freight transportation.
14.      The mining sector is a source of significant export earnings, but production did not increase
in recent years and is largely artisanal. Rwanda wants to attract investment that will enable the
expansion of exploration, modernize mining methods and introduce mineral processing. There are views
that part of Rwanda’s exported minerals are coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC). If
so, the recent US Congress Bill on conflict minerals (effective since April 1, 2011) could threaten
Rwanda’s mineral exports. With World Bank support, the Government has set up a mineral tagging and
sealing scheme, internationally recognized as the International Tin Standard Certification (iTSCi)2
project. In March 2011 Cabinet passed legislation to prevent smuggling in mineral trade.
15.      The Government recently started developing a Strategic Capacity Building Plan with
support from the Africa Governance Initiative and the World Bank. The Government recognizes
that building the capacity of its institutions is essential for delivering its long term vision of development.
The initiative plans to combine service delivery and capacity building. Government aims to fast track
service delivery improvements with this initiative in key sectors of agriculture, energy, mining and private
sector investment. The World Bank committed to support the initiative with IDA16 funding and will do
so through the proposed PRSF series and a separate Technical Assistance operation.

 The iTSCi, an ITRI Tin Supply Chain Initiative is a project aimed at ensuring the traceability of minerals from the
source to the consumer. The ITRI is a not for profit membership based organization.

Overall trends

16.       Rwanda’s recent economic performance has
been remarkably strong given the difficult external                          Figure 1: Rwanda’s Real Growth Compared
                                                                                to EAC and SSA 2005-2011 (Percent)
environment. Despite these difficulties, the growth rate                  12.0
averaged 7.6 percent between 2008 and 2010, around two
percent higher than the East African Community (EAC)
and four percent higher than Sub Saharan Africa (SSA)                      8.0
(Figure 1). The services sector established itself as the main
growth engine with 10.0 percent average growth over the
same period. The industry sector was mostly impacted by
                                                                           4.0

Agriculture growth registered a healthy 6.3 percent average

As an effect, economic growth slowed down in 2009,

18.      Inflation peaked at the end of 2008 at 22.3
percent following global commodity hikes, declining until end-2010 and reached in August 2011, 7.5
percent year-on-year (Figure 3). Over 2009-10, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) followed a downward
trend to pre-crisis levels. As of December 2010, the CPI stood at 0.2 percent and year-on-year inflation
reached 2.3 percent for headline inflation and 1.5 percent for underlying inflation, respectively. In the first
half of 2011 the CPI (largely influenced by rising food and energy prices) slowly climbed up, reaching in
August 7.5 percent. Since August prices began to ease off and the overall CPI came down to 6.7 percent
in September.
19.      Looking forward, rising fuel prices are the biggest threat. Rwanda has been periodically
adjusting fuel prices at the pump in response to world oil market developments.3 Between 2008 and 2010,
fuel pump prices were reviewed seventeen times, resulting in an overall increase of 39.2 percent for
premium and 39.7 percent for diesel. Since May 2009, fuel prices started to climb steadily and since
January 2011 more rapidly, registering a more than ten percent increase in the first four months (Figure
4). This prompted Government to reduce fuel taxes by Rwf100 per liter as part of the 2011/12 budget,
starting with the implementation of a Rwf50 per liter reduction in July 2011.

 A committee consisting of Government and private sector representatives meets monthly to discuss and determine fuel prices
per liter at the pump.

Over the last three years, Rwanda’s economy experienced three              Figure 3: Inflation Trends 2008-11

shocks were manifested through the following channels:             25.0
inflationary pressures, decline in GDP growth, lower export
performance, and decline in remittances and FDI. These adverse     20.0

effects were partly mitigated by continuing strong donor inflows.

Lower export performance. In 2009, value of exports declined
by 12.2 percent as the country experienced a decline in the                                Information &
external demand for Rwandan goods and services (mainly for                               Telecommunication
tourism and minerals) and a slump of commodity prices,
particularly for minerals and coffee.                                                                      Other

    Tourism receipts. Visitor arrivals decreased by 7.4 percent,
                                                                                Wholesale and retail trade                                                      2009
     leading to a 6.2 percent drop in tourism receipts in 2009. All
     visitor arrivals’ categories recorded a slowdown, but arrivals              Agriculture, Forestry and                                                      2008

     percent drop in hotels and restaurants value added.                                          Construction

    Minerals. Rwanda’s minerals suffered from low production                    Accomodation and Food
     levels and international market prices fell dramatically.                         Services

     14.6 percent for wolfram. This led to a 39.5 percent                                             -10.0        0.0   10.0        20.0   30.0         40.0       50.0

     decrease in mineral exports’ value.
    Coffee. Coffee exports’ value recorded a 20.8 percent decrease, resulting from a 17.6 decrease in its export volume and 3.6
     percent decreases in average unit value. The volume decrease was largely due to a low phase in the coffee production cycle.
Remittances and FDI decline. Following the global financial crisis, net remittances declined by 55.3 percent to US$31.1 million in
2009 from US$69.5 million in 2008 and remained below the level before the onset of the global crisis in 2009 and 2010. The
effects of the global crisis impacted the FDI in 2010 with a 64.3 percent decline to US$42.3 million from US$118.7 million in 2009.

Fiscal Developments

23.      Government responded to the impact of the crisis with an expansionary stance.5 From the
2008 budget to the 2009/10 budget6, the overall deficit (excluding grants) increased from 10.0 percent of
GDP to 13.3 percent of GDP. Spending increases focused on priority sectors such as health, education
agriculture and infrastructure. Addressing the food price crisis Government launched in 2008 the CIP
which includes a fertilizer subsidization scheme with the goal to increase fertilizer use and agricultural
productivity. There is strong commitment from Government to an exit strategy for fertilizer provision,
which is also supported by the proposed PRSF series. It is envisioned that the private sector will develop
and gradually take over from Government. On the monetary side, a series of measures was taken to inject
liquidity into the economy through: (i) reverse repo operations in January 2009 (for the first time since
2004); (ii) gradually maturing all Treasury bills; (iii) reducing the reserve requirement ratio from 8 to 5
percent (February 2009); and (iv) introducing of refinancing facilities (in March, a 3-to-12-month facility
and in July, a 5-year-facility). Overall, an amount equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP (around Rwf30.0
billion) was injected in the banking system in 2009.
24.     Government embarked on a large strategic investment program to stimulate growth,
comprising six projects.7 A framework for implementing a Public Investment Program was approved in
2009 and a Public Investment Policy has been adopted. Efforts to ensure coordination of investments and
to establish an analytical base for prioritizing investments still needs to be supported with capacity
building in this area. The Bank is supporting a capacity building program in economic and financial
analysis to ensure that large investments will go through a rigorous vetting process.

  Since 2006, the Government had embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce poverty by improving education, health,
infrastructure facilities.
6
  The Rwandan fiscal year changed in July 2009 from calendar year to July 1–June 30 to harmonize with the East African
Community budget calendar. As a transition, the Government prepared a six month-budget known as 2009 mini budget.

  The six strategic investment projects are: (1) increasing household grid connections, including all public health centers and
administrative offices and 50 percent of schools; (2) creating a ICT infrastructure with high-capacity fiber-optic lines; (3)
rehabilitating/building a railway linking Rwanda to Burundi and Tanzania; (4) constructing a new airport conforming to
International Civil Aviation Organization standards; (5) expanding RwandAir and (6) constructing the Kigali Convention Center.

  Fiscal space is defined here as discretionary spending (that is, total expenditures and net lending minus wages & salaries,
interest payment, transfers and exceptional social expenditure).

26.      Despite the impact of the global crisis and unfavorable external conditions, domestic
revenues remained stable as a share of GDP, but low compared to the region. Domestic revenues
averaged 13.4 percent of GDP between 2007/08 and 2009/10, peaking at 14.9 percent of GDP in 2008.
The 2008/09 record stemmed from one-off non-tax revenues and receipts related to the sale of a
telecommunication operating license (in the amount of Rwf33.4 billion). For the following budgets,
domestic revenues reverted to its normal levels and reached 12.6 percent of GDP in the 2009/10 budget
and revenue mobilization remains lowest compared to Rwanda’s East African neighbors. Recent
measures to increase revenues focused on achieving higher compliance, facilitating trade and increasing
administrative efficiency including decentralization services of the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA). In
2009/10 RRA established three district branches in Kigali which provide services to taxpayers and eased
the payment of taxes through designated commercial banks. Efforts were also undertaken to recover
outstanding tax arrears. However, the revenue increase from these administrative measures was in
2009/10 largely consumed by temporary, lower-than–expected revenues from corporate income tax and
the permanent decline in taxes from international trade as a result of the implementation of trade
liberalization agreements with the EAC and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA). For 2010/11 domestic revenues are estimated at 13.6 percent of GDP. The Authorities
continue to follow an ambitious revenue target of 14.3 percent of GDP by 2012/13 by continuing to
implement tax administration reforms and introducing new tax policy measures.

27.     The Government is working closely with DPs to improve aid predictability as Rwanda’s
budget remains heavily reliant on grant financing. In 2010/11 about 39 percent of the entire
Government budget was grant financed. A large part of these grants is provided as budget support. After
reaching record levels in 2009/10 of 9.1 percent of GDP due to additional crisis support by donors,
budgetary grants decreased in 2011/12 to pre-crisis levels of around 6 percent (Table 2). At the same
time Government is persistently trying to increase aid predictability. One effort focuses on bringing the
considerable amount of aid from bilateral and vertical funds that is still delivered outside of the
Government system on-budget. The 2010/11 budget included for the first time Global Fund resources.
Following Government’s requests budget support donors now provide to the extent possible annual
commitments in time for the national budget formulation process and monthly disbursement plans. The
Government also encourages donors to increasingly use country systems, given the improvements in
Public Financial Management (PFM), as reflected in the most recent 2010 Public Expenditure Framework
Assessment (PEFA) (para 132 and Annex 4).
28.      Fiscal consolidation is a medium-term goal of the Government’s fiscal strategy, but
domestic revenues are not expected to cover recurrent expenditure before 2015/16. Fiscal
consolidation is anchored on increasing domestic revenue mobilization and on expenditure prioritization.
Given the overall prospect of declining grants and the still limited scope for domestic financing,
continued efforts to increase domestic revenue collection are crucial. The Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) still needs strengthening in the outer years and needs to follow a realistic set of
policy assumptions. Capacity needs to be build in order to improve medium-term macroeconomic and
fiscal projections.

30.     Lending interest rates continued to increase between 2008 and 2010 despite Central Bank’s
efforts to release more liquidity into the banking system by keeping the key repo rate low. The
policy rate was cut multiple times since 2009 to provide incentives to commercial banks to provide credit
to the private sector instead of investing in the money market. Nevertheless, money market activities
continued to increase and growth of credit to the private sector picked up less than expected, reaching
11.1 percent in 2010. The extensive issuance of Treasury bills to finance Government’s budget and high

level of lending rates, combined with the fact that most banks were strengthening the recovery process
and writing off bad loans, slowed down the credit growth. Over the period 2008-10, growth in credit to
private sector averaged 15.9 percent per year. Credit to the private sector grew 22.4 percent in 2007 and
31.9 percent in 2008, but dropped to 4.8 percent in 2009. Large withdrawals of deposits in 2008 had led
to a mismatch of credit maturities, i.e. borrowing and lending of banks (Box 1). As of August 2011 credit
to the private sector growth largely recovered, reaching 27.4 percent.
31.      Financial sector soundness improved between 2008 and 2010, corroborated by the results of
the recent joint IMF-Bank Financial System Stability Assessment of June 2011. The banking system
recovered from a period of restructuring in 2007 and 2008, leaving banks better capitalized, provisioned
and liquid, but still exposed to some risk. Banks are generally sufficiently capitalized, but some banks
exhibit more vulnerability due to large exposure risk in the form of concentrated corporate lending. To
date, all eight banks are in compliance with the minimum capital requirements of Rwf 5 billion
(approximately US$8.3 million). Asset quality improved and as the ratio of non-performing loans/gross
loans declined from 12.6 percent in 2008 to 11.3 percent by end of 2010. The framework for monitoring
and mitigation risks is still facing pressures due to limited human resources. Government’s strategy to
mobilize domestic savings and building an inclusive financial system in Rwanda, resulted in the
establishment of 416 Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs), creating a significant increase in
supervisory burden for BNR. 10 BNR is expanding its banking supervision department to provide adequate
oversight, but SACCOs still lack capacity and essential skills in small-scale banking and managing risks.

                 MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

32.     The economic outlook for 2011/12 is cautiously optimistic and the medium-term outlook
remains positive. Rwanda’s projected growth rate for 2011 is 7.0 percent, significantly higher than the
5.5 percent predicted for SSA or the 5.9 percent predicted for the EAC. However, this projected growth is
below the 7.5 percent for 2010, reflecting the external uncertainties regarding increasing international fuel
and food prices and the more cautious fiscal stance of the 2011/12 budget. Growth in the first half of 2011
reached only 5.3 percent due to low agricultural growth as a result of a disappointing first harvest. In the
medium-term growth is projected at around 6.5 percent (Annex 5). This growth is expected to be largely
driven by Government’s strategic investments and an increase in credit to the private sector (projected at
more than 20 percent for 2011).

private sector credit and investment could
hamper economic activity and business
expansion. In order to achieve high long-
term growth, private investment and private
sector activity need to increase. Government’s
strategy is using Special Economic Zones
(SEZ) as an economic policy tool to promote
private investment, industry and export. They
are seen as answer to existing key business
constraints such as availability of industrial
and commercial land, availability and cost of
energy, limited transport/linkages/market
access, ccomplexity of the taxation system,
availability of skilled labor and low cluster
development. The Kigali SEZ was established
in 2011 after the merger of the Kigali
Industrial Park and Kigali Free Zone (both
begun in 2008) and currently, the Rwanda
Special Economic Zones Ltd., a private
company with Government shares, is
developing the Zone.

2011 from the low 2010 levels to 7.5
percent, due to the rising international fuel
and food prices, and then stabilize around
5 percent in the medium-term. Rwanda is
currently not directly affected by the drought

through the hand-through of higher food
prices. At the national level, food and fuel

Payments as food and energy goods account for more than 45 percent in volume and 25 percent of value
of imported goods. At household level, rising food prices will most likely impact the poorest households
as they spend a large share of their income on food (Figure 10). According to the 2009 World Food
Program Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA) and Nutrition Survey the
proportion of total expenditure used for food items was the highest among households in the poorest
wealth quintile, making them most vulnerable (Figure 11). The Authorities signaled that the 2011/12
budget composition and spending would remain flexible to accommodate social safety net enhancements
as to be able to react to spill-over effects of adverse global developments in food supply and general price
levels. The most recent second harvest season is expected to surpass the yields of last year’s season by 16
percent. Government is also continuing to build up its strategic grain reserve from 10,000 tons in 2010 to
planned 40,000 tons by the end of 2011. The situation in regard to the potential impact of increased food
crop outflows as a result of increased cross border trade activities with Uganda and Kenya is being
monitored by the Authorities.

36.      The external sector will continue to be influenced by global economic and financial trends.
External balances continue to be vulnerable to export shocks, as they depend on a narrow export base.
There is a need for accelerated growth and diversification of exports. Government is making a concerted
effort to develop export sectors with higher added value growth potential including mining, tourism, and
horticulture, as reflected in the recent Export Strategy approved in April 2011. Additionally,
Government’s strategic investments projects have the primary objective to facilitate exports and services
by providing key infrastructure, and they are supported through several World Bank financed projects. A
World Bank Non-lending Technical Assistance for Private Sector Development provides a targeted
program of support to potential growth sectors in order to complement the infrastructure program. In the
medium-term imports are expected to record strong growth due to the ongoing Government strategic
investments and the associated requirement of capital goods for these projects. Import growth is expected
to outpace moderate expansion in exports. Consequently, the external current account deficit (including

percent in 2012 and then stabilize around 4.4 percent by 2014.
37.      In recognition of the uncertain global economic outlook and the volatilities concerning oil
and food prices the 2011/12 Government budget was themed Ensuring Food Security and Price
Stability Whilst Promoting Sustainable Growth. The budget contains a reduction in excise tax on fuel by
Rwf100 per liter for both petrol and diesel-to be implemented in two phases. This will not only mitigate
some of the impact of high world fuel prices, but will also help harmonize Rwanda’s highest regional fuel
tax rate with those of neighboring countries. In addition, the Government negotiated with other EAC
members to maintain a lower tax rate for imported food stuff as part of the EAC Common External Tariff
(CET). While the normal CET on rice is 75 percent it will remain for another year at 30 percent, for wheat
grain it will remain at zero compared to normally 35 percent, and for wheat flour it will be 35 percent,
compared to normally 60 percent.
38.      Fiscal medium-term objectives focus on consolidation following the large stimulus to
mitigate the global slowdown and a gradual replacement of official transfers by domestic revenue.
Government spending is projected to fall by 1.3 percent of GDP to 27.4 percent of GDP in 2011/12, for
the first time since the on-set of the crisis. Over the medium-term Government expenditure are expected
to stabilize around 23-24 percent. For example and as supported by the PRSF, Government is expected to
gradually exit agricultural input provision and fertilizer subsidization, and have the private sector take
over. Revenues are expected to increase, by 0.2 percent of GDP to 13.9 percent of GDP in 2011/12 and
beyond 15 percent of GDP by 2015/16. In the medium-term revenue performance is planned to improve
by continued support to economic development, widening of the tax base and increasing VAT
productivity. Immediate measures include the approval of legislation to transfer collection of social
security contributions to RRA, completing a study to widen the tax base through a flat tax and estimating
the potential revenue gap, and introducing an electronic tax registry to improve issuance of VAT invoices
by taxpayers. Government is continuing to sell of selected shareholdings in private companies (also
stimulating activity on the country’s new stock market). Grants are expected to start to decline in 2011/12
to 11.7 percent of GDP from 13.2 in 2009/10, before decreasing by about 1 percent of GDP in the
medium-term. The overall fiscal deficit (including grants) is projected to decline from 4.2 percent of
GDP in 2010/11 to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2011/12 and stabilize at 0.3 percent afterwards.

Debt Strategy (MTDS) which is expected to be finalized in late 2011. The MTDS would be used in
designing fiscal policy in 2012/13 and beyond. Further capacity building in performing debt sustainability
analyses is crucial in assessing and monitoring debt sustainability, especially when large infrastructure
projects with different financing options are being considered. To that end, Government plans to
strengthen the capacity to conduct their own DSAs using the Bank-Fund DSA template.
40.     The moderate rather than low rating of risk of debt distress is motivated by the
vulnerabilities stemming from Rwanda’s low export base. Under standard stress tests the ratio of Net
Present Value of external debt to exports breaches the relevant threshold in the near term but returns
below it by 2017. In that respect, the achievements to improve the business climate, and efforts to build
basic infrastructure and lift the export base—including through the implementation of the recently
adopted Export Strategy—are timely and would help mitigate those vulnerabilities over the longer term.

Export Strategy. Public investments to
improve agriculture productivity and infrastructure access, as well as capacity-building initiatives, such as
the Strategic Capacity Building Initiative (SCBI), should help establish the foundation for long-term
sustainable growth. However, continued high level of public investments coupled with the high level of
donor financing to the budget comprise a considerable fiscal risk. Revenue efforts need to be intensified,
in particular, in regard to tax policy measures that broaden the tax base. In order to keep external debt
dynamics sustainable, new non-concessional external borrowing for investments will need to be carefully
assessed in regard to economic viability and include private sector financing options. Rwanda’s track
record of prudent macroeconomic policies justified the transition to PSI-based IMF support in 2010.
Rwanda successfully completed the second review of the PSI in June 2011.

web-page of the Ministry of Finance. The Executive Budget Proposal is presented to Parliament as part
of the revised Budget Framework Paper, drafts of which are discussed before with Development Partners
that provide budget support and are approved by Cabinet. The legislative approval and enactment period
for both documents is in June. Gazetting as well as web-posting happens on the Ministry of Finance’s
external website before the start of the new fiscal year, on July 1.

43.     According to the most recent national household survey, carried out in 2006, national
poverty incidence decreased by 5.8 percent from 60.3 percent in 2001 and 2006 to 56.8 percent.
However, given the high population growth of 3.5 percent per year, the absolute number of people living
in poverty increased from 4.8 to 5.4 million, mainly in rural areas and in non-Kigali urban areas. Extreme
poverty incidence15 –reflecting people living below the food poverty line—was 37.8 percent of the
population. Lack of more new poverty data prevents an assessment whether recently experienced high
growth translated into significant poverty reduction in Rwanda. In November 2010 a new improved
national household survey, the Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV 3), was launched,
which is based on a monthly rolling survey to adequately address seasonality. It will deliver updated
poverty numbers by mid-2012.
44.      Rwanda has made progress toward the attainment of a number of MDGs, but MDG 1 on
poverty and hunger eradication and MDG 7 on ensuring environmental sustainability are unlikely
to be met (Table 4). According to the latest MDGs progress report (2010), three of eight MDGs are
classified as on track for being achieved, two as possibly achievable, and one as off track, while one
MDG is showing mixed result. In regard to MDG 1, poverty fell between 2000/01 and 2005/06, from
60.5 percent to 56.9 percent. However, a much faster reduction is needed to reach the MDG target of 30.0
percent. The 2009 CFSVA and Nutrition Survey noted that Rwanda has made progress in terms of
achieving food security but indicated that more investments are needed to sustain this progress. In regard
to MDG 7, Rwanda is facing pressures on its natural resources from the growing population, most evident
in land degradation, soil erosion, a decline in soil fertility, deforestation, wetland degradation and loss of
biodiversity. Further economic development will these increase environmental pressures through more
energy consumption, pollution and urbanization. Progress in increasing the proportion of population that
has access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities is slowly increasing.
45.      MDGs 2, 3 and 4 on education, gender equality and child mortality reduction are among the
better performing MDGs in Rwanda. The Government of Rwanda has made considerable progress in
expanding access to education, particularly to primary education, and has put in place ambitious strategies
to expand access to lower secondary education. Primary school enrolment increased by over 60 percent
since the mid-1990s and reached 94 percent in 2008, mainly due to the introduction of free primary
schooling. Primary completion increased in 2009 to 75 percent from 53 percent in 2008. If progress made
continues, then there is a possibility of the target being achieved. In regard to MDG 3, Rwanda achieved
gender equality. Within education, gender parity in literacy rate and gender enrolment parity at the
primary level have been achieved. Within the public arena, the number of woman in politics, parliament
and all decision making sharply increased over the last decade, supported by the Government target of 30
percent female representation. For example, to date, Rwanda women hold 56 percent of the seats in
Rwanda's Parliament, the highest percentage of women lawmakers in the world. Progress towards health
MDGs 4 and 5 has been remarkable, especially for child and maternal mortality rates, although none of
the health targets is yet close to being met. In 2005, the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) and infant
mortality rate (IMR) were 152 deaths and 85 deaths per 1,000 respectively while maternal mortality rate
(MMR) was 750 deaths per 100,000 live births. Data from the 2008 Demographic Household Survey
suggests that these rates may have already fallen to 103 for U5MR and 32 for IMR. Preliminary data from
the 2010 Demographic Household Survey show 69 percent of births were attended by skilled heath
personal (compared to the target of 90 percent by 2015).

III.       RWANDA’S ECONOMIC AND POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY
  Rwanda’s Development Strategy
  46.      The EDPRS is the country’s medium-term development plan for 2008-2012. The EDPRS
  was completed and adopted by the Government in September 2007, and submitted to the IMF and World
  Bank as Rwanda’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.16 The EDPRS is the Government’s second-generation
  Poverty Reduction Strategy setting out the country’s objectives and major policies, and redefining the
  country’s priorities for five years. Rwanda’s first PRSP covered the period 2002-2005 and was elaborated
  in a post-conflict environment, where the primary emphasis was on managing a transitional period of
  rehabilitation and reconstruction. The EDPRS makes the case for consolidating and extending the
  decentralization of public spending when accompanied by robust accountability mechanisms. The EDPRS
  recognizes the key role of the private sector in accelerating growth in order to reduce poverty. The

       The Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note (Report No. 42149-RW) was presented to the Board in February 2008.


                                                                   18
strategy provides a medium-term framework for achieving the country’s long term development goals and
aspirations as embodied in the Rwanda Vision 2020 objectives. Rwanda’s long term development vision
is to become a lower middle income economy (US$900 per capita) operating as a knowledge-based
service hub by 2020.
47.     The Government produced the EDPRS over a period of 18 months following an extensive
process of consultation with stakeholders from across Government and domestic and international
partners, including donors, civil society and the private sector. The national coordination mechanism
involved provincial and district level steering committees which ensured participation at grass-root levels
through citizens’ representatives. Their results fed into the discussion of then 15 Sector Working Groups
(SWGs), which are now the implementation monitoring mechanisms of the EDPRS. Results of the
discussion and identification of priorities by the SWGs on the themes of growth, human, rural
development and governance fed into the work of Technical Steering Committees, which played the
principal coordinating role in the EDPRS formulation. Based on their high-level recommendations the
National Steering Committee, consisting of Ministers and Provincial Governors, guided the prioritization
across sectors.
48.       This participatory process, together with lessons from the first PRSP resulted in four
underlying objectives for the EDPRS: (i) increase economic growth, (ii) slow down population growth,
(iii) tackle extreme poverty, and (iv) ensure greater efficiency in poverty reduction. The EDPRS assigns
the highest priority to accelerating growth to create employment and generate exports. The strategy is
framed around three strategic flagship programs: (1) Growth for Jobs and Exports, (2) Vision 2020
Umurenge (an integrated rural development program to eradicate extreme poverty and release the
productive capacities of the poor)17, and (3) Governance. The implementation of the EDPRS will require
total resources of Rwf5,151 billion over the five-year period 2008-12. The financing gap amounts to
RwF352 billion, equivalent to US$700 million (or an average of US$ 140 million per year).
49.      EDPRS progress is being monitored jointly by the Government and its Development
Partners. Monitoring and evaluation of the EDPRS is based on a Results and Policy Matrix, developed
at the national level with inputs from each of the now 17 SWGs of the EDPRS. Monitoring of the
EDPRS progress takes place two times a year in the context of the Joint Sector Reviews (JSRs) and is
subsequently validated by the JBSR. Donors providing budget support coordinate with Government to
jointly monitor progress in EDPRS implementation through use of the CPAF.
50.      Rwanda's performance is impressive when looking at the number of indicator targets which
have been met, as well as the number of policy actions which have been implemented up to date.
The interests and needs of local communities are represented through the results of the Ubudehe process
(community based participatory planning, monitoring and feedback), Imihigo, performance contracts
between District Mayors and the President, citizen report cards and score cards, and direct participation of
civil society organizations in the SWGs. Many sectors are now in a position to systematically monitor
progress towards achieving the EDPRS targets.
51.      The proposed PRSF operation supports the EDPRS and its underlying growth strategy. The
proposed PRSF-8 operation is coordinated with the CPAF and all PRSF-8 prior actions are part of the
CPAF (Annex 3). In line with the intention to give a more prominent role to SWGs and to increase the
focus of the overall JBSR, consultations and discussions are held at sector level prior to each JBSR.
SWGs, each chaired by a lead Government institution and co-chaired by a lead donor, monitor and report
on their respective sector results and policy matrices. Sectors produce sector performance reports (around
EDPRS, CPAF and budget indicators), which are subsequently discussed in JSRs. Based on these
discussions, summaries of sector performance over the fiscal year are signed by the co-chairs.

 IV.     CONTRIBUTION AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM POVERTY
                    REDUCTION SUPPORT 4 TO 7
            KEY POLICY REFORMS AND RESULTS ACIEVED UNDER PRSF 4-7

52.      The PRSF 4 to 7 series had two pillars, aligned with the two Flagships of the EDPRS: (i)
growth for jobs and exports; and (ii) improving economic governance and development implementation
capacity. In the first area, the main focus was on (a) development of labor force skills through better post
basic education; (b) removing constraints to growth and increasing access in electricity, water, transport;
(c) improving agricultural productivity; and (d) deepening and broadening the financial sector. In the
governance area, the operations focused on (a) improving Public Financial Management (PFM) and
procurement at the national and local levels; (b) strengthening fiscal decentralization, and (c) promoting
civil service reform to build skills incentives and retention.

Results Achieved in Supported EDPRS Flagship Area 1: Growth for Jobs and Export

53.     The PRSF-4, 5 and 7 supported reforms designed to lay the foundation for a comprehensive
program to enhance the skills of the labor force. Among the results achieved are the development of a
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system. The Poverty Reduction Support Grant
(PRSG) 5 supported the publication of the TVET Policy in 2008. Based on the policy, the development
and costing of the TVET strategic plan is being finalized. A strategic framework has been elaborated for
Post Basic Education (PBE) with an emphasis on improving quality in secondary and higher levels of
education, including TVET. The PRSF-7 supported the critical step of costing of PBE through the
revision of the Education Sector Strategic Plan. The related output indicator, transition from basic
education to upper secondary education increased since 2008 to over 90 percent, above target (Annex 2).
Outcomes capturing actual improvements in PBE and skills are expected to materialize under a longer
timeframe.
54.      In the energy sector, the PRSG-4 and 5 supported Government in establishing a
transparent regulatory framework, reducing service cost, and introducing a sustainable framework
for coordinating and financing investments. As prior action for PRSG-6 the Project Management
Directorate for the implementation of the National Electricity Rollout program was established and made
operational in the Rwanda Electricity Corporation, consolidating within the corporation all existing
project-specific Project Coordination Units. The PRSF-7 supported the electricity tariff and cost service
study, which recommends a new structure and tariff for various customer groups balancing the cost of
service and socio-economic considerations to protect the poor and support economic growth. The
Government has either met or exceeded its own targets over the past years in the energy sector (Annex 2).
In the case of electricity, the number of electricity subscriptions increased from 91,332 in 2006 to 110,000
connections in 2008 and in 2009/10 an additional 49,516 customers have been connected, in both years
exceeding the targets. The number of mega watt (MW) of electricity generated was 84MW in 2009/10
against a projected target of 80MW (Annex 2).
55.      In the road sector, the PRSG-4 and 5 supported the establishment of a framework for
regular maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network through the adoption of the Road
Maintenance Strategy. Financing to ensure sustainability in maintenance is a critical factor for the upkeep
of the road network. As a result, Government intended to increase the fuel levy collected through the
Road Fund. In 2009, The PRSG-6 supported the Government in progressively increasing the Fuel Levy
up to 10 cents per liter over the period June to August. The related indicator is the percent of Classified
District Road Network in Good Condition, which slightly missed its target of 28 percent, increasing to 23
percent in 2009/10 (Annex 2).




                                                    20
56.      The PRSG-4 and 5 have supported reforms to improve planning and financing of
maintenance in the water sector. Starting with the 2008 budget, the PRSG-4 supported mainstreaming
of water supply and water resource management. In line with the more coordinated approach for
integrated water resource management, there has been a consolidation of responsibility for all aspects of
water and sanitation management under one ministry. Under PRSG-5, the development of a water
information system and the management information system was a prior action. A Water Supply and
Sanitation Policy, supported by PRSG-6, presents the sector's approach on how to achieve the Vision
2020, MDGs and EDPRS objectives, and breaks them down into concrete principles, objectives and
actions. The related indicator of proportion of households with access to clean drinking water increased
steadily each year, exceeding the target in 2009/10 (Annex 3). A critical step was the elaboration and
adoption of a tariff structure to ensure effective operation, efficient service delivery and financial viability
of the newly restructured water utility, supported by PRSF-7. It should help reduce the need for annual
budgetary support from the Treasury. The tariff setting mechanism also takes into consideration
affordability and social constraints (poverty focus) or equity as major policy priorities.
57.      The second PRSF series supported the Government’s main areas of reform in agriculture,
to strengthen soil and water conservation and irrigation, and reforms to develop a private sector led
fertilizer distribution system. PRSG-5 supported the completion of eight feasibility studies (exceeding the
target of four), including assessment of pilots and mapping out of 34 sites for watershed management.
The related indicator, proportion of arable land sustainably managed against soil erosion increased from
45 percent in 2008 to 81 percent in 2009/10 (Annex 3). The PRSF-6 and 7 supported Government’s
actions to strengthen the private fertilizer distribution system. Along with efforts to improve private sector
engagement in the distribution of improved inputs, there was also a critical need to support farmers in
their effective use of these inputs. To complement the actions to improve the extension system, there was
a need to elaborate a strategic action plan for capacity support to farmers. Therefore, the PRSF-7
supported the development, costing and initiation of an action plan for capacity building of private sector
agro-dealers in input procurement and distribution, particularly at decentralized levels. The related
indicator, mineral fertilizer use (in tons) performed well in recent years, and was in 2009/10 achieved
with 90.6 percent of its target fulfilled (27,900 compared to the targeted 30,800).
58.      The previous PRSF series supported Government's efforts to improve access to financial
services, with a focus on micro-finance and rural finance. Under PRSG-4, a Policy on Microfinance
and a related law were developed in line with international good practice. The PRSG-5 supported the
signing of a MoU between BNR and the Ministry of Agriculture to fund investments in the rural sector,
through the second Rural Investment Facility. PRSF-7 supported the adoption of a comprehensive
framework of support to SMEs. The Bank also supported the modernization of the payment systems, a
critical action to support increased banking and monetization of the economy. The PRSG-6 and PRSF-7
supported the adoption by Parliament of a Law Governing Payment Systems in the Financial Services
Sector, and development by the Central Bank of the associated regulations. The related indicator, credit to
the private sector was achieved at 95.6 percent in 2009/10 (actual 11.8 percent of GDP compared to the
target of 12.2 percent of GDP).

Results Achieved in Supported EDPRS Flagship Area 3: Governance

59.      In PFM the second PRSF series focused support on Government’s actions to improve
transparency through the strengthening of the budget monitoring and reporting system. Under
PRSG-5, the Public Books module of SmartGov was finalized. Development of the Integrated Personnel
and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) was seen as an extremely important step in strengthening the
Government’s ability to manage resources within the public sector. The prior action for PRSG-6
supported the adoption of the Payroll Module (subsystem) of the IPPIS which was subsequently installed
in central Government ministries as part of the reform program supported by the proposed PRSF-8. It will
allow producing a consolidated financial statement with fully and transparently capturing wages and



                                                      21
salaries in the system, eliminating potential errors or misuse of resources. PRSF-7 supported the piloting
of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) in central government and
integrated it with the IPPIS. One of the related CPAF indicator (but not a PRSF indicator), PEFA PI-25
on the timeliness and quality of financial statements (Annex 4) did not improve, but deteriorated, in the
recent 2010 PEFA (as compared to the 2007 PEFA).
60.      The second PRSF series supported the Government in its effort to develop its capacity and
systems of procurement. For example, the prior action for PRSG-6 was that at least eighty percent of all
procurement agencies submit a procurement plan that is consistent with their allocated budget proposal, to
the Ministry of Finance, and the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority publishes at least 60 percent of
such plans on its website. In order to reinforce progress made to improve procurement practices and
transparency, PRSF-7 supported the Cabinet approval of the amendments the Procurement Law with the
goal to increase efficiency and transparency of public procurement. Overall, Rwanda was successful in
establishing an institutional and legal framework for oversight of procurement that is in line with
internationally accepted standards. The related CPAF indicator, the proportion of the value of
procurement tendered competitively or justified reached 100 percent in 2009/10, above the 87 percent
target.
61.      In decentralization, PRSG-4 supported the adoption of budget software at district levels
and the production of the first budget execution report by districts (for the period January to June
2007). Government has also adopted various community based monitoring and accountability
arrangements to promote increased accountability. The production of citizen report cards is one means of
engaging the local citizens in improving service delivery. PRSG-6 supported the assessment of service
delivery at local level with citizen report cards and community score cards. The results of the nationally
representative citizen report / community score cards ranked administration highest and infrastructure and
agriculture services the lowest in terms of satisfaction. Government also has taken steps to build a new
local administrative structure and local capacity. PRSF-7 supported the adoption and operationalization of
a comprehensive 5-year capacity building strategy for local Government. The related indicator, the
proportion of districts achieving a minimum of 80 percent of their service delivery and development
targets, progressed positively and exceeded its target of 65 (achieving 67 percent) in 2009/10.
62.      The second PRSF series supported skills development and staff retention in the civil service,
and strengthened coordination of functions and structures. The prior action for PRSG-6 was Cabinet
approval of the Organic Framework reflecting agreement between the Ministry of Public Service and
Labor and all central government ministries on staffing levels and ministerial structures for optimal
performance within fiscal limits. The Government also recognizes stronger systems of performance
management, career progression and pay harmonization need to be developed in order to recruit and
retain skilled and dedicated people in the public service. It is seen as critical to develop a comprehensive
and affordable Pay and Retention Policy. Therefore, PRSF-7 supported the Cabinet approval of the
General Statutes for the Public Service, a milestone towards the finalization of the more comprehensive
Pay and Retention Policy. The draft law approved by the Cabinet includes performance-related pay rules
and proposes to introduce a bonus system for public servants linked to their annual performance reports,
in the interest of increasing retention.

                                         LESSONS LEARNED
63.     The proposed Rwanda PRSF series comprises three annual, single-tranche operations
within a programmatic framework that reflects good practices and lessons learned in budget
support and development effectiveness. The reform program supported by these PRSF operations has
been underpinned by analytic and diagnostic work (para. 77), policy dialogue by Bank staff and policy
collaboration with development partners —involving both budget support and non-budget support
partners (para.80). The proposed program complements, and is reinforced by Bank sectoral investments
and a diverse trust fund portfolio (para.75).


                                                    22
64.     Findings from the second PRSF series are that it proved to be effective in advancing
Government-owned reforms, providing substantial financing and fostering better donor
coordination. The PRSF series has provided important support to the Government to operationalize its
ambitious medium-term development strategy (i.e., the EDPRS) by translating its objectives into priority
actions. The PRSF series also provided substantial financing to Rwanda’s budget, US$370.2 million
between 2008 and 2011. Since Rwanda depends on highly concessional financing, not just to cover an
ambitious investment program, but also to cover parts of the recurrent budget expenditures, budget
support grants provide a preferred contribution to Rwanda’s overall financing needs. The Authorities are
looking to the World Bank and other development partners as a source of continued financing in meeting
these needs. Finally, the second PRSF series has improved harmonization and reinforced support for
reforms among the country’s budget support donors.
65.     The recently prepared Implementation Completion and Result report (ICR) for the PRSF 4
to 7 series found that performance with respect to progress towards development objectives has
generally been satisfactory or highly satisfactory. Performance for most indicators was satisfactory or
highly satisfactory, with one indicator being rated moderately satisfactory in 2010. The series as a whole
was found to be relevant, both at the time of design and in hindsight, to support Rwanda’s EDPRS key
objectives of (i) promoting growth for jobs and exports; and (ii) strengthening governance. The design of
the PRSF 4 to 7 was in general assessed as satisfactory with potential for improvements in a few areas.
66.      As the PRSF series has progressed, so the reform agenda evolved, but remained overall
broad. This is attributable to the breadth of the Bank’s policy dialogue with Government, but also
reflects the recognition by policy-makers of the utility of budget support, including the PRSF series, in
helping to move the reform process forward. While the series set-out to support the second generation
EDPRS, the process of designing the reform program as well as its timing, evolved in ways that were not
foreseen at the outset. For example, a major change over the course of the series was the finalization of
the CPAF in December 2008 and the subsequent alignment of all donor budget support, including the
PRSF series with it. The PRSG-5 operation was the first operation that aligned the series with the CPAF.
A second major change was the shift in the Rwandan fiscal year from calendar year to July 1-June 30 in
2009. As a result two out of the four operations were not well aligned with the Rwandan budget
preparation cycle. The re-alignment with the Rwandan budget year is expected to be resolved during the
proposed series.
67.     The broad scope of the Government of Rwanda reform agenda, reflected in the CPAF,
revealed tensions in the design and strategic use of the PRSF series. While the CPAF (Annex 3)
contains a number of outcome indicators, which other donors use as their condition for budget support
disbursement, the policy actions formulated in the CPAF are by design more process-oriented and, at
times, seem not linked closely to the outcome indicators. For Government the goal of these policy actions
is to be able to monitor if key milestones are being achieved, thus, helping the Government to track
progress over the year towards fulfillment of key multi-year outcome indicators. For example, in
agriculture the PRSF-8 will support an important chain of policy actions under the CPAF outcome
indicator mineral fertilizer used (Annex 2), some of which are process-oriented, but all with a clear goal
to build a sustainable private sector-based fertilizer distribution system over a very short period, leading
to tangible changes in how an important agricultural input will be financed and distributed to farmers.18
68.    Overall, the themed focus on production increase as main growth and export driver has
been appropriate and the proposed series should continue with support in this area. This would

18
   PRSF-8 will support the publication of results and lessons learned of an evaluation study of the fertilizer strategy. PRSF-9 will
support the amendment of the fertilizer strategy, including the exit strategy for MINAGRI in input distribution and subsidization,
based on the evaluation study. PRSF-10 will endorse a regulatory framework for fertilizer importers/wholesalers, dealers,
retailers, i.e. the private sector which will take fertilizer distribution over from the Government. (This builds on reforms started
under the previous PRSF series, where PRSF-7 supported the development, costing and initiation of an action plan for capacity
building of private sector agro-dealers in input procurement and distribution, particularly at decentralized levels.)


                                                                23
imply for the next series a continued, rather indirect treatment of exports, although more attention could
be given to reducing overall transport transit and transactions costs for imports and exports, which are an
important determinant of overall competitiveness. Previous analytical work noted the importance of
expanding production capacity as a precondition to increased exports. The previous and the proposed
operation therefore focus on infrastructure access and increasing agriculture productivity, but also skills.
For example, in agriculture, sustainable access to inputs, like fertilizer, is crucial. As production expands,
issues related to processing, handling, storage, etc. will increasingly require attention, which is also
reflected in the SWG dialogue on future CPAF indicators and the program supported by the new series.
69.     Through the successful implementation of the PRSF series 4 to 7, investment projects and
analytical work on Rwanda, a number of lessons have been learned. First, the CAS Progress report
summarizes lessons from previous strategy implementation, underlining the importance of capacity
building and the need to continue to explore synergies within the World Bank Group. Second, given the
capacity constraints of a small, but reform-oriented Government the principles of selectivity, ownership
and predictability -applicable across countries—are emphasized in Rwanda. Finally, there needs to be
better coordination with the monitoring and evaluation system for the EDPRS, and in the case of the
PRSF series, the CPAF process. Coordination of policy actions under the CPAF framework is expected to
continue to be a main challenge: other partners do not assign such as high value as to the degree the Bank
does to them, and as a result are not as concerned with issues related to quality of the policy actions.
During the second PRSF series, the Bank team was able to convince Government and donors to include
policy actions in the CPAF and the usefulness of the actions was acknowledged, particularly during the
JBSR. However, Government and other partners still regard this as the Bank focusing more on its
bureaucratic requirements and less on outcomes.
70.     In order to minimize tensions between the World Bank, the Government and other
Development Partners over the choice, formulation and timing of CPAF policy actions, specific
measures are proposed. On the Bank-side continued participation of sector staff in policy discussions
within SWGs during the biannual JSRs is necessary, especially on the occasion of the forward looking
JSRs in April each year, when policy actions can be defined for the upcoming two years. Given the
complex and time-compressed process, representation of respective sector staff in-country is crucial to
contribute to progress. Within the Bank, better coordination and greater guidance which acknowledges
the on-the-ground limitations related to the adherence to broader partnership frameworks will be required.
On the SWG-side, the capacity of chairs and co-chairs and key sector ministry staff needs to be
strengthened further to adequately present sector ministries’ needs and priorities during policy and budget
discussions and to better facilitate and coordinate SWG discussions with inputs also being prepared on a
more timely basis. Overall, the CPAF process might warrant review and adjustments as part of the
EDPRS 2 preparation.
71.     Given these lessons learned, best practices on conditionality were applied to the Rwanda
country context (Box 5). These principles are also reflected in the CPAF, which contains specific
actions and outcomes for PRSF-8 (Annex 3).




                                                     24
                            Box 5: How the PRSF Reflects Good Practices Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership. The Government of Rwanda has a strong track record in committing to and implementing
reforms. The PRSF supports the Government’s program, the EDPRS, which was developed in a participatory manner involving
extensive consultation of a wide range of stakeholders (including civil society, farmers’ organizations, and Non Government
Organizations -NGOs). The process was led by a National Steering Committee, comprised of Ministers and Governors, providing
high level guidance. Furthermore, Government coordination with development partners and its preferred modality for donor funding
is defined in the Aid Policy that articulates the Government’s vision for improved aid management and policies
Principle 2: Agreement upfront with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework. Under the Government’s leadership and working closely with development partners, a common performance
assessment framework was completed and adopted in 2008. The CPAF is based on the policy matrix of the EDPRS and
represents a time bound and monitorable action plan (Annex 3). The CPAF matrix serves to monitor progress under the reform
program supported by the PRSF series. In addition, the Government and the budget support donors have agreed to use the PEFA
as a common assessment framework for progress in PFM.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances. The PRSF
series is fully aligned with the EDPRS priority areas. It benefits from the extensive consultations that were led by Government in
identifying priority areas for the EDPRS. PRSF preparation also benefited from the extensive consultations through the SWGs of
the EDPRS implementation process. Each key sector of the EDPRS (and therefore of the PRSF) coordinates its sector policies
through a SWG. SWG membership includes both Government and non-government representation (i.e. donors, civil society, local
organizations and NGOs).The PRSF can be seen as the overall umbrella for Bank support and policy dialogue, which is
complemented by specific projects providing focused investment assistance. Rwanda has established a track record in budget
support and project implementation, therefore budget support is seen as a good instrument to address a broader range of issues
while strengthening the Government’s systems.
Principle 4: Choose actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The PRSF focuses on selected
triggers and prior actions, representing critical steps for implementing the Government’s program. They are based on the EDPRS
policy matrix and evolved from extensive discussion with the Government and other relevant stakeholders.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial support. A
full review of the program takes place in line with the reviews agreed in the MoU between the Government and the budget support
donors. JBSRs take place twice a year, aligned with the budget cycle. A secretariat in MINECOFIN has taken over the lead role in
coordination and preparation of the reviews. In addition, SWGs conduct sector reviews, aligned with the budget cycle, and which
form the basis for the JBSR.



       V.       BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY
                                                       LINK TO CAS

72.    The proposed operation is in alignment with the Rwanda CAS, discussed by the Board in
August 2008. The CAS is framed around two strategic pillars: (i) promoting economic transformation
and growth; and (ii) reducing social vulnerability. It is closely aligned with the EDPRS and follows the
Government’s preferences for engagement with the Bank in coordination with other donors.
73.     The CAS Progress Report (February 2011) confirmed that performance towards CAS
outcomes has been largely positive, although important challenges remain. A new CAS (FY13-16) is
expected in FY12, but no major portfolio changes are expected. The Bank’s priority engagement is in the
sectors of agriculture, energy, and transport (including ICT), following broadly the Government’s
proposed Division of Labor (DoL) from July 2010. While the Bank will no longer provide direct
financing in some sectors such as health and education, it will nonetheless continue to be a silent partner
in social protection and support crosscutting areas including skills development, private sector
development, employment and demobilization. Going forward and in line with the DoL, much of the
focus shall be on promoting economic transformation and increasing growth, especially for exports.
74.     The focus of the PRSF series is on the first CAS strategic theme: promoting Rwanda’s
economic transformation for sustained growth. Within this theme, the PRSF will support the CAS
outcome indicators (1.1) agricultural production—particularly for food crops—sustainably raised; (1.2)
improved access to and quality of key infrastructure services; (1.3) improved environment for private
sector development; and (1.4) capacity to manage public resources–at central and local levels—
strengthened. In support of the second CAS strategic theme, reducing social vulnerability, a parallel
Development Policy Operation will support the Government’s implementation of its social protection
strategy.



                                                               25
            PORTFOLIO RELATIONSHIP AND ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

75.      The PRSF supports other parts of the Rwanda portfolio, including various investment
projects in different sectors (Annex 8). The PRSF and the reform areas covered by it complement a
portfolio with a strong emphasis on improved agriculture production and infrastructure (transport, energy
and ICT) to increase growth and exports, and ensuring appropriate management of public resources at
central and local levels. In all these areas the Bank has a range of active instruments and works in
partnership with other donors to support the implementation of the Government’s strategy through
investment financing, technical assistance and capacity building (Figure 12). The PRSF addresses in
particular the need to provide a policy complement to sectoral investments financed by Bank projects,
such as the Skills Development Project, the Electricity Access Scale-up Project, Land Management, Water
Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation Project and the Public Sector Capacity Building Project.
76.     Non-lending activities play a key role in supporting the implementation of PRSF activities,
as they focus on capacity building. For example, a recently finalized multi-year Technical Assistance
(TA) program in support of improving public expenditure management continues to play a major role in
implementation of PRSF activities by prioritizing the measures needed to improve the quality of
spending. It also provided capacity building assistance to the Government for the institutionalization of
the Public Expenditure Review (PER) process. A new Governance and Competitiveness TA will support
capacity building in the public and private sector to improve corporate governance, strategic capacity
building and value chain development for identified export sectors. Most importantly, the portfolio
contains TA support to all SWGs which the Bank co-chairs, which is providing resources for Bank staff
co-chairs to ensure adequate preparation and participation in the JSRs, a key pre-condition for a
successful PRSF series.
77.      The preparation of the third series of PRSF built on a broad program of analytical work
carried out over the last years (Figure 12). That work has informed the EDPRS preparation and
subsequent implementation to which the proposed operation is closely aligned. It has also contributed to
the design of Bank operations, as the PRSF. Findings from analytical work fundamentally related to
specific areas of the PRSF are summarized below and are also discussed in section IV, which describes
the proposed operation and series. Overall, the most important analytical foundation for the design of the
series was provided by work on the assessment of economic growth and of the development of the private
sector. It provided important insights on potential sources and constraints of growth, which are selectively
addressed through reforms supported by the proposed PRSF series.
78.      The 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) highlighted the importance of agriculture in
sustaining economic growth, and, together with the 2007 Agriculture Policy Note (APN), identified low
input use, poor water management and soil conservation along with insufficient capacity support as major
critical constraints to raise productivity. The poor state of infrastructure, particularly electricity, transport,
and water, limit the development of the manufacturing and services sectors while the low base of skilled
labor and limited access to finance are cross-cutting issues in all sectors. In addition to the CEM and
APN, the 2009 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) and 2005 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study
(DTIS) stressed the need to build and maintain the stock of infrastructure and skills, to increase access to
finance in order to sustain economic growth. The 2007 APN identified the lack of skilled workers,
particularly vocationally training, as one of the underlying causes of the low profitability in the
agriculture sector. The ICA pointed out the lower productivity in manufacturing sector, coupled with
higher wage premium from skill shortages, leads to higher labor cost and reduced competitiveness of
Rwandan firms in the regional market. Furthermore, the 2010 Education Country Status Report
highlighted as a strategic priorities to achieve the education sector objectives is the expansion of access to
high-quality and demand-driven TVET.
79.    Upcoming analytical work for key sectors will deepen the understanding in regard to
improving competitiveness and employment and growth creation. In particular, ongoing and future

policy dialogue will build on the Employment and Growth Economic Sector Work (scheduled for delivery
in FY2013) which comprises a number of policy notes, including on the demography of economic
growth, and how the identified key growth sectors of mining and tourism could contribute to employment
creation and future growth and wealth creation. Other analytical work includes background papers (e.g.
planned on energy, remittances and Diaspora financing) for the special themes covered under the bi-
annual Rwanda Economic Updates, the report on the Rwanda Household Enterprise Survey (FY2012),
the Post Basic Education and Training in Rwanda (FY2012), the Rwanda Study on Developing
Sustainable Public Sector Capacity for Rwanda's Growth and Competitiveness Economic Sector Work
(FY2012), a Land Sector Study (FY2012) and other studies.

                     COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

80.     The World Bank and the IMF continue to work closely together to ensure program
coordination and consistency in advice provided to the Authorities. Regular DSA updates, in close
collaboration with the IMF and in consultation with the Government, aim to ensure debt is managed
consistently with macroeconomic stability. While the Fund takes the lead on the macroeconomic policy
dialogue, the World Bank takes the lead in the dialogue on long-term growth, public financial
management, social and poverty analysis, and sector-specific composition of spending and alignment with
the EDPRS. The macroeconomic framework presented in this document is consistent with the one used
for the recent joint-Fund-Bank DSA and the second PSI review, which was concluded successfully in
June 2011. The proposed PRSF operation supports a subset of the Government’s reform program which is
complementing the IMF’s PSI and budget support operations provided by other donors.
81.     Rwanda has a high level of donor engagement19 and Government is proactive in improving
aid coordination and aid effectiveness. A considerable amount of aid is still bypassing Government
budget. The Government attached high priority to better donor coordination and was the key driver
behind the establishment of the DPAF, the CPAF for budget support donors and a number of other donor
coordination fora.
82.      A yearly DPAF review assesses the performance of bilateral and multilateral donors against
a set of indicators on the quality and volume of development assistance to Rwanda. The DPAF
exercise is based on donor reporting of aid data and self-reporting on DPAF indicators at project/program
level in a Development Assistance Database. Total Oversees Development Assistance (ODA) for the last
DPAF review for 2009/10 was US$941 million from 15 donors with 36 percent provided in budget
support. Key DPAF findings on an aggregate level include a continued increase in the total volume of
ODA that is recorded in Rwanda's national annual budget. This increase has been driven by a
considerable shift in aid modalities toward general and sector budget support. At the same time, more
ODA is disbursed using Government financial reporting as well as procurement systems. Further
improvements are needed in terms of ODA disbursed using Government’s execution procedures as well
as auditing procedures. The DPAF also features budget support specific indicators, which record
positively that donors aim to keep Government informed about annual commitments of budget support.
However, progress is still lacking with respect to the predictability, i.e. disbursement timing of budget
support.
83.      In July 2010, Government finalized a DoL exercise with the goal to limit each partners’
activities to three sectors (Table 5). Criteria for mapping sectors with donors were related to the
financing gap for different EDPRS programs and specific donor characteristics, e.g. a donor’s preferred
aid modality, track record in terms of achieving sector outcomes, mandate, and global experience. The
DoL confirmed the Bank’s engagement in three sectors: agriculture, energy, and transport (including ICT)

  There are currently twelve bilateral, three multilateral (the AfDB, EU, and the World Bank) and about sixteen United Nations
(UN) organizations active in Rwanda. In addition, a number of NGOs and vertical funds (including the Global Fund) are
represented with major activities.

and some cross-cutting areas (e.g. skills development and capacity building). As a provider of general
budget support the Bank is in principle free to take part in any sector dialogue. This includes the provision
analytic and advisory work and TA.

      VI.       THE PROPOSED NEW SERIES OF POVERTY REDUCTION
                             SUPPORT FINANCING
                                        SERIES AND PRSF-8 DESCRIPTION

84.      Development Objective: The third series of PRSF 8 to 10 continues to support the
implementation of the Government’s medium-term development strategy, the EDPRS, within the context
of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The first operation in this series, PRSF-8 of SDR77.7
million (US$125 million equivalent) will provide financial support to the Government for implementing
priorities of its strategy, narrowing the gap between resources available from Government’s revenues and
other donor support. The realignment of this programmatic development policy financing and the recently
adopted Government fiscal year will contribute to predictability of funding. The proposed PRSF-8 is
aligned with the CPAF and the associated dialogue between the Government and Development Partners
to strengthen policy prioritization and coordination.
85.       The purpose of the proposed series of operations is to support Rwanda’s policies and
institutions aimed at attaining the sustainable growth needed to become a middle-income country
by 2020. For example, a number of prior actions will support the Governments ambitions to become a
service-based economy with a strong ICT sector and focus in the areas of customs and public financial
management on the introduction of network based information systems, such as the roll-out of the
Automated System for Customs Data and the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, and
improvements to the Education Management Information System. However, as the transition to a more
sophisticated economy is starting to accelerate, the focus needs to be squarely on infrastructure
development and ensuring an adequate skills base of the population, basic structural reforms and a shift in
the role of government in relation to production. In order to translate Rwanda’s successful reform
efforts improving the investment climate into growth-promoting investments, both perception and
facilitation issues need to be addressed and transparency will need to increase at all levels. While in many
areas regulatory frameworks and monitoring mechanisms are being implemented, adequate capacity to
steer a more complex economy needs to be developed and reflect a broad number of stakeholders.
86.      The program development objective is to adopt policies that facilitate increased private
sector investment and involvement and ease constraints to broad based growth. Supported reforms
to increase efficiency, transparency and accountability in the public sector include public financial
management to ensure that resources are used more efficiently and effectively to benefit all parts of the
population, including the poor. During the PRSF8-10 priority will go to measures aimed at: (i) supporting
the facilitation of trade and investments; (ii) increasing access to electricity and improved infrastructure
services; (iii) raising private sector participation in the agricultural sector; (iv) increasing the quality and
relevance of education to build a skilled workforce; (v) improving service delivery through focused and
strategic civil service reform; and (vi) strengthening the management of public resources, including
increasing transparency and accountability.
87.     Strategic Reform Focus: With the focus on creating opportunity for growth and harnessing
private sector growth, the proposed series is linked to the Competitiveness and Employment theme and
the underlying foundation of Governance and Public Sector Capacity of the World Bank strategy for
Africa.20 The proposed new PRSF series represents a continuation of the overall reform program
supported under PRSF4-7, as it carries on supporting the same underlying national development strategy.
The Government requested IDA to support the national development strategy, the EDPRS, with its
commitment to macroeconomic stability and sustained growth and poverty reduction as outlined in the
attached Letter of Development Policy (LDP, Annex 1).

88.      The strategic question faced in preparing the new PRSF series was whether to exercise a
higher level of selectivity as compared to the previous series or to cover all three EDPRS flagships.
The previous PRSF series supported the two flagships of Growth for Jobs and Exports and Governance.
A separate Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC) supported reforms in health and the
implementation of the third EDPRS flagship, the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP). An argument
in favor of the preparation of an even more focused third PRSF series for Rwanda was the Government’s
DoL of 2010, with the goal to limit each development partners’ activities to three sectors in an effort to
increase aid effectiveness. Important lessons learned from the previous series PRSF4-7 implied that some
prioritization in reform support of a future series would be advantageous. Particularly, it was noted that
the quality of the CPAF and the PRSF depends crucially on the participation in sector dialogue through
in-country sector staff and that the reform program should provide synergies and opportunities for policy
dialogue to other operations in the portfolio.
89.     The proposed series will broadly continue previous reform focus. As Government decided to
extend the EDPRS to the end of 2012/13, rather than December 2012 following the change in fiscal year,
this means the completion of the EDPRS will coincide with the third PRSF cycle, supporting a broad
continuation of the areas covered under the second series. The Bank decided to follow broadly the DoL
while also taking on relevant cross cutting issues in regard to sectors of the EDPRS flagships covered
with the proposed PRSF series. This is also in agreement with the spirit of the budget support MoU, that
the Bank as provider of general budget support, is in principle free to take part in any sector dialogue
(including providing TA or analytical work), backed by relevant global experience and track record in
achieving sector outcomes.
90.      Supporting the implementation of Rwanda’s reform agenda across two out of three
flagships requires being selective within each of them. While the EDPRS contains long lists of policy
actions to be adopted over the five-year period, the CPAF, used for all budget support, is already much
more focused on a number of 45 indicators with a maximum of two policy actions under each. However,
it is unlikely that all those actions have the same strategic importance and at a practical level, there are
capacity constraints to implement the breath of development programs in Rwanda, both on Government
side and financially and technically on the donor side. Indeed, having a broad sectoral coverage is not
incompatible with identifying a core set of about 10 to 12 policy actions to be followed closely in each
operation. The selected support of policy actions within each flagship will follow broadly the DoL, i.e. the
Bank’s engagement in the three sectors: agriculture, energy, and transport (including ICT) and some
cross-cutting areas (e.g. skills development and capacity building) under the overall theme of supporting
private-sector led growth. As the World Bank is also a key partner for Government on issues of
macroeconomic and fiscal management and PFM, these are also areas continued to be supported.
91.     Prior actions: The PRSF-8 has seven prior actions and the operation is designed so that all
actions have been taken prior to Board presentation. The prior actions are described in Table 6 and
present the specific measures within the Government’s (Recipient’s) reform program that forms the basis
for PRSF-8 disbursement. Triggers for the next operation, the PRSF-9 are displayed in Table 7. These
policy actions are imbedded in the medium-term Government reform program and are described in detail
in the following section. For the purpose of this PRSF Program Document only, and in an attempt to
increase conformity with Bank operational guidelines, the respective CPAF policy actions are provided
with an additional prior action / trigger formulation. Annex 2 presents the entire policy matrix supported
by the PRSF-8 to 10 operations, which is aligned with the CPAF and reflects a sub-set of the CPAF
(Annex 3). It should be noted that within the EDPRS and CPAF objective of Enhancing Population
Development the PRSF series is only focusing on support of policy action to increase the skills base of the
population, as this addresses a key constraint to economic growth.

                          EDPRS AND CPAF STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1:
                              INCREASED ECONOMIC GROWTH
92.     The proposed PRSF series will provide under this EDPRS and CPAF objective broad
support to policies that facilitate increased private sector involvement and ease constraints to
broad based growth. This main focus on creating opportunity for growth and harnessing private
sector growth for sustainable poverty reduction corresponds directly to the Competitiveness and
Employment theme of the World Bank strategy for Africa. The main goal of this strategic thrust is to
address key investment climate constraints and increasing productivity.

Enhancing Business Climate
93.      The EDPRS estimates that it would require an increase in domestic investment to 24.4
percent of GDP to achieve the economic growth target rate of 8 percent in 2012. It was expected
that the private sector would contribute more than 14 percent of GDP by 2012, including FDI.
Structurally, it is envisioned that exports would become a more prominent and diversified income
source, increasing annually by 15 percent. While the country realizes on average the 22 percent per
GDP investment target since 2008, the shift to increased private investments did not materialize. In
2010 private investments stood at 9-10 percent of GDP, comparable to 2007 levels. Foreign
investments contribute on average 15 percent to total private investments since 2008 (reflecting a
meager 1.7 percent of GDP, partly also due to adverse global conditions). Export volumes continued
to increase since 2008 at an average rate of 11 percent, while export values increased on average by 19
percent.
94.      Rwanda has made rapid advances in regulatory reforms, but especially infrastructure
investment climate constraints remain prominent. The Bank supports through the Competitiveness
and Enterprise Development Project investment climate reforms by assisting in strengthening the legal
and institutional framework and supporting implementation of key elements of the country’s financial
sector development plan. Rwanda made great efforts in recent years to improve its investment
climate. But despite the country’s achievement in having established a sound regulatory framework for
businesses to support a private sector led development model, foreign direct investment levels are low.
Overall, the private sector is still overwhelmingly informal and its role and contribution to economic
activity remains limited. Also, export product diversification in agriculture –a key strategic area of
Government for perusing investors to fulfill its growth ambitions- efforts have yet to bear fruits. It
appears that there are still a number of unaddressed investor perception and facilitation issues as well
as severe input and infrastructure constraints that hamper the realization of investments into the
Rwandan economy, some of which will be addressed in the proposed PRSF series.21
95.      In the most recent Rwanda ICA (2009)22 firms ranked as their most severe constraint
electricity, tax rates and access to finance, followed by transport (Figure 13). Access and cost of
land featured also a major constraint (more than 20 percent of firms ranked it as a constraint).
However, the informal sector grew rapidly over recent years, but there is little incentive to enter into
formality, as it does not increase access to public infrastructure and services. The effective tax
administration seems to create another disincentive. With a small private sector tax base compliance

96.      According to the Logistic Performance Index (LPI)23 of 2009 Rwanda ranks near the
bottom at place 151 out of 155 economies (Figure 14). Rwanda performs especially poorly along
the dimensions of customs, infrastructure and logistic competence, also if comparing its performance
to neighboring EAC countries. To compensate for its natural disadvantage as a land-locked country,
significant improvements will need to be made, if it wants to become competitive within the region.
The main findings and recommendations of the 2005 DTIS, led by the World Bank and the Ministry of
Commerce, in terms of improving customs and transport services and diversifying export remain
valid. As part of the Trade Facilitation Facility the Bank recently started to support building trade
logistic services in Rwanda through a first component of a larger International Finance Corporation
(IFC) Rwanda ICA Program. The proposed PRSF series is also supporting policies which aim at
improving trade facilitation, especially at customs and in trade logistics in border transit.

23
   The LPI measures performance along the logistics supply chain within a country and is based on a worldwide
survey of operators on the ground (global freight forwarders and express carriers) along five dimensions.

97.     The Government is continuing with administrative customs reforms to enhance trade
across borders. Rwanda’s ranking for the related Doing Business indicator is still very low, but
increased from 169 in 2010 to 159 in 2011. Ongoing reforms led already to more efficient processing
and a reduction of time it takes for normal clearance to 2 days for exports and 3 days for exports. The
number of days to export has decreased from 47 days in 2008 to 35 days in 2011 and number of days
to import decreased from 69 in 2009 to 34 days in 2011. Increased operating hours and enhanced
cooperation at the border, along with the removal of some documentation requirements for importers
and exporters contributed to these achievements. Also, a risk assessment system was introduced where
goods are released without verification for companies with a track record of compliance and pre-
clearance and electronic filing of customs declarations was introduced. Customs declaration points
have been increased and the Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) system has been
streamlined and is being rolled out to all major border posts in Rwanda. Government is also in the
process of finalizing agreements for One Stop Border Posts. The ASYCUDA application and one stop
border services are some of the measures which will be supported by reform program under the new
PRSF-series. However, overall, cost to export and to import remains exceptionally high compared to
SSA, due to expensive inland transportation and handling.
98.     PRSF 8-10 supports policy actions to enhance the business climate are designed to foster
trade across borders and improve conditions for the realization of productive investments. As
described above, these are based on findings of a range of AAA work done by the World Bank. In
particular, the agenda of PRSF 8-10 serves the following purposes:
   Supporting trade facilitation through improved trade logistic at the borders through prior
    actions focused reducing the time goods spend in border transit and ensuring the effective
    application of international approaches to customs valuations, by supporting the computerization
    of customs procedures and: (1) having ASYCUDA++ modules applied at all major border posts
    and reinforcing valuation at customs; (2) starting the operationalization of an electronic single
    window project; and the creation of (3) one stop border services at four out of seven main border
    posts. The related outcome indicator to these policy reform areas is the CPAF indicator index on
    business environment, which uses information from the World Bank on six Doing Business
    indicators to compute an absolute index (not responding to other countries’ performance),
    including the one on trading across borders (Annex 2).


                                                       36
   Supporting the translation of improvements in the investment climate into productive
    investments with prior actions which aim at elevating a key constraints to business and which
    clarify the regulatory framework for investors by: (1) establishing an electronic land registry; and
    (2) adopting a Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) Law. The related outcome indicator to these
    policy reform areas is the CPAF indicator score of investor perceptions index, which is calculated
    based on data from an annual survey of investors, the most recent one was conducted in 2010 in
    collaboration with the Private Sector Federation and the Rwanda Development Board (Annex 2).
99.      The PRSF-8 supports reforms in this area with the following prior action: connection of
the seven (7) main customs border posts in the Recipient’s territory to the Recipient’s automated
customs data system to streamline and rationalize the operation of customs entry processing
(corresponding to the 2009/10 CPAF action: effectively apply all ASYCUDA modules and reinforce
valuation unit at customs). All main seven main customs border posts by volume and value of
transactions (Gatuna, Kagitumba, Rusumo, Akanyaru, Rusizi, Gisenyi and Cyanika) were connected
to the ASYCUDA++ network. It is expected that this policy action will contribute to a reduction in
time goods spend at border customs, which will be reflected in e improvements of related investment
climate indicators. Automated customs systems are also likely to limit corruption in the form of
informal payments. This indicator is part of the related CPAF indicator index on business environment,
which, ceteris paribus, is expected to improve as a result.
100.     There will be two triggers in this reform area for the PRSF-9: (i) phase 1 of the
electronic single window project is completed with a decision reached on the choice of platform
to be used at all main border stations, and (ii) a Land Administration and Information System
has been developed, tested and officially launched. These triggers correspond to the two 2010/11
CPAF actions: (i) operationalize electronic single window project for trade facilitation, and (ii)
establish an electronic land registry. The electronic single window project has a number of sequenced
phases. As a first step for introducing an electronic single window project, it is necessary to agree on a
platform to which the specific electronic single window system will be attached. The Government is
planning to use ASYCUDAWorld as a platform and is in the process of finalizing the agreement with
UNCTAD. This policy action is expected to increase trade facilitation and ultimately reduce the time
that goods spend in border customs, resulting over time in an improvement of the related CPAF
indicator index on business environment. An electronic land registry system is expected to help
improve clarity on land ownership by having a computerized system which is more accurate and
durable than paper records and easier to update and to access. It is expected that this will contribute to
improve access and cost of land issues, faced by many businesses. As a result the related CPAF
outcome indicator score of investor perceptions index, is expected to improve over time.

Building Economic Infrastructure
101.     Priority has been put by Government on improving conditions of the road network,
especially classified district roads, to help reduce indirect transport costs due to breakage.
Government’s road maintenance and rehabilitation follows a decentralized administration model
where districts receive funds directly from the Ministry of Finance. The Government has taken
substantive measure in decentralizing roads administration by adopting a structure that will allow the
establishment of District Roads Units, responsible for development and maintenance of district roads,
and a Roads Coordination Unit under the Ministry of Local Governance. The Bank is providing
financing for key road rehabilitation under the Transport Sector Development Project. The East Africa
Trade and Transport Facilitation Project supports measures to improve links with the EAC the Bank.
102.    To ensure financing of road maintenance Government increased in 2009 the fuel levy
collected through the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF), a policy action supported by the previous
PRSF series. The Government is committed to pursue critical actions in support of effective
management of funds from the fuel levy, including the completion of a district and rural road
inventory and the development of an allocation mechanism for RMF resources through annual


                                                   37

area which will help improve road conditions in its final operation, PRSF-10 only.

and renewable technologies and through
increased participation in maintaining the distribution system. As part of a Sector Wide Approach in
the energy sector the Bank’s Electricity Access Scale-up Project is supporting Government’s access
and generation targets by financing the rehabilitation and expansion of Rwanda’s transmission and
distribution networks. The MIGA arm of the Bank recently issued an investment guarantee for the
Lake Kivu Methane Gas Project (Box 6). The proposed PRSF series will support the Government’s
efforts to increase efficiency and access, including through increased private sector participation in the
energy sector.
104.     A strong institutional framework of the energy sector will need to become operational if
the ambitious energy targets are to be met. In 2010, a separation of policy making and strategy
formulation from implementation for the energy sector was endorsed, with the Ministry for
Infrastructure confirmed as the policy institution and the reorganized utility, the Energy, Water and
Sanitation Authority (EWSA) as the implementing institution of Rwanda’s Energy Sector Strategy and
Energy Policy. The PRSF series will support progress toward a financially viable power utility, able
to contribute to Government’s ambitious generation and access targets. For example, having supported
the development of a revised tariff structure in the previous PRSF series, support under the proposed
series will include the implementation of a new tariff structure which will ensure a net income for the
power utility. In regard to the methane gas source at Lake Kivu, it will support the establishment of a
monitoring unit at the Ministry of Infrastructure to ensure the sustainability of this exploitation for
future energy generation.
105.    This institutional framework will also need to provide adequate support to PPPs and the
capacity to increasingly realize Rwanda’s integration into the regional power market. The Bank
will be supporting the East African Power Pool through the proposed Regional Rusumo Falls and
Hydroelectric and Multipurpose Project with the goal to foster access to and use of regional electricity
resources. This regional project will also include associated transmission network interconnecting
Rwanda, Tanzania and Burundi. Other regional projects include a transmission line connecting
Rwanda to Uganda and the regional hydropower project Rusizi III with transmission lines connecting
Burundi, DCR and Rwanda. The PRSF support to the establishment of a legal framework for PPPs,
covered under the Improving Investment Climate Theme of the PRSF, will contribute to this objective.

106.    Policy actions under this sub-component of the PRSF 8-10 aim at easing infrastructure
constraints in the energy and transport sectors. They reflect analytical results of the World Bank
ICA and other sector work. The objectives of this part of the PRSF 8-10 reform agenda are the
following:
    Improving road conditions of the district network with prior actions that ensure sustainability
     of district-level road maintenance and the optimal use of resources resulting from the fuel levy
     increase by: (1) put in place a policy and institutional framework which will form the basis of
     performance contracts between RMF and beneficiary districts. The related outcome indicator to
     this policy reform area is the CPAF indicator is percentage of classified district road network in
     good conditions (Annex 2)
    Increasing access to electricity with greater private sector participation through prior actions
     which support a financially viable electricity utility, able to focus on achieving the access targets
     and multi-stakeholder agreement on a strategic plan to ensure capacity for installing connections
     and their maintenance by: (1) revising the electricity tariff structure, ensuring EWSA retail tariffs
     at a level necessary to ensure a positive rate of return on its assets adopted by RURA, EWSA and
     MININFRA and applied to EWSA customers; and (2) developing and validating a costed action
     plan to maximize the local private sector participation in the construction and maintenance of the
     electricity distribution system. The related outcome indicator for this policy reform area is the
     CPAF indicator number of electricity subscriptions (Annex 2).
    Ensuring efficiency and sustainability of increased energy generation by prior actions which
     support energy generation by the public utility in a efficient manner by: (1) put in place a policy
     and institutional framework that will form the basis of performance contracts between
     Government and the energy utility to increase efficiency and ensure electricity access targets to
     households, economic nodes and social institutions. The sustainable exploitation of natural
     resources for energy generation will be supported with: (2) establishing a unit for monitoring of
     Lake Kivu stability and sustainable exploitation of methane gas. The related outcome indicator to
     this policy reform area is the CPAF indicator Mega Watt of electricity installed (Annex 2).
107.     There will be two energy sector triggers for the PRSF-9, but no prior action for PRSF-8:
(i) a revised tariff structure is agreed on and becomes effective to all energy utility customers,
ensuring a positive rate of return on the utility’s assets, and (ii) a policy and institutional
framework that will form the basis for performance contracts between Government and the
energy utility to increase efficiency and ensure electricity access targets is put in place. These
triggers correspond to the two 2010/11 CPAF actions: (i) revised electricity tariff structure, ensuring
EWSA retail tariffs at a level necessary to ensure a positive rate of return on its assets adopted by
RURA, EWSA and MININFRA and applied to EWSA customers, and (ii) performance contract
including targets to increase efficiency and access to households, economic nodes and social
institutions signed between Government and the energy utility and made effective. In October 2010 a
tariff and cost of service study was completed and discussed in a validation workshop hosted by
RURA. It informed on the level of a cost reflective tariff that is a function of operational cost,
investment needs and depreciation and recommended a new structure and tariff for various customer
groups balancing the cost of service and socio-economic considerations to protect the poor and support
economic growth. Based on this study (a prior action for PRSF-7) a revised tariff structure is expected
to be implemented and applied to all utility customers.25 In the medium-term this is expected to
improve the financial viability of the utility, help wean the sector off subsidies except where justified
and transparent, as in the case of investment requirements for an access scale-up and will contribute to
improvements sector performance, reflected in an increase in the CPAF outcome indicator number of
electricity subscriptions. The policy and institutional framework for performance contracts to increase
efficiency and ensure electricity access targets will define for the utility clear medium-term efficiency

  A socio-economic impact analysis of the planned tariff framework in regard to access will be incorporated into the Rwanda
Electricity Access Scale-up Project.

and access targets with the goal to ensure that more energy is generated with higher resource
efficiency and resulting in increased access. This is expected to contribute over time to improvements
in the CPAF indicator Mega Watt of electricity installed.

Increasing Agricultural Productivity
108.    To address the EDPRS goal of accelerated growth a main focus of Government’s policy
is on increasing agriculture production and productivity. Rwanda’s agriculture sector will play an
essential role in attaining the country’s development vision of sustainable growth and increased
poverty reduction, due to its large employment weight. The sector occupies 79.5 percent of the labor
force. Thus the importance of agriculture’s contribution to growth in Rwanda remains considerable,
despite the emergence of other significant growth drivers, such as services. The sector contributes
about 36.0 percent to the overall GDP and generates more than 45.0 percent of the country’s export
revenues.
109.     The strategic focus on agriculture, through continued public investments, has
contributed to marked productivity increases and solid agriculture growth rates. Over the past
three years, budget allocations to the agricultural sector have increased from 4.2 percent of the budget
in 2008 to 6.6 percent in the 2010/11 budget.26 The agricultural sector grew at an average of 6.3
percent annually since 2008. Indeed, in comparison to other East African countries Rwanda’s
agricultural growth is high, as is land productivity, but labor productivity remains low (Figure 15). A
key challenge to sustaining productivity increases is poor post-harvest management, which results in
the loss of up to 15 percent of total production. The new PRSF series will support Government’s
efforts to improve post-harvest management to increase food security crops production and to facilitate
food crops export and import.

of hillside agriculture in target areas. The Bank also finances the Second Rural Sector Support Project
to accelerate the pace of agriculture intensification through expanding irrigated areas and increasing
the use of sustainable land management practices on hillsides.


26
   Together with agricultural related spending allocated to other institutions, Rwanda now complies with the 10 percent
commitment made under the Africa Union’s Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) compact,
of which Rwanda was the first signatory.

                                                                   40
111.     Government’s reforms in agriculture will need to focus on greater private sector
involvement to realize sustainable productivity increases and better food security. Government’s
overall stated policy for the sector contains the commitment to promote private sector involvement,
including an exit strategy in fertilizer subsidization, also evidenced by supported past PRSF policy
actions. Government withdrawal from mechanization, seeds and post-harvest activities must be
accompanied with farmer choice-led programs and policies and support for private sector agents, if the
ambitious growth targets are to be met. The new PRSF series will support related activities, and
further reforms that complete the exit of Government from the fertilizer sector.
112.    The policies in the agriculture sector envisioned under PRSF 8-10 will support the
continued increase in agriculture productivity. Supported policy actions by the PRSF program will
fall under two groups of reform objectives in this sector:
   Fostering the role of the private sector in agricultural input provision, to ensure sustainability
    in productivity growth with policy actions vetted by multi stakeholders that will support the
    Government’s exit strategy from the fertilizer sector by: (1) publishing results and lessons learned
    of an evaluation study of the fertilizer strategy; (2) amending the fertilizer strategy -including the
    exit strategy for the Ministry of Agriculture in input distribution and subsidization- based on the
    evaluation study; and (3) enacting a regulatory framework for fertilizer importers/wholesalers,
    dealers, retailers in Rwanda. The related outcome indicator to this policy reform area is the CPAF
    indicator mineral fertilizer used (Annex 2).
   Supporting the production of food security crops through improvements in post-harvest
    management, including export / import facilitation for food crops, with prior actions in support of:
    (1) establishing a National Plant Protection Service at the Ministry of Agriculture to implement
    the 2009 Phytosanitary Law; and (2) establishing a functional secretariat to oversee the
    implementation of the post-harvest strategy, including a baseline for post-harvest losses. The
    related outcome indicator is the CPAF indicator production of key food security crops (Annex 2).
113.     The PRSF-8 supports reforms in agriculture with the following prior action: publication
of an independent evaluation of the implementation of the Recipient’s fertilizer strategy to
promote agricultural productivity, including the results and lessons learned on the website of the
Recipient’s ministry responsible for agriculture (corresponding to the 2009/10 CPAF action:
publish results and lessons learned of an evaluation of the fertilizer strategy). The fertilizer strategy
was approved by Cabinet in 2007. A strategy evaluation was carried out by an international consultant
from the International Fertilizer Development Center, contracted by MINAGRI. The final report from
March 2010 was presented to the agriculture SWG for validation. Main discussion items were
inefficiencies related to the subsidization and credit mechanism Government offers as part of its
fertilizer promotion program. It is expected that this policy action will contribute to improvements in
the current fertilizer subsidization scheme and provide through its lessons learned valuable
information for private sector participants in fertilizer importing, wholesale and dealing as
Government gradually exits fertilizer distribution and subsidization. This will be reflected in a future
improvement of the related CPAF indicator mineral fertilizer used.
114.      There will be two triggers in this reform area for the PRSF-9: (i) an exit strategy for the
Ministry of Agriculture in fertilizer distribution and subsidization is adopted as part of the
amended fertilizer strategy, and (ii) a National Plant Protection Service (NPPS) Unit is
established and equipped within the Ministry of Agriculture. These triggers correspond to the two
2010/11 CPAF actions: (i) amend, endorse and share with agriculture SWG the fertilizer strategy -
including exit strategy for MINAGRI in input distribution and subsidization- based on the evaluation
study, and (ii) establish and equip a NPPS as a unit within MINAGRI to implement the 2009
Phytosanitary Law. The Government is committed to a gradual exit strategy from fertilizer
distribution and subsidization in order to ensure sustainability in fertilizer provision and agriculture
productivity growth through the development of a private fertilizer sector. This will be reflected in a
revision of the fertilizer strategy from 2007. As a result the related CPAF outcome indicator mineral
fertilizer used is expected to improve steadily over time. The establishment of the NPPS is a crucial
                                                   41
reform step to facilitate imports and exports of agricultural products, especially food crops, through
phytosanitary certification that meets international standards. Currently, there is one person in
MINAGRI issuing certifications, while the planned unit –under a Director General and 3 directors–is
expected to operate a laboratory, an up-to date database on international phytosanitary standards and
have a cadre of field-based phytosanitary inspectors to ensure that the certification process accepted by
international trading partners. This will reduce the risk of farmers and traders of their goods not being
accepted (and dumped) at destination. It is expected that this risk reduction will contribute to increased
production of food security crops (including for export), but will also facilitate food crops imports. As
a result the related CPAF outcome indicator production of key food security crops is expected to
improve over time.

                         EDPRS AND CPAF STRATGIC OBJECTIVE 2:
                         ENHANCING POPULATION DEVELOPMENT

115.     The proposed PRSF series will support under this EDPRS and CPAF objective policy
actions aimed at increasing the relevance of education to built a skilled workforce, within the
overall theme of supporting private-sector led growth and easing key constraints to broad based
growth. Other EDPRS and CPAF areas under this objective, such as enhanced family planning,
improved health and nutrition status and strengthened health financing, improved access to safe
drinking water and sanitation and improved social safety net are not covered by the proposed series.
Some of these will be covered by a separate social protection Development Policy Operation. Health
and social protection policies were previously supported with a smaller budget support series, the
CLSG. Supported policies under the PRSF series in regard to skills development (i.e. improving the
quality of education and building a labor market responsive TVET system) is closely linked to the
Competitiveness and Employment theme of the World Bank strategy for Africa. The main goal of this
strategic thrust is to ensure that in addition to infrastructure and an improved business climate, a
skilled labor will lead to employment and greater competitiveness.

Enhancing Population Skills
116.    Rwanda has achieved significant increases in primary school enrollment and completion
rates. Rwanda is close to reaching universal education; primary school enrolment stands at 97 per
cent for boys and 98 per cent for girls, some of the highest enrolment rates in the EAC according to
the United Nations’ Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Total primary
school enrolment in schools has grown from 1.6 million pupils in 2003 to 2.2 million in 2009.
Enrolment in secondary schools has almost doubled from 179 thousand pupils in 2003 to 347 thousand
in 2009. Primary school completion rates reached 75 percent in 2009. The transition rate from primary
to secondary education stood at 90 percent in 2009. The number of teachers increased steadily, partly
through hiring contract teachers, reducing the primary school pupil to qualified teacher ratio from 73
in 2006 to 65 in 2009. In 2009 Rwanda’s introduced its ambitious Nine Year Basic Education Program
(9YBE).27 The program was introduced by Government to fast-track increased access to secondary
education and to reduce secondary school drop outs; as pupils attend now the first part of their
secondary studies at the schools where they completed primary education.
117.    While Rwanda’s success in providing universal access to primary education is laudable
there remain challenges in regard to quality of education. Repetition and drop-out rates remain
high and there are concerns about the relevance of curricula. Although, most primary school teachers
are qualified; few have been trained in the use of modern teaching techniques including learner-
centered approaches. 28 Also, with the introduction of the 9YBE and higher student enrolment, teacher
demand has increased -double-shifting was introduced-and quality concerns become more

27
   The 9YBE program gained momentum following a school construction campaign. It offers six years of primary and three
years of secondary education to all Rwandan children free of charge.
28
   In 2008 the main language of instruction changed from French to English posing an additional challenge.

                                                         42
pronounced. Education expenditure increased steadily, but not enough to ease the financial limitations
for recruiting and retaining qualified teachers, resulting in poor job satisfaction, low motivation and
deteriorating standards of living compared to other professionals with the same level of educational
attainment. Accurate data on education outputs and, in particular, on education quality is still missing.
The existing Education Management Information System (EMIS) has strong potential, but was limited
with its management having been based on annually centrally administered surveys. Implementing a
decentralized approach for EMIS is likely to result in a more sustainable and accurate data system.
However, the EMIS is mostly geared toward providing data on education inputs and outputs rather
than learning outcomes. A Monitoring Learning Assessment (MLA) system would provide most
relevant data on education outcomes. Over the next two years it is planned to develop a MLA test,
pilot it and administer a baseline survey to develop a MLA system for Rwanda. The new PRSF series
will support policies that will enable Government to improve the EMIS and better track education
quality in order to assist in reaching informed policy choices in this area.
118.     One of the top priorities of the Government of Rwanda is the establishment of a
Technical and Vocational Training (TVET) system as an essential part of the educational
system. Delivery of relevant vocational training and strengthening of the TVET system is also
supported by the World Bank’s Skills Development Project. Government’s efforts related to TVET
provision currently focus on filling the skills gap in the lower level essential vocations the building
and construction, and tourism sectors. Government approved an integrated TVET Policy in 2008,
which was supported by the previous PRSF series. In 2009, the Government established the
Workforce Development Authority to oversee the implementation of TVET policy. An integrated
TVET Concept Paper, and draft TVET Implementation Plan have been developed, with finalization
and costing of the plan expected shortly.           Overall, the TVET system remains relatively
underdeveloped compared to that for general upper secondary and higher education, and efforts are
underway to improve its quality and relevance. Many TVET institutions still lack adequate resources
and up-to-date curricula. There is also a need to improve the links to the industrial sectors and
strengthen the demand-driven response to the private sector. The CPAF itself had no measurable
outcome indicator for reforms supported in this area. The proposed PRSF series is supporting the
development of a TVET system that provides a higher and relevantly skilled labor force to support
further progress toward achieving Rwanda’s aspired increasingly sophisticated economic structure and
the establishment of a baseline to measure TVET reform progress.
119.   PRSF 8-10 support for policy actions in the area of skills development aims at increasing
the quality and relevance of the education and TVET system in the long-term. In particular, the
agenda of PRSF 8-10 serves the following purposes:
   Supporting the creation of a system that can track education quality through prior actions
    focused on improving the existing EMIS and creating a new MLA systems, based on which
    strategic policy choices in regard to quality improvement can be made by: (1) rolling out the
    EMIS to districts; and (2) developing and piloting a MLA test to measure quality of education.
    The related outcome indicators are the CPAF indicators transition from basic education to upper
    secondary education and primary school completion rate (Annex 2).
   Improving the quality and relevance of the TVET system with prior actions which support the
    finalization of a TVET related outcome indicator and baseline and increased interaction and
    cooperation between the TVET system and the private sector by: (1) conducting an employer’s
    survey to establish baseline information of TVET graduates and adequacy of training; and (2)
    designing a minimum of 5 TVET curricula with private sector participation. The related outcome
    indicator is the CPAF indicator proportion of employers who are satisfied with the performance of
    TVET graduates (Annex 2).
120.    The PRSF-8 supports reforms in the education sector with the following two prior
actions: (i) installation of an education management information system satisfactory to the
Association in all the Recipient’s districts to facilitate data input regarding the education sector
at the district level, and (ii) publication of a survey of employers’ satisfaction with the skills of
                                                   43
the graduates of the Recipient’s ongoing technical and vocational, education and training
program to generate baseline data for assessing said program (corresponding to the 2009/10
CPAF actions: roll out EMIS to districts and prepare school based roll out; and conduct employers
survey to establish baseline information of TVET graduates and adequacy of training). The EMIS has
been strengthened and the 2010 data collection process was improved through the involvement of head
teachers and DEOs to ensure reliability of data. The servers for the District EMIS are available and the
District EMIS is processed by first entering data in EXCEL™ sheets at district level and then
importing the data into the EMIS system. It is expected that this policy action will contribute to more
accurate data and more school-level involvement for the identification of challenges that prevent good
education outcomes, like the transition rate of pupils. The CPAF indicator transition from basic
education to upper secondary education, is, ceteris paribus, is expected to improve as a result over
time. For the CPAF indicator proportion of employers who are satisfied with the performance of
TVET graduates there were no baseline or targets available yet, until the baseline survey, which was
supported by the above PRSF-8 prior action. The survey of employer satisfaction with TVET
graduates was carried out with support from Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit
and its initial findings of the survey were presented at the sector JSR of October 2010. The survey
report was since then finalized and published and its data serves now as a baseline for the CPAF
outcome indicator on TVET progress.
121.    There will be one trigger in this reform area for the PRSF-9: a tool for monitoring
learning achievements in literacy and numeracy in P3 is developed and piloted. This trigger
corresponds to the 2010/11 CPAF action: put in place a MLA pilot to measure quality of education.
The goal of the MLA system is to develop a methodology for measuring quality of education and
create a baseline for education outcomes, which is planned to be used to formulate a new CPAF
indicator and targets for learning achievements. The MLA system is being developed over a two year
period, and the first phase was implemented for measuring learning achievements in P3. After two
years the survey will be repeated at P5 level to track progress. The first phase, covered by the PRSF-8
prior action, also included the development of the survey tools and the pilot test. Since then, the
sample area was identified and a core team within the Ministry of Education (under leadership of the
Inspector General) was trained to administer the survey in mid-2011. This is expected to result in first
findings for a baseline in late 2011. Until the definition of a new CPAF indicator and baseline to
measure education quality, the related CPAF outcome indicator remains primary school completion
rate, which is expected to increase over time.

                   EDPRS AND CPAF STRATGIC OBJECTIVE 3:
                ENHANCING GAINS THROUGH GOOD GOVERNANCE

122.     The proposed PRSF series will provide under this EDPRS and CPAF objective
supported to policies that will increase efficiency, transparency and accountability in the public
sector, including the public financial system. This core theme of the PRSF series corresponds to the
foundation of the World Bank strategy for Africa, improving Governance and Public Sector Capacity,
which addresses competitiveness constraints as a result of weak governance or poor quality of public
services. The main goal of this strategic thrust is ensure that resources are used more efficiently and

Improving Public Accountability
123.    The EDPRS governance flagship program covers the areas of security, rule of law,
decentralization and public sector capacity strengthening for services delivery, including PFM.
In the area of public sector reforms the goal is to enhance accountability at all levels of Government
and to increase the transparency and predictability of policy making. Key reform areas are identified
as decentralization, improvements in the budget process and the strengthening of PFM and
procurement.

124.    Overall governance indicators improved since 2008 for Rwanda, but performance
remains still weakest in the areas of voice and accountability. The Bank’s Worldwide Governance
Indicator project has shown Rwanda leading SSA and the EAC on two governance aspects,
government effectiveness and control of corruption. Transparency International has ranked Rwanda
as the least corrupt country in EAC and among the least corrupt in Africa in 2010 and the Ibrahim
Index has showed a similar trend over the last 10 years. Low corruption levels are also corroborated by
the World Bank’s ICA, where much less firms in Rwanda (4.3 percent) reported corruption as a
problem as compared to neighboring countries, such as Uganda (24 percent), Tanzania (51 percent)
and Kenya (74 percent). However, in the area of voice and accountability, i.e. the extent to which
citizen of a country are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of
expression, freedom of association and a free media, Rwanda still ranks in the lowest quintile (Figure
16). Reporters Without Borders rank Rwanda in their 2010 Worldwide Press Freedom Index 169 out
of 178 countries , continuing a decrease from 157 out of 175 in 2009 and 145 out of 173 in 2008.

125.    In 2008 the Government and Development partners completed a Joint Governance
Assessment (JGA), but an update is still pending. Governance assessments focus on measuring the
performance, accountability, responsiveness and capacity of formal institutions. The 2008 Rwanda
JGA was regarded widely as an example of a coordinated assessment. It followed a more harmonized
approach and applied the principle of encouraging country ownership and the alignment with
nationally driven assessments. The 2008 JGA concluded that Rwanda has made impressive progress in
governance since the 1994 genocide and identified remaining challenges in the categories Ruling

Justly, Government Effectiveness, Investment Climate and Corporate Governance. The review
concluded that: (1) institutions need to be further strengthened and rules-based governance more
rigorously enforced; (2) vertical accountability between government and citizens needs to be
strengthened, in particular by enabling constructive state-society engagement around participatory
processes such as budgeting, planning and monitoring; and (3) transparency and access to reliable
information are essential to nearly all aspects of good governance. An update report was planned to be
issued in the Fall of 2010 to capture governance progress from 2008 to 2009. A number of issues
however constrained its DPs from similarly honoring this commitment. These issues, that continue to
be discussed include: (i) the validity of a report that is issued with a 2010 date but that does not
address 2010 election related governance issues because of a pre-agreed cut-off date; (ii) significant
difficulty in actually measuring progress using the framework that had been designed under the 2008
JGA resulting in some anomalous results; and (iii) the fact that with hindsight it was perhaps overly
optimistic to have expected to deliver annual updates in an area where measurable progress takes years
to accomplish. At present Government and its DPs including the World Bank, remain committed to a
joint assessment process. Collaboration is therefore continuing to enable the issuance of the first JGA
update report. In the meantime, since the beginning of 2011, Government and its DPs have entered
into a program of high level (Ministers, Ambassadors, Heads of Development Agencies) governance
dialogue meetings at which topical governance issues and concerns are discussed and debated.

This is also supported by one component of the World

compensating, rewarding, retaining and motivating public servants that is equitable, competitive and
recognizes their competencies and contributions to the performance of the public sector. The new
PRSF series will support the finalization of the Pay and Retention Policy.
127.  To fast track service delivery improvements in the key sectors of agriculture, energy,
mining and to increase private sector investment, Government has also developed a new

determination of pay in the civil and public sector. In 2007 a new job classification system was adopted which moved the
system to a job-based system, which classified and re-graded jobs based on the full requirements of the job instead of
qualifications only.
31
   The Civil Service Reform component of PSCBP supports the development and implementation of reforms to strengthen
the effectiveness and efficiency of the public service, focusing on the areas of pay and retention, human resource
management, communication and information sharing, payroll management, leadership development, and citizen charters

Strategic Capacity Building Initiative (SCBI) with support from the Africa Governance Initiative
and the World Bank. The initiative will focus on the Government’s own delivery priorities and plans
to combine delivery and capacity building at the same time. Capacity needs assessments have formed
the basis for a US$34 million technical assistance support package over the medium term to address
staffing and skills gaps and strengthen the centre of government. In the context of the SCBI it will be
important to ensure adequate resource allocation to line ministries, which are covered in the first round
of the program as well as to support government to enhance the long term sustainability of the
initiative through complementary public sector reforms covering for example human resource
management and pay and retention. The World Bank committed to support the initiative with IDA16
funding through the Government’s preferred instrument, namely policy actions in the context of this
new PRSF series.
128.    Wages and salaries are the largest cost element in the operating budget, representing
about 12.5 percent of Government expenditure, although comparatively the wage bill share of
under 5 percent GDP is lower in Rwanda than its neighboring countries. In order to increase the
effectiveness of payroll controls, Government is in the process of implementing an Integrated Payroll
and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). This is a central oversight program with the goal to
ensuring that wages and salaries are captured accurately by improving transparency and eliminating
potential manual entry errors or data manipulation to the effect that salary payments go to bona fide
employees and are captured in turn in the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS). The new
PRSF series is supporting the integration of the IPPIS Payroll and the Human Resource (HR)
Modules, followed by the IPPIS roll-out to central ministries and districts.
129.   Policy actions under this sub-component of the PRSF 8-10 aim at improving public
accountability. In particular, the agenda of PRSF 8-10 serves the following purposes:
   Improving service delivery in the public sector with prior actions which first, focus on the
    framework finalization of civil services reforms and second, connect it to service delivery in key
    strategic sectors as part of the SCBI by: (1) finalizing the Pay and Retention Policy; and (2) having
    counterparts for all SCBI international practitioners with positive feedback on skills transfer. The
    related outcome indicator is a new CPAF indicator, introduced during the April 2011 forward-
    looking JBSR: percentage of planned outputs achieved in the selected 4 SCBI priority areas
    (Annex 2).
   Increasing effectiveness of payroll control through prior actions focused on assuring accuracy of
    the payroll system by: (1) integrating Payroll and HR Subsystems of the IPPIS; and (2) achieving
    full coverage of the IPPIS. The related outcome indicator is the CPAF indicator index of
    effectiveness of payroll controls, Public Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA) indicator PI-
    18 (Annex 2).
130.    The PRSF-8 supports reforms in this area with the following prior action: integration of
appropriate human resources and payroll subsystems into the Recipient’s integrated personnel
payment information system to improve payroll accuracy and transparency in the management
of public finances (corresponding to the 2009/10 CPAF actions: integrate HR and Payroll Subsystems
of the IPPIS). The integration of the IPPIS Phase I Payroll and HR Modules was accomplished and
represented a key part of the IPPIS development. The system now provides greater efficiency and
control over the payroll by linking any HR changes in the public service automatically to the payroll
system. With the previous legacy payroll system, if someone was promoted or left the public service,
the data had to be adjusted manually in the payroll. Now, if the HR change is made in the IPPIS
system, the payroll gets updated automatically. It is expected that this will result in better integration
and reconciliation between personnel record and payroll data, as well as improvements in timeliness of
changes to personnel record and payroll data and increased control to these changes. The related
CPAF outcome indicator index of effectiveness of payroll controls, PEFA indicator PI-18 is expected
to improve in future assessments, but already these changes and partial roll-out of the new system
were reflected in the 2010 PEFA, which recorded an improvement in payroll controls on the 2007
report with the score rising from D+ to B+.
                                                   47
131.     There will be two triggers in this reform area for the PRSF-9: (i) Pay and Retention
Policy finalized and deliberated at a formal high-level workshop with all Government ministries;
and (ii) the IPPIS is deployed to all Central Government (CG) ministries and district roll-out
was initiated. The first trigger corresponds to the 2010/11 CPAF action: Pay and Retention Policy
finalized, the second to: roll-out of IPPIS to CG agencies and districts following prioritization
sequence. The first trigger has the goal to finalize the Pay and Retention Policy and have it vetted by
all main stakeholders in Government. The Ministry of Public Services and Labor contracted a
consultant to design the policy in January 2011 and approved the inception report. The first policy
draft was submitted in May 2011. The related outcome indicator percentage of planned outputs
achieved in the selected 4 SCBI priority areas is new, replacing the one which was in place until April
2011: percentage of performing budget agencies, which aimed at addressing capacity issues in budget
agencies. The new outcome indicator will also focus on capacity building, but narrower linked to the
Government’s new SCBI service delivery sectors. The Pay and Retention Policy will be a crucial
overarching public service framework and will contribute to the success of the SCBI by harmonizing
the pay-scale and benefit and performance system. It is this expected to contribute to improvements in
the new indicator over time. The second trigger is a follow-up action to the prior action for PRSF-8,
described above, and covers the IPPIS roll-out to all CG ministries and some districts, including user
group training. This is expected to lead to overall improvements in payroll and wage bill accuracy and
better oversight control. It is expected to result in improvements in the CPAF outcome indicator index
of effectiveness of payroll controls, PEFA indicator PI-18 in future PEFA assessments.

completed and shows remarkable improvements compared to the 2007 PEFA (Box 8). A mid-

133.    The proposed PRSF series will shift its support to policy action with the goal of
increasing effectiveness, transparency and accountability of the budget process, and improving
internal audit. The previous PRSF series has focused support on Government actions to improve
transparency through the strengthening of the budget monitoring and reporting system. Specifically it
supported the automation of the entire spectrum of the PFM cycle (planning, budgeting, procurement,
accounting and reporting and oversight) enhancing the transparency and efficiency of PFM processes
across Government. The main challenge remains the coexistence of two different systems, SagePastel
and SmartGov, and efforts are currently underway to develop a blue print for the IFMIS

     The strategy is based on the results of the 2007 PEFA.

                                                              48
implementation. In the meantime time the core functionality of SmartGov is being enhanced,
including linking it with other systems such as IPPIS, BNR and RRA systems.
134.     The mid-term review of the PFMRS observed that overall Government has made
satisfactory progress in budget formulation and preparation, but the multi-year perspective in
fiscal planning and budgeting needs to improve. According to the PEFA 2010 assessment, the
impact of budget reforms still remains limited as the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
did not yet develop into an instrument that ensures a strategic allocation of resources and fiscal
sustainability. Currently, it fails to link policy targets with actual budget allocations, particularly in the
outer years. Within each budget year there are still high variances in reflected composition of
expenditure outturn compared to original approved budget. Also, despite data being available, there is
still inadequate disclosure of scope and nature of donor financing as ultimately reflected in financial
statements and budget execution reports. Although a MTEF approach to planning and budgeting was
introduced by 2000, the MTEF process in practice reverted to an annual budget preparation process by
2006. This was a result of high staff turnover, progressive changes in program structure and the
absence of costed strategies for some sectors. Since the EDPRS formulation and starting with the
2009/19 budget efforts were put on improving the multi-year fiscal projections and their connection to
sectors. The proposed PRSF series will support improvements to the MTEF and its budget process
integration.
135.     Internal audit was found to be the least well performing PFMRS component so far,
which is corroborated by the weak PEFA 2010 results for effectiveness of internal audit. In
2005, the Government established the office of the Chief Government Internal Auditor (CGIA) under
MINECOFIN. Subsequently most ministries and agencies established internal audit units, which
report directly to both their management and the CGIA. A basic legal framework for internal audit is
now in place and includes an internal audit charter, internal audit manuals as well as a code of conduct
for internal auditors. CGIA has focused efforts on building capacity for risk-based auditing, financial,
payroll, procurement, value for money, and IT auditing and trained a core group of auditors from
various budget agencies. However, currently only about 45 percent of budget agencies submit internal
audit reports to the CGIA. To progress towards substantial realization of key PFMRS target outputs
and sustain anticipated outcomes, a number of challenges will need to be addressed, including: (i)
improving the quality of audit report; (ii) recruiting and training adequate numbers of skilled and
experienced audit staff; (iii) completing the process of establishing and mobilizing audit committees;
and (iv) acquiring the internal audit software and other tools needed to enable the available staff to
perform with efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed PRSF will support the Government in
establishing audit committees including a phased piloting, starting with Government’s big spending
ministries such as Finance, Education, Infrastructure, Defense and Agriculture.
136.    Policy actions under this sub-component of the PRSF 8-10 aim at enhancing public
financial management. They reflect results of the PEFA assessment and other sector work, including
the PFMRS mid-term review. The objectives of this part of the PRSF 8-10 reform agenda are the
following:
   Increase effectiveness, transparency and accountability of the budget process through prior
    actions that increase the relevance of the MTEF and timely web-posting of budget related
    documents by: (1) revitalizing the MTEF and integrate it into the budget process; and (2)
    increasing transparency and accountability of the budget process by posting on the MINECOFIN
    website key budget documents as follows: a) Approved Budget by 31st July 2011; b) Citizens
    Budget by 31st August 2011; c) Pre-budget Statement by 31st October 2011; d) 1st Budget Call
    Circular by 31st October 2011; e) 2nd Budget Call Circular by 31st December 2011; f) In-year
    Budget Execution reports-within 60 days after each quarter; g) Annual Budget Execution report by
    30th September 2011; h) Revised Budget by 31st March 2012; and i) Budget Framework Paper by
    30th April 2012. The related outcome indicator is the CPAF indicator index for multi-year
    perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting, PEFA indicator PI-12 (Annex
    2).

                                                     49
   Supporting improvements in internal audit with prior actions which support an audit committee
    system that preserves independence of the internal audit function vis-à-vis the management of
    budget agencies by: (1) adopting a regulatory framework for the implementation of Audit
    Committees; and (2) establishing pilots of Audit Committees in ministries and districts. The
    related outcome indicator is the CPAF indicator percentage of internal audit reports submitted
    (Annex 2).
137.     The PRSF-8 supports reforms in this area with the following two prior actions, but no
triggers for PRSF-9: (i) development and integration of a medium-term expenditure framework
into the Recipient’s budgeting process across all sectors to improve the Recipient’s medium-
term macroeconomic and fiscal projections; and (ii) adoption of a regulatory framework for the
establishment of internal audit committees in public entities and at Local Government level to
oversee the auditing of public finances (corresponding to the 2009/10 CPAF action: Revitalize
MTEF and integrate it into budget process; and develop and adopt proposals for the implementation of
Audit Committees). Starting with the fiscal year 2009/10 simplified costing guidelines were
developed and disseminated to sectors and detailed Budget Call Circulars as well as instructions on the
preparation of budget estimates for the MTEF are provided. This was accompanied by comprehensive
training to sectoral focal points and MTEF focused training to planning and budgeting officers. As a
result, for the 2009/10 budget contained for the first time again budget estimates for the next budget
year and two outer years, based on sector level MTEFs and fiscal projections in a Budget Framework
Paper. Thus, the sectoral MTEFs became again integral to the budget process. Nonetheless, multi-year
estimates still need to improve further, as well as the link between costed sector strategies and
aggregate fiscal forecasts. Further enhancement to the MTEF and integration, through comprehensive
training and sensitization is ongoing. It is expected that these plans, together with the results achieve,
will lead over time to improvements in the related outcome indicator index for multi-year perspective
in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting, PEFA indicator PI-12 in a future PEFA
assessment. A ministerial order to establish Audit Committees in public entities and local
government’s entities was issued in October 2009. The purpose of the order was to establish and
empower the functioning of Internal Audit Committees as independent committees of public entities to
provide oversight to financial management of the entity. The legislation for establishing Internal Audit
Committees was a prerequisite for the following piloting of the committees across government and
state-owned entities. As next steps Audit Committees will be made operational in an increasing
number of Government budget entities and ministries, starting with 5 ministries, including the
Ministry of Finance. It is expected that this policy action will contribute to a future improvement of
the related CPAF indicator percentage of internal audit reports submitted.

                   VII.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
                               POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

138.      The poverty and social impact assessment found that the proposed reforms are unlikely
to adversely affect the poor, while several prior actions have the potential to contribute to
poverty reduction (Annex 6). The Government is committed to understanding the distributional and
poverty reducing impacts of the reforms supported by the PRSF as well as the potential impacts of
specific policy actions supported under this operation. Analysis undertaken in the context of the
EDPRS and the Bank’s CEM highlighted the importance for growth and poverty reduction of
investments and reforms to ease infrastructure constraints (particularly in rural areas), and improve
agriculture productivity. A more in-depth analysis of poverty trends since 2006 is expected once the
recently collected household data from the EICV3 becomes available in mid-2012. The focus of the
PRSF series is not only on central state level reforms, but reforms which would create equal benefits
for the population at decentralized levels. Overall the operation is likely to contribute to positive
poverty and social impacts as the financing provided to the Government for implementing priorities of
its strategy will narrow the gap between resources available from Government’s revenues and other

                                                   50
donor support. This will contribute to macroeconomic stability and sound fiscal underpinnings,
enhancing economic growth which could in turn improve the quality of life for all segments of the
population. Supported reforms are not expected to generate concerns regarding social or livelihood
impacts.
139.    Measures to enhance the business climate and build economic infrastructure will address
key constraints to economic growth and will lead to benefits across the population. Support to
improving trade logistic and infrastructure, such as easing trade across borders through the installation
of automated customs systems and better districts road conditions, are likely to benefit private sector
actors most at first. However, this is likely to contribute to increased economic activity and private
investments, which in turn has the potential to provide productive employment and income
opportunities for broader segments of the population. Overall, higher growth and increased
Government revenue are likely to translate over the medium to long-term positively into poverty
reduction.
140.    Supported actions to increase agriculture productivity will first of all improve the
livelihood of farmers. By fostering the role of the private sector in agricultural input provision it will
also ensure sustainability in productivity growth and ultimately better food security. This will benefit
also other parts of the society, like private sector players and the net-buyers of food crops, including
the poor. As specific actions focus on an exit strategy for Government subsidies of fertilizers, it will
also free up scarce public resources which could be now allocated to alternative uses within the
budget, especially core Government service delivery priorities in education or health. This will
potentially lead to benefits to broader segments of the population, including the poor, if service
delivery is appropriately targeted. Together with increased private sector activity (para.139), in the
medium-term this is expected to contribute positively to poverty reduction.
141.    Policy actions supported by the PRSF to enhance the skills base of the population are
expected to positively affect through more productive opportunities for the working population,
especially the poor. Increase information on quality and relevance of the education and TVET system
will make improvements to these systems possible. However, the benefits of these measures would be
expected to materialize only in the long-term and would be heavily conditioned on other important
follow-up reforms in the education sector. Nevertheless, they could contribute to increasing the
likelihood of employment and income for members of society, and, if realized, contribute to the
envisioned transformation of the Rwanda economy.
142.     Proposed measures to improve public accountability and enhanced public financial
management will most likely have a positive impact on all segments of the population. Measures
to improve the MTEF and budget process will ensure better medium-term fiscal planning and priority
setting for resources on poverty-related expenditure and infrastructure. Proposed measures to improve
the management of public funds, such as increasing effectiveness of payroll control and improving
internal audit functions are likely to have similar gains, leading, for example, to a more accurate wage
bill and higher ensures that salary payments only go to bona fide employees. This is not only
decreasing leakage of public funds, with this additional assurance of adequacy of fiduciary standards it
is likely that donors will feel more comfortable to use Government systems to channel their resources
and implement their projects. This in turn would likely help to increase health and education budgets
and could overall improve services delivery outputs. PRSF support to civil services reform and the
SCBI are also likely to improve service delivery and will directly benefit motivated public servants.
However, these improvements are expected to be medium to longer term, and would need proper
targeting for the poor to positively affect this group.
143.     In general, the assessment of the poverty and social impact of the measures proposed by
the EDPRS, and supported by the PRSF is carried out in the context of Rwanda’s EDPRS
monitoring system. It involves an analysis of the household living conditions and demographic
health surveys and, among other things, poverty trends and dynamics every five years. The surveys are
complemented by annual integrated poverty assessments to enable adjustments towards reaching
identified goals and targets.

                                         ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

144.     Following Bank Policy requirements, specific policies supported by the PRSF-8 are not
likely to cause significant effects on Rwanda's environment, forests and other natural resources,
if adequately managed.33 Any likely adverse effects are expected to be limited and manageable
through the existing Bank framework in place for the PRSF-8 areas of support. In the current PRSF
series, such environmental effects may arise through measures to support infrastructure development
(including hydropower and rural road development and maintenance), and agricultural development,
particularly with fertilizer distribution. An extensive Environmental Assessment and Social Analysis
undertaken during PRSG-1 remains relevant in this regard.
145.      The PRSF-8 relies on: (i) continued strengthening of the overall framework for
environmental management in Rwanda; and (ii) environmental management assessments
undertaken in the context of other Bank projects to address potential environmental concerns.
Improvements in the framework for environmental management in Rwanda resulted in noticeable
enhancements of the institutional framework. A noticeable hindrance to effective policy
implementation and coordination remains the lack of adequate staffing with relevant skills both at the
central and district level and a well-organized and accessible environmental knowledge base and
monitoring system. The Bank, through project specific work and work being carried out by other
donors in this area, is supporting the Government’s efforts to strengthen capacity in the key agencies
charged with environmental management. This is complementing a program of small grants for
environmental capacity building provided by the United Nations Environment Program that is being
used to build in a framework for environmental assessments in key ministries. Moreover, the Global
Environment Facility projects are also supporting institutional capacity development on environmental
management in Rwanda, particularly on ecosystem and watershed management in both central and
district levels.
146.     The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) lies with the Environment Compliance
Unit in the Rwanda Development Board (RDB). Receipt of an EIA clearance is now one of the
requirements for setting up a business. The RDB has created the one-stop center for business
registration which also integrates the EIA clearance process and helps to minimize clearance
procedures for businesses. However, environmental standards enforcement and audit functions remain
within the Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA). This is a unique institutional set
up and for that reason the Bank has requested an institutional assessment to be carried out.
147.    The impact of climate risks to livelihoods and the production sectors, particularly on
agriculture production, hydropower generation, and disaster risk management have been
recognized, and considered as part of the mainstreaming efforts. There is a need for stronger
coordination across various sectors and agencies on developing and implementing a comprehensive
approach to climate risk management, incorporating adaptation to historical climate variability and
projected climate change and effectively using new climate-related financing. In particular, the lack of
a modern, real-time hydro-meteorological monitoring network, appropriate climate and hydrological
forecasting, communication and preparedness pose significant challenges in adaptation to climate
risks. Sustainable land management through sound and sustainable agriculture and watershed
management practices and improved urban planning are critical to increase climate resilience. The
scope for benefitting from climate adaptation and mitigation related financing should also be explored
wherever there are double dividends to both development and climate related objectives. The Bank is
supporting REMA with a technical assistance to improve mainstreaming of climate risks and
opportunities. Other specific relevant Bank programs include: (i) the planned social protection

33
   Under Operational Policy 8.60, on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is required to determine whether specific
country policies supported under the operation are likely to cause significant effects on the country’s environment, and, in the
event of such likely effects, assess country systems for reducing any such adverse effects and enhancing such positive effects.
In the event of significant gaps in the analysis, or shortcomings in the country systems, the Bank is required to identify how
such gaps or shortcomings would be addressed before or during program implementation, as appropriate.

                                                              52
Development Policy Operation which will look at climate risks to livelihoods; and (ii) a recently
initiated land policy TA which will look at sustainable land management practices.
148.     Measures to support the fertilizer exit strategy of Government to ensure sustainable
fertilizer provision and increased agriculture productivity through private sector involvement
should lead to a more efficient distribution and better use of fertilizer than under the previous
government’s subsidized system. Although this is likely to result eventually in an increased uptake of
fertilizer, currently, the quantity of fertilizer that is likely to get distributed through improved private
sector involvement would be limited. With proper management34, significant adverse environmental
impacts could be avoided, and it should have substantial positive impacts on poverty and smallholder
and resource productivity.35 REMA’s State of the Environment and Outlook Report 200936 for
Rwanda also indicates the need to control the use of agrochemicals near marshes and on slopes. The
Government, under the EDPRS, is exploring a balanced approach between environmental
conservation and the need for increased agriculture productivity. Various pilot activities are being
undertaken to test different approaches by the REMA and MINAGRI, including through the Bank and
GEF-supported Integrated Management Critical Ecosystem Project and Lake Victoria Environmental
Management Project.
149.   The proposed operation is expected to have no significant adverse effects on the
environment, while country systems are functioning and appropriate arrangements have been made
through the Bank’s work, to address any such effects that might arise. The operation therefore
complies fully with the requirements of OP 8.60.

                    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

150.    The third PRSF series comprises three annual, single-tranche operations within a
programmatic framework. The PRSF series will be aligned with the CPAF, which was finalized in
December 2008. The PRSF series supports two objectives under of the EDPRS Flagship Area 1:
Growth for Jobs and Export. The strategic objective one supports increased economic growth,
including, enhanced business climate, building economic infrastructure and increasing agricultural
productivity. Strategic objective two supports the management of the population growth rate and
enhancing population development, by focusing on enhancing population skills. The PRSF also
supports one objective under the EDPRS Flagship Area 3: Governance. Under the objective three of
enhanced gains through governance the PRSF series supports improved public accountability and
enhanced public financial management.
151.    The reform program supported by the PRSF 8-10 has been captured in the associated
Policy Matrix and Results Framework (Annex 2). Key outcomes indicators monitored under the
proposed PRSF-series are described in Table 8 and only include indicators that have actual results
available on a yearly basis (i.e. exclude PEFA-related indicators). For indicator 10, a baseline became
available in 2009/10 only. For indicator 11, no data was available for 2009/10 as it constitutes a new
indicator. Among the remaining 10 indicators, 9 were fulfilled; only one missed its target for 2009/10
(shaded grey).
152.     Monitoring and evaluation arrangements rely on Government arrangements with the
aim of strengthening Government capacity and institutions. The Government has developed in
close collaboration with partners, including the Bank, a results and performance framework integrated
into the planning and budgeting processes for monitoring the EDPRS. The integrated results
framework/monitoring system consists of three components: (i) a National Results and Policy Matrix,
(ii) the CPAF, and the DPAF. It has also designed appropriate institutional settings to monitor its

34
   In terms of types of fertilizers distributed, encouraging complementary manure use and field erosion management,
appropriate integrated nutrient management and integrated pest management programs, soil testing to improve targeted and
appropriate use, capacity building and awareness raising of farmers and agro-dealers, and monitoring programs.
35
   An Environmental Capacity Assessment was recently prepared by the Bank for the LWH project.

implementation, in which responsibility for the overall monitoring of the EDPRS rests with
MINECOFIN’s Strategic Planning Unit. In addition, the Budget Monitoring and Reporting Unit
reports on spending of the budget and related outputs. This unit also ensures that the sector spending
plans are incorporated into the macro-MTEF, and budget. The Bank closely worked with these two
units to monitor spending and outputs achieved under the PRSF series.
153.     To improve monitoring systems, the Bank has supported the Government’s efforts to
build quality and institutional capacity. Alongside the PRSF, the Bank is implementing grants from
the Belgian Poverty Reduction Partnership Trust Fund aimed at enhancing statistical capacity,
providing support to the National Institute of Statistics through the Statistics for Results Facility.
Finally, the Bank’s ongoing investment projects each have an M&E component that supports both the
project and the relevant sectoral ministry.

154.    The monitoring and evaluation of the PRSF series draws from the CPAF which was
finalized in December 2008. The Bank monitors selected key outcome indicators and the overall

37
   According to the Terms of Reference for the JSR outcome indicators fulfilled at 90 percent of target are regarded as
fulfilled. The Bank, as a partner in the CPAF, follows this assessment and regards them as fulfilled.
38
   It is possible that some indicators have for 2010/11 targets a lower target than the actual for 2009/10 (e.g. primary school
completion rate). This is the case because by the time the actual of 2009/10 was available, in October 2010, the CPAF was
locked for 2010/11, hence no target adjustments that considers the already overachievement was possible anymore and could
be only reflected in the target in 2011/12.
39
   The indicators: index on business environment and score of investor perception are defined in detail in Annex 2.

                                                                54
CPAF in close collaboration with Government and other budget support donors. Table 8 summarizes
the expected outcomes and related indicators and targets and provides the actual achievements for
2009/10, the fiscal year closing immediately before the PRSF-8. Monitoring of these indicators relies
on the Government system, and the actuals for 2009/10 displayed in the table below, stem from the
SWG reports of the October 2010 JSRs. Definition of each indicator along with measurement and data
source has been outlined by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda.

                                           FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

155.     The Government is in its third year of implementing its ambitious PFMRS based on
Annual Action Plans. The ultimate goal of the PFMRS is to ensure efficient, effective and
accountable use of public resources as a basis for economic development and poverty eradication
through improved service delivery. The PFMRS and the Annual Action Plans have been endorsed by
key donors engaged in supporting the Government’s reform agenda in this area via the PFM basket
fund, including the Bank. The PFMRS is being implemented under four pillars and thirteen distinct
complementary components. A PFM Reform Steering Committee, comprising representatives of the
implementing agencies and development partners oversee the implementation of the PFMRS. The
Steering Committee is supported by a PFM Reform Technical Committee, which is in turn supported
by various Component Working Groups. Day to day coordination of PFMRS implementation is
carried out by a PFM Reform Secretariat, which is based at MINECOFIN. Progress in implementation
of the PFMRS is primarily measured through the common approved performance indicators as
established in the CPAF of the EDPRS and in the PFM Key Results Matrix described in the PFM
Reform Strategy (2008/09-2012/13).
156.    The PFM system is reasonably adequate to support the proposed PRSF. Assessments of
the fiduciary aspects are largely based on results from the 2007 and 2010 PEFA (Annex 4). They
indicate that PFM and procurement systems have been improving steadily in line with Government’s
commitment to reform (as outlined in its Financial Accountability Review and Action Plan) and the
dialogue between the Government and donors. This fiduciary assessment is also based on results from
recently completed PERs, the 2004 HIPC Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment Report,
as well as the 2005 Country Financial Accountability Assessment.
157.     A key focus of the proposed PRSF 8-10 is to strengthening the Government’s public
financial and expenditure management systems and providing continued support implementation of
the Government’s PFMRS. Areas of support under the PRSF have been summarized in the previous
section.
158.    The most recent safeguards assessment of the BNR was completed by the IMF in the
context of the PRGF arrangement approved on June 12, 2006. The updated assessment was
completed on January 26, 2007 and proposed recommendations to address continuing vulnerabilities
in the external audit and financial reporting areas. The implementation of these measures is being
monitored under the Fund program, but there was no separate follow-up since 2007. The Central Bank
has been regularly audited and its audited financial statements are publicly disclosed. They are
accompanied by internal control reports..40 The audit opinion issued is unqualified (clean) and in
compliance with international financial reporting standards.

159.    Amount, Beneficiary, Terms, and Tranching: The Recipient is the Republic of Rwanda,
represented by MINECOFIN. A single-tranche development policy financing consisting of a grant of

    Audits of the Central Bank are annual and published in the annual reports which are found under the following link:
http://www.bnr.rw/publications.aspx. The most recent audit report is part of the annual report for December 2010:
http://www.bnr.rw/docs/publicnotices/Annual%20Report%202010%20.pdf. Audit reports are accompanied with internal
control reports are not included in the published report. The exercise dates back to audits of 1997, conducted in 2002.

SDR37.3 million (US$60 million equivalent) and a credit of SDR40.4 million (US$65 equivalent) will
be made available following approval and notification by IDA of financing effectiveness. The
completion of prior actions and the maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework are
sufficient to release the financing.
160.     Disbursements: The proposed financing will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy operations. The Financing proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program. Upon notification by IDA of financing
effectiveness, and with the submission by the Recipient of a withdrawal application, the proceeds of
the Financing into an account designated by the Recipient that forms a part of the country’s foreign
exchange reserves at the BNR. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will be necessary. However, the proceeds of the Financing cannot be used
for ineligible expenditures (i.e. to finance goods and services from the IDA’s standard negative list as
reflected in the Financing Agreement). If, after deposit into the Foreign Currency Account, the
proceeds of the Financing are used for ineligible expenditures, IDA will require the Recipient to either
(i) return the amount to the account for use for eligible purposes, or (ii) refund the amount directly to
IDA. Within two business days, BNR will credit the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the Financing
proceeds to the consolidated account maintained on behalf of Government which finances budgeted
expenditures.
161.     Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing: The Recipient will report to IDA on the amounts
deposited in the Foreign Currency Account and credited in local currency to the budget management
system with an indication of the exchange rate applied. The Director of Treasury will be notified
accordingly. The BNR will not impose any charges or commissions on Government for these
transactions. The conversion from US dollar to Rwanda Franc will be based on the prevailing
exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the consolidated account. Government, through
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, will: (i) provide written confirmation within 30 days
to the Bank that an amount equivalent to the Financing proceeds from the Bank has been credited to
the consolidated account, with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (ii) provide evidence that the

                                 RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

163.    There are a number of risks that could jeopardize the expected outcome of this proposed
PRSF series (Table 9). These include (i) regional and country-specific risks, (ii) vulnerabilities to
external shocks and (iii) program-specific risks. The design of this series, with a relatively focused
reform agenda anchored in the CPAF which is supported by all budget support development partners,
should help mitigate many of these risks.
164.     Stability has returned to the Great Lakes Region, following the joint military operation
to disarm the Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda (FDLR) of the Governments of
DRC and Rwanda in 2009, but still poses a residual risk to Rwanda's economic stability and its
ambitious development program. It could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic management, in
particular revenue mobilization, budget implementation, and take strategic priority over the
implementation of the reform program. Success in addressing this risk will depend on the strong
engagement of the governments in the region as well as the international community. At the
international level, both the United Nations (UN) and the African Union have continued to support the
establishment of peace in the region. UN Security Council Resolution 1804, adopted in March 2008,
urges the FDLR and all Rwandan armed rebel groups to lay down their weapons and return to

                                                   56
Rwanda. Following the flare up of fighting in Eastern DRC in late 2008, some budget support donors
who constitute a small share of overall budget support suspended their budget support due to their
uncertainty over Rwanda’s compliance with the underlying principles of the Budget Support
Partnership Agreement Framework, related to the promotion of peace and security in the region
(Article 18 of the partnership MoU signed between Government and Budget Support donors in April
2008).
165.     Rwanda’s internal security and political situation has also stabilized. In August 2010, the
country peacefully re-elected the incumbent president for his second and, and by the Constitution, last
seven-year term. In order to mitigate the risk of repeating internal ethnic unrest due to unequal access
and distribution of resource, the Government focuses large parts of public expenditures on poverty
reduction priorities, and address remaining disparities with explicit interventions to assist the poorest
groups identified through one of the three EDPRS flagships, the VUP. Additionally, the participatory
planning and poverty assessment in use –i.e. the Ubudehe program– assesses how the poor are
identified and offers recommendations for reducing poverty. However, Rwanda remains vulnerable to
a reduction in aid flows due to changes in international perceptions about the state of political
governance and human rights in Rwanda. For several bilateral donors, issues of democratic
governance, political and media freedom and equal access to justice are key determinants of the
decision to continue provide funding, in particular general budget support which amounted to about 36
percent of total expenditures in 2009/2010. While these issues continue to be raised by bilateral
donors, there have so far been no signs for reductions in donor assistance, which could potentially
jeopardize achievement of development outcomes including the ones supported by the proposed PRSF
series. The Bank’s support for strengthened governance will continue within the parameters laid down
in its 2007 Governance and Anticorruption Strategy and strengthening capacity of civil society and
private sector actors.

166.    Capacity remains one of the key country risks that affect the public and private sector
alike. Weak capacity could diminish the link between reforms supported by the proposed PRSF series
and envisioned reform achievements. These risks will pose also a threat to the sustainability of the

                                                           57
results achieved by reforms supported by this PRSF. However, the Government is commitment to
invest in skills development and recently launched the SCBI with support from the Africa Governance
Initiative and the World Bank to improve service delivery in key sectors. It remains also committed to
the broader civil service reform agenda, specifically the completion and implementation of the Pay and
Retention Policy to harmonize pay across the public service and address the widespread retention
problem. To improve the skills base of the population as a key input to increased private sector
activity, Government is focusing increasingly on improving the quality and relevance of the general
education system and the TVET system. All of these reform areas are also supported by the PRSF
series.
167.     Rwanda’s short to medium term outlook is vulnerable to external shocks as large trade
imbalances and heavy reliance on donor assistance persists. Overall Government’s record on
macroeconomic management is satisfactory as evidenced also through the satisfactory completion of
the second review under the IMF PSI in June 2011. However, risk in this regard could arise through
persistent volatility in world commodity prices for Rwanda’s key export goods, tea, coffee and
minerals, compromising export earnings. Also, yet again raising food and fuel prices could dampen
overall growth prospects. The previous crisis was transmitted to the Rwanda economy mainly through
lower export values, FDI and tourism receipts. The Government responded with the development and
adoption of an Export Strategy, aiming at diversifying exports and better using its comparative
advantage in specific sectors. Related, is the risk of a reduction in grants as an effect of the fiscal crisis
following the global slowdown. In order to mitigate fiscal risk, Government will continue to protect
priority spending from any potential reductions in overall spending and will redouble efforts to expand
improve the efficiency of the tax system. Although Rwanda is not directly affected by the drought that
is affecting other Eastern African countries, the situation is being carefully monitored by the
Authorities and the 2011/12 budget composition and spending remains flexible to accommodate social
safety net enhancements, if necessary. Financing provided through the proposed PRSF are of
discretionary nature and would enable Government to react to external shocks. There remains the need
for Government to take on some non-concessional loans, on a selective basis, to finance its ambitious
strategic investment agenda. The World Bank and the IMF will continue to support the Government in
managing macroeconomic reform. In the context of the Low Income Country (LIC) DSA framework,
the Bank and IMF will continue to monitor the evolution in Rwanda’s debt indicators which are
currently below set thresholds. The Bank’s support is provided on fifty percent grant and fifty percent
credit terms in response to the country’s risk of medium debt distress. The PRSF can mitigate some
risk, by contributing to macroeconomic stability (through fiscal sustainability), supporting private
sector development, and maintaining a focus on key reforms.
168.     Program risks including implementation risks (e.g. lack of reform ownership, political
constraints, and weak capacity) and fiduciary risks are deemed low to negligible. None of these
risks, other than slight delays related to capacity constraints, have materialized during the
implementation of the previous PRSF series. Overall, the Government has shown in the past great
reform leadership and established a very good track record of reforms. This is evidenced by the
successful implementation of the PRSF4-7 series, and the graduation of the country to a PSI
arrangement with the IMF, under which it completed until now all reviews successfully. Also, the
proposed PRSF mitigates these risks with prior actions that are aligned with the CPAF, as part of the
EDPRS monitoring matrix and thus directly part of the reform program Government committed itself
within each fiscal year. Improvements in fiduciary standards and budget implementation were reported
in the recent PEFA assessment (Annex 4). In addition, IDA projects (such as the PSCBP) provide
direct support to the Government’s fiduciary systems and contribute to higher fiduciary standards for
all Government transactions. IDA and other donors are also supporting the Government’s efforts to
strengthen its implementation capacity through investments and technical assistance, which will be
closely monitored in consultation with other donors. Finally, the proposed PRSF series is supporting
measures to reduce fiduciary risk by increasing transparency and accountability in the management of
public finances.

                59
       Letter of Development Policy for the Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Financing

The Program

1.      The Government of Rwanda (GoR) remains committed to achieving sustained economic
growth and poverty reduction and consolidating macroeconomic stability. The strategies to achieve
these goals are set out in the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) for
2008–2012 as well as in the Vision 2020 development plan. Rwanda is just passed mid-way in
implementation of the EDPRS designed in line with its long term 2020 Vision and other international
commitments including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that aims to set out the national
strategy and action plan for poverty reduction and form the basis for the allocation of public resources
to development activities.

2.      The GoR jointly with all its Development Partners implement, monitor and review the
EDPRS’s three flagship programs, namely (i) Sustainable Growth for Jobs and Exports, which
includes agriculture, infrastructure, and private sector development; (ii) Vision 2020 Umurenge (a
decentralized integrated rural development program designed to address extreme poverty); and (iii)
Governance. A picture of progress of the Strategy is shown through EDPRS formal monitoring and
assessment framework, the Joint Budget Support Reviews (JBSR). The latest backward-looking JBSR,
held early October 2010, concluded that Rwanda is making good progress in terms of EDPRS
implementation as targeted through indicators of the Common Performance Assessment Framework
(CPAF). The CPAF is the basis for assessment of the Government’s performance in the
implementation of the EDPRS by the Development Partners providing budget support.

3.       Rwanda presents a unique case in development and in the progress towards achieving the
MDGs. While many countries were on course to implement the MDGs in the 1990s and beyond,
Rwanda has been recovering from the tragic and devastating genocide and civil war of 1994. All the
MDGs indicators in Rwanda were actually dramatically reversed during and as a consequence of the
1994 genocide and fell far below 1990 levels. Therefore, Rwanda's "starting line" for working towards
the MDGs begins much later, and much lower, than in many other countries. This said, Rwanda has
comparatively good progress in implementation of the MDGs, including the number of seats held by
women in the Rwanda’s Parliament, which increased from 17 percent in 1994 to 52 percent in 2008,
the highest in the world. Rwanda is very likely to meet—and possibly even surpass—the MDG targets
for child and maternal mortality by 2015, the rate of births attended by skilled staff increased from 39
percent to 52 percent between 2005 and 2008 and the proportion of children under five sleeping under
insecticide-treated bed nets increased from 4 percent in 2000 to 56 percent in 2008/09.

4.      Rwanda has achieved high growth and macroeconomic stability over the last decade despite
the global financial and economic crisis, Rwanda’s economic growth remains relatively strong, and
the growth has averaged about 8 percent a year. Five years average real GDP growth was 8.8 percent
during 2005-2009, exceeding the EDPRS target of 7 percent. In 2008, the economy registered its
highest growth rate in the last five years of 11.2 percent. After a somewhat slower growth in 2009 of
6.1%, a slight recovery took place in 2010, with GDP growth reaching 7.5%; while inflation had gone
down to 0.2% in December 2010. Growth was driven by a good agriculture harvest, especially
food crops that benefited from the large investments in fertilizer, improved seeds and
extension services under our Crops Intensification Program (CIP).
5.      In 2011 economic growth is expected to go down slightly to 7.0%, largely due to a withdrawal
of fiscal stimulus and the adverse impact of rising global food and fuel prices. However, robust
monitoring and treatment of external risks by the GoR in FY2010/2011 will continue to help hold off
the high inflationary pressures experienced by other countries in the region and indeed in the world.
Despite this positive prognosis, much effort is needed to translate the growth into reducing extreme
poverty and to meet the Vision 2020 targets.


                                                  60
Economic Development and Macroeconomic Management

6.       The current macroeconomic framework will seek to accommodate the Government of
Rwanda’s financing requirement for the budget without crowding out the private sector. As a result,
credit to private sector is forecasted to grow by about 19.4% over the year in 2011, not far from the 20
percent growth initially projected. In a bid to improve access to finance in rural areas, under structural
reforms, the Central Bank is recruiting 60 inspectors that will supervise the Savings and Credit
Cooperatives (SACCOs) and also provide to them on reporting back to the central bank.

7.      In recognition of its track record of high growth and generally prudent macro-economic
management, including achievement of low fiscal and current account deficits and maintenance of a
comfortable level of international reserves, Rwanda was approved for a Policy Support Instrument
(PSI) by the IMF in June 2010. The PSI is designed to address certain key vulnerabilities, including
weaknesses in monetary and exchange rate policies, which have at times led to high levels of inflation;
low levels of fiscal revenues and exports; and continued high aid dependence. The three-year Policy
Support Instrument (PSI) aims to support prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that
underlie strategies in the EDPRS and Vision 2020.

Overview of Recent Developments

8.      The last backward-looking JBSR of October 2010 reported that there was in general good
progress in the five sectors under the economic cluster: (1) Private Sector Development (PSD), (2)
Agriculture, (3) Energy, (4) Transport, and (5) Environment.

9.       For the agriculture the stakeholders welcomed the strong yields achieved, following concerted
reform efforts of the Government in this sector. Actions to follow-up on this success are lined up and
agreed with the Authorities. Forward-looking there is agreement on improvement of the post-harvest
supply-chain. Due to the remarkable increase in the agriculture productivity, a strong focus should be
put on the improvement of postharvest and strategic storage in order to minimize losses and to
continue to tackle malnutrition. The analysis of potential consequences of a Strategic Grain Reserve
was identified as a key action. There was strong support from all stakeholders to support next steps to
further the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach. The World Bank is the Lead Development Partner for
this sector.

10.      For the energy sector stakeholders welcomed progress on the electricity tariff study, which is
expected to be finalized over the next months. They also acknowledged the Government’s efforts to
address the biomass issue with the successful implementation of the LPG tax-reduction and the
continued effort to promote alternatives to charcoal. Participants note, however, that following the
LDG tax-reduction an impact study concerning social and environmental consequences needs to be
prepared. In an effort to address the constraints and challenges in the sector, GoR launched the public
utility Energy, Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA), which replaces the old Rwanda Electricity
Company (RECO).

11.      On transport, it was noted that following the successful interventions in the agriculture sector
to improve yields there is a need to provide appropriate feeder roads which will connect farmers with
markets. Currently the focus of policy actions and indicators in this sector is primarily on national /
district paved road, rather than rural roads. There was agreement that in order to improve coordination
of on the issue of roads, the Sector Working Group on Transport should be strengthened through, for
example, wider participation including MINAGRI.

12.     Stakeholders in the Private Sector welcomed GoR initiatives with regards to the new
Competition and Consumer Protection Policy and recommended the issue of a lack of, and the
untimely availability of invest climate indicators was addressed. Rwanda continued to build on the
progress measured by the 2011 World Bank Doing Business Report, and noted improved ratings in
key indicators as getting credit, trading across borders, starting a business, and dealing with

                                                   61
construction permits. The Doing Business spirit that is inbuilt within institutions enabled the
establishment of a one-stop centre for construction permits in order to promptly address the main
bottlenecks to our construction industry. Yet there is still more to do. Over the next 12 months, the
GoR will continue to implement programs of reform so that business and trade contribute more to
Rwanda's economic growth and social transformation.

13.     Ever committed to ensuring aid effectiveness and efficient use of public funds, the GoR is
hoping to take a leadership role in the region and become a focal country during the 4 th High-Level
Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Korea. We shall look forward to sharing our experience,
particularly on the issues of national ownership and leadership of the development agenda, use of
country systems as well as mutual accountability.

Conclusion

14.      In closing, the Government of Rwanda expresses its gratitude to the Bank for its continued
support to the development of Rwanda and reiterates its strong commitment to reduce poverty and
foster sustainable growth. The Government would greatly appreciate the approval of the Financing to
assist in the implementation of our objectives and development program.

           The Index of business environment uses information from the World Bank on six Doing Business indicators to compute an
        absolute index (not responding to other countries’ performance). The six World Bank Doing Business categories covered
        under the business environment index are: Starting a business, registering property, paying taxes, trading across borders,
        enforcing contracts and dealing with construction permits.

       By the time the actual of 2009/10 was available, in October 2010, the CPAF was locked for 2010/11, hence no target
       adjustments that considers the already overachievement was possible anymore. The 2011/12 and onwards targets reflect the
       earliest possible revision opportunity of April 2011.

          The 2010/11 target (88 percent) followed the trajectory of the 2008 actual (78.6 percent) and the 2009/10 target (82
       percent). By the time the actual of 2009/10 was available, in October 2010, the CPAF was locked for 2010/11, hence no
       target adjustments that considers the already overachievement was possible anymore. The April 2011 review needed to adjust
       all forward-looking targets to reflect the shift in Government policy from 6 to 9 year basic education in 2009, combining
       primary and lower secondary into basic education. Given that the first cohort of pupils will exit the new 9YBE in 2011/12,
       the indicator is measuring now not anymore transition from 6 th to 7th grade but from 9th to 10th grade, i.e. basic to upper
       secondary education. As such it is expected that the proportion of pupils transitioning is decreasing, reflected in revised
       targets 2011/12 onwards.

                               Annex 4: Rwanda’s 2007 and 2010 PEFA


This annex presents a summary of the PEFA 2010 prepared in the second half of 2010, covering a
Central Government (CG) assessment and a Sub-National (SN) assessment. The CG Assessment is a
repeat assessment as a PEFA for CG has been undertaken in 2007.
When comparing the 2007 and 2010 ratings it should be noted the previous PEFA may have under-
scored or over-scored some of the ratings for indicators or individual dimensions. Thus a simple
comparison of the overall scores between two assessments at different times, not detailed by
dimension, and with no analysis of change, can suggest deterioration, improvement or stagnation of
indicators, which is in fact not the case. In the case of Rwanda there was real progress despite the
appearance of stagnation, if an indicator was over-scored by the previous assessment, as the PEFA
team found to be the case for PI-11. Similarly, in the case of PI-21 and PI-25 there is the appearance of
deterioration as indicators or dimensions were highly over-scored in the PEFA 2007. Also, there was
progress for PI-18 but less so than indicated by a simple comparison of the overall scores, as the
indicator was over-scored by the previous assessment.
The CG assessment found that the areas of PFM performance that were already at a very satisfactory
level of performance (A) in 2006 and have remained such are: PI-3 Aggregate revenue out-turn
compared to original approved budget (A); PI-5 Classification of the budget (A); PI-13 Transparency
of taxpayer obligations and liabilities (A).
The areas of PFM performance that have improved and achieved a very satisfactory (A) or acceptable
(B) level of performance are: PI-1 Aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to original approved
budget (A); PI-4 Stock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears (B); PI-6 Comprehensiveness
of information included in budget documentation (A); PI-8 Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal
relations (A); PI-10 Public access to key fiscal information (A); PI-11 Orderliness and participation in
the annual budget process (B+); PI-14 Effectiveness of measures for taxpayer registration and tax
assessment (A); PI-16 Predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of expenditures (B+);
PI-17 Recording and management of cash balances, debt and guarantees (B); PI-18 Effectiveness of
payroll controls (B+); PI-19 Competition, value for money and controls in procurement (A); PI-20
Effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary expenditure (B+); PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of
accounts reconciliation (B); PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external audit (B+); PI-28
Legislative scrutiny of external audit reports (B); D-1 Predictability of Direct Budget Support (A).
The areas of PFM performance that are showing some improvement, yet remain weak, are: PI-2
Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget (D); PI-7 Extent of
unreported government operations (D+); PI-9 Oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public
sector entities (C); PI-21 Effectiveness of internal audit (C); PI-25 Quality and timeliness of annual
financial statements (D+); D-2 Financial information provided by donors for budgeting and reporting
on project and program aid (D+).
The areas of PFM performance that are not showing much improvement and remain weak are: PI-12
Multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting (C+); PI-15 Effectiveness
in collection of tax payments (D+); PI-23 Availability of information on resources received by service
delivery units (D); PI-24 Quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports (D+); PI-27 Legislative
scrutiny of the annual budget law (C+); D-3 Proportion of aid that is managed by use of national
procedures (D).
Ratings that have remained unchanged since the 2007 PEFA, and are difficult to justify are: PI-7 (ii),
PI-23, and D-3 at D; PI-15 and PI-24 at D+; PI-12 and PI-27 at C+. For PI-7 (ii), more information on
donor assistance than what is included in fiscal reports is available within MINECOFIN, for PI-15,
effectiveness in collection of tax payments, unchanged at D+ since the 2007 PEFA, despite Domestic
Revenue Generation being a component of the Government PFMRS under Pillar 1, Economic
Management and Budget; for PI-24, as in-year budget reporting did take place in 2007 and 2008; and
in-year reporting just ceased.

                                                   74
Regarding the others, it can be noted that: D-3, proportion of aid that is managed by use of national
procedures, shows that donors are not sufficiently relying on country systems for the channeling of
donor assistance, and have not increased their reliance since 2006, despite the constant and
coordinated presence of donor support in Rwanda, an overall improvement in PFM processes, and the
general objective under the Paris Deceleration and the Accra Agenda to increasingly rely on national
systems; The failure of improvements in the availability of information on resources received by
service delivery units (PI-23) is surprising especially give the fiscal decentralization process
underway, and the stated objectives of the National Decentralization Policy. Regarding legislative
scrutiny of the annual budget law (PI-27), the indicator rating cannot improve as long as the current
situation, of no limit in place for the size of supplementary budgets, reflected under dimension (iv),
continues. The failure of the MTEF (see PI-12) to deliver its true objective of linking policy targets
with actual budget allocations and thus ensure at the same time a strategic allocation of resources and
fiscal sustainability, is also costly in Rwanda, given the vast amount of capacity invested in the multi-
year planning process, which is very extensive and involves a large variety of activities throughout the
budget preparation cycle, across all sectors. Regarding the implementation of IFMIS/SmartGov, which
is part of the official PFM Government Reform Program, under Pillar 2, component 3, it has fallen
behind schedule. Its delay is at the root of the fact that the quality of financial statements (PI-25 (i))
has not improved as much as its potential, as it is hampered by the continued coexistence of two
different systems, SagePastel and SmartGov. Overall, not enough effect has trickled to PFM systems
in the area of accounting, recording and reporting despite it being one of the main reform pillars.
The SN Assessment found a satisfactory nature and scope of the external scrutiny of SN governments
(see SN PI-26, rated at A for nature and scope and B overall). The OAG in fact audits all SN
governments on a yearly basis and issues the results of the audit as part of the Annual Report
presented to Parliament, under Volume III. Also in parallel with CG, and also probably as a result of
an acceptable level of external oversight, including on the implementation of audit recommendations,
the SN Assessment found that controls on both salary and non-salary expenditure are at an
acceptable/satisfactory level, with PI-18 and PI-20 both rated at B+. At the SN level, the core
dimension transparency and comprehensiveness was assessed only on the basis of two indicators (PI-8
and PI-10), one of which was found not applicable (PI-8). On the basis of PI-10 only, which assesses
public access to key fiscal information, transparency at the SN level is satisfactory (A). The core
dimension accounting and reporting, assessed at the SN level on the basis of the availability of funds
for commitment expenditures (PI-22) and in-year budget reporting (PI-24), shows acceptable to good
results (B+), and a more positive status of processes than for CG.
By indicator, the SN Assessment found that the areas that are at a good or acceptable level of
performance are: PI-2 Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget
(B,B,A,B); HLG-1 Predictability of transfers from higher levels of Government (B+, B+, B+, A)
_ PI-10 Public access to key fiscal information (A); PI-16 Predictability in the availability of funds for
commitment of expenditures (B+); PI-18 Effectiveness of payroll controls (B+); PI-20 Effectiveness
of internal controls for non-salary expenditure (B+); PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of accounts
reconciliation (B+); PI-24 Quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports (B+); PI-26 Scope, nature
and follow-up of external audit (B+).
The following areas were found to be weak: PI-1 Aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to original
approved budget (D,B,D,D); PI-11 Orderliness and participation in the annual budget process (D+).

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under Policy Support Instrument for
Rwanda

Press Release No. 11/251
June 23, 2011

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the second review
under a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Rwanda1. The Executive Board’s decision
was taken on a lapse of time basis2.

Rwanda’s macroeconomic performance has been strong overall, and its economic program
supported under the PSI remains on track. Real GDP growth is estimated at 7.5 percent for 2010,
up from 4.1 percent in 2009, driven by a favorable external environment and the PSI-supported
fiscal stimulus. However, rising global food and fuel prices, slower pick-up in credit to the private
sector, and raising financing to implement the government’s investment plan to close the
infrastructure gap continue to pose policy challenges. All quantitative assessment criteria for
December 2010 were observed, and structural reforms are advancing at a good pace.

The start of fiscal consolidation in FY 2011/12 would further anchor macroeconomic stability and
support growth. To this end, the authorities are streamlining expenditures—while protecting
priority spending—and introducing further reforms in revenue administration and public financial
management (PFM). The authorities are committed to tighten monetary policy in 2011 if needed to
contain any second round effects of higher global food and fuel prices on inflation. Structural
reforms will continue to focus on improving access to financial services while safeguarding
financial stability, further improving monetary policy implementation, further strengthening the
Public Financial Management (PFM) system, enhancing revenue administration, improving the
quality of national accounts statistics and enhancing policy coordination and capacity building.
Stepped up efforts will be needed to ensure that the risks of the large roll-out of Savings and Credit
Cooperatives (SACCOs) is addressed adequately through hiring and training of inspectors and the
early adoption of a sustainable institutional structure for SACCOs. Over the medium term,
sustaining the growth momentum would depend on securing financing for the key growth catalytic
investments, a favorable external environment, and a strong recovery in credit to the private sector.

The Executive Board approved a three-year PSI for Rwanda on June 16, 2010 (see Press Release
No. 10/247).

1
  The IMF’s framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need IMF financial assistance, but
still seek close cooperation with the IMF in preparation and endorsement of their policy frameworks. PSI-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil
society and development partners. A country’s performance under a PSI is reviewed bi-annually.
2
  The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedures when it is agreed by the Board that a proposal
can be considered without convening formal discussions.

Since 1970, IDA has committed to Rwanda a total of US$1.9 billion, of which 35 percent has
been in grants and 65 percent in credits. Forty-five investment projects and ten development policy
operations have been implemented to date. By the end of FY11, IDA delivered two new investment
operations and two PRSFs for a total net commitment amount of US$151.4 million. IDA's current
active portfolio comprises nine investment projects with a net commitment of US$267.28 million, of
which approximately US$100 million (37 percent) had been disbursed as of May 23, 2011.
Agriculture: The Second Rural Sector Support Project (second phase) focuses on expanding
irrigated areas in cultivated marshlands and increasing the use of sustainable land management
practices on associated hillsides to accelerate the pace of agriculture intensification. A third phase is
planned in FY12. The more recent Land Management, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation
Project supports a comprehensive Government program for commercialized and professional
agriculture with a focus on increasing the productivity and commercialization of hillside agriculture in
target areas. The Integrated Management of Critical Ecosystems Project promotes the sustainable
use and management of Rwanda’s critical ecosystems. A planned Lake Victoria Environment
Management Project regional project will focus on the sustainable environmental management of the
Lake Victoria basin. The regional project (under the Nile Basin Initiative), the Kagera River Basin
Project, includes a feasibility study in integrated watershed management and for small multipurpose
storage in the Kagera Basin.
Infrastructure (Energy/Transport/ICT): The Electricity Access Scale-up Project focuses on
improving access to reliable and cost-effective electricity services for households and priority public
institutions by financing the rehabilitation and expansion of Rwanda’s national transmission and
distribution networks. The Transport Sector Development Project contributes to improving the
quality of key international and domestic transport infrastructure as part of a wider strategy to improve
regional connectivity. The project links with various regional projects, including the East Africa
Trade and Transport Facilitation Project, which supports specific measures to improve the links
with markets within the EAC. The project is providing political risk insurance to improve private
capital flows within the COMESA. The Regional Communications Infrastructure Project supports
investments and technical assistance to lower prices for international communications and extend the
geographic reach of broadband networks.
Private Sector Development: The Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project supports
investment climate reforms by assisting commercial law reform, developing the capacity of the
Rwanda investment promotion agency, promoting the public-private dialogue as well as supporting
implementation of key elements of the country’s financial sector development plan (payment systems,
microfinance, accounting and auditing standards). The planned East African Community Financial
Sector Regionalization Project supports the development of the financial sector through the
establishment of a single market in financial services among EAC partner states. The IDA program
links closely with various IFC activities in the country, including the Investment Climate Reform
Project, which seeks to improve the regulatory environment, build institutions, and attract private
sector participation in key sectors; the IFC’s Credit Reporting Program, which works closely with
the central bank to develop the legal framework for sharing information and selecting a private credit
bureau operator; and the Entrepreneurship Development Program, which promotes SME
competitiveness through building capacity and linkages with larger firms as well as entrepreneurship
among the youth and women. In addition, there are several MIGA activities, which consist of three
projects in the areas of financial services and banking, with a major guarantee for the energy sector.
Management of Public Resources: The Public Sector Capacity Building Project focuses on
supporting crucial reforms that will strengthen PFM, including budgeting, accounting, auditing,
procurement, financial reporting and external oversight. This is complemented by technical assistance
which is being provided for Public Expenditure Management. In addition, technical support is
being given to help the Government implement its newly developed SCBI, with particular attention on
strengthening key service delivery ministries and agencies.
