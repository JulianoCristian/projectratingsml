of the Eighth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Financing Project (PRSF-8) for\n            Rwanda is to support the development of policies that\n            facilitate increased private sector investment and\n            involvement and ease constraints to broad based growth. The\n            PRSF-8 supports the Government of Rwanda as it implements\n            its medium-term strategy towards the attainment of the\n            Vision 2020. It supports the Government's second\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the Economic\n            Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The\n            EDPRS covers the period 2008-2012 and provides a medium-term\n            framework for achieving the country's long-term\n            development aspirations as articulated in the vision 2020.\n            It describes the Government's development objectives of\n            consolidating the achievements in rehabilitation and\n            reconstruction and accelerating the transformation to a\n            middle-income nation with a knowledge-based economy. It\n            presents a strategy focused on growth and human development,\n            with an emphasis on decentralization, and a greater role for\n            the private sector. The EDPRS priorities are articulated\n            through three flagship programs aimed at promoting\n            sustainable growth and poverty reduction and improving\n            governance. The Rwanda PRSF series is the Bank's key\n            policy dialogue instrument and it provides a broad framework\n            to support the reform process in Rwanda. In addition, it\n            leverages other Bank operations in areas supported under\n            this series. Supported reforms to increase efficiency,\n            transparency and accountability in the public sector include\n            public financial management to ensure that resources are\n            used more efficiently and effectively to benefit all parts\n            of the population, including the poor."}, "docdt": "2011-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
