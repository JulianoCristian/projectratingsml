Program Development Objectives
Program Development Objective (from Program Document)
The program development objective is to adopt policies that facilitate increased private sector investment and involvement and ease constraints to broad based growth.
Supported reforms to increase efficiency, transparency and accountability in the public sector include public financial management to ensure that resources are used
more efficiently and effectively to benefit all parts of the population, including the poor. During the PRSF8-10 series priority will go to measures aimed at: (i) supporting
the facilitation of trade and investments; (ii) increasing access to electricity and improved infrastructure services; (iii) raising private sector participation in the
agricultural sector; (iv) increasing the quality and relevance of education to build a skilled workforce; (v) improving service delivery through focused and strategic civil
service reform; and (vi) strengthening the management of public resources, including increasing transparency and accountability.
Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?
