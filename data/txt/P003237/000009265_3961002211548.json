of\n            Zambia's structural adjustment program which focuses on\n            market liberalization and civil service reform, together\n            with major new initiatives in private sector development,\n            privatization and parastatal reform. The main themes of the\n            credit are to: i) modernize the business framework through\n            up-to-date laws and regulatory systems; ii) consolidate\n            establishment of a market-based exchange rate mechanism;\n            iii) direct encouragement of the private sector through\n            privatization; and iv) autonomy and efficiency improvements\n            in the remaining parastatals. The centerpiece of the reform\n            is the privatization of 90% of Zambia's parastatals\n            over a five year period, and giving autonomy to the\n            remaining public utilities through a new arm's length\n            regulatory system. The parastatal holding companies will be\n            abolished within the next year. At the end of the five-year\n            period, the Government will have largely removed itself from\n            business operations."}, "docdt": "1992-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
