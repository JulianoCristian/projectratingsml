(ICR) for the Privatization and Industrial Reform\n            Credit (PIRC I) and the Second Privatization And Industrial\n            Reform Credit (PIRC II) in Zambia. The two PIRC programs\n            were designed to continue the implementation of the\n            privatization and parastatal reforms and the macroeconomic\n            stabilization started under the ERC. The two Credits\n            supported Zambia's structural adjustment program,\n            focusing on market liberalization and civil service reform,\n            and private sector development. Bank's performance was\n            highly satisfactory. Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: 1)\n            Macroeconomic stabilization is fundamental to private sector\n            investment and growth; 2) more priority should have been\n            given to abolishing Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation\n            (ZIMCO) to end its resistance to privatization, as well as\n            to the rehabilitation of the Zambia Consolidated Copper\n            Mines (ZCCM); 3) civil service reform requires the\n            development of a workable strategy and an affordable\n            compensation package; 4) it is essential to ensure support\n            of key government officials for the reform program during\n            the early stages of preparation and implementation; and 5)\n            development of a plan for streamlining the regulatory\n            framework and licensing requirements for small scale\n            enterprises and assessing their access to credit to be ensured."}, "docdt": "1996-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
