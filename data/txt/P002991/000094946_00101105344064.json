Lessons\n            suggest that market linkage development require further\n            interventions, not only market liberalization in accord with\n            public sector financing of technology development, since on\n            their own, these are not sufficient conditions for adoption\n            of new technologies. Rather, road network improvements,\n            development of farmers organizations, and, development of\n            savings, and credit associations with financing\n            institutions, together with supportive rural buying agents\n            are needed, to increase farmers capacity. Thus priority\n            should be given to training provision, to ensure the balance\n            between theory, and practical skills, to become more\n            demand-driven, placing stronger emphasis on enabling\n            extensionists in providing effective participatory\n            techniques. Furthermore, sound financial management,\n            internal auditing, and progress monitoring systems should be\n            established to improve performance, and cost-effectiveness,\n            possibly outsourcing to local organizations, under\n            supervision by independent external consultants. But\n            mechanisms should be established to ensure accountability of\n            research, and extension practices, considering empowerment\n            of farmer organizations, as well as public, private, and\n            non-governmental organizations responsiveness to pluralistic requirements."}, "docdt": "2000-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
