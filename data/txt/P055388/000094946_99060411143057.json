The\n            project has three components. The first has three\n            subcomponents comprising subprojects implemented 1) by\n            eligible farmer associations to support collective actions\n            to eradicate foot and mouth disease and hog cholera; control\n            Newcastle Disease, micoplasmosis and salmonelosis in\n            livestock; and eradicate plagues affecting fruit exports of\n            apple, mango, melon, and papaya; 2) by state agencies to\n            strengthen intrastate and interstate transit control of\n            animals and plants, train technical personnel and farmers in\n            agricultural health; and improve the agricultural monitoring\n            and surveillance system; and 3) by the Ministry of\n            Agriculture for capacity building, and for purchases of\n            equipment, materials, vehicles, and computer hardware and\n            software. The second component funds technical assistance,\n            training, and consultancies. The third component finances\n            project administration, monitoring, and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1999-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
