The project\n            achieved its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, it is important to have realistic estimates\n            of the timing required for implementation, particularly\n            regarding startup and the completion of detailed design and\n            engineering. Second, it was difficult to establish both the\n            appropriate institutional capacities for implementing new\n            policies, as well as the associated requirements for\n            preparing, implementing, and managing urban projects.\n            Finally, constraints were experienced with implementing\n            policies which hinged on the introduction of untested\n            enabling legislation."}, "docdt": "1983-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
