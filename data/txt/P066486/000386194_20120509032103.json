     governments in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, have\n            embarked on a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as a\n            way of improving their budget.  MTEF is essentially a\n            response to past budget failures in which budgeting was\n            reduced to a listing of 'wish-list' activities\n            that focused on 'needs' rather than 'funds\n            availability' causing undue expansion in the public\n            sector.  Moreover, government policymaking, planning, and\n            budgeting took place independently of each other such that\n            the budgetary implications of policies and programs were\n            rarely taken into explicit account.  Due to these factors,\n            many developing countries experienced inexorable growth in\n            government projects and in civil service employment,\n            resulting in little leeway for the funding of other\n            recurrent costs and in ensuring the sustainability of\n            investments. MTEF attempts to correct these budgetary\n            distortions by providing a 3 to 5 year framework for the\n            funding of priority expenditures under a given and\n            predictable budget constraint, that is, subject to the\n            availability of funds that are within the manageable\n            interest of the government (budgetary funds, extra-budgetary\n            funds such as user fees, and donor resources).  An MTEF\n            exercise has three related objectives are to improve\n            government and donors' allocation and spending of\n            resources to identified priorities within the sector, to\n            increase government and donors' commitment to the\n            stated policy and to funding predictability, and to provide\n            line ministries with a solid budget constraint that allows\n            them to 'contract' with lower level units on the\n            basis of a predictable budget. This report reviews the\n            status of the Government of Kenya's (GoK) initiative to\n            develop an MTEF for the health sector.  It identifies\n            institutional and technical constraints in the MTEF process,\n            provides recommendations for expediting and improving it,\n            and attempts to share lessons learned from other East\n            African countries that are going through similar budgetary\n            reform exercises. This report reiterates the importance of\n            formulating the MTEF firstly in the context of GoK's\n            stated goal of improving economic governance.  The Ministry\n            of Finance (MoF) views the MTEF as an important instrument\n            for instilling fiscal discipline and improving expenditure\n            management at the macro level."}, "docdt": "1999-06-10T09:37:01Z"}
