Some\n            lessons learned included: decentralization to the district\n            level has the potential to improve service delivery, but it\n            needs to be anchored within a strong institutional framework\n            accompanied by capacity building (including on fiduciary\n            issues) to improve the autonomy of districts and enable them\n            to plan, budget, and better manage their programs. At the\n            same time, sufficient attention should be given to national\n            level policy dialogue in order to ensure continuous support\n            and commitment to the decentralization agenda. In a\n            challenging political environment, sufficient attention\n            needs to be given during project design to find the right\n            balance between innovation for impact and preconditions for\n            reform. Preferably, for complex and innovative reforms like\n            those involving decentralization and fiscal transfers, it is\n            important to establish legal, policy and institutional\n            frameworks including implementation arrangements at all\n            levels and/or to plan to develop such capacity to carry out\n            the assigned responsibilities effectively. It may be\n            necessary that some progress take place on key aspects of\n            reform during project design and before project\n            effectiveness to ensure sufficient political commitment and\n            momentum from the government. Projects need good monitoring\n            and evaluation systems with clear and measurable indicators,\n            which are clearly defined during design of the project and\n            institutionalized to be able to systematically monitor\n            project implementation over time. Given the long history of\n            similar lessons from previous operations in health, there is\n            a clear need for simple, well-designed monitoring frameworks\n            that are owned by the government and implementable."}, "docdt": "2008-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
