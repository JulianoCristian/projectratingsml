overall outcome was\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low to\n            moderate, and both the Bank and the borrower performance\n            were satisfactory. Some important project lessons learned\n            were: (1) the key ingredients for project success always go\n            beyond the sphere of project itself. The Bank's support\n            strategy at both the country level and for the higher\n            education sub-sector was in full alignment with the\n            government's agenda. Sustained political support and a\n            relatively stable implementation environment were also key\n            factors in the project success. (2) A proper combination of\n            lending instruments is crucial to consolidate complex reform\n            processes. (3) Sequential operations offer great learning\n            potential. (4) Active project management is a key ingredient\n            for successful project implementation. (5) Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) systems have to be conceived as a\n            critical element of an operation\u0092s design. (6) Strong field\n            presence, continuity and a sector-wide view on the part of\n            the Bank teams give operations a substantial implementation\n            advantage. (7) It is important to ensure the full alignment\n            between the Project Development Objective (PDO) and the\n            actions supported under the operation, as well as the\n            alignment between the PDO and the Key Performance\n            Indicators. (8) A project\u0092s design can, in itself, reinforce\n            its underlying strategic objectives. (9) Balancing\n            efficiency and equity targeting criteria can have multiple advantages."}, "docdt": "2012-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
