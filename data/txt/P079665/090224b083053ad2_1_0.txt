      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the Second Higher
Education Project in Vietnam. This project was financed by the government of Vietnam,
beneficiary universities, the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA),
and the government of Japan through its Policy and Human Resource Development trust
fund. The World Bank approved its contribution on June 20, 2007 and the program
closed on June 30, 2012. The World Bank’s contribution through IDA was US$59.4
million, while the government of Japan committed US$4.8 million.

The program focused on improving the quality and relevance of higher education of
Vietnam and was part of a long-term effort by the government to increase the
contribution of higher education to development.

This report was prepared by Erik Bloom, Senior Economist, IEG with the assistance of
Ms. Hoàng Thanh Hà, consultant. The findings are based on an extensive review of
project documents as well interviews and field visits.

As much as possible, the PPAR cites publically available documents, and when
appropriate, it refers to interviews and internal documents.

Following standard IEG procedures, the report was sent to the government officials and
agencies in Vietnam for review and comments, no comments were received.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the impact of the World Bank’s
Second Higher Education Project in Vietnam. The project was approved on June 20,
2007 and closed on schedule on June 30, 2012. The World Bank provided a credit for
US$59.4 million, of which US$55.5 million were disbursed. The government committed
US$0.8 million and participating universities US$5.5 million; total disbursement from
local sources was US$5.5 million. The project also benefited from a US$4.8 million grant
from Japan’s Policy and Human Resource Development trust fund, of which US$2.6
million were disbursed.

The project objective was:

       to increase the quality of teaching and research in universities in Vietnam so as to
       improve the employability of graduates and the relevance of research.

The project consisted of three components:

      Component 1, Capacity Building for Policy Development (Appraised at
       US$4.8 million). This component aimed to develop policy and build capacity in
       in governance of higher education, higher education financing, and higher
       education quality.

      Component 2, Capacity Building for University Teacher and Research
       (appraised at US$61.4 million). This component focused on strengthening
       teaching and research in selected universities, through the provision of Teaching
       and Research Innovation Grants (TRIGs).

      Component 3, Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (appraised at
       US$4.3 million). This component aimed to support project management and
       management and evaluation, including support for project management in the
       areas of planning, financial management, procurement, and communication.

The project’s objectives remain very relevant to both the government’s strategy
towards higher education as well as the Bank’s country strategy. Vietnam is in the
process of modernizing and strengthening the higher education system. It fits within the
government’s strategies and supports several areas of its approach towards higher
education. Higher education continues to play an important part in the World Bank’s
country strategy and the project’s objectives remain relevant for the Bank.

Objective 1: Increase the Quality of Teaching in Order to Improve the
Employability of Graduates

This achievement of this objective was rated substantial. The project contributed to the
teaching capacity, leading to greater relevance and improved opportunities for students.
The project supported a number of programs to improve the quality of teaching. The
project supported both post-graduate training and short-term courses. Universities have
seen an increase in the percentage of instructors with masters and doctoral degrees.
                                              xii


During the project period, average score increased on standardized tests in both group 1
and group 2 universities. The average time of completing undergraduate studies
decreased in both groups of universities. In Group 1 Universities, the number of students
going overseas within six months of graduation increased from 1.7 to 2.4 percent. The
percentage of students getting a job within six months increased from 68.4 to 72.4
percent. However students in Group 2 Universities saw an increase in time to get a job.

Objective 2: Increase the Quality of Research in Order to Improve the Relevance of
Research.

The achievement of this objective is rated high. The project supported 249 research
projects. The project supported the development and dissemination of research. TRIGs
supported 1,162 national articles and 645 international articles, well exceeding the
established target. During the same period, there was an increase in the total number of
national and international articles, approximately doubling the annual production. While
this cannot be wholly attributed to TRIG, its support played a major role in this increase.
Science and technology has paid for a growing share of revenues in participating
universities growing from 5.2 percent to 11.8 percent during the project period.

Efficiency

The project’s efficiency is rated as substantial. The project was executed in timely
fashion and the project closed as expected. Most of the proposals for TRIGs were
prepared as expected and the PMU was able to disburse resources quickly. Although the
procurement was quite complicated, involving international competitive bidding for
sophisticated laboratory equipment did not affect the disbursement or the schedule of
implementation. The project audits did not show any serious problems with financial
management. Given the general success of the research component, the estimates in the
PAD probably understate the return. The PPAR estimates that the rate of return was at
least 34 percent, above the opportunity cost of capital.

Ratings

Overall, the project is rated satisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcomes is rated modest. The project was developed with
strong support from the government, as a follow-on project and well aligned with the
government’s strategy. The government has continued its commitment to the project’s
objectives. It is likely that the government will continue with TRIG. Increasing financial
autonomy also provides universities with resources to maintain their investments.

Bank Performance

Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The design period was quite long,
allowing the Bank time for detailed technical work as well as project preparation. The
Bank held an identification mission in 2003. This was followed by a number of
preparation missions that culminated in appraisal in March 2007. The Bank drew heavily
                                           xiii


from the lessons from the previous project and worked to make the grants more efficient.
The design was informed by consultation and technical work, including the preparation
of technical papers. The Bank also prepared detailed economic and financial analyses.

The Bank’s supervision was proactive, efficient, and supportive. It was responsive to the
project’s need and worked to prevent and solve bottlenecks. This included a fast
approvals (“no objection”). The Bank held at least one supervision mission per year, both
in Hanoi and in the field. Both Bank task team leaders were based in Hanoi and were
supported by local education, operations, and fiduciary staff.

Borrower performance

The overall borrower’s performance is rated as satisfactory. Central government
ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Planning and Finance, fully
supported the project. The Ministry of Education and Training was well engaged with the
project. It established the PMU and ensured that it was staffed. This was a major part of
the Financial Management Action Plan.

The Project Management Unit provided sound management to a complex project. The
PMU had a strong sense of ownership of the project. Universities indicated that it
provided timely technical and fiduciary advice that was crucial in implementing the
project, in particular for the complicated procurement processes. The PMU was able to
implement an ambitious monitoring and evaluation system that went beyond what was
indicated in the PAD. The PMU monitored the status of each university and provided
“grades” as well as feedback to improve performance.

Monitoring and Evaluation

The project had a strong monitoring and evaluation framework. While the World
Bank had a relatively underdeveloped results framework, the government had a more
detailed and sophisticated results framework. Both sets of results framework had baseline
and target indicators.

The project was able to monitor all of the required data as expected. Universities
provided a variety of information on their inputs as well as outputs and outcomes in a
timely fashion. Data played an important role in decision making in the project. The
project’s design included a mechanism to allocate TRIGs based on performance, which
the PMU used for the second tranche of TRIG. Universities that performed well received
additional resources while poorly performing universities lost resources.

Lessons

The key ingredients for project success often come from beyond the sphere of
project itself. In no small way, the project’s close alignment with the reform contributed
to its strong performance. The project was developed within the context of an extensive
higher education reform that had a high level of sustained government and university
support. It was also implemented in the context of a larger World Bank program for
higher education as well as full support from the Bank’s Country Strategy. Although it
was an investment project, HEP II supported many aspects of the reform, which, in turn,
                                             xiv


strengthened the project. Many of the actions supported by the project directly feed into
the reform and this is reflected in the results framework. As illustrated by the experience
of the HEP II, a project can effectively build upon the implementation experience of
preceding and parallel operations to enhance both the achievement of objectives.

A combination of Bank support instruments can contribute to a complex reform.
The Bank’s support for Vietnam’s higher education reform efforts has adopted a multi-
pronged strategy, combing investment and development policy operations with
knowledge work and a continuous policy dialogue. The investment operations, including
HEP 1 and HEP 2 and to a lesser extent the New Model (German) University, supported
both analytical inputs and investments to support the reform. In addition, they were
aimed at building much needed technical and institutional capacity at the central
government and university levels. In turn, the development policy series has provided
substantial financial incentives to move forward more with the challenging policy
reforms. It is clear from a review of the development policy activities that the support
from the HEP II was crucial in carrying many elements that HERA needed to advance.

Monitoring and evaluation can support the implementation of investment projects.
A robust M&E system was a key feature of the HEP II design and contributed to its
success. The PMU actively tracked and monitored implementation, beyond the World
Bank’s results framework. This led to development of university level monitoring
systems. This was a complex task given the diverse nature of TRIG sub-projects, and the
large number of implementing entities. The PMU used the data to provide targeted
support to the universities, identifying those that needed additional assistance. The PMU
also used these indicators to adjust the grants that universities receive. Universities that
were implementing the grant slowly saw a reduction in their allocation in the second
tranche, which focused on better performing institutions.

While a grant program may play an important role in developing autonomy, it is
not sufficient to ensure autonomy. When well defined, grants in higher education can
contribute to strengthen the capacity of universities to act autonomously. Competitive
grant programs are common in World Bank-financed higher education projects, building
on the positive experience of higher education systems in high income countries.
Strengthening autonomy was a central tenant of the ongoing higher education reform,
HERA. When the project was initiated, universities were centralized under the direct
authority of a Ministry or local government. Interviews show that while individual
researchers and research teams had some experience in writing grant proposals,
university faculties and school lacked this experience. The introduction of TRIG gave
faculties an opportunity to work together and to start to act with some autonomy. The
evaluation shows that despite this progress, developing university autonomy is more
complicated.

1. Background and Context
1.1     This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the impact of the
World Bank’s Second Higher Education Project in Vietnam. The project was approved on
June 20, 2007 and closed on schedule on June 30, 2012. The World Bank, through the
International Development Association (IDA), provided a credit for US$59.4 million. At
appraisal, the government of Vietnam committed US$0.8 million and participating
universities US$5.5 million for the project. The project also benefited from a US$4.8 million
grant from Japan’s Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) trust fund.

Socio-Economic Context
1.2     Since the start of market-based reforms twenty-five years ago, known as Doi
Moi, Vietnam has seen rapid economic growth. Vietnam transformed itself from one of
poorest countries in the world to a lower middle country in one generation. Overall, the per
capita gross domestic product has increased from US$290 (in 2005 dollars) in 1989 to
US$990 in 2012, with an average 5.3 percent growth rate. The industrial sector has seen an
8.2 average growth rate from 1991 to 2013, growing from 24 percent of the gross domestic
economic in 1991 to 28 percent in 2013. The agriculture sector has seen a growth rate of 3.7
percent during the same period, as its relative size decreased from 41 percent to 18 percent of
the gross domestic product. The services sector, which tends to rely most heavily on higher
education graduates, grew from 35 percent to 44 percent, a growth rate of 7.0 percent (World
Bank, 2011; World Bank, 2014).

1.3    Vietnam is passing through a major demographic transition. In 2010, Vietnam
had a population of 87.1 million. While the fertility rate declined from 3.7 birth per woman
in 1989 to 1.8 in 2011, the country is still relatively young with a quarter of the population
below the age of 14 in 2011. Vietnam has a significant ethnic minority population,
accounting for around 15 percent of the population, located primarily in the Central and
Northern Highland regions (World Bank, 2014).

1.4     Economic growth and transformation has led to a significant reduction in the
poverty rate. Using the US$1.25 per day poverty line, the percentage of poor has dropped
from 64 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 2008. Increasingly, extreme poverty is concentrated
in the remote rural population, particularly among ethnic minorities. By 2008, around half of
the poor were ethnic minorities (World Bank, 2012). While the income distribution remains
relatively equitable, there is growing inequality in access to health and education services.

1.5    Economic growth has transformed opportunities for employment. From 1990 to
2013, the national unemployment rate has averaged 2.3 percent and 4.9 percent for youth.1
Both of these rates have remained relatively steady as has the labor participation rate, around
77 to 79 percent. Between 2000 and 2012, the share of the employment in agriculture has
dropped from 65 to 47 percent, while the share in services increased from 22 to 32 percent.
Women have a high participation rate in the economy of around 71 percent, compared to 81

    Data are not available on employment rates by level of education.
                                                  2


percent for men. Women tend to be more active in agriculture and services, (about 5
percentage points more), while men are more active in industry (about 6 percentage points
more), using 2013 data (World Bank, 2015). For university graduates, employment for
university graduates is expected to grow by 5.9 percent between 2011 to 2020 (using a
computable general equilibrium mode), compared to a 1.4 percent growth rate for all
employment (Giesecke, Tran, Meagher, & Pang, 2011).

Education Sector
1.6     The education system of Vietnam is divided into five general levels: preschool (ages
3 to 5); primary education (grades 1 to 5); lower secondary education (grades 6 to 9); upper
secondary education (grades 10 to 12); and higher education. Most education providers are
under the authority of the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) or local governments.

1.7      In parallel with Vietnam’s fast economic and rapid poverty reduction, access to
education has increased substantially. While primary education has been essentially universal
for at least a decade, coverage of the secondary education is rapidly increasing. By 2013, the
net enrollment for lower secondary education is 93 percent. Likewise, coverage of pre-
primary has also increased substantially, from 40 percent in 2000 to 81 percent in 2012.
Increasingly, low access to education is confined to the population in remote areas (largely
ethnic minorities) and the unregistered urban population.

Higher Education in Vietnam
1.8     Prior to Doi Moi, most institutions of higher education were organized around
specific sectors or professions. These were supervised by the appropriate Ministry, such as
the University of Health under the Ministry of Health. There were only a few general
universities, under the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Education.2 The higher education
system was largely focused on teaching and producing graduates. Most research was carried
out by independent institutes and most post-graduate education was carried out overseas,
largely in the Soviet Bloc (St. George, 2010).

1.9      Currently, Vietnam is in a process to modernize and strengthen the higher
education system. The approach, introduced in 1993, includes greater centralization of
higher education, under the MOET, growth in general universities, and an increased place for
research. At the same time, the reforms formalized initiatives to introduce non-governmental
institutions and tuition in public universities. The reforms also aimed to break the
relationship between the university and state employment and explicitly gave graduates the
responsibility to find employment (Hayden & Thiep, 2010; St. George, 2010).

1.10 In 2012, there were an estimated 2.3 million students in higher education, which
corresponds to a gross enrollment of around 25 percent (World Bank, 2014). This appears to
be similar to enrollment in East Asian middle income countries like China or the Philippines,
however it is well below countries like Thailand or the Republic of Korea, which have gross

    This Ministry was merged into MOET in 1992.
                                                 3


enrollment rates between 50 to 100 percent (World Bank, 2013). As can be seen in Figure
1.1, enrollment has grown quickly since 1989 and the enrollment rate has increased ten-fold.

1.11 As part of the reforms introduced in 1993, there has been a consolidation in the higher
education sector. In 2007, there were 322 higher education institutions, including 139
universities. In 2004, the government designated 14 universities as “key” higher education
institutions.3 Approximately 15 percent of higher education institutions were private,
accounting for around 15 percent of total enrollment (Hayden and Thiep 2010). Around 60
higher education institutes are under the MOET with the rest reporting to different ministries
and to local governments (World Bank 2013).

1.12 In general, higher education in Vietnam is orientated towards the job market. Using
data from 2008, 33 percent of graduates are in the field of education, 27 percent are in social
science, business, and law, and 20 percent are sciences, industry, and engineering. The
remaining 20 percent are in agriculture, health, and humanities. A separate study estimates
that science accounts for around 4 percent of university enrollment in 2004 (Sheriden, 2010).

1.13 Despite the growth in higher education enrollment, the sector still faces many
challenges that the reform seeks to address. In particular, higher education suffers from a lack
of quality and relevance. Traditionally, higher education focused on teaching with little role
for research. It often employs out-of-date curriculum and lacks necessary equipment.
Likewise, there is a lack of a quality assurance system to provide feedback to universities.

3
 For the sake of simplicity and following the practice in the Project Appraisal Document, this PPAR
will call the higher education institutions “universities.”
                                                 4


Faculty members often lack sufficient academic credentials and training to be effective
teachers and researchers (World Bank, 2007). These limitations are associated with education
financing—universities have limited capacity to charge tuition or to benefit from the
research. Faculty salaries were low and there are often not enough instructors to meet the
demand. Universities generally lacked the capacity and authority to control their own
resources and to make strategic investment. Private universities have limited coverage.

 Box 1.1. The Higher Education Reform Agenda
 The Higher Education Reform Agenda 2006-2020 (commonly called HERA) is the government’s
 long-term agenda to adjust the higher education system to the changing needs of the economy. Its
 overall objective is to develop a higher education by 2020 that is “advanced by international
 standards, highly competitive, and appropriate to the socialist-orientated mechanism (Nghi 2010).”
 HERA has five specific objectives:
     1) Completion of a national network of higher education institutions suitable for Vietnam;
     2) Full development of a higher education curriculum that supports research and gives student
          more career options;
     3) Continued rapid expansion of the higher education system;
     4) An increase in the number of qualified higher education staff to improve quality and
          decrease the student-to-teacher ratio; and
     5) More scientific and technical research in higher education institutions.
 The agenda proposes a number of activities, including reforming curriculum and teacher methods,
 increasing fiscal autonomy and granting greater autonomy, expanding physical facilities,
 investment in teaching and research, and encouraging private and foreign investment. The
 government estimated that the total cost of HERA will be US$20 billion, of which approximately
 US$18 billion will be for physical infrastructure. Approximately half of the total is expected from
 private sources, including tuition paid to both public and private institutions.

1.14 The World Bank has provided significant support to the higher education sector.
In 1998, the World Bank approved the First Higher Education Project (P004828) for
US$83.3 million. In addition to the Second Higher Education Project (the subject of this
evaluation), the World Bank approved a series of three development policy operations
(P104694, P116353, and P116354) focusing on implementing the government’s Higher
Education Reform Agenda. Currently, the Bank is financing the New Model University
Project (P110693), which aims to develop an autonomous research-based university in the
context of Vietnam’s higher education policy framework.

1.15 Other development partners have also provided support to higher education.
The Asian Development has been active in supporting higher education in Vietnam through
the New Model University (see Box 1.2), in this case in collaboration with France. It has also
provided knowledge work in higher education (Sheriden, 2010). The German government
has provided support and parallel financing to the World Bank’s New Model University.
Japan and the United States are also supporting the development of New Model Universities.
Countries provide scholarships or have university-to-university cooperation programs.

    Box 1.2. The German University
    The World Bank is financing a new university, the Vietnamese-German University. This is part of
    the government’s New Model University program based on the German model. The University
    will focus on Engineering, Science, and Technology. The German government is providing
    technical assistance including providing German instructors and researchers. The World Bank and
    the government are financing the construction of infrastructure as well as the purchase of
    equipment. The university is currently being built in Ho Chi Minh City. In addition to the German
    University, the government is planning to establish a total of four or five new universities, with the
    expected support of Japan and the United States, among others. The Asian Development Bank is
    supporting the development of a model university in Hanoi (“the French University”).

2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
The Project’s Objectives
2.1   The legal agreement between the Government and the World Bank, known as the
Development Credit Agreement, states that the Project’s objective were:

           The objective of the Project is to increase the quality of teaching and research in
           universities in Vietnam so as to improve the employability of graduates and the
           relevance of research. 4

2.2    The objectives can be divided into two groups. The first is to increase the quality of
teaching in order to improve the employability of graduates. The second is to increase
the quality of research in order to improve the relevance of research.

2.3     The project objectives make clear reference to employability and not to employment,
which follows the approach taking in the government strategies. In general, employability
refers to increased readiness to find and a hold employment (Yorke, 2004):

           a set of achievements – skills, understandings and personal attributes – that make
           graduates more likely to gain employment and be successful in their chosen
           occupations, which benefits themselves, the workforce, the community and the
           economy.

The Project Design
2.4     Following the design in the First Higher Education Project (P004828), the project had
three components. Table 2.1 outlines the activities under each component, along with the
budget at the time of appraisal.

 Virtually the same wording is used in the Project Appraisal Document, which modifies the phrase
“…so as to improve….” to read “…in ways to improve…”

2.5     Component 1, Capacity Building for Policy Development (appraised at US$4.8
million, actual allocation US2.3 million). This component aimed to develop policy and
build capacity in policy development in governance of higher education, higher education
financing, and higher education quality. The component was targeted at the central level,
through different departments within the Ministry. It supported the governance and
regulation of the sector. The component supported the introduction of accreditation with
minimum standards. This was to support consultants and studies. It also financed an
information management and policy information system.

2.6     Component 2, Capacity Building for University Teacher and Research (appraised
at US$61.4 million, actual allocation US$58.2 million). This component focused on
strengthening teaching and research in selected universities. The component received the
bulk of the project’s financing through its provision of grants of Teaching and Research
Innovation Grants (TRIGs). Group one TRIGs were designed to provide support for 17
universities that were designated as “key” by the government and that participated in the First
Higher Education Project. Group Two provided support to five universities located in
disadvantaged regions. Box 2.1 outlines the design and selection criteria for the TRIGs. The
component also supported training and capacity building to allow them to manage the
                                                 7


TRIGs. In addition to financing TRIGs, this component includes support to administer and
monitor the program including tracer surveys to track changing patterns in student jobs.

2.7     Component 3, Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (appraised at
US$4.3 million, actual allocation US$2.9 million). This component supported a semi-
autonomous Project Management Unit (PMU) created in the Ministry of Education and
Training. It was responsible for project management in the areas of planning, financial
management, procurement, and communication. The component also supported the
collection and analysis of data under a Monitoring and Evaluation Coordinator.

 Box 2.1. Design of the Teaching and Research Innovation Grants
 TRIGs play a central role in achieving the project’s objectives and account for approximately 85
 percent of the project’s financing. Only pre-identified universities in Group One (“key
 universities”) and Group Two (“universities in disadvantaged regions”) were eligible to apply. The
 average grant for Group One was expected to be US$3.2 million (maximum US$5.0 million) and
 US$1.0 million (maximum US$2.0 million) for Group Two. Grants could include resources for
 consultants, training, goods and equipment (excluding vehicles), and refurbishment of existing
 infrastructure. The IDA credit could not finance salaries.
 Grants would be given based on proposals that aim to improve the quality of teaching and learning
 through changes in curriculum, teaching methods, and research. Each proposal would include a
 budget, performance criteria, information on procurement and financial management capacity, as
 well as data on gender and ethnicity. The Assessment Panel, comprising leading academic staff
 from universities in Vietnam, international academic staff (for Group One universities), and
 representatives from the business and science communities, would review the proposals. The Panel
 would have the option to accept the proposal, request modifications, or reject the proposal. The
 Ministry’s Project Management Unit would review implementation progress through reports and
 site visits, which were to be confirmed by an independent monitoring study.

Financing
2.8   The project received financing from four different sources: the IDA grant; recipient
Group 1 Universities; the national government; and a grant from the Policy and Human
Resource Development (PHRD) trust fund. Table 2.2 outlines the financing by source.

2.9     Total spending under the project was US$63.4 million, around 90 of total spending.
Of the total IDA financing of US$59.4 million, a total of US$55.5 million was spent.
Supervision documents suggest that part of the difference is due to underspending of grants,
which also explains why the universities underspent their contribution (US$4.5 million vs. a
planned amount of US$5.5 million). The rest of the cancelled amount was due to reduced
spending on components 1 and 2, due to the changes in plans to build an information system,
the cancellation of some activities, and cost savings. This also led to the cancellation of
around 46 percent of the PHRD (US$ 2.6 million), which was designed to support capacity
building activities.

Relevance of Objectives
            The relevance of objectives is defined as the extent to which an operation’s objectives
            are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current
            Bank…strategies and corporate goals.

2.10        The Relevance of Objectives is rated high.

2.11 The project’s objectives remain very relevant to both the government’s strategy
towards higher education as well as the Bank’s country strategy.

RELEVANCE FOR THE GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY

2.12 The project’s objectives are highly relevant to the government’s current strategy
for higher education. The government’s ten year development strategy, the Sustainable
Development Strategy 2011-2020 (Government of Vietnam, 2012),5 makes specific reference

 The strategy is often called the Socio-Economic Development Strategy, 2011-2020. All quotes in
English are based on non-official government translations for reference, with editing for style.

to the importance of increasing the role of research (particularly research in science and
technology) as important tools to improve the economy’s competitiveness as well as the
relevance of education for the labor market. Specifically the strategy identifies one of its
objectives to:

       focus on educating a workforce capable of meeting the diverse requirements of
       technology and development levels of sectors of sectors and professions [and]
       produce workforce for [the development] of a knowledge economy.

The strategy also proposes several solutions to meet the goals, including a pledge to:

       …develop a high-quality workforce, closely combine human resources and science
       and technology…to restructure the economy [and] transform the growth model.

and

       …step up the comprehensive of Viet Nam’s tertiary education, expanding
       investments in establishing excellent universities and focus on [human resources] for
       the knowledge economy.

2.13 The government’s medium term strategies also proposes a strong focus on
science and technology as the engine of development. The Social-Economic Development
Plans for 2005-2010 and 2011-2015 identify science and technology as playing a significant
role in promoting development in agriculture and forestry, industry, and service sectors. The
2011-2015 Plan states:

       Science and technology development is…the key [factor] for a process of fast and
       sustainable development.

Both development plans emphasize the importance of improving the coverage and quality of
higher education (Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2006; Government of
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2011).

2.14 The government’s objectives are in line with the expected growing demand for
education and skilled worker as the economy is transformed. This is particularly the case for
Vietnam, where the coverage of higher education has traditionally been lower than many
economies in the East Asia. Likewise, at the time of preparation, around 20 percent of firms
identified the lack of skilled labor as major or serve bottleneck and another 20 percent
identify this as a moderate constraint (World Bank, 2008).

2.15 The project supports a major portion of the government’s strategy in higher
education. Likewise, as indicated in Box 2.1, the Higher Education Reform Agenda
specifically includes as objectives improving the quality of research and the relevance of
teaching, in addition to expanding the coverage of the higher education system. The
government’s strategy emphasizes improving quality, relevance, and enrollment. The project
strategically focused on the first two elements, aiming to improve workforce skills by
focusing on the quality and relevance of teaching and research.

RELEVANCE FOR THE BANK’S COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

2.16 The project remains highly relevant to the World Bank’s current strategy for
Vietnam. The current Country Partnership Strategy, covering the period 2012-2016,
proposes a more selective program that focuses on sectors where the Bank has clear strengths
and has had a successful track-record. The Bank also intends to support programs that are
likely to be sustained by the government and will have a significant institutional impact
(World Bank, 2011).

2.17 Higher education is included in Competitiveness Pillar. The Country Partnership
Strategy places higher education in Outcome 1.3 of the Competitiveness Pillar, supporting
increased capacity for innovation and value added. In particular, the Bank’s strategy aims to
respond to “weak innovation capacity and the related low skills base of the Vietnamese labor
force (page 17).” It further states that “[a] central element of Vietnam’s innovation agenda is
strengthening labor market skills by reforming how the education and training system is
managed (page 22).” The Strategy proposes an additional project, The Third Higher
Education Project, as well as analytical work in the areas of skills for the workforce. It also
proposes projects in science and technology and in innovation, which are both directly
related to the project’s development objectives. The Country Partnership Strategy indicates
that the Bank will move away from education infrastructure investment, and towards an
approach that treats education as a system.

Relevance of Design
       The relevance of design is defined as the extent to which the project’s design (its
       planned activities or policy areas) are consistent with the stated objectives, including
       assessment of the Results Framework. The Results Framework represents the
       underlying project logic linking the inputs and outputs to the outcomes.

2.18   The relevance of design is rated substantial.

2.19 The project’s design includes the necessary elements to meet its objectives and
project’s causal chain is sound. The project’s technical design was sound and builds on
previous Bank projects in a variety of countries.

TECHNICAL DESIGN

2.20 The project’s technical design is sound, incorporating building on previous Bank
work in Vietnam and incorporating elements from other higher education projects. The
approach used for HEP2 built on the World Bank’s experience in the higher education sector.
The use of competitive grants for universities to promote improving teacher and researching
was a common element in many higher education operations, including the previous
investment loan in Vietnam as well as in countries as diverse as Afghanistan, Chile, and
Uganda among others.6 As is often the case for higher education projects, participation in the
6
  These projects are examples of a model that the World Bank often finances for higher education
including: (1) Afghanistan Strengthening Higher Education (P089040), May 2005 to June 2013; (2)
                                               11


project was pre-determined during appraisal. This was one of the lessons from the previous
project, where resources were too widely disbursed.

2.21 Grants were seen as essential to promoting high quality research. This approach
can be seen as “semi-competitive.” While the universities were pre-selected, they had to
compete with each other for the amount of the grant. This contributes to the university
autonomy, which is often seen as playing an important role in promoting research. While
each university would set its own priorities, the project included both technical and fiduciary
safeguards. The proposals were reviewed both internally (by the PMU and the Bank) as well
as an external panel of international experts.

2.22 The project included elements to improve the overall effectiveness of
universities. The project supported the reform by strengthening accreditation and quality
assurance. These are important in supporting autonomy for project universities. The
accreditation and quality assurance system provide important feedback to universities
administrators. It also supports the reform effort itself by providing assurance to central
authorities that the university is “ready” to be autonomous. This is likely to have a positive
impact on both the quality of research and teaching.

2.23 The project also financed efforts to improve teaching. The TRIG grants were also
aimed at improving teaching and universities could use them to finance further training and
education for their faculty members. This was aimed to provide faculty members with a
combination of improved technical knowledge and pedagogical skills. In addition, the
research component of the TRIGs was expected to give students more hand-on experience.

2.24 The targeted support to strengthen research programs and university staff will
lead to better prepared students. TRIGs provided targeted support to certain programs with
the intention that both faculty and students in these programs would benefit. The selection
committee helped ensure that the chosen programs were relevant to the country and
consistent with the university’s “comparative advantage.” The project had no illusions about
improving employability for all students; it only targeted those students in participating
programs. It included both a baseline and follow-up tracking survey to identify the progress
of graduates.

2.25 The project also identified five disadvantaged universities to ensure equity in the
project. The project included five universities in disadvantaged regions to participate in the
project. These universities would not have ordinarily been included in the project. These
universities were not expected to compete with the other universities. This has a positive
equity impact, which could have a positive impact on the region’s development. However,
the project did not have a formal equity objective and targeting disadvantaged universities
reduces resources for that could have been used in key universities.

RESULTS CHAIN

2.26 The Bank’s result framework was relatively weak for measuring intermediate
outcomes, which play an important role in understanding the project’s contribution and areas
where course correction is needed. However, the Bank’s results framework was substantially
buttressed by the government’s more extensive and complementary results framework. These
indicators were included in its own project document and were monitored throughout the
project. This included indicators to measure both teaching and especially research quality. In
addition, the government had an extensive monitoring system at the university level to track
inputs and to help the project to understand progress.

CHOICE OF INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCING

2.27 The Project’s choice of an investment loan was appropriate. The project requires
concrete investment in equipment and training to be effective. In Vietnam, investment loans
represent additional resources for the budget. Given the complicated budgetary system, an
investment loan is the most effective way to ensure that resources arrive to the university.
While the project supported the reform process, this was a secondary objective. The Bank
provided parallel support for the higher education reform process through a separate
development program operation. This division of labor was appropriate and allowed the
Bank to have the “best of both worlds” in its support for higher education.

2.28 Financing was generally adequate. The project predetermined which universities
were going to participate and the average amount per university was around US$2.7 million.
Based on the experience from HEP 1, this seemed like a reasonable amount and in line with
the university’s capacity to handle the resources and the associated fiduciary responsibilities.


3. Implementation
3.1     Overall, the project had a relatively smooth implementation. The project closed
on time and disbursed over 90 percent of the committed amount. Many of the activities were
cheaper than originally projected and the project moved around resources among different
activities that were effective.

From Initiation to the Mid-Term Review
3.2     The project had a long preparation period and the approval date was delayed
several times. The project was approved on June 20, 2007, 45 months after preparation
formally began. The project was declared effectiveness on March 26, 2008, which
represented a delay of nearly five month from the original date of November 1, 2007. By that
time, the Ministry had complied with the legal covenants related to project administration.
This included establishing a project management unit and a steering committee, as well as
preparing a detailed project operational manual strengthening financial management and
procurement capacity. Several factors appear to have contributed to the delay, including a
delay in the signing of the legal agreement on November 22, 2007 and delays in establishing
                                              13


the financial management system. The project management unit was established before
November, 2007.

3.3    The delay in effectiveness did not have much impact on project implementation.
By June 30, 2008, the project had disbursed US$6.4 million against a target of US$4.6
million. Significant work was carried out before the project became effective, which
contributed to the rapid start of the project. For example, by May 2008, 14 Universities had
signed TRIG agreements and established TRIG administrative units, four had signed
agreements, and the remaining universities were expected to sign agreements by June.
Likewise, the government was beginning the procurement process at the central level to
support component 1, such as preparing short lists of potential suppliers.

3.4    At the same time that HEP2 was initiating, preparation began for a Development
Policy Operation (DPO) for higher education, known as the Higher Education Development
Policy Program (HEDP). In large part, the DPO was developed in response to the
government’s and Bank’s desire to strengthen support for the reform process (See Box 3.1).

3.5     The mid-term review confirmed that the project remained relevant for the
Vietnam and that there was no need for significant adjustment in its design. The mid-
term review, which was originally planned for December 2009, took place in August 2010.
The mid-term’s consensus was that component 2.2 (TRIGs) was generally being
implemented well. The review rated this component as moderately satisfactory, with 13
universities rated moderately satisfactory or higher and 9 rated moderately unsatisfactory or
less. The project was making good progress on financing training, consulting services, and
equipment and that it was likely to close as planned. The mid-term review proposed adjusting
the procurement plan and following up on slower elements.

3.6     The project also saw advances in the implementation of several components. For
component 1.1 (governance), the project supported the Higher Education Master Plan as
well as many of the planned studies either finalized or in progress. For component 1.3
(quality assurance), which focused on accreditation, the project provided technical assistance
to MOET, supporting the design and implementation of new regulations. Components 1.2
(higher education financing) supported a major study on higher education financing.

 Box 3.1. The Higher Education Development Policy Program
The Higher Education Development Policy Program was designed to complement HEP2 and to
support the government’s reform agenda, HERA. The DPO series had three operations that provided
financing as the government approved reforms (“prior actions”) to forward HERA. The operations
were approved in June 2009, August 2010, and February 2013.
The final operation of the DPO had six prior actions divided into four areas:
         (1)      Approval of the Higher Education Law;
         (2)     Improving governance, with circulars on university autonomy and a decree on
         foreign financed education institutions;
         (3)      Enhancing financing and financial management, including annual financial reports
         for all higher education institutions and audits on a number of universities; and
         (4)     Improving quality, through a circular to introduce academic credits and reforming
         the grading systems as well as establishing a number of university-level quality assurance
         levels.
The previous two DPOs included prior actions supporting areas (2) to (4). A review of the prior
actions shows a clear complementary between the DPOs and the Higher Education Project II. The
project provided some support to implement the reform.

After the Mid-Term Review
3.7     There were no major changes after the mid-term review and the project closed
as planned. The project was carried out as planned and the project closed as originally
planned in June 2012. Initially the government requested additional financing to extend the
project. Eventually the government and the Bank agreed to prepare a new project to build on
the project’s gains.

3.8    Component 2, which provided TRIGs to universities, was generally implemented
smoothly. Although the procurement under this component was generally technically
complicated but by 2011, most of the procurement under this component was finalized.

3.9     The project’s design included an independent evaluation of the implementation of
TRIGs. While a firm was hired to carry out this evaluation, the firm was not able to meet the
terms of the contract and the contract was cancelled. The project then turned to a panel of
experts to carry out an evaluation. Component 2.1, which focused on strengthening the
management capacity of universities, was implemented slowly but eventually led to the
development of instrument to collect feedback and information from a variety of sources,
including graduates, employers, and students. In addition, the project supported a follow-up
tracer survey that was completed in March 2012. This was originally planned under
component 2 but it appears to have been financed under component 1.2.

3.10 The implementation of component 1 was delayed and required additional
attention. While there were few problems with component 2, the project’s technical
                                                   15


assistance was both delayed and required some changes in its implementation. The publically
disclosed sections of the Bank’s Implementation and Results Status Report (ISR) from 2010
to 2012 generally cited “limited progress” or delays in the different aspects of this
component. By the end of the project, most of the activities in this component were finished
albeit later than expected. One important exception was the development of a higher
education management and policy information system (an information system to track
development in the higher education system), which was cancelled due to the lack of
consensus within the Ministry on the design.7 The project’s Implementation Completion and
Result’s Report (ICR) provided several examples of component 1’s contributions, including
inputs for the 2012 Higher Education Law, new policy for tuition policy, and improvement in
the quality assurance system (World Bank, 2012).

3.11 The project ended on time and was largely disbursed (more than 90 percent). Several
research activities continued after the project closed, using national resources. Likewise,
many graduate students remained overseas to finalize their studies with alternative resources.

Safeguard Compliance
3.12 No safeguards were triggered during appraisal. The Operational Manual included
provisions for environment standards, if required by the TRIG proposals. The ICR did not
report on safeguard issues. As per the TRIG regulations, the project supported refurbishment
of existing facilities and financed little of no new construction.

Fiduciary Issues
3.13 Financial reporting, including data from each participating university, were
consolidated by the PMU. The universities had to receive clearance from the provincial
treasury prior to submission. During implementation, the project faced several fiduciary
issues. The project submitted all of the required financial reports, such as statements, auditor
reports, and interim financial statements. However, many of the universities’ financial reports
were filed late or of poor quality. The project audit reports were submitted in a timely
fashion. The government refunded IDA for a variety of reasons. The government refunded
the Bank to repay an advance for procured goods that were ultimately not delivered.
Likewise, the government refunded IDA for some illegible expenses such as subsidies to
student after the project closed. Several universities had to return unspent advances after the
end of project. In total, around $1.8 million were refunded. The audit reports reflected these
refunds, which were all certified by the independent auditors (“clean report”).

3.14 Although the PMU developed an internal audit system, this was not implemented
because the universities preferred to submit receipts rather than develop their own financial
management units. Internal ratings for the project’s financial management were rated
moderately satisfactory until 2011 when the rating was lowered to moderately unsatisfactory.
The rating was lowered due to problems in introducing internal audit as well as delays with
some of the financial management reports.


7
    The Ministry eventually established its own, more limited system with its own resources.
                                               16


3.15 Procurement was complicated with around 750 procurement contracts, including over
100 international contracts. For the procurement of goods, the Bank would review the first
contract in each university. After the first contract, prior review was only required on
internationally competitive bidding contracts worth more than $300,000. A similar set of
rules was introduced for consultants, with lower limits. The PMU and the Bank carried out
the traditional fiduciary review of the equipment that the university purchased with the
TRIGs. The procurement was largely carried out by participating universities, which proved
to be a challenge for some of them. The PMU provided extensive training to the participating
universities on procurement. While there were a number of delays in procurements as well as
canceled biding processes, there were no major delays or issues with procurement and most
of the procurement was carried out as planned before the end of the project (World Bank,
2012). In October 2010, the Bank reported that “some of these procurements [for major
equipment] experience delays due to potential fraud (sic) practices of bidders.” The
government carried out a number of investigations on its own that led to barring two firms.


4. Achievement of the Objectives
4.1      The evaluation divides the objectives into sub-objectives, each with one final
objective statement. As presented in Section 2, these objectives are to increase the quality of
teaching in order to improve the employability of graduates and to increase the quality
of research in order to improve the relevance of research. In university setting, these
elements are closely related. Table 4.1 presents indicators that are relevant to both objectives
or provide background information, such as support for policy reforms and quality assurance
as well as training and education for university staff.

4.2    The project provided support for the development of the Higher Education Master
Plan and education finance policy. In addition, the project supported efforts to introduce
accreditation in most of the project universities. The project also supported the training and
education of a number of university staff. This will also lead to an increase in lifetime
income in this academic staff.

4.3     While each university developed its own TRIG project based on its priorities, they all
support both research and training. Project rules restrict infrastructure investments to those
directly related to research and teaching (World Bank, 2007).

Objective 1: Increase the Quality of Teaching in Order to Improve the
Employability of Graduates
4.4     This objective is rated substantial.

4.5     The project contributed to the teaching capacity of participating universities leading
to greater relevance and improved opportunities for students. In total, the project reached
around 50,000 students that studied in the programs covered by the project; total university
enrollment was higher. Tables 4.2 and 4.3 present relevant data associated with changes in
teaching and learning as well as data from tracer studies. These indicators were not formally
followed by the World Bank in its internal reports. Because group 1 universities are among
the “best” universities in the country and group 2 universities are located in poor provinces,
the results are presented separately. Much of the data and targets are based on the
government’s results framework which the universities collected and the PMU consolidated

and monitored. It is important to point out that the target values in the table are for the
entire university system and not just the TRIG universities. Since the Group 1
universities are among the best, many of them have already exceeded the national targets.

OUTPUTS

4.6      The project supported a number of programs to improve the quality of teaching. The
two main areas of support were through training—both long term post-graduate training and
short-term course on teaching methods. The evidence presented in Tables 4.2 and 4.3 show
an increase in the teaching capacity of participating universities. Both group 1 and group 2
universities have seen an increases in the percentage of instructors with master’s degrees.
Likewise, the proportion of instructors with doctoral degrees has increased in group 1
universities. The project supported the training of 149 staff at the master’s level (111 finished
by the end of the project and returned) as well as 56 staff at the doctoral level (10 returned by
the end of the project). Despite the fact that overall enrolment has increased at the tertiary
level, the student-teacher ratio decreased in participating universities.

4.7     The project also supported both the development and revision of new curricula in
participating university, exceeding the project’s targets. Updating curricula is generally
considered important to ensure that teaching remains relevant. In addition, the project
supported the investment in 111 laboratories, 29 multi-media teaching facilities, and five
libraries with new 38,755 titles.

4.8     Both the development of an internal quality system and an independent external
accreditation system are important elements of the project and of the government’s HERA.
These quality assurance systems require the university to have minimum standards for both
teaching and research as well as having relevant curricula (World Bank, 2013). By the end of
the project, 20 out of 22 universities were evaluated in the accreditation system, which also
                                                 20


requires the establishment of an internal quality system. In essence, accreditation validates
the investments made in training and the development of new curriculum.

OUTCOMES

4.9     The government measured gains in learning. During the project period, average score
increased on standardized tests in both group 1 and group 2 universities. Likewise, the
average time of completing undergraduate studies decreased in both groups of universities.
While this definitely reflects an increase internal efficiency in participating universities, it
also likely to reflect an increase in quality of teaching—better instruction is likely to lead to
students graduating in a more timely fashion.

4.10 Although not strictly a measure of employability, the project’s tracer survey tracked
both the number of students that pursued graduate degrees overseas and the length of time
that students had to find jobs. Since the tracer survey was carried out with project financing,
it can only collect data on the six months after graduation. In Group 1 Universities, the
number of students going overseas within six months after graduation increased from 1.7
percent to 2.4 percent. During the PPAR mission, universities confirmed that a growing
number of undergraduate students pursued graduate studies both in Vietnam and overseas.
While there is no published data on where the students were hired, all universities reported
that majority of their students were hired in their field. Many students find employment in
their university’s laboratory prior to starting graduate education.

 Box 4.1. The View of Students
As part of the evaluation, the PPAR team met with around 40 undergraduate students from a variety
of fields. These discussions, which were carried both within their universities and outside, focused
on how students benefited from the projects, their views on relevance of higher education, and
challenges that they face.
The students came from a variety of backgrounds. Most came from Hanoi or its environs, although
a significant minority came from elsewhere. Very few had parents with university degrees. Tuition
was generally low, although it was a significant cost for the poorest students. For students who
came from outside of Hanoi, living costs were a concern. Dormitories are relatively cheap although
space is limited. Scholarships were generally not adequate for the poorer students.
Most students reported that they had some access to the laboratories supported by the project,
particularly students in the final years of studies. This sometimes involved their own research
projects or work done under professors. Students typically identified one or two professors involved
in research as role models and most felt that the academic staff was quite open to answering
questions and discussing issues related to their field of study.
Employment was a concern of virtually all students. All of the students wanted to remain in their
field of study and this was often seen as a challenge. While there was always potential employment
as laboratory assistants, this work was often on a voluntary basis or with low pay. All students felt
that a graduate degree was a necessity, preferably from an overseas university. Foreign language
skills and financing were major concerns. In addition, several students discussed the lack of
institutional support for job and career guidance. Nearly all students felt that their professors were
supportive in this area and were optimistic about their eventual employment.

4.11 Likewise, the percentage of students getting a job within six months increased from
68.4 to 72.4 percent. This happened in a time of economic slowdown. On the other hand,
students in Group 2 Universities saw an increase in time to get a job after graduation. The
poorer provinces were more affected by the economic slowdown and it is not surprising that
students from Group 2 Universities had a more difficult time finding jobs.

Relevance of Research
4.12     The achievement of this objective is rated high.

OUTPUTS

4.13 The project provided significant support to research activities through the
TRIGs. The grant provided financing for both equipment and training. However the TRIG
program is also an output. Establishing a grant program for teaching and research is a major
advance for the higher education system as it moves away from a system that is almost
entirely financed by the government budget. Although the universities were pre-selected,
                                                  22


they had to compete with each other for financing. This is an important for establishing
university autonomy and is considered good practice in higher education (Salmi, 2009).

4.14 Staff and students interviewed by this evaluation indicated that the grants were
targeted to well-defined research areas. Interviews for this evaluation and for the ICR also
showed that the research projects were focused in relevant areas, often addressing local and
national needs. In the case of the better established research universities, TRIGs were
focused on one or two targeted programs (for example, geology or materials science). In
other universities, resources supported a larger number of laboratories with basic equipment.

4.15 The project supported a total of 249 research projects, of 171 were finished by the end
of the projects and another 78 were ongoing when the project closed. University faculty were
surveyed to rate the quality and impact of the project’s support on research. These results are
summarized in table 4.5. The total amount of TRIG amount was around US$50 million.
Academic users generally give the program a rating of 3.5 (out of five); in the context of
Vietnamese grading system, these are reasonable ratings.

OUTCOMES

4.16 The project had a major impact on improving the quality and relevance of research in
higher education in Vietnam. The project provided significant support to development and
dissemination of research. According to project data, TRIGs directly supported 1,162
national and 645 international peer-reviewed articles, well exceeding the established target.8
This led to two patents directly supported by TRIG. During the same period, there was a
significant increase in the total number of national and international articles, approximately
doubling the annual production. While this cannot be wholly attributed to TRIG, the
equipment, supplies, and research supported by the project definitely played a major role.

4.17 The project did not try to pick “winners” ex ante by restricting research to certain
topics. The TRIG review panel carefully considered the relevance of each proposal as well as
the “comparative advantage” of each university in its proposed areas. The fact that research
generated a large number of articles published in peer reviewed international journals

8
 The ICR reports 2,037 national publications and 876 international publications. This includes both
peer-reviewed and non-reviewed articles.
                                              23


suggests that it was relevant for the research community (93 percent were in the field of
natural sciences). Both the ICR and the PPAR’s interviews showed that TRIG supported
several partnership agreements with both private (for example, agriculture and mining) and
public sector organizations. This indicates a willingness to pay for research supported by
TRIG. Science and technology has contributed to a growing share of revenues in
participating universities, growing from 5.2 percent to 11.8 percent. Interviews with
universities suggest that these were largely in programs supported by TRIG.

4.18 The project’s direct contribution to science and technology in participating
universities significantly exceeded expectations. The project made a significant contribution
to the overall university environment beyond its support for specific research programs.


5. Efficiency
5.1    The project’s efficiency is rated as substantial.

5.2     Measuring the project’s efficiency includes the external efficiency, which focuses on
the project’s contribution to the economy. Although this is difficult to measure, it appears
that the project had a positive economic impact. Internal efficiency measures how well the
project managed its own resources. The project was careful with its resources and spent them
in a timely fashion.

External efficiency
5.3     It is challenging to calculate the external efficiency for the project. A project
focusing on teaching and research is likely to have both public benefits (largely accruing to
the economy) and private benefits (largely accruing to individuals). This evaluation will
consider both aspects to determine the project’s efficiency. The PAD has a good explanation
of the various individual and economy-wide economic benefits that might be attributed to the
project (World Bank, 2012). Table 5.1 provides a summary of the results from the PAD.

5.4     The project’s first objective largely focuses on improving options for graduates and
ultimately raising their lifetime earnings. In principle, this can be measured by a number of
different techniques that capture the private rates of return to education, as developed by
Mincer and other researchers (Mincer, 1981).9 The rate of return for students is calculated
for graduates over a thirty year horizon; given the age at graduation, probably a forty year
horizon would have been more realistic.

5.5     The PAD estimated that graduates from Group 1 Universities would be able to earn
12.5 percent more as a result of the project, while students from Group 2 Universities would
earn about 4.2 percent more. The project was implemented as designed and had the expected
coverage for the expected costs. The assumptions about the impact of the project is also
reasonable. More recent evidence suggests that the wages for university educated population
is increasing faster than was expected, leading to greater wage differential for students
benefiting from the program (World Bank, 2012; Giesecke, Tran, Meagher, & Pang, 2011).
This suggests that the rate of return for students is higher than was expected. Likewise the
estimates do not include the reduced time needed to find employment, which will also
increase the rate of return for students.

5.6   However the project’s greatest benefit for employment is likely to accrue to students
who pursue a graduate degree as a result of the project or who go to a better graduate

9
  In addition, creating high quality employment creates important social rates of returns that are
typically not captured in analyses in the external efficiency of education (World Development Report,
2014).
                                               25


program. This was not explicitly taken into account in the economic analysis. The project
only collected data on students who went overseas for graduate studies within six months, a
small percentage of the total number of students that eventually do graduate studies. Thus the
PAD’s estimate of the rate of return for students understates the project’s benefits.

5.7     Likewise, the PAD estimated the returns to investment in research. Although research
often creates private gains, such as the patenting of discoveries, this is typically smaller than
the value of the public gains from research. There is no standard methodology for calculating
these benefits for the economy and the PAD makes a number of assumptions based on
international literature. These assumptions are conservative (for example, the benefits for
research only last for five years) and probably understate the project’s impact. It appears that
the research supported by the project was more effective than expected. Thus the
assumptions on the rates of returns for RandD provide a good basis for the rate of return.

5.8      Based on this, the evaluation estimates that the project’s economic rate of return is at
the 34 percent that was estimated at the time of PAD. This builds on the estimate in the PAD,
taking into account that the project has met or exceed its targets and therefore the
assumptions. The high number of international articles attests to the quality of research.
Thus the time horizon for the returns to RandD is likely to extend beyond five years that was
initially assumed. Spending on research was similar to what was originally assumed and the
original estimates of the rate of return for investment of RandD remains reasonable. It also
builds on the new information about the structure of the labor for university graduates, which
show a greater impact of higher education on income than originally assumed. In short, the
project’s economic rate of return well exceeds the opportunity cost of capital.

Internal Efficiency
5.9     Most of the proposals for TRIGs were prepared in a timely fashion and the PMU was
able to disburse resources to the universities as expected. Although the procurement was
quite complicated, involving international competitive bidding for sophisticated laboratory
equipment did not affect the disbursement or the schedule of implementation. The project
audits did not show any serious issues with financial management. Internal Bank reports
suggest that the government was proactive in addressing allegations of important
procurement, going as far as “blacklisting” two firms. Nearly all of the funds were disbursed
and it closed as planned.

5.10 While it is not possible to compare the administrative cost of this project compared to
that other similar projects, comments from interviews as well as comments in internal Bank
reviews suggest that the PMU was quite efficient and provided good value for money.

 Project Outcome                    Satisfactory

6.2     The project’s high relevance of objectives, reflecting its role in the World Bank’s
strategy as well as its alignment with the government’s development and higher education
strategies. The relevance design is related substantial, as it addressed most elements of the
PDO. The project had a substantial impact on the quality of teaching to improve the
employability of graduates. The project had a high impact on promoting research in Vietnam
that exceed expectations. The project was carried out with a substantial level of efficiency,
leading to a reasonable rate of return.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.3    The risk to development outcomes is rated modest.

6.4    The project was developed with strong support from the government, as a
follow-on project and well aligned with the government’s strategy, HERA. The project
was also supported by a programmatic development policy operation (see Box 1.2) that
focused on supporting the policy environment following the elements laid out in HERA.

6.5     The government has continued its commitment to the project’s objectives. HERA
is a 15 year program and remains in effect until 2020. This is reinforced by the approval of
the Higher Education Law in June 2012.10 The Law confirms the principal aspects of the
project’s objectives including those related to teaching and students (Article 5) as well as
those related to research (Articles 39 and 40). In particular, the Law reaffirms the role of
quality assurance in higher education (Articles 49 to 53) as well as promoting university
autonomy (Articles 28, 29, 32, and 65). While the law has been criticized for “not going far
enough,” it does reaffirm two central elements behind the project’s causal chain (Pham,
2012; Viet Nam News, 2014).

6.6   Increasing financial autonomy also provides universities with resources to
maintain their investments. Interviews with universities show that additional resources are

10
  The Law on Higher Education (Law Number 08/2012/QH13), approved by the National Assembly
on June 18, 2012 and effective on January 1, 2013.
                                                   27


needed for current expenditures. While all of the visited universities confirmed that they had
the necessary funds, they indicated that their budgets were tight. Growing revenues from
tuition as well as more flexibility in the university budget should help alleviate this pressure.
Likewise, the project supported efforts to increase university’s capacity to raise money from
research projects and joint ventures.

6.7     There are sufficient resources to continue financing the activities supported by
the project. HERA includes ambitious targets for investment in higher education. In addition
to financial support from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, the government
has been increasing its financing of education.11 The economy continues to grow strongly
(World Bank, 2013), which both contributes to the government’s capacity to finance higher
education as well as maintaining the demand for higher education (Huy, 2012). Table 6.2
shows the growing spending on education, which has continued after the project closed.

6.8    It is likely that the government will continue with grant funding for higher
education. Interviews with government officials indicate that the Ministry intends to
maintain some form of the TRIG program. Currently the government and the Bank are
discussing a follow-on project that is likely to include TRIG or its successor among its
components. In addition, the Ministry has allocated the revenues from the Development
Policy Operation (US$150 million). Although the final disposition of these funds has not
been determined, interviews suggest that these resources are likely to complement TRIGs.

Bank Performance
6.9       Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

6.10 Quality at entry benefited from lessons learned from previous project (Higher
Education Project 1) as well as the careful technical work that was done as part of the
preparation process. However, there were a number of shortcomings in the development of
the project’s results framework.

QUALITY AT ENTRY

6.11      Quality at entry is rated satisfactory.

6.12 The design period was quite long, allowing the Bank time for detailed technical
work as well as project preparation. The Bank held an identification mission and prepared
a concept note in 2003. This was followed by a number of preparation missions that
culminated in appraisal in March 2007 and approval in June 2007. The project became
effective in March 2008. During the four years of preparation, the Bank financed a wide
range of policy documents supporting all elements of the objectives as well as number of
assessments of different elements of the project. The project preparation was delayed
approximately 24 to 30 months. This was caused by delays in the First Higher Education
Project (HEP1),12 which closed two years late. The delays in HEP1 happened in the first
years of implementation, while the Ministry and the universities built their capacity to
implement the project (World Bank, 2008).

6.13 The Bank drew heavily from the lessons from the HEP1. These lessons included
efforts to improve project efficiency that complemented efforts to improve the project’s
equity. While HEP2 had a similar design as HEP1, with grants awarded to universities based
on competitive proposals, the Bank worked to make the grant process more efficient. HEP2
reduced the number of universities included in the program from 36 to 22 universities,
allowing the project to be more focused. These universities were chosen by MOET based on
their quality as well as readiness to receive grants. In addition, HEP2 reduced the number of
calls for grants from three to one, with provisions for MOET to approve some grants before
the project became effective. The Bank also agreed to raise the limits for prior approval in
procurement (World Bank, 2012). While the aim of these measures was to increase the
project’s efficiency, it was also well-aligned with the government higher education strategy
(HERA) - the greater selectivity allowed the project to focus on universities that are active in
research and are likely to be accredited. In addition, the Bank and the government agreed to
increase the project’s equity by creating the TRIG 2 program that provided grants to “equity”
universities in disadvantaged regions. This responded to concerns that universities in poorer
areas were increasing falling behind key universities. TRIG 2 represented an attempt to
address this perceived inequality in a way that was consistent with the existing design.

6.14   The design of HEP2 was informed by strong consultation and technical work.
The Bank took advantage of the long project preparation period to organize a number of

12
     Higher Education Project (P004828), approved in August, 1998 and closed in June 12007.
                                              29


technical workshops and high-level meetings. For example, in March 2006, the Bank
organized a high level retreat bringing together experts in various national organizations
along with Bank specialists. In addition to providing technical advice, these meetings helped
the design team understand what was feasible and realistic in Vietnam (Dang, 2009). The
technical work was specialized and prepared both by international and domestic consultants.
The Project Operational Manual identified 22 different technical papers, prepared in two
series: (1) developing research capacity and enhancing teaching and learning and (2) reforms
for higher education sector policy and governance (Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2007). It
is likely that these papers contributed to the development of HERA (Dang, 2009). Likewise,
the technical work contributed to the World Bank’s 2008 Higher Education and Skills for
Growth report (World Bank, 2008). The Bank also supported an independent review of the
TRIG process in 2007 (Khang, 2007).

6.15 The Bank prepared detailed economic and financial analyses during appraisal.
The PAD included a detailed economic analysis (Annex 9), which focused on the costs and
benefits of the project as well as a financial analysis (Annex 10), which focused on the
project’s financial impact and the government’s capacity to finance it. Both analyses clearly
lay out the underlying assumptions. The economic analysis was more detailed analysis than
is typically seen in World Bank project appraisals. The financial analysis focused on the
government’s capacity to support higher education and sustain the project’s investments.

6.16 The Bank was proactive in addressing fiduciary issues. During project preparation,
the Bank financial management (FM) team carried out a comprehensive review of HEP2’s
capacity, under the assumption that the PMU would change its FM staff. The Bank carried
out visits at both the central and the university levels. The FM strategy (Annex 7 of the PAD)
identified concerns about the large number of implementing agencies (22 universities) that
had limited FM capacity. Annex 7 proposed training and capacity building at a number of
levels as well as requiring the PMU to hire experienced FM staff. The Annex indicated that
the government would establish internal controls and have an internal auditor, which would
report directly to the Vice Minister. The Annex included an Action Plan that summarized FM
measures and at which level they needed to be implemented. The Bank was pro-active in
addressing the challenges in procurement. Procurement was to be carried out by each
university and was likely to be complex, involving scientific equipment. The procurement
plan (Annex 8) included reasonable procurement limits, allowing shopping procedures for
less than $30,000, as well as the requirements for prior Bank approval. The Annex outlined
procedures for procurement from state-owned enterprises and from universities, which were
likely to be relevant for the project. The Bank carried out a procurement capacity review and
also prepared an action plan for procurement.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION

6.17   The quality of supervision is rated satisfactory.

6.18 Overall, the Bank’s supervision was proactive, efficient, and supportive. The
World Bank was generally quite responsive to the project’s need and worked to prevent and
solve bottlenecks. This included a relatively fast approval (“no objection”) to project
decisions. The Bank started this supervision before the project became effective. For
                                                30


example, in late 2007, the Bank offered comments on 14 TRIG proposals less than one
month after they were submitted for review. This was important in preventing a major
bottleneck, as TRIG accounted for the largest single expenditure in the project. Likewise,
despite the complicated nature of much of the procurement, the Bank was able to process no
objectives in a relatively efficient fashion, contributing to the relatively stable disbursement.

6.19 During the implementation period, the Bank held at least one supervision mission per
year, including a review in Hanoi, with meetings with university authorities both in Hanoi
and in the field. In addition, the Bank organized visits by the financial management team to a
number of universities. It supported the PMU with technical advice and provided solution to
pressing problems. In addition there was constant contact and dialogue between the Bank and
the government and implementers. Both Bank task team leaders were based in Hanoi and
were supported by local education, operations, and fiduciary staff. The interviewed
universities indicated that the Bank was provided support during all phases of the project.
This was particularly important given the complexity of the TRIG procurement packages.

6.20 The Mid-Term Review was used as an opportunity to make course corrections. This
included adjusting the size of a number of different sub-categories as well as a reallocation of
resources among the universities, based on their performance.

Borrower Performance
6.21   The overall borrower’s performance is rated as satisfactory.

GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

6.22   The government performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

6.23 Central government ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Planning and Finance, fully supported the project. Government counterpart financing was
provided in a timely fashion, even during the global economic crisis in 2008. The
government provided the MOET with the necessary authority to implement the project. And
perhaps more importantly, the government ensured that the universities had sufficient
autonomy to implement the project. New reform efforts (such as the Higher Education Law)
were consistent with the project and incorporated many of its lessons.

6.24 The Ministry of Education and Training was well engaged with the project. It
established the PMU and ensured that it was staffed as agreed. This was a major part of the
Financial Management Action Plan. The Ministry also supported efforts to promote
university autonomy. Several units within MOET—notably the Department of Planning and
Financing and the Department of Education, Testing, and Accreditation—contributed to the
implementation of Component 1 (World Bank, 2012). Internal records suggest that the
government provided necessary refunds in a timely fashion.

6.25 There were several minor shortcomings in the government performance. The
first was the cancellation of Higher Education Management and Policy Information System
was due to the lack of coordination across a number of Ministries and universities, including
                                              31


those that did not participate in the project. There was no consensus on the system’s purpose,
which further complicated efforts to establish the system.

IMPLEMENTATION AGENCY PERFORMANCE

6.26   The implementation agency performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

6.27 The Project Management Unit provided sound management to a complex
project. According to the ICR and interviews in the field, the PMU had a strong sense of
ownership of the project and a clear understanding of how the project fit into the
government’s reform program for higher education (World Bank, 2012). All of the
interviewed universities indicated that PMU provided timely technical and fiduciary advice
that was crucial in implementing the project, in particular for the complicated procurement
processes. This involved both training as well as working with the individual universities to
improve their fiduciary capacity. The PMU also preformed its FM role as expected and
consolidated reports were submitted in a timely fashion.

6.28 The PMU was able to implement an ambitious monitoring and evaluation system that
went beyond what was indicated in the PAD. This included collecting data (both project-
level data measuring outputs and impacts as well as administrative indicators) from
universities and processing them at the central level. The PMU monitored the status of each
university and provided “grades” as well as feedback to improve performance. The PMU
used this data to reallocate resources among universities to ensure that the best performing
institutions receive more support. Decisions about grants were made based on a technical
review of grants by an Assessment Panel made up of national experts and (for Group 1
Universities) international experts as well. The TRIG assessment report included comments
for each university. According to project records, the Panel met and provided comments in a
timely fashion.

6.29 As a whole, the universities carried out their functions satisfactorily, however
there were a number of shortcomings. Some universities performed better than others;
according to the PMU’s ranking 18 out of 22 universities were rated “average” (equivalent to
a grade of A, B, or C) or greater. This rating reflects the university’s physical and financial
implementation of the project and not on the project’s impact. The remaining four
universities had shortcomings, such as mistakes in procurement and limited implementation
of their TRIG projects. Universities with a rating of C had minor shortcomings, leading to
delays but not requiring major adjustments to their investment plan. The participating
universities all prepared the necessary proposals for TRIG, largely before the project become
effective. Each university established a management unit, with qualified staff. The
universities complied with the reporting requirements, generally in a timely fashion.
However Bank reports show that a few universities were often late with their financial
reports and delivered reports of low quality.

Monitoring and Evaluation
6.30   Monitoring and evaluation is rated substantial.
                                              32


MONITORING AND EVALUATION DESIGN

6.31 The project had a strong monitoring and evaluation framework. The government
had a detailed results framework both for higher order objectives, which were outlined in the
Higher Education Reform Agenda, and project level indicators, which were included in the
Project Implementation Manual. These indicators also had baselines, when appropriate, as
well as yearly targets. In contrast, the World Bank developed a weak results framework in its
PAD. It did not have indicators for most aspects of the objectives or the intermediate
objectives. The Bank’s results framework had two objective-level indicators that focused on
the second objective (“improving the relevance of research”). The Bank did not have an
objective-level indicator for the first objective (“improving employability”).

6.32 The results framework included a realistic strategy to collect data, which was largely
based on collecting data from universities. The project included support for universities to
strengthen their data collection and analysis capacity. Data were also collected centrally, such
as tracer surveys that was planned at the end of the project.

6.33 The PAD included baseline values for the two objective-level indicators; the
intermediate outcome indicators started at zero. The Bank set yearly targets for each
indicator. The Bank’s parallel development policy operations did have more detailed
indicators focusing on policy objectives; these operations started after the HEP II was

MONITORING AND EVALUATION IMPLEMENTATION

6.34 The project was able to monitor all of the required data as expected. Universities
provided a variety of information on their inputs (training, procurement, etc.) as well as
outputs and outcomes (articles published, staff with graduate degrees, etc.) in a timely
fashion. The PMU collected the data from the universities and consolidated it in periodic
reports that were available to the World Bank. Both for the mid-term review and project
closing, the PMU produced a detailed report on the project build around the monitoring
framework. In addition to monitoring trends, the PMU also calculated aggregate scores for
each university and gave each university a letter grade (from A to D) based on performance.
This allowed the project to compare the progress of each university and to make adjustments
in the allocation of resources.

6.35 The World Bank monitored the project on a regular basis, using data provided by the
PMU; this included data that the government collected for its M&E system. The Bank’s
internal reports noted that the project’s monitoring system was strong and effective. The
universities visited by the evaluation indicated that the project provided effective support to
strengthen their monitoring and evaluating capacity.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION UTILIZATION

6.36 Data played an important role in decision making in the project. The project’s
design included a mechanism to allocate TRIGs based on performance, which the PMU used
for the second tranche of TRIG. Universities that performed well were eligible to receive
                                               33


additional resources. Likewise, some universities lost resources after the mid-term due to
poor performance.

6.37 Universities used data to strengthen their management capacity. One of the
principal goals of HERA is to create a system of autonomous universities. The universities
visited as part of this evaluation all confirmed that the project played an important role in
creating an internal monitoring system. They reported that this was useful as the university
management starts to play a larger role in decision making. Several universities reported that
they collected similar type of data for units that did not directly benefit from the TRIGs. The
PMU was able to use the monitoring system to target technical assistance to universities that
had implementation difficulties.

6.38 The World Bank used the results framework to inform its other higher
education operations in Vietnam. During the period of project implementation, the Bank
prepared two additional higher education projects. Both of these project made use of HEP
II’s monitoring framework in their design and to prepare their own results framework.


7. Lessons
7.1    The Second Higher Education Project was largely successful in meeting its
development objectives in an efficient manner. This generates a number of lessons both for
Vietnam and the World Bank.

7.2      The key ingredients for project success often come from beyond the sphere of
project itself. In no small way, the project’s close alignment with the reform contributed to
its strong performance. The project was developed within the context of an extensive higher
education reform that had a high level of sustained government and university support. It was
also implemented in the context of a larger World Bank program for higher education as well
as full support from the Bank’s Country Strategy. Although it was an investment project,
HEP II supported many aspects of the reform, which, in turn, strengthened the project. Many
of the actions supported by the project directly feed into the reform and this is reflected in the
results framework. As illustrated by the experience of the HEP II, a project can effectively
build upon the implementation experience of preceding and parallel operations to enhance
both the achievement of objectives.

7.3     A combination of Bank support instruments can contribute to a complex reform.
The Bank’s support for Vietnam’s higher education reform efforts has adopted a multi-
pronged strategy, combing investment and development policy operations with knowledge
work and a continuous policy dialogue. The investment operations, including HEP 1 and
HEP 2 and to a lesser extent the New Model (German) University, supported both analytical
inputs and investments to support the reform. In addition, they were aimed at building much
needed technical and institutional capacity at the central government and university levels. In
turn, the development policy series has provided substantial financial incentives to move
forward more with the challenging policy reforms. It is clear from a review of the
development policy activities that the support from the HEP II was crucial in carrying many
elements that HERA needed to advance.
                                              34


7.4     Monitoring and evaluation can support the implementation of investment
projects. A robust M&E system was a key feature of the HEP II design and contributed to its
success. The PMU actively tracked and monitored implementation, beyond the World Bank’s
results framework. This led to development of university level monitoring systems. This was
a complex task given the diverse nature of TRIG sub-projects, and the large number of
implementing entities. The PMU used the data to provide targeted support to the universities,
identifying those that needed additional assistance. The PMU also used these indicators to
adjust the grants that universities receive. Universities that were implementing the grant
slowly saw a reduction in their allocation in the second tranche, which focused on better
performing institutions.

7.5      While a grant program may play an important role in developing autonomy, it is
not sufficient to ensure autonomy. When well defined, grants in higher education can
contribute to strengthen the capacity of universities to act autonomously. Competitive grant
programs are common in World Bank-financed higher education projects, building on the
positive experience of higher education systems in high income countries. Strengthening
autonomy was a central tenant of the ongoing higher education reform, HERA. When the
project was initiated, universities were centralized under the direct authority of a Ministry or
local government. Interviews show that while individual researchers and research teams had
some experience in writing grant proposals, university faculties and school lacked this
experience. The introduction of TRIG gave faculties an opportunity to work together and to
start to act with some autonomy. The evaluation shows that despite this progress, developing
university autonomy is more complicated.
