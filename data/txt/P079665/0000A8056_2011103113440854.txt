                         of international consultants, the sub-component has now been split into three parts: (i) individual international consultants to advise on the development of institutional quality culture;
                         (ii) local consultants to provide training/support to quality assurance centers at universities to develop feedback collection instruments from students, staff and external stakeholders;
                         and (iii) local consultants to collect information on labour market information of graduates.

                         Component 2 - Training Research Innovation Grants - Overall TRIG implementation progress is satisfactory since the last supervision mission, except for a few complicated goods
                         procurement actions which are facing bid evaluation difficulties. Nevertheless, all TRIGs are expected to be completed on schedule, except one, i.e. the HCM University of
                         Education.

                         Overseas training of Ph. D and Masters has already exceeded the original target by 9%. The Master Program has almost achieved its original target of 92%. So far, 62 Ph. D and
                         135 Masters overseas have been funded by TRIGs. National Masters have also exceeded the original target by 50%, but local training such as short courses is still progressing
                         slowly. About 48% of local training courses and and 80% of local workshops have been achieved.

                         Overseas study tours have reached 83% of the original target. However, as stated in the last supervision aide-memoire, thousands of university faculty members have benefitted
                         from the results of these study tours. Yet many universities are still short of their original targets. PMU should encourage all universities to make good use of these activities before
                         project closing. The Project M& E Component needs to measure concrete results, such as whether the outcomes of TRIGs have indeed improved academic and managerial capacity
                         at the universities.

                         Research seems to exceed the original target, although not all TRIG funds for research are fully disbursed. This is because universities have been using their budgets and other
                         financing sources. So far, 251 research projects have been launched representing 99% of the original target of 253. 428 articles have been published in international journals and
                         934 in national journals, exceeding targets by 141% and 134%, respectively. The mission reminded PMU to ask universities to document any research activities which resulted in
                         registration of patents. Any research results which contributed to improvement in teaching should be documented in their final completion reports, including evidence for the impact.

                         Upgrading and provision of equipment for laboratories, computer networks, multi-media teaching facilities and libraries - to date, the following facilities have been set up and are being
                         utilized: 61 laboratories out of 85 planned laboratories (i.e. 72%); 3 out of 7 planned computer networks (i.e. 43%); 5 out of 12 planned multi-media teaching facilities (i.e. 42%); and 1
                         out of 5 planned libraries (i.e. 20%). Several facilities are under installation stage, e.g. 13 laboratories, 4 multi-media teaching facilities and 1 library.

                         Progress has been made on revisions and/or new teaching curricula under the TRIGs with some now taught in English. It is expected that all universities with the exception of two, i.
                         e. Hanoi National University and HCM University of Education, are expected to meet their original targets before the project closing. However, the final impact of these revised or
                         new teaching curricula will probably not be able to be measured within the project implementation period.

                         Component 3 - Project management and monitoring - The PMU and universities maintain very good data on the project activities and results. These data allowed the mission to

                         discussed with MOET and PMU the outline of the university level- TRIG completion and result report. It was agreed that a first draft of the universities# reports will be done by March
