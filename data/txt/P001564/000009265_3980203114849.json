the Government, communities, and private sector\n            to expand a sustainable and cost-effective coverage in water\n            supply and sanitation. The project components are: 1) policy\n            and legal framework for the sector, assisting in: i)\n            reformulation of the water and sanitation sector policy and\n            implementation arrangements; ii) preparation of a water law;\n            and iii) promoting enforcement of water policy and\n            regulations; 2) sector reorganization and capacity building\n            to ensure that sector organization is relevant to the policy\n            framework; and 3) community based water and sanitation\n            services (pilot), to be implemented in two parts -part A:\n            assisting the Government in preparing a community needs\n            assessment, education and support studies in order to reach\n            a better knowledge of sector; and part B: assistance in\n            water and sanitation services extension, including\n            boreholes, gravity systems and civil works to support the\n            sector capacity building efforts. The project will also\n            finance pilot water and sanitation systems in targeted rural areas."}, "docdt": "1997-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
