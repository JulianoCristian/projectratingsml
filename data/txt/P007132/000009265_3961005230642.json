electricity subsidies in a sustainable way; 2) reform the\n            legal and regulatory framework for the electricity and\n            telecommunications sectors so as to ensure a complete\n            separation of state policy and regulatory functions from\n            commercial activities; 3) establish and/or strengthen the\n            institutions in charge of the policy and regulatory\n            functions which remain with Government; and 4) modify the\n            legal status of the two state enterprises INECEL and EMETEL\n            to prepare them for commercially oriented activity through\n            concessions possibly combined with sale of assets or shares.\n            To meet these objectives, the project will provide the\n            Government with technical assistance in the form of\n            consulting services and training to prepare the necessary\n            legal, regulatory, institutional and sectoral reforms in the\n            electricity and telecommunications sectors; define reform\n            implementation; and prepare the privatization of specific\n            activities whenever feasible."}, "docdt": "1994-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
