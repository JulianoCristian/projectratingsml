"Ratings for the Public Enterprise Reform\n            Technical Assistance Loan Project for Ecuador were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; sustainability was\n            likely; institutional development impact was substantial;\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory; and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: in a changing political environment especially in\n            a situation of economic and political turmoil and absence of\n            political protection for reforms, the objective of technical\n            assistance was appropriately limited to facilitating the\n            reform of sector structures and the strengthening of the new\n            structures needed to enhance private participation. The\n            envisioned sector privatization requires a permanent\n            commitment by the Government to reform that extends beyond\n            the scope and duration of the project supporting the\n            technical assistance. Well-articulated public information\n            and communications campaigns are a key to successful sector\n            reforms. These campaigns need to be directed at decision\n            makers as well as stakeholders such as management and\n            employees of state enterprises. Continued consultations need\n            to be maintained with sector entities, groups directly\n            affected by actions to be supported by technical assistance,\n            professional groups, and other shareholders so as to gain\n            their support in the reform process."}, "docdt": "2000-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
