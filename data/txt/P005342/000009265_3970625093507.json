The project consists of the following major\n            components: (1) extending water supply facilities in\n            Kesrouan and Nabatiye sub-project areas and wastewater\n            collection and disposal systems in Kesrouan, Saida, Sour,\n            and Nabatiye sub-project areas; (2) entering into\n            countrywide operation, maintenance, and training services\n            contracts for mechanical and electrical equipment installed\n            or rehabilitated under the NERP, including consumable and\n            spare part procurement;  (3) obtaining operation and\n            maintenance equipment and office facilities for the five\n            regional water authorities and for environmental monitoring;\n            and (4) securing consultant services  and technical\n            assistance to establish and develop sector institutions\n            nationally and regionally, for environmental monitoring, for\n            project management, for construction supervision and\n            performance review auditing."}, "docdt": "1997-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
