The Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            given its constructive dialog, and meaningful implementation\n            of the reform program. Likewise, the performance by the\n            Borrower was satisfactory, for despite delayed commitments,\n            reforms did overcome competing interests. Lessons point at:\n            1) the critical role technical assistance projects play in\n            paving the way for successful subsequent operations: to the\n            extent that legal reforms, and financial diagnosis had been\n            previously implemented, which enabled the establishment of\n            relevant action plans under this operation; 2) the precise\n            definition of privatization, as specified in the Development\n            Credit Agreement, was essential, so that tranche conditions\n            would not be circumvented by transactions; and, 3) the\n            privatization dilemma, which given the weak economic\n            conditions prevailing at the time, was aggravated by the\n            potential decline of enterprise assets. However, these\n            factors, and the possible subsiding of the reform agenda,\n            fostered the pursuit of meaningful privatization targets, a\n            strategy that proved successful."}, "docdt": "2001-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
