macroeconomic stability by providing\n            foreign exchange; 2) privatize state-owned enterprises; 3)\n            promote an efficient banking system; and 4) enhance\n            budgetary provisions for health, education, and the social\n            safety net. The first of three components privatizes all\n            small-scale enterprises; converts all large enterprises into\n            joint stock companies and registers their shares with the\n            finance ministry; sells or scraps state-owned trucks;\n            privatizes state-owned cotton ginneries, strengthens the\n            legal basis and enforcement capacity to foster competition,\n            and monitors newly privatized gins; dissolves the Republican\n            Corporation of Pakhtek Tajik, sells its assets, and\n            transfers supervision of seed production and cotton grading\n            functions to the Ministry of Agriculture; and prepares and\n            privatizes an aluminum plant. The project's financial\n            sector reform improves the legal framework for banking\n            activities; upgrades the regulatory framework and\n            supervision capacity; and restructures individual banks,\n            focusing on the five largest. To bolster the social sector,\n            the government is expected to ensure timely payments of\n            salaries, pensions, and safety net payments; eliminate\n            outstanding arrears in the state budget; and review the\n            expenditure composition for 1999 in the social sectors,\n            agreeing to budget allocations and the plan to restructure\n            the social protection system."}, "docdt": "1998-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
