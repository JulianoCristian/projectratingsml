sustainability, with substantial\n            institutional development impacts, achieved through\n            satisfactory performances, both by the Bank and Borrower.\n            Regardless of success, the following lessons learned\n            address: 1) policy and design issues, suggesting a) the\n            mechanism of competitive funding for higher education can be\n            effectively designed to have two positive benefits: the\n            first benefit is accountability in the use of public funds;\n            the second benefit is seen in the flexibility of the funding\n            mechanism itself; b) while the actual cash investment\n            underlies impacts on student achievement, the nature of how\n            investment funding flows to the higher education\n            institution, underlies institutional development and serves\n            as an agent of change in organizational behavior; c) the\n            sustainability of institutional impacts of competitive\n            funding mechanisms in higher education, are closely linked\n            to financial management and procurement capacity at both the\n            central level (CPCU) and at the study program level (LPIU);\n            and, d) innovations in higher education finance at the\n            university level, are more likely to be successful where a\n            project also addresses regulatory, and legislative changes\n            necessary to foster a supportive environment at the national\n            level.; and 2) implementation and operational aspects,\n            namely indicating an early and continuous training in\n            procurement and financial management within implementation\n            units, is necessary to avoid delays and ensure\n            sustainability of innovations in higher education finance.\n            Thus, a pro-active, problem-solving approach by the Bank in\n            the early stages of procurement planning, within\n            implementing agencies may consume time and resources, but it\n            is effective in minimizing potentially large procurement\n            problems in the longer term. Due to the fact that strong\n            institutional development is a key benefit for implementing\n            competitive-funding mechanisms in higher education, the Bank\n            and future borrowers should endeavor to develop indicators\n            that better monitor qualitative aspects of organizational\n            behaviors, that can help identify the loci of institutional\n            change, and that better measure factors such as\n            institutional autonomy, transparency, accountability, and efficiency."}, "docdt": "2004-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
