objectives: 1) to improve the quality of\n            undergraduate study programs in national priority fields;\n            and 2) to promote a more cost-effective allocation of public\n            funds by directing resources to high priority fields at both\n            public and private universities.  The specific academic\n            programs to be supported will be determined through a\n            competitive process.  The recipient academic programs will\n            utilize block grant funds to implement self-design\n            development plans aimed at improving educational quality.\n            The components of the project are the following: 1)\n            improvement of educational quality through competitive\n            grants to undergraduate study programs in public and private\n            universities; 2) improvement of discipline service centers\n            through direct investment and performance-based awards; and\n            3) support to the Central Project Coordinating Unit (CPCU)."}, "docdt": "1997-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
