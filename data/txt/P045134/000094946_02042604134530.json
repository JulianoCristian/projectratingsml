Some of those negative environmental impacts\n            and measures to mitigate them are described here: During the\n            construction phase, use soil and humus after construction\n            for topsoil or use borrows with valid operating license. To\n            alleviate mud and dust, wet or cover truck load. Use\n            alternative routes to minimize noise, vehicle exhaust, and\n            road congestion. During operation, limit activities to\n            daylight working hours and operate equipment with mufflers\n            to reduce noise disturbance and lessen vibrations. Cover\n            working areas, use sealed formwork, isolate wash down areas,\n            collect and dispose of waste material at appropriate\n            locations, secure storage and ensure proper loading of fuel\n            along with maintaining equipment to prevent water and soil\n            contamination. Avoid crop and tree destruction by\n            appropriately handling machines and paying compensation for\n            damages. Prevent oil and fuel spills to reduce air, water,\n            and soil pollution. Workers will be supplied with safety\n            instructions and protective gear. To control vehicle speed,\n            install traffic and warning signs. To limit traffic volume,\n            monitor movement of cattle. To minimize danger of erosion,\n            landslides, and hazardous conditions, install nets and\n            warnings, and repair roads."}, "docdt": "2001-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
