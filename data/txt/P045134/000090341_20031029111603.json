HERZEGOVINA\n            FORESTRY PROJECT - NORWEGIAN GRANT,TF024091-WOOD SUPPLY AND FOREST\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT - ITALIAN GRANT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the Forestry Project for\n            Bosnia and Herzegovina were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that in a country, like Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina, with strong traditions in the forest sector,\n            benefits of Bank assistance lie in sector reform and\n            institutional strengthening as well as the introduction of\n            modern technologies. Nevertheless, the lesson is that\n            initial emphasis on technical investments can achieve\n            immediate impacts on the ground and can build trust as well\n            as momentum for institutional reforms. In the Bosnia and\n            Herzegovina (BiH) forest sector, the Bank was seen as a\n            trusted broker, and as a result, it helped achieve consensus\n            between varying stakeholder interests, as well as among\n            sub-sectors. The lesson is that support for a participatory\n            approach to institutional reform is more likely to be\n            successful than a purely technical approach. Project\n            implementation was initiated in a post-conflict situation,\n            yet it was successful. The lesson is that Bank support for\n            technical issues in a divided country can help bring about\n            broader based trust and collaboration between stakeholders.\n            Reform processes need enough time to mature and to convince\n            all stakeholders and that the speed of change varies from\n            country to country. Therefore, facilitators of reforms need\n            to stay involved in order to sustain processes after they\n            are initiated.  The lesson is that patience and continued\n            support are needed to bring about sustainable reform. The\n            project included a range of financing instruments including\n            grant funding for capacity building. The lesson is that\n            projects seeking to achieve institutional reform benefit\n            from a mix of credit and grant funding."}, "docdt": "2003-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
