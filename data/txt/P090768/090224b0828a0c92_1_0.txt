                         Project targets for the number of tanks rehabilitated as well as the length of canals rehabilitated. The target ayacut area (improved irrigation) has already been exceeded. Project
                         disbursements in FY15 are targeted to reach $86 million for a cumulative project total of $467 million. The remaining amount of roughly $18 million has been identified as savings
                         and has been recommended by the Bank for potential cancellation.

                         Achievement of the Project Development Objective is on track, though Tamil Nadu is currently has suffered consecutive drought years recently. Yield increases for paddy and pulse
                         crops reported in the most recent M&E Report are in line with targets set out in the PAD. Production increases for milk are running ahead of projected targets. The target for
                         increase in area under micro-irrigation of 40,000 ha. has been exceeded. Available evidence also shows that the targeted increase in area under high-value crops is being met.

                         Implementation of the set of measures agreed to in February 2013 to strengthen Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) in the Project has been incomplete. During September
                         agreement was reached on a set of measures to utilize the remaining nine months of project implementation to further address capacity building of the Water Users Associations
                         (WUAs). The agreed approach incorporates change management and broader sociological elements into the traditional PIM capacity building training. The goal of this intervention is
                         to facilitate better water management practices at the village level and needs to be given greater priority in the remaining months of Project implementation.
