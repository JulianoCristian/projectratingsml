                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is now well into its last phase of implementation (Phase IV). Civil works in all 4 phases of sub-basins originally included in the Project now stand at 97% complete.

                         Supporting work of the participating line departments with farmers in these sub-basins is moving in accordance with the agreed DPRs and will be completed by the Closing Date of
                         September 30, 2014. Two sets of additional civil works not included in the original project design have been approved and are in the process of implementation, utilizing the agreed
                         18 month extension of Closing Date and the available project savings. Delays have occurred in tendering and awarding some of these remaining contracts. The earlier agreed target
                         was to have all contracts awarded by January 1, 2014. Following the mission, the Bid Evaluation Reports for all remaining packages have been reviewed by the Bank and no

                         objections provided. The Task Team is working with the MDPU to ensure that no further delays in contract implementation are encountered.

                         Achievement of the Project Development Objective remains on track, though Tamil Nadu is currently suffering its second consecutive drought year. Yield increases for paddy and
                         pulse crops are in line with targets set out in the PAD. Production increases for milk are running ahead of projected targets. The target for increase in area under micro-irrigation of
                         40,000 ha. is on track to be met. Available evidence also shows that the targeted increase in area under high-value crops is being met. Lastly, discussions with farmers confirm
                         information provided in the interim M&E Report that they are receiving substantial increases in incomes as a result of adopting the promoted technologies and that the levels of
                         adoption and sustainability are high. Scaling up of the fisheries interventions is behind schedule and is being hindered by the drought conditions.

                         With respect to Component C, implementation of the set of measures agreed to in February 2013 to strengthen Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) in the Project has been
                         incomplete. The agreed approach incorporates change management and broader sociological elements into the traditional PIM capacity building training. During the mission and
                         afterwards, steps were taken to address delays in conducting the training and in payment to staff that have been hired. The goal of this intervention is to facilitate better water
                         management practices at the village level and needs to be given greater priority in the remaining months of Project implementation.

                         Continued delays in hiring a Consultant to conduct the independent external audit of the implementation of the environmental and social safeguards plan has resulted in a
                         downgrading of the overall safeguards rating to unsatisfactory.
