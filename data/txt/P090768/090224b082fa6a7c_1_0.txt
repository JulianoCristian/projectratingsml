Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The revised project implementation plan agreed to as part of the 9-month extension of Closing Date to June 30, 2015 has largely been adhered to.
 Virtually all the civil works under the Project were completed by March 31, 2015. Roughly Rs. 33 crore were required beyond that date to cover
 liabilities and the small amount of works that spilled over into the last three months of the Project. The work on other aspects of the Project is also
 winding up in accordance with the agreed timeframe. Utilization of outlays under Component B have reached 99.8% as of June. Remaining field work
 is winding down and remaining unspent balances will be reported as project savings. Estimated project savings stand at USD 32 million from the
 remaining loan funds.
 The Project has been successful in increasing yields for crops and meeting yield targets for most of them. The Project has also been successful in
 diversifying to high value crops away from paddy. At the same time, three consecutive years of drought have not allowed the investment in tank
 rehabilitation to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of expanding area sown. This in turn has had impact on agricultural income in the sub-basins
 included in the Project. Rainfall in 2014, though below average, was better than in the serious drought year of 2013. Supplementary information
 on impacts and results for 2014 will be essential to fill out available documentation on the Project and is currently being collected by the ICRR Team.
