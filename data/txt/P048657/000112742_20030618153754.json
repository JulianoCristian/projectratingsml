"The Second Integrated Financial\n            Management Project for Guatemala had a satisfactory outcome\n            with highly likely sustainability, substantial institutional\n            development impact, and satisfactory performances by both\n            the Bank and the Borrower. Major Factors which affected\n            implementation and outcome: a) outside factors -\n            technological change and computer security; b) factors\n            subject to government control - government commitment, staff\n            turnover at the line ministries, and staff continuity within\n            the PCU; c) factor subject to implementing agency control -\n            delays in system integration.  Lessons learned include the\n            following.  Achieving project objectives was directly\n            related to the level of government commitment.  Using\n            widely-available and appropriate technologies.  Developing\n            capacity among all participating entities to achieve results\n            throughout the entire system.
