management and control; b) improve\n            the delivery of public services through the deconcentration\n            to line agencies of the primary responsibility for\n            management of their financial resources; c) improve the\n            execution of public investment; and d) establish and/or\n            strengthen mechanisms to reduce corruption in public sector\n
