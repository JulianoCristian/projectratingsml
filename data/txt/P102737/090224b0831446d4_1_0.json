Bihar is one of the largest\n            and poorest states in India. Two million children between 6\n            and 13 years of age were out of school and the literacy rate\n            was at 48 percent. Bihar\u2019s public services and\n            infrastructure were among the worst in India. Nearly 60\n            percent of homes in the state were not connected to roads,\n            only 21 percent of households had access to piped water, and\n            electricity was not available to the vast majority of\n            households. International Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development (IBRD) supported Bihar government through Bihar\n            Development Policy Loan to boost economic growth through\n            reforms in agriculture, investment climate and basic\n            infrastructure, with an emphasis on roads. The funding from\n            IBRD helped create fiscal space for development by financing\n            the government\u2019s budgeted expenditures including retiring\n            expensive public debt. Bihar\u2019s tax revenues had increased by\n            an impressive 19 percent annually since the reform program\n            began. About 1,900 kilometers of the national highway along\n            with 3,432 kilometers of district roads network were\n            renovated by 2009. The government extended its midday meal\n            scheme to cover children in grades six through eight,\n            thereby increasing the program\u2019s reach to nearly 11 million\n            children. Bihar government, backed by World Bank funding and\n            technical support, has helped Bihar improve public finance\n            management and direct the proceeds toward getting more\n            children into schools, immunization, and fighting corruption"}, "docdt": "2010-03-05T09:32:04Z"}
