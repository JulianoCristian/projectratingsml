 Reforms boost funding for roads, education and health




Overview
India’s Bihar state is home to some of India’s poorest people, but a new reform effort by the
Bihar government, backed by World Bank funding and technical support, has helped Bihar
improve public finance management and direct the proceeds toward getting more children into
schools, immunization, and fighting corruption.

Beginning in 2007, IBRD supported Bihar’s 2-year-old reform
                                                                       UK Department for International

public financial management and governance. Its goal is to             Public Private Infrastructure
                                                                       Advisory Facility 
boost economic growth through reforms in agriculture,
investment climate and basic infrastructure, with an
emphasis on roads. It also supports improving public service

IBRD helped create fiscal space for development by
financing the government’s budgeted expenditures including
retiring expensive public debt.


Results
Bihar’s tax revenues have increased by an impressive 19 percent annually since the reform
program began in 2005/06, and the size of the budget increased by 158 percent between
2004/05 and 2008/09. Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) accelerated to 10.7 percent
between 2004/05 and 2008/09 from an annual average rate of 4.5 percent between 1999/00
and 2003/04, the pre-reform period. Public financial management reform—combined with
greater delegation of financial powers—has resulted in a trebling in development expenditures
on such areas as roads, health and education.


About 1,900 km out of a total 3,000 km of the national highway network were renovated by
December 2009, along with 3,432 km of district roads between 2006/07 and 2008/09. In health,
the number of out-patients visiting a government hospital rose, on average, to 4,380 in October
2008, from 39 per month in January 2006; the percentage of the population now fully
immunized rose to 53 percent in 2008 from 18.6 percent in 2005; the number of babies
delivered in healthcare facilities also shot up from 112,371 for FY 2006/07 to 780,000 in
2008/09 (through December 2008). Medicines are also being provided free to patients.

In education, the number of out-of-school children fell steeply by 77 percent between 2006/07
and 2008/09. In 2008, the government extended its midday meal scheme to cover children in
grades six through eight, thereby increasing the program’s reach to nearly 11 million children.


Toward the Future
While IBRD’s development policy loan closed on December 31, 2009, it is potentially the first of
four such loans between 2007 and 2011, amounting to $900 million. IBRD provided $150
million to the first DPL, and the International Development Association provided a $75 million
credit. A request for the next operation is in the pipeline, and is likely to be delivered in the
2011 fiscal year.
