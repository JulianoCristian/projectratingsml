 Synopsis

   India’s Bihar state is home to some of India’s poorest people but a new reform effort by the Bihar gov-
   ernment, backed by World Bank funding and technical support, has helped it improve public finance
   management and direct the proceeds to getting more children into schools, to immunizing its people,
   and to fighting corruption.

Results
State revenues and expenditure increased, public services
improved. The state’s tax revenues have increased by an
impressive 19 percent annually from 2005/06, and the size
of the budget increased by 158 percent between 2004/05
and 2008/09. In addition, development spending under the
state’s annual plan has more than trebled. Public financial
management reform—combined with greater delegation
of financial powers—has resulted in a big jump in develop-
ment expenditures. The reforms have enabled the govern-
