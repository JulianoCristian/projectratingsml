(GFDRR: TRACK II TA)", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "4879", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the First Bihar Development\n            Policy Loan Project (BDPL-1) for India were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: first, BDPL-1 reaffirms the\n            importance of the comprehensive, multi-sector policy\n            dialogue with the highest levels of government that a DPL\n            provides. The three pillars of the DPL on fiscal management\n            and governance, growth, and service delivery, provided\n            convening power because they mapped closely into the\n            Government's 11th Five Year plan and endorsed its core\n            ideas. The pillars also provided the basis for the more\n            coherent framework for development partnerships that Bihar\n            was able to organize, important in a state where limited\n            capacities could have been further fragmented by poor donor\n            coordination. Second, gauging the political economy of\n            reforms is vital for a DPL. A key lesson that BDPL-1 reminds\n            us of is the vital importance of gauging the domestic\n            politics within which clients must function and assessing\n            how their reform ownership might evolve. This is important\n            everywhere, but doubly so where administrative capacity is\n            low, governance has been poor and the track record thin.\n            Third, a DPL should strengthen the role of monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) in government and promote\n            evidence-based policymaking. It can do so by identifying a\n            good result framework that is measureable and consistent\n            with the capacities of the client and that can provide\n            assurance that the government's programs are sound and\n            producing desirable outcomes. Fourth, a DPL should\n            synchronize technical assistance with realistic capacity\n            building objectives especially in situations of still low\n            capacity. From the perspective of individual Bihar\n            Government departments or entities other than the Finance\n            Department, technical assistance and economic and sector\n            work were the two tangible elements associated with the DPL\n            that they could see and benefit from. Fifth, the BDPL-I\n            shows the need to maintain the long-term, special\n            relationship with Bihar that a DPL makes possible."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
