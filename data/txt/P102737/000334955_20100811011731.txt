1. Program context, development objectives, and loan design

1.0      The First Bihar Development Policy Loan/Credit (BDPL-I) provided budget support over
2008 and 2009 for the wide-ranging reform program of the Government of Bihar, India's poorest
state, and in many ways its most lagging state. A new, development-minded government took
office in Patna in November 2005. BDPL-I's objective was to support the new government's 11th
Five-year Plan, designed to promote rapid, inclusive, and sustainable development and improve
the delivery of basic public services. The Loan's prior actions and tranche-release conditions
focused on: (i) improving fiscal policy, public financial management, and governance; (ii)
accelerating economic growth through reforms in agriculture, investment climate, and basic
infrastructure, particularly roads; and (iii) improving public service delivery in education and
social protection. BDPL-I was a key element of the Bank's new focus on lagging regions in its
2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), further strengthened in its 2008 CAS.

1.1 Context at appraisal

1.1.1 To help deal with the fiscal crisis in many Indian states in the late 1990s, the Bank had
followed a strategy until 2001 of providing budget support to states that were willing to embark
on a comprehensive program of economic reforms. Prominent among such "focus" states were
India's better-off states. The Bank began to emphasize budget support for low-income states with
high concentrations of poverty starting with the 2001 CAS. Among these, Orissa, one of India's
poorest and most indebted states, received two development policy loans (DPL) in 2004 and 2006.
The 2004 CAS pushed an explicit approach of more intense dialogue and additional financial
resources for the four poorest Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh.

1.1.2 Bihar in many ways lies at the center of India's quest for rapid development. With 8.5
percent of India's population, Bihar had the lowest per capita income in 2007-08 among 18 major
Indian states, less than a third of India's average. Bihar's 2004-05 rural poverty rate of 43 percent
compared poorly with India's 28 percent, and urban poverty at 36 percent with India's 24 percent.
Income disparities within Bihar remained extreme. Patna District, containing the capital had the
highest 2006-07 per capita gross domestic district product in Bihar, nearly nine times that of
Sheohar District at the bottom.

1.1.3 Bihar is mostly rural and agricultural, with 32 percent of its GDP coming from
agriculture in 2004-05, and still very high at 26 percent by 2008-09. Some 90 percent of the rural
population earns its livelihood from agriculture and related work. With the 2000 partition of the
state into Jharkhand and Bihar, Bihar lost most of its rich mineral assets, but has good soil and
water availability. Land ownership, however, is highly fragmented, with average landholdings of
0.7 hectares compared to India's of 1.4 hectares. Nearly half of all households are landless or near
landless, and agricultural laborers are 48 percent of the labor force, nearly double the national
average of 27 percent. Bihar's 2001 literacy rate was 47 percent, in sharp contrast to 65 percent
nationally. Female literacy was even lower at 34 percent, compared to 54 percent nationally.

1.1.4 Bihar's infrastructure rates among the worst in India--road density is only 111 kilometers
against the national average of 360. Annual flooding is a regular feature. In August 2008, the
Kosi flood, the largest in living memory, inundated five districts, forced the evacuation of more
than a million people, cost 530 lives, laid waste 0.3 million hectares of agriculture land, and
destroyed nearly 90 percent of the rural road network in the five districts.




                                                 1
1.1.5 For a decade and a half prior to 2005, Bihar was best known for its poverty, crime, and
corruption, epitomizing fickle governance, poor law and order, caste-based politics, and a
political discourse that seemed to leave little room for development. A principal objective of the
Government during this time was to promote the empowerment of the `Other Backward Castes'
(OBCs) and loosen the control of the `forward' castes which ruled Bihar's feudal-agrarian society.
The Government succeeded in empowering the OBCs politically. In the process of empowering
the OBCs and other lower castes, the state de-institutionalized the power of the élite civil service.
The judiciary, as an independent organ of government, fared better and served as a check on the
populist tendencies of Bihar's politics during this period.

1.1.6 Development measured in terms of the effective delivery of public services suffered with
the whittling away of the bureaucracy's ability to function. Law and order collapsed, with Bihar
becoming notorious for its flourishing kidnapping industry; teachers and doctors failed to perform
their duties citing insecurity in the state's far-flung blocks as a reason; private industry fled the
state; and the civil service, mirroring the lack of a development focus at the top and fearful of
becoming embroiled in anti-corruption investigations, put the brakes on capital investment and
spending. Not surprisingly, the people of Bihar--civil society, private investors, government
officials, farmers, and politicians--struggled with an image problem that was also deeply
damaging to Bihar's growth prospects, despite the underlying resilience and strength of Bihar's
society. Instead, this strength showed up in the outmigration of high-quality talent among those
with access to opportunities and of manual labor among the very poor.

1.1.7 The neglect of economic development created a unique opportunity for the new coalition
government that won power in November 2005 to pursue a different approach. The fact that
conditions in the state had deteriorated to such a degree and for so long effectively meant that the
only legitimate alternative that the Government could offer was a focus on development. Public
opinion in 2005 in Bihar pointed virtually unanimously in this direction, supported by the Central
government, Bihar's many academic and non-governmental institutions, and the Bihari diaspora
in India and abroad. The new Government strongly committed itself to development.

1.1.8 The Bank had begun an engagement with Bihar through its 2005 report "Bihar: Towards
a Development Strategy," one of the first comprehensive analyses of Bihar's developmental
challenges and potential. The Report, widely used in the state during 2005 to raise consciousness
about Bihar's missed opportunities, emphasized five areas: improving the investment climate;
implementing public administration and procedural reforms; strengthening the design and
delivery of core social services; better budget management and fiscal reform; and improving law
and order. The Bank did a report on Bihar's agricultural prospects in 2006. A Rural Livelihoods
Project (US$ 63 million) followed in June 2007, the first loan to Bihar after three decades.

1.1.9 During the two years leading up to BDPL-I there were palpable signs of a turnaround, the
result of wide-ranging reform that the new Government was implementing. Three areas seemed
particularly notable. First, the law and order situation was improving with a declining incidence
of violent crime and higher conviction rates. Second, Bihar was markedly increasing the
utilization of central funds, particularly on capital expenditure, and taking steps to increase their
effectiveness under a new Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act passed in 2006.
Third, early evidence suggested that sector- and agency-specific reforms and the promotion of
elected, local government, panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) was slowly beginning to improve
service delivery.

1.1.10 This was the context for the Bank's accelerated response to Bihar's request for a DPL in
2007. In the medium term, the DPL offered the opportunity of a comprehensive policy dialogue


                                                 2
anchored in Bihar's 11th Five-year Plan. It also provided fiscal space by substituting expensive
public debt with the proposed lending of US$ 225 million (2/3 IBRD and 1/3 IDA), significant at
over 20 percent of the state's own revenues. Over the longer term, the DPL offered the Bank a
development partnership with India's poorest state. Though the Bank was the first in reengaging
with Bihar, the multi-sectoral nature of a DPL series also offered the possibility of close, long-
term coordination with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the UK Department of International
Development (DfID), and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), all committed by
end 2007 to long-term assistance to Bihar.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives and key indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The Government of Bihar articulated its core development objectives in its Vision for
Accelerated Inclusive Growth, the 2006 Approach Paper to its 11th Five-year Plan (2007-2012).
Writing the foreword, the Chief Minister said, "Development is always a complex matrix. In the
case of Bihar...simultaneous action is required on multiple fronts to pull the State from the
morass of poverty...." BDPL-I was designed to support the three pillars of the 11th Five year
Plan: (1) stepping-up public investment, and strengthening public financial management and
governance; (2) raising economic growth by promoting agriculture, investment climate reforms
and infrastructure; and (3) delivering public services efficiently and with accountability. As its
Program Development Objective (PDO), the BDPL-I noted, "...the overarching objective of the
operation is to support the implementation of critical structural reforms to attain sustainable and
inclusive development over the medium term, while improving the delivery of key public
services."

1.2.2 In line with the Chief Minister's vision, the Government's Letter of Development Policy
put forward an ambitious, comprehensive Policy Matrix, covering almost every sector and aspect
of the medium and long-term challenges Bihar faced. A strong political view that Bihar had no
time to lose (two years of the new government's five-year term had already elapsed by appraisal)
appeared to drive this. The Government saw in Bihar's first engagement with a major
development partner, and in the DPL instrument, the political and administrative opportunity to
create a far-reaching, inclusive, organizing framework for setting, implementing, and monitoring
Bihar's development agenda. It was important therefore not to leave anything out, even if not
everything could be achieved at the same time. Motivated by the need to let the Government
judge the direction and pace of priority actions in a political and administrative setting in which
so little had been done for so long, the Bank DPL team appeared to concur with this view. Bank
staff from almost every sector participated in the scoping and preparation phase in order to build
relationships and their own familiarity with the complex challenges Bihar faced.

1.2.3 Bihar's Department of Finance became the natural nodal agency for DPL implementation.
The responsibility for overseeing and monitoring BDPL-I (and its key indicators as identified by
the Program Document (see Table 1)) rested with a secretary-level committee headed by the
Chief Secretary, Bihar's highest-ranking civil servant. In parallel with BDPL-I, the Bank
developed for the first time in India a new, non-lending, three-year Bihar Capacity Building
Technical Assistance Program (BCB-TA) to be financed by a $5 million grant from DfID. This
umbrella TA program was designed to augment the new Government's capacity to implement
and monitor reforms across a range of sectors. This included the setting up of a new M&E Cell in
the Development Commissioner's Office.

      1.3   Revised PDO and key indicators, and reasons/justification

      1.3.1 There were no revisions in the PDO. One of the DPL's prior actions concerned the
      Government's policy on civi1 service transfers adopted in 2007. The policy had four elements: (i)
      annual transfers of government employees was to be limited to ten percent of each department's
      cadre strength; (ii) with minor exceptions, only those officers who had completed three years in a
      position could be transferred; (iii) with some exceptions, transfers could be made only once a year
      (instead of twice previously); and (iv) the use of political influence in transfers was banned. This
      was included as a prior action for the DPL's first tranche release.

      1.3.2 In May 2008, the Government of Bihar (GoB) repealed the ten-percent cap, leaving the
      other three elements of the transfer policy intact. The Government noted that applying the 10
      percent cap lengthened the tenure of some officials, contradicting the objective of rotating
      officers after three years in a position to ensure their neutrality and objectivity. The Government
      therefore found itself making exceptions to the cap, weakening the credibility of the overall
      policy. GoB's data also revealed that repealing the cap did not vitiate the policy's underlying
      objective of stabilizing transfers for senior officials: there were 3,714 transfers of Class A and B
      officers in June 2008, approximately 8 percent of the total cadre strength of about 46,066. In
      December 2008, Bank management agreed with the Government's proposal to substitute the ten
      percent cap with a new second-tranche release action focusing on the decision to appoint "a high-
      level review body chaired by the Chief Secretary to systematically monitor compliance with
      transfer policy guidelines for Class A and B officers with the three-year rule in the transfer
      process." The Bihar Government appointed the review body in July 2009, and the Bank and the
      Government thereafter executed an amendment to the program agreement to reflect that action.
      The amendment became effective immediately prior to the release of the second tranche in
      November 2009.



                                                                5
1.4 Original policy areas supported by the program (as approved)

1.4.1 The policy areas agreed under BDPL-I were: (i) improving fiscal policy, public financial
management, and governance; (ii) accelerating economic growth through reforms in agriculture,
investment climate, and basic infrastructure, particularly roads; and (iii) improving public service
delivery in education and in social protection, through Bihar's anti-poverty programs.

1.5 Revised policy areas (if applicable)

1.5.1 The original policy areas were not revised, but there were modest shifts of emphasis.
Relatively greater emphasis in the policy dialogue was given to the first and the third policy areas,
driven largely by client demand and the fact that private sector investment response in agriculture
and industry was slow in coming. There were other areas, such as strengthening environmental
institutions, which were not actively pursued because the initial dialogue did not lead to strong
client interest. The shifts were also a response to the need for strong donor harmonization in a
low-capacity setting that had just emerged from a long period of poor governance. Leading up to
the DPL, Bihar had prepared a Development Partnership Framework, including the Bank, ADB,
DfID, and JBIC (see Figure 1).

1.5.2 As an organizing principle, the DPL Policy Matrix reflected this Partnership Framework
and included parallel activities envisaged outside the DPL, again catering to the Government's
need to have everything in one place for political and administrative reasons. This meant, for
example, that even while power and health were included in the BDPL-I Policy Matrix, they were
not to be the focus of the Bank's work because ADB and DfID, respectively, were to pursue
parallel assistance. Similarly, though local governance and strengthening PRIs was seen as key to




                                                     6
rural service delivery and were included in the Policy Matrix, this was not a focus of the BDPL-I
because the Bank planned a parallel investment operation on local government strengthening.

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

1.6.1 Besides the change in the Program Agreement in 2009 and the addition of a new second-
tranche condition, there were no other significant changes in design, implementation
arrangements, or funding allocations. BDPL-I was extended twice from its original closing date
of December 31, 2008, first to June 30, 2009, and then to December 31, 2009. These were caused
by delays in completing two actions for second tranche release on teacher recruitment and civil
service transfers. National elections during April-May 2009 also contributed to the delays.

1.6.2 In recognition of Bihar's capacity constraints, the Bihar Capacity Building Technical
Assistance program was to run parallel to BDPL-I, starting in December 2007. In the event, the
BCB-TA was delayed until end-August 2009, four months before BDPL-I closed, because of
delays in setting up the Third World Bank­DfID Trust Fund for India under which this TA was to
be funded. Several activities proposed under the BCB-TA, in public financial management,
creation of an M&E Cell, evaluation of teacher recruitment, and support for strengthening the
business process and functional review of the Rural Development Department were nonetheless
initiated in 2008 and 2009, using funding from the Second DfID Trust Fund, DPL
implementation support funds, and administrative budgets of Bank sector units, but the pace of
implementation was constrained by the lack of adequate funding.

1.6.3 As envisaged in the BDPL-I, a second policy loan was to follow in January 2009. This
did not happen because of the delays in BDPL-I second-tranche release and the absence of a
formal request yet from Bihar and GOI. But in several instances, as explored in Sections 2 and 3
below, actions envisaged in the Policy Matrix under a BDPL-II did not wait for the second DPL,
and the momentum generated by the Government continued to propel these reforms, in some
instances going even beyond what the proposed BDPL-II had envisaged.

2. Key factors affecting implementation and outcomes

2.0    Bihar's economic growth remained strong during the BDPL-I, averaging 10.7 percent
between 2005-06 and 2008-09, higher than the national growth rate of 8.7 percent (Table 2).

Bihar's growth over a longer period of a decade has also been higher. Though growth on average
has been more stable since 2005-06, growth rates in Bihar remain volatile due to recurrent floods
and the cyclical behavior of some major horticultural items (Figure 2). While the share of
agriculture has declined by 6 percentage points since 2004-05, it remains large at 26 percent. The
                                                                             share of industry has

2.1 Program performance (supported by a table derived from the Policy Matrix)

2.1.1 All prior actions for BDPL-I were completed, by design, prior to Board approval in
December 2007. The Government maintained reform momentum along all three pillars even as it
started dealing with the large administrative capacity gaps at all levels of the state. For the one
prior action on civil service transfers that was partially reversed in May 2008, the Government
made a persuasive case that the condition was both unrealistic in implementation and contradicted
other parts of the policy to improve officer accountability. Bank management agreed to the
substitution of a new action on appointing a high-level review body on transfers, qualifying the
loan for release of the second tranche.

highest per capita growth rate over this period even as it continued to be the lowest in the level of
per capita GDP. This rapid growth represented a dramatic shift for Bihar: GSDP grew at 3.5
percent per year during 2000-04 and at 11.4 percent over 2005-09. Beyond growth, fiscal
improvement in the states was also linked to rapidly rising Central tax revenues and an increase in
the shareable pool for the lower-income states.

2.2.2 Fiscal correction prompted by the 12th Finance Commission has helped Bihar.
Under guidance of the 12th Finance Commission, states, including Bihar, passed fiscal
responsibility legislation, and accepted borrowing limits starting in 2004-05. Thereafter, deficits
and debt ratios showed considerable improvement, and states were able to spend more on social
services. The early momentum generated by fiscal consolidation in some of India's advanced
states raised the confidence of low-income states like Bihar to improve fiscal management and
public financial management. It allowed Bihar to improve, more than ever before, its use of
Central assistance.

2.2.3 Stable political leadership focused on development has brought to Bihar extraordinary
momentum and willingness to reform. Though the BDPL-I came two years into the term of the
current Government, the reform momentum that had built up by then was substantial. The Bank
found a motivated partner in the DPL's preparation, making it easier for the Bank to structure the
DPL's three pillars on the lines of Bihar's 11th Five-year Plan. The commonality of interests with
the state's political leadership, its accessibility, its willingness to empower competent officers,
and its impatience to get going and make up for lost time have occasionally meant that its reforms
have been ahead of the BDPL-I's program. In effect, the Government created a virtuous circle of
reforms in some areas that began serving Bihar well going forward. For example, panchayat
elections in 2006 made possible local teacher recruitment by panchayats and laid the foundation
for greater local accountability and empowering of panchayats; improved law and order and
better road connectivity are helping communication and agribusiness links and faster rural growth
and raising the ability of the average citizen to benefit from this growth. This is not to say that
outcomes or processes were ideal, for example in teacher recruitment, where many panchayats
were ill equipped themselves to recruit teachers on such a large scale. But this did not deter the
Government from wanting to empower local governments first and then addressing the deep
capacity constraints in local government and the poor training of some of the teachers through a
process of learning by doing.

2.2.4 The unexpected delay in starting the Bihar Capacity Building TA postponed some
potential capacity gains during the DPL. The Bank team designed the BCB-TA to be fully
integrated with BDPL-I across sectors and across donors as part of Bihar's Development
Partnership Framework (see Figure 1 above and Annex E of the BDPL-I Program Document for a
detailed exposition). This integration promised that the TA would be demand-driven and
accountable and would lead to learning-by-doing and sustainable capacity creation. The TA was
one of specific measures to mitigate implementation risk in the DPL, but unfortunately the risk of
delays in this mitigation measure itself were not anticipated. Several activities such as the setting
up of the M&E Cell, the third party monitoring and evaluation of teacher recruitment by PRIs,
and reviews of safety net administration and business processes in the Rural Development
Department did proceed with funding from alternative sources. But there was more that had to put
on hold after the initial momentum generated by the approval of BDPL-I, including an MIS
system for teachers, TA to the Road Construction Department, and an evaluation of the Mid-day
Meal Scheme.

2.2.5 The August 2008 Kosi flood of was one of the worst in the history of Bihar. Caused by
a breach in the Kosi embankment in Nepal near the Indo-Nepal border, the river changed its
course and inundated areas that had not experienced floods in many decades. The flood affected
2.3 million people in Northern Bihar.

2.2.6 In addition to having to catch up, Bihar still suffers from an image problem. Inter-state
competition for private domestic and foreign investment has risen rapidly, putting growing
pressures on lagging states such as Bihar that must compete with other richer states. Bihar's long
years of poverty, crime, and corruption have taken a toll that is not easy to repair quickly despite
the gains on the ground. Accepting the prestigious Economic Times "Business Reformer of the
Year" award in Mumbai in early 2009, the Bihar Chief Minister quipped pointedly about this
image problem to the assembled CEOs of some of India's largest corporations, "...if some
business does not come to Bihar, what is the meaning of this [Business Reformer of the Year]
Award?"

2.3 Monitoring and evaluation design, implementation, and utilization

2.3.1 The DPL explicitly recognized that a strong M&E effort would be crucial to measuring
outcomes and benchmark progress, particularly given the broad sweep of reforms that was
included in the Policy Matrix. At the same time, it also recognized the capacity constraints in
Government for data collection and analysis needed to track outcomes and inform policy. This
might have called for a narrower focus and a smaller set of indicators, but this would have run
counter to the desire to see in the DPL the political and administrative opportunity and signaling
value of creating a far-reaching, inclusive, organizing framework for setting and implementing
Bihar's development agenda.

2.3.2 The BDPL-I proposed what amounted to a four-pronged approach to assist the
Government build its M&E capacity. First, the broad-ranging Policy Matrix the Government
put forward to reflect the breadth of reforms it wanted to tackle simultaneously contained a range
of indicators, some with numerical targets, some without, and others that were qualitative in
nature. To help shift the focus away from measuring inputs, the Policy Matrix appeared to be
emphasizing the signaling value of putting down process and final outcomes, even if in the first
instance not everything could be or would be measured within the short life span of a single DPL
with the capacity constraints in government departments faced. The idea seemed to be that
relevant departments would refine these measures through learning by doing as their capacities
grew.

2.3.3 Second, the DPL emphasized the establishment of a high-level committee chaired by the
Chief Secretary to oversee program implementation and create the demand for good M&E data as
well as improve the chances that better evidence would push evidence-based policymaking in
Government. Third, the DPL envisaged the creation of a well-staffed, dedicated M&E Cell
funded by the BCB-TA and attached to the Development Commissioner's Office to work with
relevant Departments to strengthen their M&E capacity, fine tune indicators where they had not
been fully defined, and assist in the monitoring of the DPL. The Cell was set up in September
2008 and has worked with 22 Government departments to train nodal officers and start the
process of helping build departmental M&E capacities.

2.3.4 Fourth, the Government identified a number of special welfare schemes that it wanted to
monitor with technical assistance under the BCB-TA. These included the Mid-day Meal program
for school children, the impact of revised Below-Poverty-Line (BPL) lists on the targeting of
social protection schemes, the piloting of a coupon scheme for improving the efficiency of the


                                                14
Public Distribution System (PDS), a process and impact evaluation of the National Rural
Employment Guarantee scheme, and the setting up of the Teacher Management Information
System (TEMIS) and its use for teacher cadre management and tracking teacher performance.

2.3.5 The political and administrative support from the new Government for strengthening its
M&E systems is also evidenced by the creation of a new Directorate of Evaluation; the
outsourcing of concurrent evaluation studies; empanelment of a number of agencies to undertake
field evaluations; and engagement with reputed researchers from institutes such as the Abdul
Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In another
initiative, the reform support cell in the Rural Development Department developed user-friendly
reporting formats for key anti-poverty programs. An independent monitoring report of teacher
recruitment was prepared and used by GoB to evaluate the recruitment process by PRIs.

2.3.6 The plans to monitor and evaluate the Mid-day Meal Scheme is a good example of how
interest in M&E is growing. The Bihar Government's concern about the Mid-day Meal Scheme
(MDM) is a useful example of both the problems and potential for good M&E and its utilization
in a state that is coming late to many of these schemes. MDM is a centrally supported school-
feeding scheme aimed at providing cooked meals to children enrolled in primary and upper
primary schools. Bihar universalized its version of MDM only in 2005, long after most Indian
states (nationally, the MDM is the world's largest school feeding program). There is greater
openness and interest in good M&E in part because these schemes are mostly new to Bihar and
there has been less time for vested interests to develop around them. The rapid increase in the
program's scope and coverage in recent years has however posed implementation challenges at
all administrative levels with concerns about food quality, the utilization gap between students
formally on the rolls and those availing the meals, and possible leakages. The proposed activities
under the BCB-TA--a public expenditure tracking survey and quantitative service delivery
surveys, followed eventually by an impact evaluation--will support the GoB's commitment to
improve the MDM's performance using an efficient M&E system.

2.3.7 Building M&E capacity is a long-haul process and will take time. This is more so given
the significant capacity gaps in government after long years of neglect. Furthermore, the delay in
funding the BCB-TA has meant in some instances that capacity building or evaluation activities
planned to run in parallel with BDPL-I could not be scaled up as envisaged or were being
realistically launched only towards the end of BDPL-I. For example, the M&E Cell could have
been structured and staffed on a more significant scale during 2008 and 2009 with grants from the
BCB-TA, and possibly could have made greater departmental inroads into strengthening M&E
activities around the DPL. While some activities such as preparation for TEMIS were launched
with alternative funding from the Second DfID Trust Fund, others such as an M&E system for the
MDM were delayed and started only in late 2009.

2.4 Expected next phase/follow-up operation: (if any)

2.4.1 A second Bihar DPL was to have been in place during fiscal year 2008-09, which did not
happen since BDPL-I itself did not complete until December 2009. The Government of Bihar has
now submitted a proposal to the Government of India for a second Bihar Development Policy
Loan from the Bank.

2.4.2 A proposed BDPL-II would greatly benefit from the lessons learnt from BDPL-I. BDPL-I
covered a very large canvas because the GoB wished to have a comprehensive guiding
framework in the BDPL-I to bring the many elements of its development aspirations in one place



                                               15
and to provide appropriate opportunities for policy dialogue and technical assistance to the many
sectors and departments covered in BDPL-I. It is likely that a possible BDPL-II would be more
focused, assisting the Government in greater depth in a smaller number of areas, while moving
forward the agenda for sound M&E and evidence-based policymaking. The BCB-TA, which will
run until 2012, should be an important source of capacity building and technical assistance.


3. Assessment of outcomes

3.0    Bihar has achieved much and yet much remains to be done. The Bihar Chief Minister, Mr.
Nitish Kumar, has often noted that the Government's singular achievement is to have shown that
Bihar and its people can govern and govern well in a state that was suffering from poor
governance. There has been widespread recognition in India of Bihar's achievements since 20051.

3.1 Relevance of objectives, design, and implementation (to current state and country priorities,
and Bank assistance strategy)

3.1.1 The objectives of the BDPL-I have remained highly relevant to Bihar's development
priorities. This was confirmed repeatedly in preparing this ICR by the Deputy Chief Minister of
Bihar, key Government officials in Patna, and observers in Patna and New Delhi knowledgeable
about Bihar and the DPL. At a time when Bihar did not have a strong record of development
implementation or gains, BDPL-I provided a far-reaching, inclusive, organizing framework for
setting, implementing, and monitoring Bihar's development agenda. The DPL's relevance is also
a function of the well laid out priorities in the Approach Paper to Bihar's 11th Five-year Plan, and
the fact that the Government of Bihar remained committed to these priorities.

3.1.2 The choice of the DPL instrument has been the right one for Bihar. The Government's
topmost priority has been to rebuild the basic functions and institutions of the state in a way in
which common citizens can perceive palpable change. This is a long-haul process, involving
many branches of government and careful judgment about the political economy of change within
these departments. BDPL-I, based on the Government's own priorities, allowed the Government
to make these political and administrative judgments about timing, sequencing, and adaptation
that it was best placed to make. The comprehensive, high-level dialogue that the BDPL-I made
possible has proved to be the right design for assisting a Government that is committed to change
at its highest levels.

3.1.3 A successful, long-term engagement with Bihar is crucial for implementing the Bank's
2008 Country Assistance Strategy. Assisting lagging regions such as Bihar effectively is a
cornerstone of the current India CAS. Bihar's achievements are all the more credible as compared
to a state like Orissa, also crucial for the India CAS, because of the poorer conditions of
governance in Bihar, its lower social indicators, and the absence of mineral wealth that Orissa and
other lagging states such as Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh enjoy. Bihar has important lessons for
the Bank's engagement with other lagging states, and more generally, for the Bank's work with
fragile states worldwide.

  The Economic Times, one of India's leading national business dailies, awarded the Chief Minister its prestigious "ET
Business Reformer of the Year" in 2009. Others have similarly recognized Bihar's achievements, including two major
Indian news channels, NDTV and CNN-IBN, which voted him as the "Indian Politician of the Year" for 2009 and 2008,
respectively.




                                                         16
3.1.4 Bihar's achievements are crucial to poverty reduction and rapid, inclusive growth in
India. Besides growing rapidly, India's biggest challenge is to close the gap between its top
performing states and its, large, lagging ones. Bihar embodies this challenge. Bihar's ranking as
the second fastest growing state over 2004-09 is not just a major achievement for Bihar, but also
an important marker for India, showing the possibilities for convergence within the Indian Union.
As many analyses of India's prospects for meeting the MDGs have shown, India can only do so
when its poorest districts begin to show rapid progress, and Bihar has many such districts.

3.1.5 Bihar's progress provides a strong demonstration effect for politicians, citizens, and
governments of other lagging states in India. If Bihar with its legacy of poor governance can
make progress, then, with appropriate leadership, surely other large, lagging states can as well.
Bihar's progress in establishing the rule of law, strengthening fiscal management, public financial
management and procurement, empowering local governments, improving local service delivery,
turning around key infrastructure providers such as the Road Construction Department, all offer a
blueprint for other lagging states with a history of poor governance. Where Bihar is making
slower progress--for example in attracting private investment in manufacturing, dealing with
power shortages, building capacity in local government, generating a private supply response in
industry and agriculture processing and marketing, ensuring quality along with better access in
education--also suggests challenges that other lagging states must plan for in their quest for rapid
development.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

                     Pillar 1: Fiscal Policy, Public Financial Management, and Governance

    A. Strengthening Fiscal Management
3.2.1. The Bihar Government has four fiscal priorities: (i) increasing the fiscal space for
boosting development and public investment in a sustainable manner; (ii) increasing the uptake of
Centrally Sponsored Schemes; (iii) improving the composition of public expenditures; and (iv)
improving the effectiveness of public expenditures.

3.2.2   Bihar has made steady progress in fiscal consolidation. Following the MTFP envisaged
                                                                         by BDPL-I, GoB has sustained a

3.2.4 Bihar's revenue performance                            Debt to Revenue Receipts Debt to GSDP (RHS)
has improved. The Government is
overwhelmingly dependent on GOI's         Source: Staff estimates
tax devolution and grants, constituting
almost 75 percent of receipts, and these have performed well as a result of a buoyant Indian
economy. GoB has also sought to improve its own revenue performance by improving tax
administration. As a result, Bihar's tax to GSDP has increased from 4.4 percent of GSDP in
2005-06 to an estimated 5.4 percent in 2009-10. Use of IT in the Commercial Tax Department
and changes in tax policy have also helped. Bihar has adjusted VAT rates, reduced property
registration and stamp duty rates to 8 percent in urban and 6 percent in rural areas, weeded out
sales tax concessions, and aligned motor vehicle taxes with those in neighboring states. The Bihar
State Beverages Corporation took over the wholesale alcoholic beverages trade, a source of
excise revenue leakage, in 2006. Its turnover has increased from Rs 20 billion in 2006-07 to Rs
75 billion in 2008-09.

3.2.5 The Government has shifted spending to capital expenditure and O&M and increased
the utilization of Central funds. Government expenditure relative to GSDP has been steady since
2005-06 in the 27 percent range, increasing in absolute terms from Rs. 215 billion in 2005-06 to
Rs. 355 billion in 2008-09. But within this envelope, capital outlays have nearly trebled in
absolute terms since 2005-06. While capital outlay increased to 5.5 percent of GSDP, O&M
expenditure increased by over 1 percentage point of GSDP between 2005-06 and 2008-09. The
share of non-wage, non-interest components (capital outlay, O&M, transfers) in total expenditure
increased from 34 percent in 2005-06 to 54 percent in 2008-09 (Figure 5). The share of salary,
pensions, and interest expenditure had dropped by 3.5 percentage points of GSDP by 2008-09
relative to 2005-06, and is expected to drop further, improving fiscal space. "Plan expenditure"
(comprising expenditure on schemes processed through the Indian Planning Commission), often
still considered in India to be synonymous with desirable development expenditure, nearly trebled
from Rs. 49 billion in 2005-06 to Rs. 138 billion in 2008-09, and is estimated at Rs. 162 billion in
2009-10. The ratio of plan expenditure in total expenditure increased from 23 percent in 2005-06
to 41 percent in 2009-10 showing much greater utilization of available Central funding.
Expenditure on the social sectors (education, health, water supply and sanitation) increased nearly
40 percent in 2007-08 and 60 percent in 2008-09 (preliminary estimates). Agriculture, irrigation
and flood control, energy and roads now account for more than 60 percent of expenditure on
economic services.

    B. Strengthening Public Financial Management

3.2.6 Bihar is laying a good foundation for public financial management. Several key
actions under BDPL-I, the passage of the Bihar Fiscal Responsibility & Budget Management Act
2006, Bihar Panchayat Raj Act 2006, and the Bihar Municipal Act 2007, have provided a much-
needed policy framework for stronger public financial management (PFM) and governance.
These laws have been complemented by proposed new rules and new practices designed to
improve the transparency and effectiveness of public spending, also a key action under BDPL-I.
The foundation for better financial management and procurement will be largely in place when
the new state Treasury Code (revised for the first time since India's Independence in 1947) is
approved by the state Cabinet and work on the new General Financial Rules is complete.

3.2.7 New delegated spending authority is going hand-in-hand with budget simplification
and risk-based auditing. The Bihar Assembly now passes the state budget on time, allowing
spending to begin during the first quarter of the financial year. Most importantly, the existing
revised Financial Rules place greater trust in the Heads of Offices and Departments alongside
more effective safeguards. Spending authority has been significantly decentralized with higher
delegated spending thresholds, but at the same time, the Government has reduced the
proliferation of officers authorized to draw money from 50,000 to 10,000. This has been
complemented by a new risk-based internal audit manual. The Finance Department has reduced
the number of line items by half in the 2009-10 Budget. The number of expenditure object heads
(including sub-object heads) went down from over 600 to 68 and are aligned with accounting
heads, a key action under BDPL-I. This is not only simplifying the budget preparation process,
but also its execution, accounting, and financial reporting. In 2009-10, all budget lines in the plan
budget were assigned object heads as against only 67 percent in the 2007-08 plan budget. The
value of lump sum expenditure not assigned object heads has declined substantially, from Rs 161
billion in 2008-09 to Rs 66 billion in 2009-10. A separate finance and accounts cadre was created
in Bihar three years ago, following which about 150 officers have been recruited and a
compendium has been issued to Internal Financial Advisors (IFA) and the eligibility pool of IFAs
has been expanded.

3.2.8 A computerized Treasury Management & Information System is in place. A
computerized Treasury Management & Information System (CTMIS) has upgraded and


                                                           19
networked all 59 treasuries and their sub treasuries in Bihar, now providing real time utilization
information, a significant achievement that is a prior action for a proposed BDPL-II. The impact
of the CTMIS and other initiatives can be seen by the improvement in the time taken by the Bihar
Accountant General to compile monthly accounts. During most of 2009-10 all accounts had been
compiled within the month; there were only four months in which a small number of accounts
had not been compiled. In the previous two years, the extent of the compilation gap was often as
high as 50 percent of all accounts in any given month. Progress in the settlement of the stock of
Abstract Contingency Bills (AC bills) against which advances have been traditionally drawn by
implementing agencies in Bihar has however been slow (these ought to have been treated as
grants-in-aid, as in other states). This settlement of overdue AC bills is continuing. To stem the
flow of new AC bills, the practice of drawing advances against AC bills has been replaced by
treating these as grant-in-aid to special purpose societies set up for project implementation. The
CTMIS is being upgraded to monitor the flow and settlement of AC bills.

3.2.9 E-procurement is spreading gradually, beginning with the procurement intensive parts
of Government. The revised Financial Rules emphasize sound procurement principles and have
been backed up with a range of technical improvements in the bidding process. The Bank's
technical assistance under the DPL has led to the revision and modernization of the PWD Codes
for civil works, a key action under BDPL-I. The procurement rules for the public works
department have also been simplified and modernized, including adoption of standard bidding
documents. E-procurement, a prior action under a proposed BDPL-II, has been made mandatory
for large contracts in six major public entities--the Road Construction Department, Bihar Rajya
Pul Nirman Nigam, Building Construction Department, Department of Information &
Technology, Public Health Engineering Department, and Bihar State Electronics Development
Corporation.

    C. Strengthening Governance, Public Administration, and Local Government

3.2.10 The Government is making progress on several governance issues, including
corruption. The Government has sought to discourage corruption by implementing the Right to
Information (RTI) Act. It has started a call center called Jaankaari to assist callers with
processing requests for information under RTI, an important action under BDPL-I. Overall,
almost 17,700 appeals were filed with the State Information Commission between October 2006
and March 2009, of which almost 10,700 cases were resolved during this period. Jaankaari has
won national recognition in the form of the national e-governance award for 2008-09. Bihar was
ranked among the top three states in India to comply with the RTI Act according to an assessment
by the Bangalore-based Public Affairs Centre, with a 55 percent score that was just behind the
score of 56 for the national capital Delhi. The ability of the Commission to dispose of cases has
suffered, however, with the increase in appeals. In 2009, the Commission received 9,871 cases
(including a carryover from previous year), but resolved only 4,987 (a disposal rate of less than
51 percent). In November 2009, the Government amended certain provisions of the Bihar Right
to Information Rule 2006 making an RTI application costlier in some instances, restricting the
way requests can be filed, and charging BPL applicants for information running into more than 10
pages. The impact of these changes is not yet clear.

3.2.11 The Government has new powers to investigate and punish corrupt officials. The
Government has enacted The Bihar Special Courts Bill 2009, which mandates the confiscation of
property of those found to have accumulated assets greater than their known sources of income.
GoB plans to set up approximately nine new Special Courts under this law to deal exclusively
with cases involving graft in order to ensure speedy prosecution of such offences, which has
otherwise been a problem with verdicts very slow in the coming. Cases filed by the Vigilance

1996 and 2005 was 4.5 compared to 82 between 2006 and 2008. The annual average of total
cases filed between 1996 and 2005 was 28.5 compared to 116 between 2006 and 2008. A Special

                                                                              Bureau, addressing

                                                                              the civil service,
has conducted a survey involving select public services such as hospitals, registration, integrated
child development services, and land mutation to assess public satisfaction and identify processes
vulnerable to corruption.

3.2.12 The Government is strengthening public administration to make service delivery more
accountable. Hiring new staff on contract to fill vacancies, outsourcing of services, better
performance management and evaluation, decentralization, and the use of e-governance have
started raising the quality of public service delivery in health, education, and roads, three sectors
that the Government has focused on to strengthen service delivery as part of BDPL-I. In
education, new teachers on contract are subject to the supervision of the PRIs that have hired
them. In health, data centers managed by a private company have been established at the block
level to collect information on the number of patients visiting a health facility, each doctor's
patient list, and the medication prescribed. In roads, the Commissioning of a GIS-based Road
Information System should enhance Government's ability to monitor its projects more closely.

3.2.13 The civil service is being empowered gradually. The Bihar Administrative Reforms
Commission recommended significant changes in the functioning of the bureaucracy, some of
which have been accepted, in particular the delegation of financial powers. Ad hoc, unregulated
civil service transfers have been a difficult matter in many states, feeding patronage politics and
creating undue pressure on the civil service. Consistent with the BDPL-I, the Government has: (a)
limited the transfer season to once a year, rather than twice; (b) banned the use of influence to
obtain transfers, and (c) created a high-level committee chaired by the Chief Secretary to monitor
compliance with the norm of spending at least three years in a position stipulated by the state's
transfer policy for Class A and B supervisory posts in departmental cadres. These important steps
will, if effectively implemented, help inject more stability and accountability in the functioning of
the civil service in Bihar. There were 3,714 transfers of Class A and B officers in June 2008,
approximately 8 percent of the total cadre strength of about 46,066. According to the Government,
in the 2009 season there were few exceptions to these rules because of the high-level scrutiny.

3.2.14 The Government is beginning to improve departmental functioning in a systematic way.
As envisaged by BDPL-I, business process reviews are underway in important departments such
as Rural Development, Roads, Revenue, Personnel, and Registration. The Registration
Department's efforts to combine computerization of 103 registration offices with business process


                                                 21
changes won the Prime Minister's National Award for Excellence in Public Administration. The
Bihar Prashashnik Sudhar Mission, a society created with DfID support, is pursuing
administrative reforms in selected departments. The hiring of about 300 new judges, setting up of
a mobile court and additional courts for anti-corruption, and better coordination between the
executive branch and the district courts have all contributed to legal and judicial improvements
resulting in a higher level of convictions and improved law and order.

3.2.15 The Government is strengthening PRIs and their local accountability. After the passage
of the Panchayat Raj Act 2006, PRI's are responsible for identifying beneficiaries under the
National Rural Employment Guarantee program, appointing teachers, supervising the Mid-day
Meal Program in schools, monitoring the distribution of PDS coupons, and selecting workers
under the Integrated Child Development Services scheme, all actions deemed important by
BDPL-I. Capacities are low in many of these functional areas in many panchayats. The
Government is now mounting an effort to build this capacity, including through a proposed Bank
supported Local Government Strengthening Project. GOI's Backward Region Grant Fund is
providing discretionary resources to Bihar's PRIs. In 2007-08, Bihar used some 70 percent of its
allocation of Rs 6 billion. Bihar is following the Third State Finance Commission's
recommendation of devolving up to 3 percent of the GoB's net total tax revenue to PRIs. A
Fourth State Finance Commission has been constituted. The setting up of 800 rural information
kiosks, along with an Apki Sarkar Apke Dwar (`Government at Your Doorstep') program is
bolstering the presence of the Government, including in Naxal-affected conflict districts.

Bihar is far from its full agricultural potential and has one of lowest agricultural productivities in
the country. A big government priority has been to increase the seed replacement rate (the
percentage of total crop area planted with certified/quality seeds rather than farm-saved seed).
The Government has revived 245 seed production farms and begun to distribute foundation seed
to two farmers in each of Bihar's 45,000 villages at the start of every cropping season. Seed
production has increased dramatically, the seed replacement rate has risen sharply (Table 4) as
envisaged under BDPL-I, and rice and wheat productivity have increased substantially. Seed
production rose nearly seven times from under 3,000 tons per year to more than 20,500 tons
between 2005-06 and 2009-10.

3.2.17 Policy and public investments are slowly improving the investment climate in
agriculture. The repeal of the antiquated Agriculture Product Marketing Control Act has paved
the way for Bihar to open up its agro-markets to competitive private sector participation.
However, large-scale private investment in crop or horticulture markets has not yet materialized
and the Government has, for the moment, relied on boosting public investment in agriculture,
modernizing markets by providing critical agro-business infrastructure (trader's platforms,
warehouses, internal roads, weighbridges, pack houses, ripening chambers) and setting up a new
authority using a PPP model to manage these facilities. ADB is assisting these activities. The
feasibility study for a terminal market in Patna has been completed and bids have been received
for the market's management, a prior condition for a proposed BDPL-II. The Government is
restructuring farmer-owned Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) in Bihar to
provide technology, input supplies, and credit to farmers on a clustered basis, as envisaged under
the proposed BDPL-II. Elections to the PACS were completed by September 2009. To enhance
credit flows, Rs 4.15 billion is being provided to almost 5,350 PACS for their recapitalization.
The National Horticulture Mission is being implemented, as envisaged under BDPL-I. A flood
forecasting and monitoring system has been set up through a separate Bank assisted TA covering
the northern flood prone districts.

3.2.18 A single-window facility for inputs to farmers now exists, but is not yet effective. As
envisaged by BPDL-I, Agricultural Technology and Marketing Associations (ATMAs) exist now
in all Bihar districts as registered societies and have some staff. However, their outreach and
effectiveness remains limited due to low capacity, human and financial constraints, and the
absence of a clear work program. Recognizing this, the Government has decided to recruit a local
"Kisan Salahakar" (agricultural adviser) in every panchayat and a subject-matter specialist for
every two panchayats. To encourage double and multiple cropping, minor irrigation is being
strengthened by transferring operation and maintenance of 32 irrigation distributaries involving
some 110,500 hectares of agriculture land to water user associations.

    B. Creating an Enabling Investment Climate

3.2.19 The Government is making a major effort to attract private investment to Bihar. With a
new Industrial Policy announced in 2006, GoB has vigorously attempted to promote Bihar as an
investment destination, but private investment flows while growing rapidly from a small base still
remain small relative to their potential. GoB has institutionalized investment promotion efforts
through the Udyog Mitra, an investment promotion unit within the Department of Industries, and
The Bihar Foundation, a government sponsored society, all actions envisaged under BDPL-I.
GoB has also enacted the Single Window Clearance Act to simplify business entry. Among the
seven indicators measured by the Doing Business Surveys, Bihar has undertaken process reforms
for starting a business, obtaining construction permits, and registering property. Patna still
remains low on the overall ease of doing business in India (ranked 14th out of 17 cities surveyed),
but it is beginning to score high on some specific areas such as the cost to start a business, (lowest
in India relative to gross national income per capita). Time to start a business in 2009 had come
down to 37 days from 41days in 2007. As recorded by the Department of Industries, private
investment flows into Bihar for new medium and large industrial projects more than doubled
from Rs 1.58 billion in 2005-06 to Rs 3.51 billion in 2007-08, declining somewhat to Rs 3.47
billion in 2008-09 because of the global slowdown. For all smaller enterprises, private investment
flows for new projects almost trebled from Rs 0.47 billion to Rs 1.35 billion in 2007-08,
declining to Rs 1.19 billion in 2008-09.




                                                 23
3.2.20 The Government is unbundling and rationalizing regulatory processes to reduce delays.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has carried out a business process mapping and
simplification study for issuing three key licenses for land allotment, factory start-up, and single-
window approval. IFC is also providing capacity and technical support to the State Investment
Promotion Board (SIPB) for tracking and monitoring of investment proposals using an Investor
Tracking System and assistance to follow up with interested investors. GoB has identified
agriculture-based industries as a key thrust area. IFC has supported this sector-focused strategy by
providing assistance in carrying out sector competitiveness and value chain studies for sugarcane
and maize and in drawing up a plan for institutional interventions to attract investments in the
food/agro-processing sector.

    C. Roads, Power, and Public-private Partnerships in Infrastructure

3.2.21 Infrastructure planning, financing, construction, and maintenance are improving. The
Rural Works Department (RWD) has outsourced the engineering design of almost 18,000
kilometers of rural roads, of which 13,000 kilometers are ready. The Road Construction
Department (RCD), which has the overall responsibility for major district roads and State
highways, and the RWD have undertaken internal functional assessments as a precursor to their
reorganization. Both the RCD and the RWD have prepared draft institutional development action
plans as envisaged by BDPL-I. The RWD and RCD have already implemented some of the
recommendations and RWD has established 80 dedicated field divisions for the implementation
of PMGSY. The RCD has developed standard bidding documents for construction plus long-term
maintenance contracts for highways under its responsibility, while the RWD has developed a core
rural roads maintenance policy. RCD switched to e-procurement for all tenders greater than Rs
2.5 million in 2009 and RWD started requiring e-procurement for all PMGSY contracts starting
2010. Though not a focus of the BDPL-I, reforms in the power sector have proceeded with
ADB's assistance. As one indicator of the progress made, aggregate technical and commercial
(AT&C) losses have come down from 59 percent in 2005-06 to 29 percent in 2008-09 according
to the M&E Cell of the Bihar Government. A major expansion of power generation capacity is to
be completed by roughly 2015, including some in the state sector but mostly in the form of PPPs
and IPPs, vastly boosting Bihar's abysmally low total installed capacity of only 540 MW in 2006.

3.2.22 The framework for PPPs is in place, but the capacity to manage them needs to be
strengthened. GoB has (i) enacted and implemented the Bihar State Infrastructure Development
Enabling Act 2006 with the establishment of the Bihar Infrastructure Development Authority
(BIDA) and the Infrastructure Projects Fund, with an initial government contribution of Rs 100
million. Reports covering three major areas--a draft PPP Policy, PPP Process Guidebook, and an
institutional strengthening plan for BIDA and review of the existing legal framework governing
PPPs--have been prepared with World Bank-PPIAF support to complement BDPL-I . BIDA and
various line ministries are working on structuring and offering nearly 25 PPP projects with a total
estimated investment of about Rs. 14 billion in several sectors, including tourism, health & family
welfare, industries, urban development & housing, and information technology. Almost all of
these projects are yet to achieve financial closure or substantial progress in construction.
Considering that Bihar is leapfrogging in adopting the PPP approach, these efforts spanning
several sectors denote a significant achievement. By including PPPs in the Policy Matrix, the
BDPL-I has guaranteed continued high-level policy attention and made it possible to provide
complementary TA, first from PPIAF and now from the BCB-TA after it become available in
August 2009.

         PILLAR 3: IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY IN THE SOCIAL SECTORS
Education

3.2.23 School enrolment has improved dramatically, but attendance is lagging behind
substantially. The gross elementary enrolment rate in Bihar has increased from 88 percent in
2006-07 to 95 percent in 2008-09 and is likely to have risen further. Out-of-school 6 to 14-year
children declined substantially between 2005 and 2009 from 17 to 7 percent (Figure 7). The
effective pupil-teacher ratio based on teachers actually in place (rather than sanctioned posts)
declined from 63:1 in 2006-07 to 53:1 in 2008-09, but still well above the norm of 40:1. The

(OOSC=Out-of-school children)

school Mid-day Meal Scheme was expanded to Grades VI to VIII in 2008, increasing the
program's reach to 14.3 million children, covering up to 76 percent of enrolled children in
primary (it was 60 percent in 2006-07) and 83 percent in secondary by 2008-09. Overall, the
primary to upper primary transition rate in Bihar has improved from 51 percent in 2003-04 to 71
percent in 2007-08.

3.2.24 Unfortunately, progress on enrolments is not yet matched by student attendance. A state-
funded Survey of Teacher & Student Absenteeism (2008-09) found that student absenteeism
ranged from 28 percent to 41 percent. Teacher absenteeism is also high; the same study found
teacher absenteeism ranging from 17 percent to 24 percent, even as these numbers represent an
improvement in the findings of teacher absence rates in Bihar of almost 38 percent by
background work done for the 2004 World Development Report. The January 2010 11th Joint
Review Mission of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has interpreted these latest findings in the context
of their own review to mean that students can expect their teacher to be absent about one week
per month and that actual student attendance may be only around 50-60 percent of the reported
enrolment figures. Besides expanding the Mid-day Meal Scheme and reducing teacher
absenteeism, the Government is seeking to address student attendance by improving school
facilities. It is emphasizing female education by ensuring toilet facilities and providing girl
students with uniforms and bicycles (for those who have passed the 8th grade from a government
school), of which some 870,000 have been distributed. A new biometric identification system for
teachers and students is being launched.




                                                      25
3.2.25 The Government has recruited a large number of new teachers through panchayats.
Panchayats had recruited approximately 100,000 new teachers by the end of 2007.  Based on this
experience, guidelines were revised and recruitment criteria standardized for a second round of
hiring. As envisaged under BDPL-I, increased transparency was created through proper registries
to record applications, third party monitoring of the process was introduced along with post-
recruitment evaluation.  In this second round, around 70,000 candidates for PRI teacher posts were
selected after delays due to the Kosi floods in August 2008, general elections in April-May 2009,
the time taken to verify candidate certificates on such a massive scale, and a Supreme Court
injunction. The 2009 third-party evaluation of the recruitment envisaged by BDPL-I suggested
that the process was mostly transparent, guidelines were implemented, 75 percent of the
applicants interviewed were satisfied with the process, and the Education Department took swift
action to remedy problems identified by monitoring teams. But the evaluation also identified
major gaps that remained in the verification of academic certificates where extensive falsification
by applications of credentials was alleged, in the training and the educational background of
recruitment committees, and in the funding and resources (e.g. computers) available given the
large number of applicants. The Government is now verifying the credentials of the selected
teachers before their appointment. These findings will be important in the context of new
requirements for teacher recruitment as the Right to Education Act 2010 is implemented in Bihar.

3.2.26 The Government now faces the challenge of training the newly recruited teachers. In
October 2009, the State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT) tested some
101,800 teachers on the selected list with very mixed results--though only some 224 teachers
were formally failed and 59 percent passed, nearly 25 percent were disqualified because their ID
numbers were not filled in properly and almost 16 percent boycotted the test. SCERT is
developing a competency assessment tool for teachers to promote pedagogical skills. The
Government has contracted with the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) to train
the teachers using distance learning. About 32,000 teachers enrolled in IGNOU's Education
Diploma course have given their first-year examination. To help develop a framework for
professional development and improve teacher attendance, a Teacher Management Information
System (TEMIS) is being set up under the BCB-TA. To reduce teacher absenteeism, district
magistrates have been issued instructions not to use teachers for non-teaching purposes. To
facilitate partnerships with the private sector, the Bihar government will provide private
secondary schools in remote areas grants-in-aid on a per child basis, based on the number of
children attending secondary schools and their performance.

Health

3.2.27 Reforms in the health sector are beginning to show results. As noted by the BDPL-I
Program Document, though health was included as part of the Policy Matrix it was not a focus of
the DPL since health was covered by DfID under the Development Partnership Framework of
Bihar.

3.2.28 Some of the important interventions by the Bihar Government include outsourcing of
cleaning, pathological, and radiological services, speeding up the appointment on contract of
medical and other staff in the health service, recruitment and training of ASHAs (a voluntary link
worker between villages and the health facilities appointed under the GOI's National Rural
Health Mission, NRHM), and free distribution of medicines for in-patient treatment. About 79
percent of the posts of ASHAs were manned in 2009, and 83 percent of regular auxiliary nurse
midwives (ANMs). The actual release of funds to the State Health Society (SHS, which
coordinates the NRHM in Bihar) increased from Rs 1.24 billion in 2005-06 to Rs 4.56 billon in
2009-10. Utilization against receipts by SHS went up from 24 percent in 2006-07 to 53 percent in


                                                26
2008-09. Though large capacity gaps remain, these reforms and the stepping up of resource
allocation and utilization in health in Bihar are beginning to have some tangible results. In rural
Bihar, there were 10.5 million patient visits to government outpatient departments in 2006-07,
already a substantial increase from earlier years, and these have risen to 13.5 million in 2007-08
and to 16 million in 2008-09. The payment of Rs. 1,400 in rural areas and Rs. 1,000 in urban
areas to mothers availing institutional deliveries has led to a phenomenal growth in institutional
deliveries since 2006; they increased 36 percent between 2007-08 and 2008-09. The infant
mortality rate has declined from 61 in 2005 to 56 in 2009.


Social Protection

3.2.29 The Government is strengthening the monitoring and implementation of targeted anti-
poverty programs. With assistance from the Bank under BDPL-I, the Government is reforming
safety nets along two lines: first, a concerted effort to strengthen implementation, and second, an
increased focus on using M&E to improve delivery. In 2007, the Government modified the Public
Distribution System (PDS) by issuing food coupons (vouchers) to beneficiaries to give them
greater choice and ability to enforce accountability over the PDS retailer. Two evaluations of the
coupon PDS in four districts supported by the Bank under BDPL-I found significantly improved
access to PDS grain and improved perceptions of the program among eligible households that
received coupons. In an impressive commitment to strengthening M&E, the Food Supply and
Commerce Department that runs the PDS system has contracted with the Institute for Human
Development (the Bank's partner in the original evaluations) for a third round of evaluation and
analysis of longer-term impacts. The use of coupons for the PDS and other subsidies is being
considered for national adoption as reported in the GOI's Economic Survey 2009-10.

3.2.30 New below-poverty-line lists for rural areas have been finalized. The Government
published below-poverty-line (BPL) lists for rural Bihar in 2008 and, following verification, had
addressed some 6 million appeals against BPL status by late 2009. A family survey helped
complete BPL data for all household members instead of just the household head as required by
some targeted programs. However, errors of inclusion and exclusion remain, as shown by the
PDS study, and an appeals management system is needed to avoid long delays and allow for
dynamic updating of the BPL database. The Rural Development Department is currently
considering approaches to BPL database management. Block and District Informatics Centers
have been established, an action highlighted under BDPL-I, and a second round of contracting for
the Centres has recently been undertaken that will address some of the issues identified in the first
round. Several reforms proposed as prior actions for a possible BDPL-II are proceeding, aided
now by BCB-TA in the form of background studies for strengthening implementation of key
Rural Development Department programs such as the National Rural Employment Scheme
(NREGS), the Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojna, and the Indira Awas Yojna. These include
evaluations of the NREGS and a business process and functional review of the Rural Department.
To overcome the delay in BCB-TA funding, the Department initiated the review and a pilot
implementation with its own funds and with TA support from Bank staff, and this is now being
taken forward under the BCB-TA.

3.2.31 There has been good progress in implementing GoB's disability and child protection
work as envisaged under BDPL-I--the Commissioner for Disabilities has been appointed, staff
posts have also been sanctioned, a draft policy, developed with TA from the World Bank and
after consultations with stakeholders has been prepared and Cabinet approval is awaited. Juvenile
Justice Boards in all 38 districts and Child Welfare Committees (CWC) in 14 districts have been



                                                 27
constituted. Staffing in CWCs has proceeded slowly because of the difficulty of finding people
who meet the CWC criteria.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcomes Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Satisfactory

3.3.1 The objectives, design, and implementation of BDPL-I remain highly relevant to Bihar's
and India's development priorities and the Bank's 2008 CAS. The DPL's design reflected sound
analysis of the politics of reforms in Bihar. The DPL was the right instrument for Bank assistance
for the new Government and was timed well. Against the many capacity constraints and Bihar's
legacy of poor governance, the achievement of key outcomes has been satisfactory for the first
and third pillars, and, with minor shortcomings, for the second pillar. Not without its problems
and with much still to do to improve quality and build capacity, Bihar's impressive advances
since 2005 and during the BDPL-I serve as a positive example to other lagging states in India.

economic growth and the expansion of safety nets.

                                                             28
Awas Yojna (IAY) have substantially expanded safety nets available to the rural poor and are
helping address rural poverty in Bihar. For example, 11.8 million eligibility job cards under the
NREGS were issued in 2009-10 (43.2 percent to scheduled caste households), as compared to
10.3 million in 2008-09. Of the cardholding households, 21 percent sought and were given wage
employment under NREGS in 2009-10, as compared to 37 percent in 2008-09, reflecting lower
demand. In 2009-10, NREGS generated about 61.5 million person-days of employment (up to
October 2009), of which 28 percent were for women.

3.4.3 The Government is dealing with Bihar's gender gaps. With a sex ratio of 919, women in
Bihar are socially disadvantaged and the gender gap encompasses many social dimensions of
discrimination, marginalization, and oppression. The Government is focusing its efforts to deal
with gender disparity in education, child protection, and social and economic security. Though
effectiveness and efficiency vary, the outlays for these schemes have risen rapidly. As calculated
by the Government's Gender Budget, outlays for women's programs rose substantially from 2
percent of GSDP to 4 percent between 2008-09 and 2009-10.

(b) Institutional change/strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

3.4.4 The common theme underlying Bihar's reforms has been the construction of a
functioning state. Bihar's residents were among the most dissatisfied in India with the state of
their public services in 2004: perception surveys ranked it lowest among 16 states in drinking
water, transport, and overall, 14th in health, and 12th in education. It is worth noting that in several
areas Bihar has sought to learn from other states, taking advantage of other reform experiences
and adapting them rather than attempting to reinvent the wheel. This has led to best practice
examples in the implementation of the Right to Information law; outsourcing, hiring new
technical staff on contract, the move toward public-private partnerships in roads, health, and
education; and a decentralization law that has opened the door to a potentially powerful third tier
of government. The turnaround has of course not been without its challenges: capacity, especially
at lower levels of administration, remains weak, but the prospects of overcoming these challenges
have improved considerably.

3.4.5 A dramatic turnaround in the rule of law. Perhaps the most significant sign of decay of
the state in Bihar was the near complete breakdown of the rule of law. This is where the most
dramatic turnaround has occurred in the performance of the state. Reducing political interference,
raising conviction rates, curbing the burgeoning kidnapping-for-ransom industry in Bihar
(kidnappings were down from 411 in 2004 to 66 in 2008), and dealing with the problem of social
conflict in rural areas by holding local elections and improving local service delivery have been
some of the manifestations of this improvement.

(c) Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative, if any)

3.4.6 Bihar's status as a development latecomer has given it some unexpected advantages.
Bihar started from a low base, adopted systemic reforms assisted by donor support such as the
BDPL-I, and took advantage of accumulated experience elsewhere. Significant progress has been
made in critical areas--from the restoration of law and order to improved health and educational
services and progress on infrastructure. Bihar's rapid development gains, albeit from a low base,
have triggered a fundamental political shift in expectations, gaining momentum after 2005.
People have tasted the fruits of a functioning state, and going back will be difficult for any
government. This is even more remarkable because it has occurred within the coalition setting of
the present Government, putting to rest concerns that such an arrangement would imply a drag on


                                                  29
reform. The deterioration in the functioning of the state over more than a decade has also meant
that relative to other states that started on development three decades back, there has been not
much time for strong vested interests to develop around new government initiatives and
expenditures. Without such vested interests, there has also been a greater willingness to focus on
results, on M&E, and on piloting. An example is the coupon-based PDS that Bihar has adopted, a
first in the country. GoB has evaluated the scheme twice with World Bank assistance, and will
now evaluate it again on its own.

3.4.7 Government personnel and institutional capacity remains a key constraint to
development. The Government's and the Bank team's expectations of how quickly capacity could
be built simultaneously in so many areas now appear optimistic. This is not to say that Bihar has
not improved its capacity over the past five years, and it will continue to do so at an accelerating
pace. Clearly, the state, which had performed so poorly in Bihar, has now re-emerged as a
functioning entity devoted to creating economic opportunities, providing law and order, and
improving service delivery in roads, schools, and health clinics. But to catch up with India's more
advanced states and to sustain the effort, Bihar will need to do more.

3.5 Summary of findings of beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshops
(optional for Core ICR)

3.5.1 No beneficiary surveys or stakeholder workshops were required to be held for this ICR.
The ICR did have the benefit of several high-level meetings with policymakers and policy
observers in Patna and New Delhi familiar with Bihar and the BDPL-I. The key message from
these meetings was the considerable value that the BDPL-I generated for the Government of
Bihar in helping it lay down a framework for the many areas where simultaneous changes were
needed and to begin to lay a strong foundation for a functioning state. The observers also
acknowledged that the comprehensiveness of the BDPL-I allowed the Government to make
strategic choices of sequencing and timing, for example allowing it to boldly experiment with
first empowering panchayats and raising expectations of their performance in order then to make
their capacity building more demand and results driven.


4. Assessment of risk to development outcomes

Rating: Moderate

4.1     The Government's steadfast political commitment to strong development gains has
mitigated some risks. The BDPL-I identified five risks: political, implementation, fiduciary,
security and law and order, and natural disasters. Political risks were to be mitigated by
emphasizing reforms with quick wins for stakeholders. Capacity constraints were to be alleviated
through parallel technical assistance. Fiduciary risk was to be mitigated by strengthening public
financial management and procurement, particularly in the Departments of Finance, Roads, and
Rural Development.

4.2     Political risks have been low and are likely to remain low. The Bihar Government has
remained focused on palpable development gains for its citizens, particularly poor people. Bihar's
dramatic turnaround in these respects is perhaps its best insurance against a reversal of its
development gains going forward--the political payoff from going back to the politics of pre-
2005 Bihar have to be low for any future Bihar government. The coalition Government
performed well in the 2009 elections to the Lok Sabha, winning 32 out of 40 seats in Parliament
in an election rooted in its claim to have improved public services. Yet, competitive politics in


                                                30
India is anything but predictable, and five years, irreversible as they appear to be, is a short time
when seen against the many deep-seated political, social, caste, and class crosscurrents important
in Bihar. State elections due in November 2010 will determine the shape of the next government
and the level of political risks for Bihar's reform momentum.

4.3     Implementation risks remain the most significant for Bihar. The long neglect of
government and agency capacities makes the risk of slow or partial implementation, and perhaps
even more importantly the risk of implementation in form without serious substance, a factor that
will remain with Bihar for some time, certainly well beyond the short time horizon of a typical
DPL. This would surely have been the case even if the mitigation measure of providing parallel
capacity-building support through a US$5 million DfID-financed Trust Fund had come into play
on time as BDPL-I started. The BCB-TA did become available in August 2009 and most of its
components are going forward. This will help reduce implementation risks for a potential BDPL-
II and for the Government's effectiveness more broadly, as indeed will the extensive capacity
building that has been underway in many key areas with separate technical assistance from DfID,
ADB, and others. Implementation risks have also been attenuated by the high-level political
commitment to improved governance and to universal development gains that can yield political
payoffs from voters across a broad cross-section of Bihar's population.
        .
4.4     Fiduciary risks in Bihar are declining slowly, though there is a long way to go. Many
developments are contributing to this trend--the substantial and continuing improvements in
public financial management, reforms in budget architecture to improve transparency,
predictability, and control, e-procurement, operational turnarounds focused on tight M&E in
major infrastructure builders such as the Road Construction and the Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam, the
strong early record of implementing the RTI in Bihar, the desire to empower and strengthen
panchayats in local service delivery, improved law and order, and new M&E systems for
schemes such as the Mid-day Meal program and for large safety nets such as the NREGS and
PDS.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower performance
(Relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)
   Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank team did well in understanding the political economy of Bihar under its new
government and was fully responsive to the Government's priorities in its 11th Five-year Plan. It
designed a DPL that met with the ambitious reform plans of the Government and provided a
unifying multi-sectoral framework for its political and bureaucratic leadership to drive the reform
process. The team also used the DPL instrument to forge development partnerships with DfID
and other donors committed to long-term support for Bihar. This was consistent with the
philosophy of DPLs and their attention to client ownership, maintaining political support, and
prioritizing core, crosscutting reforms that could improve the overall functioning of government.

5.1.2 While responding to these client and donor partnerships satisfactorily, the Bank DPL
team went with an expansive results framework with some indictors well laid out but others left
to be fine-tuned after the DPL was in place. This is normally difficult to do, more so in the
context of a short-horizon loan such as a DPL and a legacy of poor governance. This is typically
also not the recommended approach that DPLs are expected to take in defining their results


                                                 31
framework, particularly in situations where how precisely indicators are defined and measured
may have a material bearing on the success of a reform process in which governments need a
well-defined script or external influence to meet reform targets. But for BDPL-I, the adoption of
an expansive results framework with many indicators was the tradeoff made to reflect the broad
array of things the Government wanted to pursue and to signal the shift away from inputs to
outcomes.

5.1.3 The Bank team also properly understood the importance of TA for building capacity in
Bihar and produced a tight design for the DPL that fully integrated the BCB-TA into the actions
envisaged under the DPL under all three pillars. The TA was a device to mitigate implementation
risk to the extent possible. For reasons beyond the control of the Bank, the risk mitigation device
itself was delayed unfortunately by 15 months, and while several key aspects of the TA went
ahead with alternative sources of funding, these appeared to be ad hoc and opportunistic rather
than as part of a prioritized backup plan to systematically handle such an eventuality.

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements)
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.4 The Bank team provided good implementation support for BDPL-I, particularly in the
areas where it needed to be responsive to the Government's priorities or where in the team's
judgment the highest priority actions were. The impact of this is most obvious in the first pillar on
fiscal policy and public financial management, topics that are natural for the PREM-led DPL
team and topics that are also at the center of government and impact the fiduciary and
effectiveness concerns for public expenditures in other sectors. This was also the case for the
third pillar, particularly for social protection and education, two service delivery areas where
Bank implementation support was active, continuous, and often intense. IFC joined the
implementation effort on the second pillar and funded aspects of the TA that might otherwise
have had to wait for the BCB-TA to materialize.

5.1.5 The explicit or implicit design choices made at entry on how the DPL would be
monitored put a premium on a high quality, high profile M&E Cell in Patna that was well
integrated with Government (and indeed could ideally be merged into government over time). It
had the onerous task of fine tuning key DPL indicators in the immediate term, responding to
changes in GoB's implementation priorities and official MIS, and helping Government
departments invest in their long-term sustainable M&E capacity that was demand-driven and
would further the cause of evidence-based policymaking.

5.1.6 The M&E Cell performed several of these functions with diligence and became a point of
reference for implementation support. But scale and structural reasons may have prevented it
from more fully meeting the challenge that the BDPL-I design imposed on it. Delays in BCB-TA
funding may have limited its scale, for example, by not allowing it to be outsourced competitively
to a firm with a proven track record and local and global expertise of M&E capacity building. Or
structural reasons to do with its location in Government (formally in the Development
Commissioner's Office but physically in the separate Planning Department) may have affected its
ability to function as a coordinating body. This is also an illustration of the early difficulties in
embedding new ideas in a traditional government framework with a weak initial emphasis on
M&E and a comprehensive agenda for delivering delayed development. The Government has
now set up a Directorate of Evaluation in the Planning Department to coordinate M&E, which
might provide an avenue for merging the activities of the M&E Cell under a possible BDPL-II.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.7 Combining the ratings of Moderately Satisfactory in Ensuring Quality at Entry and in the
Quality of Supervision leads to an overall Moderately Satisfactory rating for Bank performance
for BDPL-I. The Satisfactory rating for Outcomes tends to push this overall rating of Bank
performance close to Satisfactory, with minor (rather than moderate) shortcomings overall.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government performance
(b) Implementing agency performance
(c) Justification of rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 The Bihar Government brought momentum and political commitment at the highest
levels of government to its reform program reflected in the BDPL-I. This was done against the
backdrop of Bihar's many capacity constraints. The progress made on outcomes on all three
pillars of the BDPL-I was satisfactory when seen against the conditions under which the
Government had to function. Certainly there were shortfalls in many of these outcomes, for
example in school attendance as compared to school enrolment, but the sheer breadth and depth
of reforms that were attempted and the progress made in core areas suggest that the
Government's performance should be rated Satisfactory. A second DPL was to be in place in
2009, but rather than wait for it the Government in several instances carried forward the
momentum of its reform process and went ahead with key actions originally indentified for a
proposed second DPL.


6. Lessons learned

6.1     First, BDPL-I reaffirms the importance of the comprehensive, multi-sector policy
dialogue with the highest levels of government that a DPL provides. This dialogue was
important in Bihar not only for reforms at the core of government, such as public financial
management, but it also sustained the dialogue, analytical work, and demand driven technical
assistance in sectors as diverse as roads, social protection, and education. The three pillars of the
DPL on fiscal management and governance, growth, and service delivery, provided convening
power because they mapped closely into the Government's 11th Five Year plan and endorsed its
core ideas. The pillars also provided the basis for the more coherent framework for development
partnerships that Bihar was able to organize, important in a state where limited capacities could
have been further fragmented by poor donor coordination.

6.2      Second, gauging the political economy of reforms is vital for a DPL. A key lesson that
BDPL-I reminds us of is the vital importance of gauging the domestic politics within which our
clients must function and assessing how their reform ownership might evolve. This is important
everywhere, but doubly so where administrative capacity is low, governance has been poor, and
the track record thin. Assessing ownership is difficult under these circumstances. As the Bank did
with its pioneering 2004 state economic report on Bihar, independent assessments can help
inform the debate on development and provide a reading on the political temperature. By the time
it was under preparation, the DPL had the advantage of the government's performance record in
2006 and 2007, and it accurately judged the political mood. Development policy operations can
help a client achieve sustainable progress in difficult (or even fragile settings) using non-



                                                 33
earmarked funding because the support then backs a program the government has chosen, knows
is feasible politically, and must remain answerable to its own voters for. Outsiders would have a
difficult time making these judgments, particularly in a tough reform setting such as Bihar's or in
a fragile setting such as in post-conflict states. But ownership is not sufficient for success,
because capacity to implement is also important. Bihar in 2007 represented a unique combination
of high ownership but low capacity, requiring strategic judgments about the design of the DPL so
that political ownership could be sustained while the long process of capacity building got under
way.

6.3       Third, a DPL should strengthen the role of M&E in government and promote
evidence-based policymaking. It can do so by identifying a good results framework that is
measureable and consistent with the capacities of the client and that can provide assurance that
the government's programs are sound and producing desirable outcomes. The DPL made the
tactical choice early on of mirroring the entire set of development priorities that the Government
felt it had to move on rather than focusing on a subset deemed vital for a solid foundation for the
three pillars of the DPL. There was a natural tradeoff implied by this decision: a narrower focus
might have provided a tighter results framework and fewer indicators with greater measurability
and quantification to gauge progress (design elements emphasized, for example, by The 2009
Development Policy Lending Retrospective). A broader focus may, in the end produce more
comprehensive, if slower institutional change and greater M&E capacity in Bihar. A narrower
focus may have produced faster M&E progress in fewer areas but with the potential for
demonstration effects, systematic learning, and scaling up. It is too early to form definitive
judgments of the superiority of either course of action in the difficult setting that Bihar presented
prior to the DPL's preparation. A possible second DPL in Bihar may want to lean on the side of a
tighter results framework, also easier to do now that there is some experience with the broader
approach.

6.4     Fourth, a DPL should synchronize technical assistance with realistic capacity building
objectives especially in situations of still low capacity. From the perspective of individual Bihar
Government departments or entities other than the Finance Department, technical assistance and
economic and sector work were the two tangible elements associated with the DPL that they
could see and benefit from. This was well recognized in the BDPL-I Program Document, with the
key areas for technical assistance as well as individual donor responsibilities well laid out. A TA
combined with the high-level policy attention from a DPL can provide coherence to the Bank's
technical assistance and capacity building efforts (avoiding duplication of effort, such as between
the Bank and IFC), strategic coordination (within the Bank and with other donors), knowledge
spillovers between sectors, and consistency in technical assistance and policy advice to the GoB.

6.5     Delays in approving and making available the BCB-TA, delays that were beyond the
control of the DPL team, were not anticipated in the form of a contingency plan that might have
kicked in to partially make up for the delays in a coordinated way. In the end, many areas did get
covered using alternative funding, but there was a loss of momentum and the scale and depth of
the effort had to be necessarily smaller than what might have been possible. Of course, capacity
building in Bihar is an ongoing and long-term process, and in the longer view of things, these
early delays may matter little. In the case of Bihar, the strong political commitment to move
reforms may have also made up capacity gaps. But for the future, to the extent possible, a realistic
TA program that does not overload the government should precede approval of DPLs in low
capacity settings. And there should be a contingency TA plan to deal with unanticipated delays.

6.6    Fifth, the BDPL-I shows the need to maintain the long-term, special relationship with
Bihar that a DPL makes possible. This relationship has generated for the Bank much design,


                                                 34
supervision, and management experience of working in the unique political and administrative
setting of India's poorest state, a society that nonetheless has immense human talent, much
resilience, and a political climate that is likely to remain supportive of rapid development
irrespective of whichever party wins the elections in November 2010. This knowledge can and
should be fruitfully deployed in the design of a second DPL as envisaged in BDPL-I.

   7. COMMENTS ON ISSUES RAISED BY BORROWER/IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES/PARTNERS
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

7.1      The Government of Bihar has provided useful comments on the draft ICR Report that
have been incorporated into the Report. Annex 4 contains the full text of the GoB's comments.
On the comment on teacher and student absenteeism, the ICR text has been modified to reflect
the reduction in teacher absenteeism from the high levels for Bihar reported in the background
work for the 2004 World Development Report. The measures undertaken by GoB to reduce
student absence, particularly for girl students, have been noted in the Report. On GoB's transfer
policy for the civil service, the relevant text has been clarified to highlight the contradiction
between the 10 percent cap and the desire to rotate officers after three years to promote their
neutrality and objectivity. The overall comment on the value and timeliness of the BDPL-I for the
State's efforts to promote sustainable and inclusive development is appreciated.
