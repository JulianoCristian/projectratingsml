Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Several lessons were gleaned from this\n            project: 1) Addressing irrigation development from a river\n            basin, multi-stakeholder perspective enables you to firmly\n            place on the agenda the impact of irrigation abstractions on\n            up- and downstream water use, establish mechanisms for\n            resolving inter- and intra-sectoral water allocation\n            conflicts, and provide incentives for increasing irrigation\n            efficiency and productivity. 2) This project put into\n            practice the Bank's 1993 Water Resources Management\n            Policy, which called for a more comprehensive approach to\n            WRM, incorporating cross-sectoral perspectives,\n            environmental concerns, and stakeholder participation. 3)\n            Policy and institutional reforms, and the transformation of\n            Basin Water Organizations into accountable, transparent,\n            financially autonomous and independent organizations are\n            slow and difficult, but necessary for instituting changes.\n            4) The project has demonstrated that limited but targeted\n            investments in irrigation and drainage infrastructure\n            improvement can encourage farmers to reduce water wastage\n            and to consider the water demands of other users. 5)  The\n            project's participatory approach, involving farmers at\n            all stages, is a slow but essential part of the process of\n            ensuring improved scheme performance and sustainability, and\n            a demand-driven spirit among beneficiaries. 6) Scheme\n            Improvement Assessment Reports (SIAR) provided a good basis\n            for smallholder scheme developments."}, "docdt": "2004-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
