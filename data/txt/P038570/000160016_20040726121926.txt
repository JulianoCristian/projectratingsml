EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Govemment of Tanzania (GoT) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS)
has taken various initiatives to improve agricultural sector in the country. One of these initiatives is
undertaking the River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP);
in context with which, is the Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC). Among others,
the need to undertake the RBMSIIP arose out of a nation-wide realisation that the ecosystems of
country's river basins (especially those of the Rufiji and the Pangani Rivers) are not being properly
managed, leading to extensive environmental degradation and loss of potentialities of these vital
ecosystems. Moreover, it was also realised that in view of the above-mentioned loss of potentiality,
smallholder traditional irrigation schemes are the worst affected; hence the need arose to undertake also
the SIIC.
Support to smallholder traditional ilTigation i mprovement a nd rehabilitation i s, therefore, one of the
major components of this RBMSIIP programme. The SIIC component focuses on improving
management of water resources and crop husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation
schemes. This can be achieved, among others, through improvement of natural resources, land and
water, during implementation of the rehabilitation and upgrading of ilTigation schemes.) SIIC is geared
at improvement of water management in smallholder ilTigation schemes to ensure sustainable use of
land and water resources and ultimately yield increase with minimal environmental degradation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC both the Scheme Environmental Assessment (SEA) as well as an
Environmental Audit (EA) were carried out for the Kambi ya Tanga Irrigation Scheme. Among others,
both the assessment and the audit were based on the Initial Environmental Assessments (IEE) studies
carried out by the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the of the Irrigation Section of the MAFS.
This report presents the findings of the study.
The objective of the study was identifying changes that have taken place before/after scheme
improvement, assessing and quantifying thereto environmental and social impacts, also duly preparing
an environmental and social management plan as well as developing an environmental and social
management and monitoring system. According to the ToR, the expected outputs of this study are two
in one interrelated reports i.e. covering both Environmental Audit (EA) as well as Scheme
Environmental Assessment (SEA), analysing e.g. socio-economic, socio-cultural and engineering
factors in order to provide quantitative information.
Furthermore, the report incorporates an assessment of compliance of the scheme's improvement to the
Tanzanian policy and legislation framework, as well as the World Bank's relevant environmental safe
guard policies (especially on OP 4.01).
Different methodologies were employed in carrying out the task, including the following:
*   Desk review of recommended documents
*   Questionnaire administration to key stakeholders
*   Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA)
At different stages of the study the following approaches and analytical tools were applied
*   Participatory data collection
*   Key infornmiant interview
*   Trend analysis
*   Geographical information system
Describing the location of the scheme, the study found that the Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme is
situated at low-lying areas at the fort of Mt. Meru about 40 km south east of Arusha municipality. Its
coordinates are latitude 030 32 South and longitude 36° 53 East, and are at an altitude of about 1 100m
above mean sea level. It comprises the following villages: Manyata, Tengeru, Nkoannua, Ngurundoto,
Songoro, and Karanga Ndogo

The monitoring program comprises the following attributes: water quality, groundwater, soil
conservation, biodiversity, crop diseases, afforestation, socio-economic and health indicators
Additionally, the environmental audit main conclusions and recommendations are:
In up-stream areas of the scheme, the key impacts constraining sustainability intensive up-stream socio-
economic activities leading to extensive pollution of water e.g. use of up-stream drainage water as
source for the scheme. In within-scheme areas the constraints are general poor soil fertility. In down-
stream a rea su stainability i s mainly c onstrained b y i nadequacy o f water a nd i nappropriate i rigation
practices. It was also found that the location of the scheme enhances sustainability of the scheme. This
is because the scheme is located near rapidly growing settlements of Mererani (which has relatively
strong monetary strength) Mbuguni and Msitu wa Mbogo all of which have reliable transportation
services to Usa River, Arusha and Moshi where many marketing opportunities exist.
Most of the identified mitigation measures are related with local community-based effective structural
-organization. This means therefore that most of the measures can be implemented by local
govermment authorities themselves with financial and technical assistance of funded projects e.g.
.RBMSIIP, NGOs and CBOs.

Villages around Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme have a total population of 2800 people. The main
ethnic groups in the scheme area are Wachaga, Wapare, Wasambaa, etc., and other smaller groups. The
majority of these are agriculturalists. Few are livestock keepers. The land use in the adjacent villages of
Kambi ya Tanga is mainly irrigation as well as rain-fed cultivation and grazing.
The source of irrigation water for the Kambi ya Tanga scheme is Kikuletwa River. This river is formed
by joining of Usa stream, Maji ya Chai spring, Tengeru and Mohoha spring. The mean annual flow of
the Kikuletwa River (during 1977 - 81) was 0.89 cumecs compared with current 5.96 cumecs.
Conflicts over water use have been recorded in the study area, especially in the dry season when river
flows are at the lowest.
With t he i rrigation structures i mprovement a nd p rospects for h igher i ncome e amings from irTigated
agriculture, there is greater loyalty to the leadership of Water Associations. Since most of the people
are irrigators and members of the associations, the latter has greater influence beyond irrigation
matters.
The following are some of the positive effects:
*   Crop production has improved a great deal
*   Water availability has improved with more areas obtaining water than used to be in before
improvement.
*   Strengthened existing Water Users Association.
*   Temporary employment oppoltunities were created during the construction phase.
*   Some farmers have attended on farm training and exchange visits to other areas to share
experience with other farmers as well as leaming new skills.

1. BACKGROUND
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The Govenmment of Tanzania, through the Ministry of Agriculture and F ood S ecurity (MAFS), has
undertaken various initiatives to improve the agriculture sector in the country. One of these initiatives
is the River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP). The
Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC) is included within the scope of RBMSIIP.
RBMSIIP was developed in response to a water shortage crisis prevalent in many parts of the country.
Water demands often exceed available resources; this is especially true in the Pangani and Rufiji
basins.
Support to smallholder traditional irrigation improvement and rehabilitation is one of the major
components of this project. SIIC focuses on improving the management of water resources and crop
husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation schemes. This is achieved through, among other
things, the improvement of natural resources (land and water) during implementation of the
rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes.
The SIIC undertaking supports the objectives of the National Irrigation Development Plan (NIDP),
which was formulated and adopted in 1994. The plan includes a management and decision-making
framework that is based on the comprehensive ranking of schemes within each management unit (river
or drainage basin).
Under NIDP, the order of priority for irrigation development is as follows:
*   Improvement/rehabilitation of Traditional Smallholder Irrigation Schemes;
*   Water Harvesting Technology;
*   Opening of New Smallholder Schemes;
*   Large Scale Irrigation Schemes for Private Sector.
SIIC focuses on the improvement of water management in smallholder irrigation schemes to ensure the
sustainable use of land and water resources. Ultimately, SIIC aims to facilitate increases in crop yields
while minimizing environmental degradation. According to World Bank guidelines, the irTigation
schemes in the Rufiji and Pangani basins are classified as Category B. Under this category, no major
adverse environmental impacts are permitted and mitigation measures must be incorporated into the
scheme design, implementation and operation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC, a feasibility study was carried out that resulted in the preparation of
the Project Implementation Plan for 1996/97 - 2001/02. This plan, produced in October 1996, contains
an assessment of environmental issues together with proposed environmental mitigation measures.
Under World Bank advisement, the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Security conducted an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) of the irrigation schemes. The
IEEs were used a s the b asis for the S cheme Improvement A ssessment Studies. The c onsultants, i n
collaboration with ECU, have been charged to conduct environmental audits in seven Category B
sites: Ruanda Majenje, Igomelo, Mangalali, Nyamahana, Soko, Kambi ya Tanga, and Mahenge. An
additional site, Lemkuna, only required the development of an Environmental and Social Management
Plan. This report is focused on presenting the findings of the environmental audit that was conducted
for the Kambi ya Tanga Irrigation Scheme.
This report draws heavily on intensive field observations by the study team. Discussions were held
with farmers and other local people, village and district officials, and project staff. A review of various
existing documents was also conducted in the preparation of this report.



1.2 UNDERSTANDING OF THE STUDY
1.2.1  Objective of the Study
The objective of the study is to get a better understanding of the present environmental conditions and
relevant i mpact a reas ( environmental a udit) within t he s cheme. I ncreased a wareness will a llow for
improved monitoring of both negative and positive changes over time and will assist in the formulation
of more effective mitigation measures. The environmental audit will also be the basis for the
preparation of an environmental and social management plan and monitoring system.
Specifically, the study will undertake the following:
*   Assess and quantify baseline environmental and social conditions
*   Assess and quantify environmental and social impacts
*   Conduct environmental audits in order to comply with existing Government of Tanzania and
World Bank environmental and safeguard policies
*   Prepare an environmental and social management plan
*   Develop an environmental and social management and monitoring system
*   Conduct public consultations
1.3     STRATEGIC APPROACH
The consultant's enviromnental audit of the Kambi ya Tanga ilTigation scheme was characterized by
tlhree a pproaches: e cosystem, fa,-niing system a nd p articipatory. T he b asic a pproach o f t he s tudy i s
illustrated in Figure 1-1.
1.3.1   Ecosystem Approach
In view of the fact that the project activities are wholly based in a rural area, potential conflicts
between the project and the environment are likely to arise. Thus, issues pertaining to the use of
natural resources (e.g. livestock grazing, agriculture, irrigation, water source protection, agro-forestry,
etc.) have to be studied.
In applying the ecosystem approach, the consultant not only focused on the Kambi ya Tanga irrigation
scheme but also on all the ecosystems upstream and down stream that impact the environmental and
social characteristics of the area. To accomplish this, the study sought an understanding of all
activities taking place within the irrigation scheme's water catchment area. River pollution,
sedimentation, flash floods, deforestation, destabilization of riverbanks, erosion, salinity, land
degradation, and waterborne diseases (among others) are all contributing to degradation of the
catchment area. In suggesting mitigation measures, sustainable practices for the use of water and land
resources must be adopted to prevent and control environmental and social problems.
1.3.2   Farming System Approach
On the irrigation scheme level, a farming system approach was used to describe and analyse
environmental and socio-economic conditions. Issues related to soil contamination, water pollution,
the use and dangers of pesticides and fertilizers, health, and others have been identified. It is clear that
the irrigation activities will transfonn village life and the whole farming system in the Kambi ya
Tanga area.
The success of the proposed mitigating measures will therefore depend on community involvement,
improvement of the socio-economic situation, capacity building, and proper upgrading, maintenance
and operation of the irrigation infrastructure. The latter should take into account the local environment
as well as the prevailing institutional, economic and social conditions.
2



1.3.3   Participatory Approach
A participatory approach was adopted in preparation for the environmental audit. This entailed seeking
information/experience from stakeholders (i.e. farmers, district and regional officers, R BMSIIP and
other institutions who have been involved in the project). In order to ensure effective participation and
cooperation it was necessary to inform stakeholders prior to the audit of the environmental and socio-
economic problems to be addressed. Their inputs have contributed to the development of more
realistic and appropriate mitigation measures.

1.4 METHODOLOGY
The methodology follows Tanzanian policy, legislation, and the World Bank's policies on
environmiental assessment (OP/BP 4.01 and related policies and guidance documents).
Available reference documents were reviewed for purposes of identifying pertinent environmental and
social i ssues. I nformation was o btained o n t he K ambi ya Tanga i rrigation scheme b efore a nd a fter
construction as well as during operation. Several meetings were held with SIIP project staff. In
particular, the ECU team, which was involved in the Scheme Environmental Assessment, was
consulted to discuss background and potential issues. Subsequently, a ten-day field mission was
conducted in A ugust by the study t eam and m embers of E CU. The team w as u sed to: 1) complete
further fieldwork at various sites in the Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme, 2) collect additional
information, 3) work with the irrigation scheme management team, and 4) to liaise with the various
stakeholders including the district officials. During the field visits, the Public Consultation and
Disclosure Plan for disseminating the results of the Draft Environmental Audit were developed with
the ECU staff.
1.4.1   Consultation
Public c onsultations took p lace in two p hases. The first p hase took p lace during the E nvironmental
Audit (EA) preparation process. This initial stage allowed for the identification of the key
environmental issues and involved the gathering of information on stakeholder concems and views of
potential environmental and social impacts. During the second phase, consultations allowed
stakeholders to review findings and give their comments.
1.4.2  Analytical Tools
The following methodologies were applied in the process of the study:
*   Participatory data collection
*   Key informant interviews
*   Socio-economic and environmental analysis
*   Trend analysis of river flow and rainfall
*   Water and soil quality analysis
*   Geographical information systems (GIS)
Participatory Data Collection
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) involves problem analysis, ranking, proposal planning, role
assigning and timing. The role playing consisted of a facilitator who played the role of an advisor on
the different matters raised during the workshop (those which the team was not informed a bout or
aware of). In the final analysis, a Logical Framework Approach workshop (also known as ZOPP)
produced the Environmental Action Plan for the irrigation scheme.
Key Informant Interviews
In addition to group discussions, information was also obtained from key informants. These were
generally staff from the Zonal Irrigation Office (ZIO), the District Executive Director (DED), farmers
of the Kambi ya Tanga scheme, village officials (including village leaders), and others (agriculture and
irrigation officers who are residents in the community). Any inconsistent information was cross-
checked to ensure accuracy. Various officials conducted the crosschecking of information while
members of the study team facilitated the group discussions.
Socio-economic and Environmental Analysis
A total of 100 household questionnaires (sample size) have been administered using the random
sampling method. This represents. Percent of households of the study area (upstream, down stream and
scheme level) 80 percent (80 questionnaires) of selected sample size has been administered at Igomelo
village (scheme level), where as 10 percent (10 questionnaires) has been administered at Manyatta
5



village (upstream village) and 10 percent (10 questionnaires) has been administered at Migungani
village (downstream village).
Quantitative data relating to the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the scheme was
collected and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software.
Trend Analysis of River Flow and Rainfall
An investigation was conducted upstream and downstream on rivers that feed the scheme. Both
statistical and visual interpretations of variability analysis were applied. To further reveal any existence
of severe abstraction or flow regime changes, variability analysis was done month to month. Any
possible causes for the change in the flow regime were quantified. In this regard, annual rainfall
variability for stations in or around the study area was noted. Three approaches were followed to tackle
the impacts problem:
* Visual interpretation - Understanding and interpreting the annual time series and percent deviation
time series from the annual mean.
* Testing randomness on the annual and monthly time series data - This test indicates that if the null
hypothesis tested for randomness is accepted, no flow regime change prevails in the record;
otherwise, it shows the flow regime is changed or there is a likely impact on the river upstream or
downstream.
*   Testing of breaks - At times a break or jump may be observed in the time series of flow. If, for
example, a huge volume of water is suddenly diverted to an irrigation area, segments before and
after the diversion can have different means.
Subsequent sections provide scheme level variability analysis and interpretation of the results for both
flow and rainfall.
The flow and rainfall data were collected from various sources. Rainfall data were collected partly from
Tanzania Meteorology Agency (TMA) and partly from the Ministry of Water and Livestock
Development (MWL). Flow data were partly collected from the Ministry of Water and Livestock
(MWL) and partly from previous reports.
Water and Soil Analysis
Water and soil samples were analysed at the laboratory of the Department of Environmnental
Engineering, University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS) and Mlingano Soil
Laboratory. Procedures and analysis were done according to the International Standards of Water and
Soil Analysis.
Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
Overlay maps and GIS were used to analyse sensitive/significant/relevant features of the irrigation
scheme area. Attributes and features that were mapped and analysed included water bodies, land use
pattems, vegetation cover, and cultural structures. The technique involved the physical overlaying of
individual topographic maps to provide a composite picture of the overall environmental and social
situation. Using ArcView 3. 1, analysis was carried out to link spatial and non-spatial data.
1.5    LIMITATIONS
Data quantification proved a difficult exercise due to the following reasons:
(i) There was insufficient baseline data related to environmental and socio-economic parameters.
(ii) Updated meteorological and hydrological data were not available.

2.1.2   History of the scheme
The existing schelmie intak-e is located about 200 mi do-wnstreanm of Msitu wa Mbogo headw orks (tlie
structure was rehabilitated by KZIU in 1989 under project URT/86/0 17). The Government and
UNDP/FAO funded rehabilitation of the traditional irrigation project in Anusha and Kilimanjaro. The
diversion of irrigation water througlh the traditional intake is affected by the presence of stones, trash
and banana stems which are dumiiped along the ri-er, which then becomle washed aw ay during high
river flows. There was no gated structure to control water extraction into the main canal, whlich started
at rather deep excav-atioaL then r ecovTered slow-ly illto normal excavation at drainage 2406 in from the
intake. From the intake, tle Kamibi va Tanga maini canal flowvs towiards the south anid then branches to
Kikuletwa secondary canal at about 1180 in from the intake. In general. there w-as a long netwvork of
7



earthen canals of various lengths and sizes. These situations had caused excessive water losses and,
hence, a shortage of irrigation water to expand into other areas.
2.1.3   Existing land use
The people in the area use their land for various socio-economic activities: agriculture (both rain-fed
and iirigated), livestock keeping, mining, and gem dealing. Some of the people of these villages are
engaged in more than one activity.
The upstream catchment area of the scheme includes Manyata village, Lakitatu village, a part of Kikwe
village and USA river village. The catchment watercourses join the Kikuletwa River in the Kikwe
ward. These villages and environs have many large estates, houses, hotels, restaurants and bars.
Downstream of the scheme is Mikungani village. This village is very close to the Mererani settlement
where a small number of Tanzanite miners are living.
Upstream of the scheme there are three other irrigation schemes: Olbuso, Sun Flag and Tajiri Ali.
There is another irrigation scheme downstream called Mbuguni Shango which also uses water from
Kikuletwa River.
The p otential a rea for irrigation u pstream a t M anyata a nd L ekitatu i s 1 080 h a, b ut o nly 9 60 ha are
actually utilized. At Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme, the potential area for irrigation is 640 ha, but
the utilized area is only 540 ha.
Crops cultivated upstream are paddy, maize and vegetables. At Kambi ya Tanga, cassava, maize,
beans, vegetables, bananas, pigeon peas, sweet potatoes and mixed fruits are all grown.
2.1.4   Land Tenure
The indigenous ethnic groups are the Maasai, Waarusha and Wameru. These initial inhabitants of the
area settled the land for farming and grazing. The Maasai occupied the steppes or plains while the
Waarusha and Wamelu settled on the slopes of Mount Meru. Wanyamwezi, Wasukuma, Wanyaturu
and Wanyiramba who were brought in to the area as labourers for neighbouring plantations were the
first to pursue irrigation activities.
During Tanzania's Ujamaa period, all the unoccupied land was allocated to landless villagers and the
Wachagga who migrated from Kilimanjaro.
There are four ways of land ownership in the area: 68%, 35%, 9% and 6% are acquired through
inheritance, buying, village government and bush clearing, respectively, as shown in the figure below.

2.2     THE BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.2.1   Climatic Data
The nearest meteorological station to the scheme from which climatic data could be collected is located
at the Kilimanjaro Airport (Station No. 09335115). The geographical position of the station is at
latitude 030 25' and at longitude 370 04'. The station is 891m above sea level.
In Tanzania, collection of meteorological data is the responsibility of the National Meteorological
Agency (NMA). It is expected that data should be collected at the local stations and then forwarded for
processing and storage at the agency's head office in Dar es Salaam. For stations, which are operated
by the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development (MWLD), data is available at the Regional Water
Engineers' offices and at the Ubungo headquarter office in Dar es Salaam.
For the Kambi ya Tanga scheme, climatic data from five different stations in the project area was
collected and duly analysed. The stations included Kilimanjaro Airport and Tengeru. The most
representative station was selected as Kilimanjaro airport because of similarity of topography,
proximity of the station to the scheme area and the length and continuity of the records. The data for
this station was used for the detailed analysis of agro-hydro meteorological parameters.
Kambi Ya Tanga scheme is located at lowland agro-ecological zone (below 1200 average mean sea
level.) in Aremeru District. The scheme lies in the marginal area where the annual rainfall is in the
range of 400 mnn to 800 mm. The temperature ranges from 17 to 25° C. The seasonal distribution of
rainfall is bi-modal in nature with the main rain occurring from March to May and minor rain occurring
from December to January. The most representative climatic station for Kambi ya Tanga scheme is a
station located at Kilimanjaro International Airport. Summnary of the climatic data are given in the table
below.

2.2.2   Water Resources
The source of irrigation water for Kambi Ya Tanga scheme is Kikuletwa River. This river is formed by
the confluence of the USA stream, Maji Ya Chai spring, and Tengenr and Molala springs.
The river is perennial with significant base flow contribution to the total flow of the river during the dry
season. Kikuletwa is gauged at Idd55-a station just downstream of Kambi ya Tanga. Though flow
measurements at this station were started in 1977, it appears measurements were not taken from 1982
to 1993. As a result, variability and other hydrological conditions in this period are difficult to predict.
The problem is further compounded by the significant flow increases during the 1994-1999 period
compared to the previous period of 1977-1981. The mean annual flow from 1977 to 1981 is 0.89 m3/s
where as that of 1994 to 1999 5.96 m3/s. Table 2.4 and Figure 2.3 illustrate the difference. The
consultant thinks this variation might be caused due to an error in the rating curve measurements.

Domestic wvater supply
The irrigation canal (Kikuletwi-a River) pro-vides the main source of drinking wvater for the comniiulihN
and their domestic animals. The -villagers also depend on the iffigation water for other domestic needs.
The quality of water for domestic consumption is questionable due to riv-er pollution. The w-ater does
not receiv e any kind of treatment prior to its use by humanis. Livestock also use water directly from the
irrigation canals as there are no specific w-atering points for livestock. As depicted in the table below, a
majority of the w ater users have to travel more than lf0Om to a reach a w-ater source.

Water use conflicts
Water rights are accredited to the village government but land is individually owned. The Kaambi va
Tanga fanrers complain about use of wvater by upstreaim fanners nwlo have no w ater right. In additioni
there has been some continLuous tensioni and conflicts betn-een the irrigators and large-scale farmers
wvho extract wN-ater from the river.
Water quality
A total of six w-ater samples were collected from the Kaiinbi va Tanga irrigation scheme. The sampling
locations wvere systematically chosenl so as to track the quality of w ater as it trickles down the irrigation
scheme. Samples were taken from the intake and downstream end. Others wvere collected within the
irrigation fanrs (channels) themselves. The samples were taken on 3 September 2003. There locations
are shownn in a map below.

2.2.3   Soil
The soils of the area were found to be alluvial deposits of volcanic origin carried by the Nduruma and
Kikuletwa rivers. The average slope ranges between I and 1.5%. The area is ranked Class 4. Crops
grown under both rainfall and irrigation are: cassava, maize, beans, vegetables, bananas, pigeon peas,
sweet potatoes, mixed fruits and coffee. A soil survey was carried out on 3 September, 2003. As the
survey was conducted during the dry season, it was not possible to assess the crop yield.
The soil characteristics are: dark brown colour; slightly hard when dry; friable when moist; sticky and
plastic when wet; medium sub-angular blocky structure; no out crop; and no concretions. Soil pH is
more than 8.3; thus, it is strongly alkaline. Fertility is low, although there is good mineralization.
Availability of phosphorus is low to medium. Cation exchange capacity ranges from high to very high.
Exchangeable calcium is very high. Exchangeable magnesium is high while exchangeable potassium
and sodium are both very high. The table below shows the analysed data.

2.2.4  Biodiversity at the scheme
The Kambi ya Tanga area is mainly covered by farmlands due to many years of agricultural activity.
There is very little natural woodland left. A few wild animals are around but these are mainly monkeys.
2.3 THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.3.1  Population
The residents of Kambi ya Tanga are composed of various ethnic groups such as Wapare, Waarusha,
Wanyiramba, Wachaga, Wanyaturu and many others. The total population in the area is now estimated
to be over 2800.

Unlike other irrigation schemes w-here residential areas are awaay from the farms. farmers in Kambi va
Tanga live on their farm plots. This calls for strategic participatory land use planuning in the area. A
large segmenit. 52% percent of the population, is engaged in farmitig. Fifty-nine percent (59°%o) can-v
out other activities such as trading. carpentry. and formal employment (e.g. teachers).

2.3.2   Energy Supply
Firewi-ood and charcoal are the main sor-ces of energx at Kamibi ya Tanga. Charcoal is. considered
rather expensive. Electricity and kerosene are used for lighting.

2.3.3  Marketing and information
Findings show that farmers' access to markets and market information is not a problem. It was found
out that 56.9% of the farmers depend on local buyers, 13.7% sell directly to consumers, 7.8% to non-
local buyers and the rest produce for their own domestic consumption.
2.3.4  Education
The people of Kambi ya Tanga have varying levels of education. Tables 2.10 and 2.11 summarize the
education levels attained, female and male respectively, in percentages.

2.3.5   Existing facilities near the irrigation scheme
There is one private primary school within the scheme area but it caters mainly to pupils from outside
the s cheme. T he r est o f t he c hildren g o t o N datu, L eganga a nd M anyatta p rimary s chools, s ome o f
which are quite far (up to 5 km). During the rainy season, some pupils are not able to go to school due
to inaccessibility.
There is no health facility within the scheme. Villagers go Leganga Health Centre in USA River
Township which is about 2 km away. There is also a hospital belonging to a religious institution and
several private dispensaries in the township.
Farmers in Kambi ya Tanga area lack adequate social services in the vicinity of the scheme area.
16



The state of sanitation in Kambi ya Tanga village is generally poor to moderate in quality. Most of the
villagers neither own nor use the improved latrines (i.e. those with roofs and walls constructed of earth
bricks). They use traditional latrines, which do not have adequate roofing and have poorly const-ucted
walls.
Income activities
85% of income activities are related to irrigation while only 15% are from irrigation/non-irrigation
activities as revealed in the table below.

2.3.6  Extension Services
The farmers benefit from access to extension services where three agricultural officers, one divisional
agricultural officer, assisted by two ward agricultural officers. The villagers are advised on the type of
fertilisers to use, depending on the type of crops they are planting and on the type of pesticides.

The co-operative society serves its members mainly. However, other farmers also get some services
from the society, e.g. training on good methods of green vegetables and paddy cultivation.
2.3.7   Social Capital
The s cheme u sed t o b e d irectly managed b y the village govemment through a nominated i rrigation
committee, which shows that it has been working well. In 1997 the farmers formed an ilTigators
organization called MBUKITA (Umoja wa Wamwagiliaji Msitu wa Mbogo, Kikuletwa na Kambi ya
Tanga). An interim committee was elected to spearhead the farmers towards formation of registered
irrigators Cooperative Society. The leadership is composed of a chairman, secretary, Treasurer and
committee members.
Ushirika wa Wamwagiliaji Maji Kambi ya Tanga (UWAMALE) was established in 1997 and
registered in 1999 as a Cooperative Society with 48 members. Now it has 100 members. The leaders
occupy their positions for 3 years and are elected by the members. The organisation is still establishing
itself in the village, considering the number of the farmers that reaches 2,800.
2.4 DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS
Consultations/interview with local communities and authorities, as well as responses from
questionnaires and group discussions revealed that in villages around Kambi ya Tanga, there are no
environmentally sensitive areas of special or unique scientific and/or cultural value

3. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES STAKEHOLDERS
3.1 SOIL CONSERVATION AND AGRO-FORESTRY PROJECT
(SCAPA)
The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) established the project in February 1989. The
main objectives of the project in Arumeni district were:
*   To improve and increase agricultural production. This is with emphasis on small holders in the
medium and high potential areas
* Formulate a sustainable integrated soil conservation
*   Extension package for rural development; and
* Provide sites/centers for training and demonstration of soil conservation practice
One of the most important achievements of SCAPA is that of creating awareness of soil erosion
problenmis among farming communities in Arumeru district. About 120 villages out of 137 in the district
have been covered by the project.
3.2 WATER USERS ASSOCIATION
The farmers organized themselves into cooperative society known as Irrigators Rural Savings and
Credit Cooperative Society (MBUKITA). It was registered on 16th Febniary 2001 with registration
number AR 384.
Organizational Set up: MBUKITA has adopted a well spread field representation were by there are
channels of communication and interaction among farmers. It also promotes a wide scope for farmer's
participation in different activities of the association and ensures well spread farmers representation at all
field levels. It is composed of a General Assembly, Executive Committee and Canal/Sub group
Committee.
It comprises total of twelve members eight being men and four women, including Chairperson, vice
chairperson, secretary and treasurer.
The sub-group committees
These are grassroots level committees where in the scheme there are three canal/sub groups. These are
Msitu wa Mbogo, Kikuletwa and Kambi ya Tanga. Members differ from one subgroup to another, and for
instance, Msitu wa Mbogo has eight members, Kikuletwa has 22 members and Kambi ya Tanga 18
members. Subgroups comprises of manager, secretary, water distributor (Bwana Maji), elder of the canal
(Mzee Mshauri), clerk and inspector of irrigated area (Mkaguzi wa mashamba).
In general, the leadership overseas all issue pertaining to development of Kambi ya Tanga irrigation
scheme including water management and distribution.
One of the most important achievements of SCAPA is that of creating awareness of soil erosion
problems among farming communities in Arumeni district. About 120 villages out of 137 in the district
have been covered by the project.
Another community-based organization is the Shamima Irrigation Rural Savings and Credit Society
(SIRSC) registered in May 2003 of which its main objectives are:
* To promote rural savings
* To increase opportunities for provision of credit.
* To provide education on cooperative management
Members of the association belong to following villages:
Kikuletwa, Mikungani and Mbuguni.

3.4     STAKEHOLDER'S ROLE
3.4.1  Identified stakeholders
In order of vested powers in decision-making roles and enforcement, the identified stakeholders are as
follows:
*   District Council's i.e., through the District Executive, Director (DED) with his/her relevant
committee and functional officers e.g. District Agricultural and Livestock Development Officer
(DALDO), District Water Engineer, District Council Development office, etc.
*   Ward Executive Officers i.e., through the Ward Executive Officers (WEO) with their relevant
conmmittee and functional offices, e.g. Ward Agricultural Officer.
*   Village Executive Officer i.e. through the village Executive Officers (VEO) with their relevant
committee and functional officer e.g. Village Agricultural Officer.
*   Water users association.
*   Farmers' groups/associations.
*   Private organization, e.g. NGOs, CBOs, etc
*   Donors
3.4.2   Analysis of stakeholders
In general for sake of sustainability influential role of all the identified stakeholders is synergetic. For
example, at the highest level, the District Council chaired by the council chairman/woman and all its
relevant committees and functional officers are fully involved so that they can put in their agenda and
plans financial issues of the scheme. In that way further development of the scheme gets both the
support and the authority it requires.
Likewise even at the lowest level (i.e. at village government/farmers associations level) the
stakeholders need to be fully involved because being at grass-roots, they are capable of providing
solution on a routine bases.
3.4.3  Involvement of stakeholders in environmental audit and implementation of ESMP
In view of the above therefore different stakeholders were and will be involved in environmental
auditing and implementation of ESMP as follows:
Water users association
Managing water resources within schemes
Farmers associations/groups
Carrying out routine activities/controlling actions
Identifying/formulating required action to VEO.
Savings and credit organisations.
Village Executive Office (VEO)
Grass-roots representation of local government system.
Mobilizes, receives, identified required action and forwards them to WEO for considerations.
Ward Executive Officer (WEO)
Grass roots representative of local government system.
Mobilizes, receives checks and controls identified required action and forwards them to District
Council (through relevant its committees).
District Council
District development planning.
Mobilizes, receives and deliberates identified required action and incorporates  them into the district
development plan for financing.
Finance/overseas implementation of the identified actions.
20



Private Organization/NGOs/CBOs
Promotes identification and implementation of identified action.
Helps to secure funding of the actions.
Donor agency
Promotes development cooperation.
Finances/overseas implementation of action plans
3.4.4   Ensuring incorporation of concerns of stakeholders in ESMP
The concern of stakeholders are incorporated in ESMP, it is proposed that the following measures be
taken after finalization/submission of the ESMP:
Seeking government approval of ESMP
This government approval of ESMP is imperative because the councils are not allowed to implement a
plan unknown to the government. Under these circumstances the ESMP has to be approved firstly by
MAFS, NEMC and then by PO-RALG.
Dissemination of the ESMP to relevant district
After government approval, then the ESMP should be disseminated to relevant districts for
implementation. This should be followed by a series of workshops, seminar, etc. to enable public
discussion on the ESMP. The discussion should start at district level then percolate to lower and lower
levels as indicated above.
21



4.     COMPLIANCE WITH TANZANIA'S POLICIES, LEGAL
FRAMEWORK AND WITH WORLD BANK'S SAFE
GUARD POLICIES
4.1    NATIONAL POLICIES
Relevant policies with a bearing on agricultural and rural development in general, and irrigation in
particular, and therefore Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme, have been examined. These include the
National Environment policy, the Land policy, the National Water policy, the Energy policy, the
National Agriculture policy, Draft Rural Development Policy, Poverty Reduction Strategy, Draft Rural
Development Strategy, Agriculture Sector Development Strategy, the Forest policy and the Wildlife
policy. These policies affect direct key sectoral activities and they were examined because they
automatically affect important land uses in the area vis-a-vis: agriculture, water, livestock, energy,
forest and wildlife.
4.1.1  National Environment Policy of 1997
Implementation of the river basin management and smallholder irrigation project and particularly the
irrigation schemes under operation is consistent with the overall objectives of the National
Environment Policy. The policy provides a framework for multi-sectoral participation and cooperation
to achieve sustainable development; and seeks to ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources for
meeting the basic needs of present and future generations, without degrading the environmental
resource base or risking health and safety. The policy emphasize the need to prevent and control
degradation of land, water, vegetation and air which constitutes our life support systems. This is so as
to conserve and enhance our natural and man made heritage; including biological diversity; to improve
the condition and productivity of degraded areas including rural and urban settlements; to raise public
awareness and understanding of the essential linkages between environment and development and
promote individual and community participation in environmental action, among others.
Furthermore the policy calls for improved agricultural practices, and better utilization of the scarce
water for irrigation, ensure efficiency, minimize looses and avoid salinisation as well as proper use of
agrochemicals to minimize reduce/pollution of water sources.
The design, re-construction and operation of the schemes have taken into account the above
considerations. Additionally, planned training of farmers in effective and efficient management of
water resources intends to contribute to achievement of the objectives of the environment policy.
4.1.2  Agriculture Policy 1997
The implementation of the RBM-SIIP based on farmer groups and rural commnunity participation is
consistent with the Agricultural and Livestock Policy (ALP) of 1997, which provides policy guidance
on the development of the agricultural sector. The policy seeks to ensure that the direction and pattem
of development in the sector meets economic, social and environmental objectives. The policy aims at
accelerated growth of production and exports through among others, assuring national food security,
developing and introducing new teclnologies, which will increase productivity of labour and land;
promote integrated and sustainable use and management of natural resources and providing agricultural
support services.
The smallholder irrigation projects aims at providing agricultural support services; improve income of
the rural poor, promote rational use of water resources and introduce appropriate technologies among
others.
4.1.3  Land Policy of 1995
The National Land Policy of 1995 provides incentives for efficient use of land and its resources. It
seeks to promote and ensure a secure land tenure system, encourage optimal use of land resources and
facilitate broad-based social and economic development without up setting or endangering the
ecological balance of the environment. Farmer groups and communities participating in the project
22



have acquired customary rights of occupancy from their respective villages and some villages are
processing granted rights. Both granted and customary rights of occupancy secure land ownership add
incentives for farmers to maintain and develop their farms accordingly, reduce land use conflicts and
increase the value of land.
4.1.4  Water Policy of 2002
The National Water Policy (2002) provides a comprehensive framework for promoting optimal,
sustainable and equitable development and use of w ater resources for sustainable development. The
policy seeks to ensure supply of good quality of water to meet domestic, environmental and other
priority development purpose. Emphasis is placed on the need to ensure more efficient utilization of
existing water resources through institutional improvements, proper soil management to prevent soil
erosion and flooding and improved monitoring to control water quality and contamination from
industrial sewerage and excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers. These objectives requite on
integrated a nd holistic p lanning a nd management i n a reas, water use a nd d isposal o f e ffluents. T he
planned project objectives are supportive of the objectives of the water policy through education,
awareness and training on better agricultural practices, effective and efficient utilization of water, water
conservation, and application of agrochemicals to minimize pollution of water sources to mention a
few.
4.1.5   Forest Policy of 1998
The main objective of the National Forestry Policy is to enhance contribution of the forestry sector in
sustainable socio-economic development of the country, as well as conservation and management of
the natural resource-base for the benefit of both the represent and future generations. In view of the
general objective, the policy focuses its intervention in the following four area (i) forestland
management
Conservation of the forestry resources in the upper catchment is crucial for ensuring sustainable flows
of water for irrigation purposes and other uses. The establishment of the scheme is thus an extra
incentive for undertaking conservation measures in the catchment area of Mt. Meru.
4.1.6  Wildlife Policy of 1998
The main Wildlife Policy is to seek involvement of a broader section of the society in wildlife
conservation, and in particular the rural local communities, as well as the private sector with only a
role of stimulating and duly guiding both the rural local communities and the private sector by
administering, r egulating a nd p romoting management o f wildlife r esources. I n view o f t his general
objective, the policy facilities it interventions in the following area: (i) wildlife protection (i.e.
incorporating management and development of protected areas) (ii) wildlife utilization (i.e.
incorporating promotion of establishment of Wildlife Management Areas conservation as well as
management measures and (iii) intemational corporation and coordination. Within the scheme, there
are no wildlife management areas. The developments have also concentrated on the already existing
scheme, with therefore little likelihood of encroaching into wildlife areas.
4.1.7  Energy Policy of 2002 (Draft)
Sufficient and efficient supply of energy is crucial for national development. The objective of the
energy policy is therefore to contribute to the national socio-economic development process by
providing an efficient energy production, procurement, transportation, distribution and end-use system
in an environmentally sound manner and with due regard to gender issues.
Provision of energy for scheme farmers in a convenient manner will allow more time for women
farmers to participate in farm activities. It is against this background that communities are being
encouraged to use fuel-efficient charcoal and wood stoves.
23



4.2     LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The smallholder irrigation project will be implemented in the overall context legal framework that
govemns agricultural and rural development. Some of the few legal frameworks that are supportive of
the project include but not limited to:-
4.2.1   Environment Legislation
Currently Tanzania lacks a single comprehensive environmental legal framework or environmental
law. Efforts are underway to prepare such a framework. To-date, the management of environment and
natural resources is governed by fragmented sectoral pieces of legislation that are yet to be fully
harmonized.
There are some guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Govemunent is
working on an act to make ElAs mandatory for all development projects. In this regard, an
enviromnuental legislation aimed at "promoting and managing environmental conservation in the
country" is in the making
The term "environmental" legislation incorporates nearly one hundred acts and ordinances and several
additional subsidiary legislation from all sectors of the economy, which affect the environment.
However, given the broad policy goal of achieving sustainable development and the specific policy
objectives, issues of unsustainable utilization of resources, deforestation, desertification, salinization,
land degradation, pollution of water resources, and impacts on rural land use have been emphasized.
The design and operational strategy of the Kambi ya Tanga scheme have taken these legal
considerations into account.
4.2.2  NEMC Act no.19 of 1983
This act establishes the National Environment Management Council as a statutory body responsible for
advising and coordinating environmental management issues. Among the many functions of the
Council, the act seeks to provide a framework for evaluation of existing and proposed development
policies, programmes, plans and activities of both public and private that are likely to affect the
environment and recommend measures to ensure adequate account of environrnental effects.
Furthermore, the act provides for the specification of environmental standards, norms, criteria, and
guidelines for the protection and maintenance of the quality of the environment, cooperation between
government, local authorities and bodies engaged in environmental programmes and stimulate public
and private participation in environmental and natural resource management.
Relevant legislation pertaining to agricultural development in general, and irrigation in paiticular and
how it relates to the proposed projects, including Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme was examined
and the following are the sectoral environment legislations.
4.2.3  Land Act no. 4 and Village Land Act no. 5 of 1999
Both laws became operational in May 2001, following the approval of their regulations. The acts seek
control land use and clarify controversial issues pertaining to ownership of land and land-based
resources, transactions on land and land administration. The new land act identifies thu-ee categories of
land i.e. village (customary land); public/gazetted land (i.e. national parks, forest reserves) and general
land that does not fall in any of the above two categories for private investment.
Implementation of the project is consistent with both legislations. For purposes of controlling land in
the village and protecting it from alienation to foreign investors, village governments would be given
documents indicating their boundaries. However, in order to give value to land there is a need for
completion of the process of land survey and demarcation, which amounts to land, titling and allocation
to different land use categories to speed up investment in agriculture.
Land allocation at the Kambi ya Tanga scheme was guided by existing land tenure aiTangements that
are in line with these legal provisions. Both men and women have received irrigation plots.
24



4.2.4   Wildlife Act 1974 (with amendments of 1978)
Wildlife act provides for protection, conservation, development, regulations and control in both
acquisition and utilization of products of both fauna and flora. To this end, therefore the Act stipulates
"modus operandi", i.e. required restrictions in the following areas (i) in protected areas: namely game
reserves, game controlled areas, partial game reserves, national parks, etc. (ii) proper procedures in
hunting, capturing and photographing of wildlife and (iii) proper handling of trophies. Furthermore, in
the wake of the Wildlife policy, which stipulates for villagers' involvement in Wildlife Management
Areas (WMA), the Act also provides modalities and procedures for designation, operation and
involvement of local communities in the management of the WMAs. Within the scheme, there are no
wildlife management areas.
4.2.5   Water Acts of 1974
As mentioned before the Water Acts principally seek to ensure that water is utilized without sectoral
conflicts, and without causing pollution. This is the spirit of both Act no. 42 of 1974 and Act no. 10 of
1981. They were enacted to control and protect water resources. The legislation defines "water" as all
water flowing over the surface of the ground or contained or flowing in or from a spring or stream or
natural lake, swamp or beneath a watercourse. The Act places a regime of water rights to govem
access to water use. Pollution control nomis and standards are embodied in the water rights.
Apart from incorporating pollution control and having prevention conditionality in the water rights,
the Act goes a step further by putting in place a regime in consent with discharge of effluent. Under
Section 15 A (1) of the Act, no person may discharge of effluent from any commercial, industrial or
other trade waste systems into receiving waters without a consent duly granted by a Water Officer.
The Act also contains two schedules, which set standards for receiving waters and effluent. The
Kambi ya Tanga irrigation has a water right in which the rights and obligations of scheme operators,
the farmers, are stipulated.
4.2.6   Forest Act 1974
The Forest Act deals with the protection of forests and forest products in forest reserves, restrictions,
and prohibitions in forest reserves. The forest management plans are administered under the Forest
Ordinance (1957). Any contravention of the restrictions and prohibition is considered an offence under
this ordinance and subject to enforcement. However, the law is being revised to meet new
requirements under a new Forest Policy. There is no forestland within the scheme area.
4.2.7   The Town and Country Planning Ordinance, Cap 378 of 1956
The Town and Country Planning Ordinance Cap 378, Part IV provides for control of urban
development while implementing a scheme of land development. Important aspects include the
designation and allocation of adequate land for solid waste disposal in any urban scheme. The law
further stipulates the design of a good sewerage system to manage liquid waste from various major
water consumers. The law empowers local authorities to enforce such schemes and punishments as
stipulated in the Act. The law further empowers neighbours and any individual to take to court anyone
who injuriously affects others due to his/her unhygienic activities. The Water Users' Association at the
scheme may p ass b y-laws t o this e ffect. H owever, they would need support from I ocal authorities,
particularly with regard to enforcement.
4.2.8   Local Government Act (District and Urban Authorities) Acts of 1982
This Act provides detailed responsibility for urban and district councils in the administration of their
day-to-day activities. Waste management is pointed out as one of the activities to be managed by
urban authorities. This Act is the backbone of the Village Government's operation, powers,
responsibilities of various local authorities and structure. The law requires that the Village Assemblies
act as the apex authorities in decision-making processes at the village level. However, such meetings
rarely take place in most villages, leaving decisions to be made by few leaders without having
consulted with the village public. This being the case, many Village Governments fail to bring about
development for their villagers.
25



4.2.9  Land Use Planning Commission Act of 1984
The National Land Use Conmmission (NLUC) was established under this Act as the principal advisory
organ of the Government on all matters related to land use. Among other things, it recommends
measures to ensure that the Government policies, including those for development and conservation of
land are in harmony. It also takes adequate account of their effects on land use and seeks for the
advancement of scientific knowledge of changes in land use; it encourages the development of
technology to prevent, or minimi-ize adverse effects that endanger man's health and his/her welfare; it
also specifies standards, norms and criteria for the protection of beneficial uses and the maintenance of
the quality of the land.
In accordance with the functions mentioned above, the Commission can indirectly help to prevent or
minimize pollution by restricting location of potential and actual pollutioni sources. The major issue is
the sectoralisation of the Govermnent's operations while neglecting holistic view of each activity on
land and their impacts on others. There is a tendency of each sector making decisions without
consulting t he o thers. F or e xample, W ildlife D ivision c an d esignate an a rea for g ame conservation
without consulting the Agriculture and Food Security Divisions to avoid grabbing land for agriculture
activities.
The Kambi ya Tanga scheme is included in the National Irrigation Development Plan, which has been
officially adopted by the Government.
4.2.10 The Land Acquisitions Act of 1967
The L and A cquisition A ct g ives p owers t o t he P resident t o t ake " land" from p rivate o ccupants f or
public purposes when the public's interests to do so. The new Land laws declare all land in Tanzania
as "Public Land" and vested to the President as trustee of all citizens. However, the Land Acquisition
law has been watered down by the New Land Laws, which restrict the President's powers not to
acquire land without negotiation with the owners. Again, the new laws stipulate detailed
compensations to be paid on any acquired land that amounts to deterring the President to do so without
careful considerations.
4.2.11 By-Laws
All villages in Tanzania are allowed to form by-laws. This has been done in Kambi ya Tanga village
whose by-laws address proper use of land and water to ensure public health.
4.3    NATIONAL STRATEGIES
In order to guide national development more effectively and systematically, Tanzania has prepared a
number of strategies aiming at operationalizing the various policies in key sectors. Some of the
strategies that have a bearing on irrigation development and discussed below include the Government
Vision 2025, Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Rural Sector Development Strategy and the
Agricultural Sector Development Strategy.
4.3.1  Government Development Vision 2025
The Government Development Policy 2025 is guiding framework for national development to the year
2025. It aims at achieving a high quality livelihood for the people, characterized by sustainable and
equitable growth. It also aims at attaining good governance through the nile of law and at developing a
strong and competitive economy by moving from a less developed country (LDC) to a middle-income
country by 2025.
Scheme irrigation committees and water users' associations are potential nuclei for promoting good
governance and democratic practices in rural villages. By adhering to common practices and cropping
pattems, farmers will realize higher incomes.
26



4.3.2   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of 2000
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) concentrates on efforts aimed reducing income poverty;
improving human capabilities, survival and social well-being. The PRSP has set medium term goals to
be achieved by the year 2010 through sustaining macroeconomic stability, rural s ector developmnent
and export, and private sector development.
Improvement of food supply and security is key to infant and matemnity health as well as to income
generation. A number of activities, including construction and consultancy services have been
performed by the private sector. This has contributed to local capacity building.
4.3.3   Rural Sector Development Strategy (RDS) of 2000
The Strategy aims at reducing rural poverty as means of managing resources sustainably, since
widespread poverty in rural areas compels people, in search for survival, to over-exploit the natural
resources. The RDS envisages the following:
*   Revising legislation and regulations with a view to enhancing community participation in
management and utilization of natural resources.
*   Revising the licensing procedures related to utilization of natural resources.
*   Introducing procedures for cost and benefit sharing of natural resources.
*   Introducing EIA as a pre-requisite for all development projects.
*   Developing procedures for natural resources with regard to entitlement of the state, communities
and individuals.
*   Developing procedures for conflict resolution in matters of natural resources utilization.
The Kambi ya Tanga scheme will contribute to the principle objective of the RDS of poverty reduction
thuough raising incomes and better resource utilization. The work of the water users' association
involves a number of elements targeted by the Strategy.
4.3.4  Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) of 2001
The ASDS, which was formulated through a broad based consultative process, aims at transforming the
agricultural sector into a m odemized, commercial, highly productive and profitable sector that shall
utilize natural r esources i n a sustainable manner a nd sh all a ct a s a n e ffective b asis f or i ntersectoral
linkages.
The ASDS will address the key weaknesses facing the agricultural sector, which include low
productivity, poor coordination and limited capacity, underdeveloped supporting facilities, erosion of
the natural resource base, inappropriate technology, dependency on rain fed agriculture, impediments
to food market access as well as low public and private expenditure levels.
The investments and other interventions made in improving the irrigation system at Kambi ya Tanga
are highly relevant and well in line with the targets of the ASDS. These improvements will contribute
to higher productivity, income generation, better water and land utilization, all of which are targets of
the Strategy.
4.4 COMPLIANCE WITH WORLD BANK SAFEGUARD POLICIES
A list of World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies is listed in Appendix 2. This part of
the report contains an analysis of the compliance of the Kambi ya Tanga scheme with the Bank
Safeguard policies. It is based on intensive field observation by the study team, during which
discussions were held with the farmers and other local people, Village and District officials and project
staff. The report is also based on the review of various existing documents.
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)
In order to ascertain that project proposals submitted for funding are environmentally sound and
sustainable, the Bank requires environmental assessment (EA) of the proposals. An Environmental
Assessment (EA) of Kambi ya Tanga Scheme was carried out as part of the overall base line study of
27



the scheme. The assessment also built on the work done earlier by the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU)
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.
The findings of the study were discussed with farmers and their leaders at meetings held at the scheme
and with District officials. Their opinions and ideas were taken into account in finalizing the
Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan.
The farmers, through their cooperative society and with support from extension staff are responsible for
implementation of the recommended mitigation measures in accordance with the Environmental and
Social Management Plan.
The rehabilitation will improve the iiTigation efficiency from the earlier estimated rate of between 10
and 20% to 30%. The improved system, together with fuirther farmers' training in water management
and scheme maintenance, plus the effectiveness of the Water Users' Association will result in use of
less irrigation water.
From the above-mentioned observation the Kambi ya Tanga Irrigation Scheme is considered to be in
compliance with the Bank Environmental Assessment.
Natural Habitat (OP/BP 4.04)
Kambi ya T anga irrigation sc heme i s a relatively o ld e stablished s cheme. I t has o nly recently b een
rehabilitated and improved. It expansion is restricted on all four sides in an extensively cultivated areas.
There are therefore no neighbouring natural habitats that require protection and conservation. The
scheme does not therefore trigger this safeguard policy of the Bank.
Pest Management (OP 4.09)
Use of pesticides at the Kambi ya Tanga scheme is currently at low level. The farmers, thu-ough the
extension service, are encouraged to apply IPM approaches. Farmers are also trained on the safe use,
storage and disposal of chemicals. These efforts will lead to greater compliance with the Integrated Pest
Management policy of the Bank.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
Kambi ya Tanga is an old scheme which been rehabilitated. The scheme farmers have been living in
the area since the end of the World War II, when they migrated to the area, the place was only
bushland. There was therefore no resettlement undertaken. The scheme does not trigger the Involuntary
Resettlement safeguard policy.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)
The farmers of Kambi ya Tanga Irrigation Scheme belong to different ethnic groups, where mainly are
Waarusha, Wachagga, Wapare, Wanyiramba and Wanyaturu. They are permanently settled in the area.
These are not considered as indigenous people in the sense of this safeguard policy. There is full
compliance with this policy.
Forests (OP/BP 4.36)
The ilTigation scheme has no potential impacts on forested areas. The scheme may not trigger by this
Safeguard policy.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37)
There are no large dams upstream of Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme. The scheme does not trigger
this policy.
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03 - draft OP 4.11)
The scheme does not have movable or immovable objects, sites, natural features and landscapes that
have archaeological, palaentological, historical, architectural, religious, aesthetic, or cultural
significance. Therefore, the scheme is not triggered by this safeguard policy.
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50)
The scheme is using Kikuletwa River which does not flow to other states. It is not therefore triggered
by this safeguard policy.
28



Project in Disputed Areas (OP[BP 7.60)
The scheme is not in disputed areas and it does not therefore trigger this safeguard policy.
Consultation and Disclosure Requirements (BP 17.50)
The baseline study findings and recommendations have been discussed with farmers' representatives at
the scheme. They endorsed these findings and recommendations. The revised Environmental Audit
report will be submitted to the relevant government authorities for review and approval prior to the
disclosure through newspapers, district offices, Kilimo and government websites.
29



5.0 TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES USED IN ASSESSING AND
ANALYZING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
5.1     INTRODUCTION
There are several tools and techniques recommended for prediction of environmental and social
impacts:
* Checklists
* Interaction matrixes
* Networks
* Geographical Information Systems
* Mathematical modelling
Checklists
The environmental checklist is used for physical observations in the assessment of the irrigation
scheme.
In undertaking the assignment, the following tools and techniques were applied for assessing and
analyzing of environmental and social impacts of the irrigation scheme in the process of the EA study:
Geographic Information system (GIS)
GIS has been used in analysing hydrological changes and trends in water quality and soil study of the
ilTigation scheme.
5.2     IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Impact assessment is a complex activity and mainly utilizes a wide range of baseline data. Depending
on available baseline data, many techniques can be applied to the study:
* Mathematical models (such as groundwater and river models, noise propagation models, air and
water dispersion models, income multipliers)
* Physical models (such as hydrological models for trend analysis, wind tunnels and hydraulic
models for estuaries)
* Scientific experience, judgment and observations
*   Structured/semi-structured approaches (e.g. changes in landscape and social impacts)
Impacts analysis and assessment must also provide information on the following aspects:
* Duration (time period over which they will occur)
* Likelihood or probability of occurrence (very likely or unlikely, etc.)
* Reversibility (natural recovery or aided by human intervention)
* Area affected (size and whether near or far from the project)
* Number (and characteristics) of people likely to be affected and their locations
* Trans-boundary aspects (whether impacts cross-national borders)
Due to a lack of baseline data and time constraints, the consultant was not able to conduct an impact
assessment utilizing mathematical and physical models. For environmental and social impacts,
structured/semi-structured approaches, focused group discussions, scientific experience, observations,
judgment, and GIS were used to quantify and evaluate impacts.

6.0 CONSULTATIONS WITH COMMUNITY AND FARMERS
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Meeting
During the environmental auditing meetings held at district, village and scheme levels. At the village
level the govermment leaders and the irrigators' association leaders participated in the meetings. The
major aim of this meetings include the brief purpose of the environmental auditing, but also to
understand the District Development Plan how it has tackled environmental at social issue in the
iirigation scheme, while at the village level the major aim was not only to brief on the purpose of the
environmental audit but to understand the major environmental and social problems and how to
mitigate them.
On the 28th August 2003 the acting District Executive Director of Arumeru was met by the team prior
to field visit to the Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme. The team has also held meeting with the Arutsha
water office for the Pangani river data. At the same day we held a meeting with the Kambi ya Tanga
government leaders and farmers at the scheme office. There were about four members including the
village chairperson, secretary of the scheme, one farmer and extension officer.
Focused Group discussion
The Kambi ya Tanga irrigation focus group discussions was conducted separately for groups of men,
women, and the youth. In doing so it was noted that each group uniquely presented and prioritized their
major problems.
Participants
The Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme participants comprised of eleven (11) women, twenty-three (23)
men, and thirty-four (34) youths, thus totaling sixty-eight (68).
6.2 MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY
STAKEHOLDERS: MEN DISCUSSION
Water related diseases
The scheme has got chronic water diseases such as amoeba, typhoid and malaria. This is because there
is no any safe and clean water for domestic use, but also people lack health education and they use
unclean water. This has increased water related diseases and farmers become weak and therefore low
production.
Dust
Most of the scheme roads generate dust especially when animals and vehicles pass through. This
creates a lot of dust in the environment, which has increased respiratory infection diseases, for example
tuberculosis and coughing symptoms.
Soil erosion
The farmers explained the absence of proper bridge and crossing f or both human and I ivestock h as
increase the rate of soil erosion but also the problem of unlined canals and floods during rain season
has influence soil erosion too. The effects include destruction of infrastructures.
Lack of agricultural inputs
In this scheme inputs are very expensive and sometimes are not available at the scheme area, hence this
has created increase in low production and income.
Deforestation
In the scheme there are no alternative sources of energy, but also no environmental conservation
training/education. The effects are little amount of water is available for ilrigation; erosion has
increased due to the destruction of the river and canal banks.
31



Canals destruction
Canal destruction occurs due to number of livestock, type of the soil but also other farmers cultivate
up-to canal banks. Poor cleaning of the canals has also reduce water availability in the field and cause
water related diseases due to stagnant water example; malaria.
Lack of knowledge
In the scheme there is inadequate ilTigation extension services, but also poor farmer participation in the
meeting. This has major effect on the income and production in general.
Lack of market
There is a weak farmers organisation and hence the major effect include low prices and farmers are
discouraged to produce more.
Youth discussion
Soil erosion of canal banks
There i s I ivestock i ntrusion t o i rrigation c anals s earching for water, t his has c reate a ccumulation o f
sands in canals (siltation)
Water shortage
In this scheme there is shortage of water during the dry season while wastage of water during the rain
season.
Scarcity of lands
The population of the scheme is increasing and the effects are high number of youth unemployed have
been observed, thus the villager government is responsible to allocate land any time when it will be
available.
Lack of safe water
The water system is no longer functioning and also there is inadequate water and sanitation education
to most farmers, The effects include increase incidence of water related disease example; typhoid,
schistomiasis, cholera and amoeba.
Deforestation
This has major source of environmental degradation, therefore tree planting and environmental
education is need to control moreover there is a need to introduce other energy alternative
sources.(where ? how much?)
Lack of Market
There is umueliable market due to bad roads condition; hence farmers get loss especially with
vegetables crops goods.
Lack of capital
In the scheme there is no any credit facilities or institutions, therefore they lack of ability to purchase
inputs and hence low production, therefore they decide to establish SACCOs done by farmers
themselves immediately.
Increase of Human diseases
There are common disease such as typhoid, schstomiasis, cholera and malaria. This is because there is
lack of clean and safe water; lack of sanitation and health education. Hence there is increase of death
rate and loss of labour.
Environmental degradation
This is caused by excessive and incorrect use of agrochemicals within the scheme and upstream, but
also floods during the rain season favour the condition. The impacts include waterborne disease.
Inadequate extension services
The scheme has poor extension services, which cause low production.
32



Siltation in canals
This problem has been caused by livestock drinking in the canals but also degradation in the upland has
lead to soil erosion with sediments loads entering the canals.
Water conflict.
This is caused by scarcity of water during the dry season and hence low production therefore they
suggest to reduce area of production and abstract water according to water right, which will be
supervised by MBUKITA.
Plant pest and disease
The farmers do lack knowledge of capital and it's source, hence they face low production the meeting
planned to find the capital sources and will be done by MBUKITA and District council in collaboration
with Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.
Thefts of agricultural products and livestock
The problem has raised due to the high unemployment of young age group, many of which were
previously where employed at Mbuguni Mining hence this has created poverty among the majority of
youth and theft is their immediate solution, therefore there is a need to enforce by-laws to take care of
the problem which will be done by the village government and MBUKITA.
Government leaders' discussion
In general this scheme does have a total of 600 hacters and a total number of 600 farmers whereby 165
farmers are from Msitu wa Mbogo, 450 Kambi ya Tanga while Kikuletwa do have 68 farmers.
The upstream of this scheme do comprise of the following users Kamo mama, Arku, Kwaugoro,
Kipilipili Duhuli Estate and Usa while at the downstream has Patanumbe, Shamuma (mbuguni shango),
Makiba, Naisinye (mererani)
The Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme formally had problems with siltation but after the rehabilitation
and with the presence of the furrows, the drainage has reduced the siltation up to 90%.
Moreover, after the rehabilitation the amount of water has increased and allows most fields to be
irrigated easily together with the help of the gate control. Therefore, because of the availability of water
the production per acre has also increased from 7-10 bags of maize per acre to 15-20 bags per acre, the
water is not the only factor but also farmers training, extension services, improved plant spacing and
water management. The scheme has been having services from the world vision concerning the use of
Mijingu phosphate, planting techniques for their crops and the harvesting technique. However there are
some problems associated with the scheme improvement.
Lack of inputs
In this scheme they are facing problem of high prices of inputs, it is approximate to have up to
16,000/= per bag, and most farmers can only afford to buy only 10 kilos which do not fulfil the
requirement per production area.
Pollution
The upstream users have been draining the excess water, which is contaminated with chemicals, to the
river which c reates water p ollution, t his i s d one mostly b y t he b ig e state a nd n ot t he sm all f armers
because their excess water does not poured back to the river.
Water shortage
The upstream users take high amount of water, and at the same time there are illegal water users who
take the water during the night and create water shortage to downstream users especially at the scheme
level.
Water borne disease
The scheme do not have any source for the domestic water, hence the rely on the water from the river,
but also the water table for this scheme is to high and the water found is easily contaminated, because
of the coffee growers who usually spray chemicals which are easily washed and enter to the near by
water and the river in general.

This chapter presents a brief description of identified enviromnental and social impacts of the irrigation
scheme. The impacts are based on changes, which have or are expected to occur, prior or post
improvement of the scheme. Attempts have been made to indicate both positive as well as negative
impacts, but for the sake of preparing an effective Environmental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP), negative impacts have featured more than positive impacts. The impacts may also be
categorized (based on localities) as follows
*   Upstream and downstream impacts
*   Scheme level impacts
7.2 UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS
7.2.1    Demographic trend (population changes)
As mentioned earlier, farmers in Kambi ya Tanga reside within the farms; this, therefore, creates
serious land use competition for agriculture (both rain-fed and irrigated), human settlements, and
35



social/economic infrastructure d evelopment. As t he p opulation i ncreases d ue t o n atural r egeneration
and inumigration, a severe land scarcity is likely to emerge. This calls for better land and water
management and sound participatory land use planning in order to optimise the use and productivity of
the existing land.
*   The scheme draws beneficiaries from Msitu wa Mbogo, Mbuguni and Kikuletwa villages.
According to results of the population census of 2002, the population of Mbuguni ward was 14,880
(7853 nmale and 7027 female). However, according to an assessing improvement report of 1998,
the population of the villages around the scheme was 6276. The breakdown is:
*   Kambi ya Tanga: 2812
*   Kikuletwa: 1917
*   Msitu wa Mbogo: 1547
Population figures of other villages of Mbuguni ward could not be obtained. In any case, it is evident
that there is rapid population growth in the area. The growth is believed to be due to improved
agriculture and the presence of Tanzanite mining at Mererani.
Upstream of this scheme, there are big coffee and flower estates (Kamo Mama, Arku, Kwaugoro,
Kipilipili, Duhuli, and Usa). Downstream, the estates of P atanumbe, Shamuma (Mbuguni Shango),
Makiba, Naisinye (Mererani) are found. The upstream estates are causing various problems:
*   High levels of water pollution are created because of the large amounts of agrochemicals and
fertilizers used in the coffee and flower farms.
*   Water shortages are created downstream due to the high amounts of water off-take. The upstream
farmers illegally off-take water at night.
7.2.2  Hydrological changes
As shown in the variability analysis table for the major tributaries of Kikuletwa, it appears there is a
hydrological regime change in some of the tributaries. The Tengeru flow has decreased over time from
a mean of 1.7 m3/s (1978-1979) to I m3/s (1980-1989) to 0.67 m3/s (1990s). The same change was
experienced with Maji ya chai. Other tributaries have either few records or showed a tendency of
increased flow as is the case for the Usa River. Further analysis of Tengeru River shows that the annual
flow reductions was most visible in the months of May, June and October (Figure 7.1).

7.2.3   Catchment degradation
Although it wvas not possible to quantitatively establish the rate at which1 deforestation is takinig place
upstream. it is clearly evident that the natural forests are disappearing very fast. The catchment of the
Kambi va Tanga scheme incorporates upstreami areas as far away as the Mt. Meru upland areas that lie
about 50 kin northwest of the scheme. Catchinent degradation of the sclheme, therefore. encomipasses
suchI places as Mt. Meru and all schemes that lie on the wA ay before the Kikulet-wa River reaches the
Kambi ya Tanga scheme for a distance of about 50 km. In v-ie  of the extensive social-economic
activities along the pathl catcluhient degradation in the area is quite likely to continue: but at the same
time. since this is also the area in wlhich activities of other controlling authorities focus their wvork (e.g
Pangani River BasiwL Tanizania National Parks. etc) solutions to amn arising problems can easily be
found.

The salinity is 0.2 % thiroughout the entire schemie. TDS ranges betwveen 164.1 mig/i to 165,1 mng/I.
This is fresi water that has started to show sigas of degradation. This fact is fnrther supported by low
values of total ihardness (32-68 mg/e as CaCOl). The turbidite ranges from 19 NTU to 32 NTU. The
colour of the water is appreciably elevated (83-132 Haze/s). The water is also relatively organicallf
polluted wiith chiemiical oxygen demanid (COD) shiowinig elevated lev-els (140-372 mng/I). though thecse
are generally considered to be normal values for irrigatiol schemes. Faecal conitamiation level ranges

7.2.5  Socio-economic impacts on downstream users
Activities including washing, cultivation along the river, and livestock rearing are contributing to water
pollution for downstream users who depend on the river for domestic and other purposes. The top ten
diseases upstream/downstream for above and below 5 years of age are depicted in the following tables:

7.3 IRRIGATION LEVEL IMPACTS
7.3.1   Soil Quality
Four representative soil samples were collected from Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme to evaluate
physical and chemical properties of the soil. Special attention was given to the checking of the
presence of salinity as well as soil trends. This is due to the fact that the top soil layer where the roots
concentrate for all crops. The sample sites and results of the soil tests are shown in the table and map
below.

The upstream soils are very alkaline over the whole farm (i.e. pH 8.3-8.5). This is related to the
presence of high levels of calcium, magnesium and sodium contents in the soil. Soils of test site No. 4
have moderately sodic soils. Soil fertility ranges from very low to medium.
7.3.2  Water quality and trends
Water quality results for samples collected from Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme are presented in the
table below. The pH ranged between 7.13 and 8.51, which is near the neutral pH band. The dissolved
oxygen (DO) ranged from 7.04 mg/I to 7.55 mg/l, indicating good aeration and might be fairly low in
organic pollution. The salinity and total dissolved solids (TDS) values of the incoming water (measured
from the intakes) indicate that the water used for irrigation is fresh and very suitable for that matter.
The salinity is 0.2% throughout the entire scheme, while TDS range between 164.1 mg/l to 165.1 mg/I.
This is fresh water that has started to show signs of degradation. This fact is further supported with low
values of total hardness (32-68 mg/l as CaCO3).
Attention should be paid to the control of human excreta upstream and within the farms.

7.3.3  Pesticide and fertilizer use
Farmers utilize to a significant degree farmyard manure in fertilizer use, where as, the use both
biological and pest control methods. Maintaining certain levels of water is working to suppress some
weeds. About 48% of the farmers are using manure while 31% use a combination of manure and
industrial fertilizers.

7.3.4  Waterborne diseases
Malaria is the leading disease in Kambi ya Tanga, followed by diarrhoea and urinary problems. From
the table below, high rates of malaria are observed between March and June (i.e. during the main rainy
season and during the short rains from November to December). During the dry season, malaria cases
are relatively low. Outbreaks of diarrhoea are often associated with the quality of water the villagers
use for domestic purposes. The village conmmunity members depend on water from the irrigation canals
and rivers for domestic use. Activities taking place in the river such as drinking, washing and bathing
are contributing in one way or another to the increased cases of waterborne diseases.

7.3.5  Drinking water and quality of sanitation
Most of the villagers (68.8%) use the irrigation canal as their water source for drinking. Other sources
are: river, rainwater harvesting, groundwater, etc. The survey report indicates that 5% of households
have no toilets; 20% have toilets but in poor condition; 75% have good toilets.

Downstream of Kambi ya Tanga at Mbuguni village, villagers are using water from the canals and a
locally dug well. About 30% of the villagers use water from the dug well and 70% use water from the
canals. Before, there was taped water from Tengeru, but due to leaking pipes and no regular
maintenance, the water is no longer reaching Mbuguni.
According to Doctor Noha, who is the medical officer in charge of the area, there are so many patients
that staff c annot a dequately attend t o t he n eeds o f p atients. M ost o f the p atients a re su ffering f rom
waterbome diseases because they are drinking untreated water from the river and the locally dug well.
Before, there was a standard well made by SCAPA, but it has since gone into disrepair. Sanitation in
this village is poor because some villagers do not have normal pit latrines or the pit latrines have been
built too close to the dug well, thereby contaminating the drinking water.
7.3.6  Socio-economic: positive and negative impacts of villages within the scheme
Positive impacts
The scheme at Kambi Ya Tanga is found to be operating well. There have not been any complaints
about the rehabilitated system. The Bwana Shamba and other fanmer groups have informed the team
that productivity has increased from 7-10 bags of maize prior to rehabilitation to 15-20 bags of maize
per acre after. Additional factors responsible for the increased productivity include: farmer training,
upgraded extension services, improved plant spacing regimes, and better water management practices.
Other positive impacts are:
Positive impacts
*   Trained farmers
*   Increased income
*   Better organized farmers (e.g. development of cooperative society, and savings and credit
schemes)
*   Women groups established
*   Improved seed varieties introduced
*   Better housing created
*   Closer water accessibility for the community
44



* Increased crop production (from 7-10 to 15-20 bags per acre)
* Extension services improved
*   Broader institutional interest in the scheme (e.g. World Vision's promotion of Minjingu Rock
Phosphate)
*   Improved socio-economic infrastructure (e.g. establishment of conmmercial centres)
* Reduced siltation
*   Better organized village government (e.g. maintenance of school, roads, and in-igation canals)
Negative impacts
* Impediment to movement for humans and cattle
* Increase in malaria and other waterbome infections
* Conflict over water use between irrigators and upstream and downstream users
* High population density increases the level of water pollution in the canals through the washing of
clothes and bathing. Use of agrochemnicals and fertilizers in the scheme, which are subsequently
washed away, enter watercourses causing potential health problems for people. The pollution risk
is greater and greatest for people living within the scheme area and downstream respectively.
* Deforestation in the area is deteriorating air quality from increased levels of dust.

8      IDENTIFIED MITIGATION MEASURES
8.1 INTRODUCTION
This section presents a brief description of the identified impacts and subsequent mitigation measures.
The description addresses itself to three categories of identified impacts as presented in previous
chapter, as well as four categories of identified mitigation measures. The categories of identified
impacts include the following:
* Impacts in up-stream areas of scheme
* Impacts at scheme areas
* Impacts in down areas of schemes
Furthermore, the categories of identified mitigation measures include the following:
* Environmental management
*   Enhancement of social -economic activities
* Improving health situation
* Revisiting engineering designs and /or construction.
8.2 UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM
8.2.1   Environmental Management
In general, environmental management involves adoption of integrated approaches in natural resources
management. The mitigation measures, among others, include:
* Soil and water conservation
* Afforestation /reforestation
* Enforcement of regulations in abstraction of water resources.
* Establishment of mechanisms for resolution of conflicts
Upstream rivers' watersheds are increasingly subjected to threats due to various human activities,
(farmring, cutting trees and human settlement development). Their ecological balance and functions are
in danger. There is, therefore an urgent need to establish sub-catchment watershed management
programmes for these rivers, including the protection of the natural springs are protected form human
interference, with to maintaining river water low volumes on a sustainable basis.
The watershed management programme should encompass:
*   Community forestry management
* Agro-forestry approaches
* Enacting and enforcing by-laws
* Provision of alternative sources of livelihoods (water and energy)
* Environmental training and campaigns
Introduction and promotion of energy-saving technology is another measure that could supplement
watershed management programme; e.g., efficient stoves, which can use rice husks and corn cobs
should be introduced to Kambi y a Tanga community to reduce fuel wood and charcoal demand for
domestic energy. This should go hand in hand with afforestation and reforestation activities.
Awareness campaigns on natural resources management should be conducted.
8.2.2  Enhancement of social economic activities
Enhancement of social-economic activities in general involves promotion of sustainable social -
economic activities.
46



Specifically, in up-stream areas of the Kambi ya Tanga scheme, the measures include promotion of
environmental consciousness in all social-economic activities. This should include establishment of
mechanisms, which should ensure controlled acquisition and appropriate land use practices.
In down -stream areas the villagers are not yet adequately conscious on high potential usefulness of
irigation agriculture as a social-economic activity. There is, therefore, the need for promoting this
activity through extension services.
8.3 IRRIGATION SCHEME LEVEL
8.3.1   Environmental management
At irrigation sheme level the key mitigation measures related to environnental management include:
water management, as well as embarking on training programs seeking to improve irrigation practice,
appropriate uses of agro-chemicals, etc.
Specifically, the following mitigation measures are proposed:
*   Training of farmers and village extension officers on good agronomic practices. Focus should be
on sustainable use of these natural resources.
*   Training of farmers in operation and maintenance of the irrigation system.
*   Conduct environmental awareness campaigns and education to all soil and water users.
*   Efficient water use management.
*   Improved soil fertility management- which includes application of both mineral and organic
fertilizers with measures that will raise soil fertility, e.g. limiting nutrient losses through leaching,
runoff, n itrification, i mproving t illage p ractices, manuring and u se o f g reen manure c rops, c rop
rotation and demand-driven mineral fertilizer application; testing and applying minimum amount
of mineral fertilizer at rates that replenish seasonal up-takings by plants
Moreover, apply proper crop husbandry and shifting cultivation such as reduce paddy production
during the dry season and substitute with drought resistant crops (e.g. beans) or high return
horticultural crops and revised and  revise cropping patter for the entire catchment every year
depending on the availability of water. Developing a robust inter and intra water allocation policy for
different growing season of the year is also recommended.
Establishing hydrological station in order to improve future availability of hydrological data.
8.3.2  Improving health situation
This category of measure should be relevant for identified impacts at both scheme level, as well as in
down-stream areas of the scheme.
One of the known environmental impacts of irrigation activities is spread of water bome diseases, e.g.
bilharziasis, dysentery, malaria, etc. Furthermore, expected influx of people, as irrigation agriculture
increases will mean that promiscuity will also arise. This calls for the need to embark on a program for
prevention of HIV/AIDS, as well as strengthening existing health and water supply services, as
appropriate. To reduce the vulnerability of the Kambi ya Tanga irrigation community to the water,
related diseases the following is recommended:
*   Health and sanitation campaigns should be conducted to sensitize the farming community on
transmission patterns of these water-related diseases and how to avoid contact with disease-
causing vectors.
*   Awareness raising among the community on the ecological requirements of different disease
vectors e.g. Anopheline mosquitoes and aquatic snails.
*   Irrigation canals should be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent development of favourable
habitats for vectors that transmit diseases.
47



8.3.3  Improving water quality
Mitigation measures to prevent or nmiinimize pollution at water sources, rivers and canals should be
undertaken; and these could include:
*   Special restrictions in the use of pesticides in areas with sensitive water resources, e.g. in the
vicinity of drinking water points/sources.
*   Control and regulation in handling, storage, application and disposal of agrochemical containers
*   Measurements of pesticide residues in irrigation canals, drains and rivers and in soils should be
carried out (once per year)
*   Record keeping of pesticides in use, application methods at all seasons
*   Adopt recommendations from TPRI regarding safe and correct handling, storage, application
(pesticide selection, timing, rate and methods) and disposal.
8.3.4   Revisiting engineering designs and/or construction stages.
This category of measure is relevant only at scheme level as well as for down-stream. The following
are proposed:
Aligning the main canal to reduce the water loss especially Mamba ya Tanga main canal
Providing proper levelling on farms to ensure continual flow

9.0 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
(ESMP)
9.1     INTRODUCTION
The mitigation measures proposed in the previous chapter represent the core findings of the EA and are
important elements in implementing the current improvement of the iirigation scheme and mitigating
potentially adverse social and environmental impacts. The Environmental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP) in the following sections presents:
*   Identification and summary of major anticipated adverse environmental impacts
* Description of mitigation measures
* Description of elements of monitoring program
* Institutional arrangement
* Implementation schedule for mitigation measures
* Performance monitoring and reporting procedures
* Cost estimates and sources of funds
The ESMP is based on the guidelines defined in the World Bank Operational Manual OP/BP 4.01.
9.2     OBJECTIVES
General objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the Kambi ya Tanga
irrigation scheme would be to promote sustainable and efficient iiTigation agricultural activities in the
area.
Specifically, the objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Plan for the Kambi ya Tanga
irrigation scheme are therefore mainly two-fold; namely:
(i) To promote sustainability of the schemes through:
*   Improving capacities, knowledge/skills,
*   Establishing/strengthening mechanisms for resolution of conflicts pertaining to uses of
natural resources especially water and land resources.
*   Establishing /strengthening mechanisms for enforcement of regulations for water
abstractions and pollution control
*   Strengthening local community leadership and effective mechanism  for control in
acquisition and uses of land resources.
(ii) To promote efficiency in irrigation agricultural activities, through:
*   Providing/educating on appropriate irrigation practices, e.g. on proper uses of agro-
chemicals, IPM approaches,
*   Strengthening implementation of water management concept.
*   Revisiting designing and construction stages of the scheme to assess the need for review
of the stages.

9.4 DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENTS OF MONITORING PROGRAM
Monitoring objectives
Monitoring refers to a systematic collection of data/information and due analysis, with the aim of
following up on the subsequent phenomena in the wake of implementation of the ESMP. Activities are
followed up, their status assessed, quantified and rectified accordingly. This process should be
considered as part of the ESMP. The District Council will keep a close eye on changing conditions and
keep records, as accurately as possible, to check, among others, on compliance with statutory
environmental protection provisions and World Bank Safeguard Policies.
Description of performance indicators that provide linkages to impacts and mitigation measures
in the EA
Water quality
Water quality will be monitored as follows:
51



*   The water quality of the Kikuletwa River will be assessed continuously to determine the overall
impact of, fertilizers, insecticides or pesticides used in the irrigation project and upstream
agricultural activities.
*   The water flow volume in the river will be measured through the established gauging stations.
Water balance modeling should be done for predication proposes. This exercise will help to assess
base flows, water yields, and hydrological characteristics of the catchment area.
Ground water
*   The ground water will be checked to determine salinity o f ground water as a result of project
operations.
*   The changes in pH of ground water will be monitored to check the impacts on ground water of the
various types of crops planted.
*   Changes i n I evels o f water t able will b e monitored i n s ample a reas o f c rops t hat c onsume t oo
much of ground water including the well-documented eucalyptus species.
Soil Conservation
Soil composition, texture and structure in the irrigation project area will be monitored in the sample
areas to determine impacts from various agricultural practices.
The fertility level of soils (i.e. nutrient concentration and soil moisture) in the sample crop areas will
be monitored to determine impacts from the planted crops. Changes in salinity, porosity, pH level and
types of biota in the soils will also be monitored in the sample crop areas. Alteration of these
parameters could be expected in cases where crops are grown alongside water or nutrient demanding
trees, which may consequently jeopardize the well being of the crops.
Biodiversity indicators
The following are pertinent indicators for catchment management: sedimentation rates, riverbank
erosion, flashfloods and deforestation rates. The District Natural Resource Office supported by other
stakeholder and RBM should monitor these.
Other important ecological parameters include vegetation; (i.e. both on dry land as well as on river
valleys); fish, (i.e. plankton, invertebrates); and birds, and other living organisms available in the area.
Crop Diseases
The type of diseases affecting planted trees will be monitored in the sample compartments to
detennine common diseases to various crops that will require special treatment in the next rotation of
crop farming or application of appropriate pesticides for treatment of the disease.
The most damaging crop pests, especially those that have caused extensive loss of production in the
farms in Tanzania will be monitored. The monitoring of emerging pests and insects in and around the
project area will help determine the most suitable disease control mitigation measure.
Afforestation
*   Provenance and species resistance to diseases and pests for planting in the community and
individual's forest plots within the project will be screened. Provenance and nursery plots will be
established. DBH and heights will be measured.
*   The amount of carbon and other greenhouse gases in the soils will be monitored in and around the
project area. The amount of greenhouse gases will be monitored to assess the impacts of forest
sequestration of greenhouse gases, especially carbon.
52



Socio-economic
The District Office should monitor the characteristics, activities and attitudes of the adjacent
communities in order to develop feasible extension programs. The major objectives will be to reduce
pressure on the irrigation area inter alia through encouraging alternative enterprises. The steps would
include:
*   Promoting agro-forestry in the local community farms.
*   Infrastructure development such as accessibility, marketing, education, health and other proposed
activities by the local community around the project area.
*   Net immigration monitoring of people in the local community. Population dynamics will be
monitored in sub-villages and around the project.
*   Fuel wood requirements for the local community will also be monitored to determine local
demand and develop possible strategies such as agro-forestry, community forest areas and
conservation of natural woodlands in the villages around the project.
Health indicators
The main health indicators to be monitored are water-bome diseases such as malaria and bilharzias.
Description of parameters to be measures, methods to be employed, sampling locations, frequency of
measurements, detection limits (where appropriate) and definition of thresholds that will signed the
need for remedial actions, institutional responsibilities, timing and timescales for monitoring,
Reporting aiTangements (to regulatory authorities and the Bank), and costs and financing provisions
are presented in the table below.

9.5    INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
The fundamental area for consideration is empowerment of existing administrative and
organisational arrangements. These include farmers, local comrnunities, both as a group as well
as in their individual capacities, in both upstream and downstream villages .The empowerment
has to be carried out through provision of capacity building, public awareness campaigns, tailor-
made training, etc.
As a strategic approach, SIIC should strengthen partnership among the Kambi ya Tanga
comnmunity in the use of water and land resources. Based on the adopted organisational-
structure and job descriptions of various committees to be established, for the operation of the
scheme, a framework should be established through which the stakeholders are able to actively
engaged in a dialogue aimed at equitable and sustainable use of the common resources.
56



The project should firstly embark on a programme of key and strategic activities that are part of the
above outlined Environmental and Social Management Plan and should enhance attainnmient of the
above objectives. More specifically, the following are proposed:
*   Hold meetings of various committees as per agreement
*   Assist: (i) to organise ward or district- based farmers' day,
And (ii) participation in local and national events like farmers day
*   Undertake joint study visits
9.6 INPUTS REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS

10. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.1 CONCLUSION
10.1.1. General conclusion
Based on review of baseline information, field visits to Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme and data
analyses, it is evident that there are environmental and social issues and impacts, which need to be
addressed in order to ensure sustainable and sound operation of the irrigation scheme. As outlined in
above chapters (among others), in up-stream areas of the scheme, the key issues constraining
sustainability are intensive up-stream socio-economic activities leading to extensive pollution of water
e.g. use of up-stream drainage water as source for the scheme. In within-scheme areas, the constraints
are general poor soil fertility. In down-stream area, sustainability is mainly constrained by inadequacy
of water and inappropriate irrigation practices. These impacts manifest either to upstream
enviroiulmental degradation, (particularly of the catchment area), or within-the-scheme impacts, (e.g.
due to inappropriate irrigation practices), or also in down -stream areas (due to uncontrolled water
abstractions) leading to community conflicts.
Baseline data with comprehensive benchmark parameters related to various studies like hydrogeology,
socio-economic, environment, water quality, etc. at catchment and irrigation levels were not available
in the area. Environment and social assessment impact requires "before and after" studies, and perhaps
experience from s imilar e nvironment t o facilitate a ssessment o f t he severity o f p erceived p roblems.
Quantification of impacts requires collection of data, understanding of process and analysis of results,
which take more time and resources.
Through ecosystem, farming system and participatory approaches, the key impacts were identified and,
as far, as was possible, quantified. Additionally, measures pertaining to prevention and/or control have
been proposed. An Environmental and Social Management Plan for the Kambi ya Tanga irrigation
scheme were developed.
10.1.2 Specific conclusions
Location
In conclusion, it was found that the location of the scheme enhances sustainability of the scheme. This
is because the scheme is located near rapidly growing settlements of Mererani (which has relatively
strong monetary strength) Mbuguni and Msitu wa Mbogo all of which have reliable transportation
services to Usa River, Arusha and Moshi where many marketing opportunities exist.
Bio-physical environment
The Kambi ya Tanga scheme lies in semi -arid area of Tanzania, where without irrigation, agriculture is
difficult to practice. It was therefore found in our conclusion that scheme improvement has been very
beneficial to the local community. With widespread realization of this fact, competition for uses of both
land and water resource uses is thence very stiff.
Socio-economic environment
Field observations indicated that local communities combine irrigation agriculture with several other
activities (especially mining) to enable them earn a living. In other words people practicing irrigation
at the scheme are those who have chosen to pursue dual socio-economic activities; namely: farming
and mining of tanzanite. In this way they cleverly balance the time they should work on their
farmlands, vis-a-vis the time they should spend searching for tanzanite.
62



Again field observations indicated that socio-culturally the people in the area are very hard working.
They are keen on their work both as iffigation agriculturists, as well as miners of tanzanite.
Identified impacts
In view of the above, therefore irrigation activities at the scheme are relatively intensive, and as such,
environmental and social impacts are relatively also significant.
Negative impacts
Negative impacts identified upstream of the Kambi ya Tanga scheme are hydrological changes, i.e. in
terms of e.g. change of regime of river flow, etc. The downstream impacts are water bome diseases and
poor socio-economic impacts on the community. Within the irrigation scheme, major impacts are soil
quality and waterbome diseases
Positive impacts
It is important that the positive aspects of development emerge, especially because these are what
motivate the people at village (farm) level and dictate the decisions that they take or those of others
whom are willing to have taken on their behalf.
Mitigation measures
A number of mitigation measures were proposed to address the identified impacts. As far as possible,
preventive management, measure should be given priority in combating soil and water pollution,
catchment degradation, and pollution of the rivers and disease control.
Compliance with the Tanzanian legislation and World Bank Safeguard Policies
The study team has demonstrated that the Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme is in compliance with the
Tanzanian legislation and policies, and World Bank Safeguard Policies.
10.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
Role of Local Government authorities
Most of the identified mitigation measures are related with local community-based effective structural
-organization. This means therefore that most of the measures can be implemented by local
government authorities themselves with financial and technical assistance of funded projects e.g.
.RBMSIIP, NGOs and CBOs.
Partnership building
By sharing experiences and information with other partners in the area could collaborate with these
stakeholders in implementation of environmental management interventions, which are relevant to the
Kambi ya Tanga irrigation scheme and others in Pangani River Basin.
In order to minimize water and land use conflicts, stakeholders of Pangani River Basin in general
should work together as partners to improve production and sustainable development of the watershed
management for the scheme's sustainable development.
Sinilar projects should develop institutional capacity arrangements geared towards sharing
responsibility (decision making) for catchment management plan and prevention management
activities in the Pangani River Basin. A partnership approach, however, also needs an appropriate
institutional framework, which clearly lays on the roles and responsibilities of each project, district
councils and stakeholders. Community and farmers participation could be solicited in the planning,
management, financing, construction and maintenance stages of catchment areas and receiving bodies.
63



Environmental and social impact management plan and monitoring
A participatory environmental and social impact plan and monitoring system has been developed for
the Kambi ya Tanga irrigation schemes. There is need to establish process-based plan and monitoring,
to build capacity of scheme management team and to develop a databank on the environmental and
social impact management plan including the monitoring plan.
Capacity Building
In order to ensure sustainability of the scheme, all stakeholders of the scheme, at their various levels,
are expected to participate in the capacity-building program. The levels include, individual farmers,
households, farmers' committees/groups/associations etc. They should also include village/ward
governments, district authorities, private/public organizations NGOs, CBOs.
Baseline Studies
It is vital for any sustainable smallholder irrigation development and management in the river basin
that t here i s a minimum knowledge about water resources a nd quantified (baseline d ata) related to
environmental and social issues. It is therefore, proposed that a mechanism be established for regular
collection of baseline data in the future smallholder irrigation improvement projects.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF GROUP B
IRRIGATION SCHEMES
PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The Govelnment of the United Republic of Tanzania has been implementing River Basin Management
and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP) since 1996 through IDA credit. The
project aims at (i) strengthening the government capacity to manage its water resources in an integrated
and comprehensive manner that ensure equitable, efficiency and sustainable development of the
resource and address water related environmental concerns at the National level and in the Rufiji and
Pangani basins: and (ii) Improve irrigation efficiency of selected smallholder traditional irrigation
schemes in these two basins. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and the Ministry of Water
and Livestock Development are implementing the project.
The Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component of the project is focusing on the improvement of
existing traditional irrigation schemes. Under existing World Bank Environimental Policy (OD 4.01),
the River B asin M anagement a nd S mallholder I rrigation I mprovement P roject ( RBMSIIP) h as b een
classified as a category "B" project requiring a limited environmental analysis and, if necessary the
inclusion of mitigation measures in project design. This is essence means that no major environmental
impacts are expected and that only mitigation measures can be incorporated into the scheme design,
implementation and operation (SAR 1995)
SCOPE OF WORK
The Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Irrigation section carried out the Initial Environmental
Examnination (IEEs) in 15 traditional Irrigation schemes to ascertain environmental issue and suggest
mitigation measures that have to be incorporated during scheme design, Construction and Operation
and Maintenance. Based on the IEE findings, IEE Reports were prepared as part of Scheme
Improvement Assessment Studies.
The consultants in collaboration with ECU will be required to cairy out Environmental Audit in seven
(7) group B Scheme of Ruanda Majenje, Igomelo, Mangalali, Nyamahana, Soko, Kambi ya Tanga and
Mahenge irrigation schemes. The consultant did environmental Review of Lemkuna irrigation scheme
in 2001, thus it requires an Environmental and Social Management Plan only. The schemes are now in
operation phase.
The assignment is a continuation of the last activities of Environmental Audit of group A and C
irrigation schemes. This will be done in accordance with GoT and World Bank safeguard policies

AVAILABLE REPORTS
The reports available at the Irrigation Section (PFT) include Initial Environmental Examination,
Engineering, Socio-Economic, Topographical Surveys, Agronomy/Agriculture and Water Resource
Studies.
The consultant is therefore required to compile quantitative and qualitative information from these
supplemented by field visit in order to have baseline information on environmental issues to develop a
model for future review of Initial Environmental Examination reports under RBMSIIP.
TIMING
The consultant is expected to spend about five month starting May 2003.
OUTPUTS
The consultant will be required to produce 17 copies of reports for each irrigation scheme for review by
NEMC in hard copy and in MS Word diskette for submission to World Bank for review.
The document should address the following issues:
* Analysis of Engineering, Socio Economic, Agricultural, Soils and Water Resources reports in
order to provide quantitative information given the qualitative information in the IEE reports.
* Compliance with EIA procedures according to the Government of Tanzania and World Bank
guidelines.
* Proper methodology and approach including criteria for assessment,
* Integrated Pest Management.
* Prepare E nvironmental M anagement p lan t o s pecify c learly who a nd when mitigation measures

APPENDIX        4              World Bank Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies
Environnrental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). Outlines Bank policy and procedure for the environmental
assessment of Bank lending operations. The Bank undertakes environmental screening of each
proposed project to determine the appropriate extent and type of EA. The Bank classifies the project
into one of four categories, depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and the scale of the project and
the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. RBMSIIC is Category B..
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04). The conservation of natural habitats, like other measures that protect
and enhance the environmient, is essential for long-term sustainable development. The Bank does not
support projects involving the significant conversion of natural habitats unless there are no feasible
alternatives for the project and its citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits
from the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If the environmental assessment
indicates that a project will significantly convert or degrade natural habitats, the project includes
mitigation measures acceptable to the Bank. Such mitigation measures include, as appropriate,
minimizing habitat loss (e.g. strategic habitat retention and post-development restoration) and
establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar protected area.
Pest Management (OP 4.09). The policy supports safe, affective, and environmentally sound pest
management. It promotes the use of biological and environmental control methods. An assessment is
made of the capacity of the c ountry's regulatory framework and institutions to promote and support
safe, effective, and environmentally sound pest management.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). The resettlement policy is triggered when people are affected
by loss of land, loss of property and/or loss of access to resources. It is therefore irrelevant whether or
not the impact will entail physical relocation of the affected people, the policy is triggered in all such
cases This means that the impact may be of such kind that only compensation in cash or kind is
necessary.
Indigenoius Peoples (OD 4.20). This directive provides guidance to ensure that indigenous people
benefit from development projects, and to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of Bank-financed
development projects on indigenous people Measures to address issues pertaining to indigenous
peoples must be based on the informed participation of the indigenous people themselves.
Forests (OP/BP 4.36). This policy applies to the following types of Bank-financed investment projects
(a) projects that have or may have impacts on the health and quality of forests, (b) projects that affect
the rights and welfare of people and their level of dependence upon or interaction with forests, and (c)
projects that aim to bring about changes in the management, protection, or utilization of natural forests
or plantations, whether they are publicly, privately, or communally owned. The Bank does not finance
projects that, in its opinion, would involve significant conversion or degradation of critical forest areas
or related c ritical habitats. I f a project involves the significant conversion or degradation o f natural
forests or related natural habitats that the Bank determines are not critical, and the Bank determines that
there are no feasible alternatives to the project and its citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates
that o verall b enefits from t he p roject s ubstantially o utweigh t he e nvironmental c osts, t he B ank may
finance the project provided that it incorporates appropriate mitigation measures.
Safety ofD ams (OP/BP 4.37). For the life of any dam, the owner is responsible for ensuring that
appropriate measures are taken and sufficient resources provided for the safety to the dam, irrespective
of its funding sources or construction status. The Bank distinguishes between small and large dams.
Small dams are normally less than 15 m in height, this category includes, for example, farm ponds,
local silt retention dams, and low embankment tanks. For small dams, generic dam safety measures
designed by qualified engineers are usually adequate.
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03). The term "cultural property" includes sites having archaeological
(prehistoric), paleontological, historical, religious, and unique natural values. The Bank's general policy
regarding cultural property is to assist in their preservation, and to seek to avoid their elimination. The
Bank (i) normally declines to finance projects that will significantly damage non-replicable cultural
property, and will assist only those projects that are sited or designed to prevent such damage, and (ii)
will assist in the protection and enhancement of cultural properties encountered in Bank-financed
VIll

projects, rather than leaving that protection to chance. The management of cultural property of a
country is the responsibility of the government. The government's attention will be drawn specifically
to what is known about the cultural property aspects of the proposed project site. Appropriate agencies,
NGOs, or university departments will be consulted if there are any questions concemning cultural
property in the area, and a brief reconnaissance survey will be undertaken in the field by a specialist.
Projects on Interntational Waterways (7.50). The Bank recognizes that the cooperation and good will
of riparian is essential for the efficient utilisation and protection of international waterways and
attaches great importance to riparian making appropriate agreements or arrangement for the entire
waterway or any part thereof. Projects that trigger this policy include hydroelectric, irrigation, flood
control, navigation, drainage, water and sewerage, industrial, and similar projects that involve the use
or potential pollution of international waterways. The riparian are being notified in accordance with
this policy, no additional steps need to be taken at the level of the subprojects.
Dispiuted Areas (OP/IBP/ 7.60): Projects in disputed areas may occur between the Bank and its member
countries as well as between the borrower and one or more neighbouring countries. Any dispute over
an area in which a proposed project is located requires formal procedures at the earliest possible stage.
The Bank attempts to acquire assurance that it may proceed with a project in a disputed area if the
governments concemned agree that, pending the settlement of the dispute, the project proposed can go
forward without prejudice to the claims of the country having a dispute.
