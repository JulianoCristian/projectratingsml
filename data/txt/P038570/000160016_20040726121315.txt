EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Government of Tanzania through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS) has
taken various initiatives to improve agricultural sector in the country. One of these initiatives is
undertaking the River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP)
in context with which is the Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC). RBMSIIP was
conceived out of a realisation that river basins in Tanzania are not being properly managed. This leads
to environmental degradation and loss of potentials of the basins' ecosystems and especially of both
the Rufiji and the Pangani River. Furthermore it has been realised that the degradation affects the
smallholder traditional irTigation schemes worst of all .For this reason the SIIC was also put in the
program.
Support to smallholder traditional irrigation improvement and rehabilitation is therefore one of the
major components of this programme. The SIIC component focuses on improving the management of
water resources and crop husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation schemes. This can be
achieved through, among others improvement of natural resources, land and water, during
implementation of the rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes. SIIC is geared at
improvement of water management in smallholder irrigation schemes to ensure sustainable use of land
and water resources and ultimately yield increase with minimal environmental degradation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC, Scheme Environmental Assessment (SEA) as well as Environmental
Audit (EA) was carried out for the Igomelo Irrigation Scheme.
This report presents the findings of the study.
The objectives of the study were the following:
*   Identifying changes which have occurred both before and after improvement of scheme
*   Assessing and quantifying environmental and social impacts
*   Preparing an environmental and social management plan ,and finally
*   Developing an environmental and social management and monitoring system.
The report is based on Initial Environmental Review (IER) carried out by the Environmental Cell Unit
(ECU) of Irrigation section of MAFS. According to the ToR the expected output of the study should
be a set of two interrelated reports: one on report Environmental Audit of the irrigation scheme and
another on Scheme Environmental Assessment (SEA) reports.
Furthermore, assessment has also been done on compliance of the scheme improvement to the
Tanzanian policies and legislation framework and the World Bank's relevant environmental safe
guard policies (especially on OP 4.01).
Different methodologies were employed, including the following:
*   Desk review of recommended documents
*   Questionnaire administration to key stakeholders
*   Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA)
At different stages of the study the following approaches and analytical tools were applied
*   Participatory data collection
*   Key informant interview
*   Trend analysis
*   Geographical information system
Describing the location of the scheme, the study found out that the Igomelo irrigation scheme lies in
relatively up-stream area of the Usangu plains about 120km East of Mbeya municipality along the
TANZAM highway and 4km south of Igawa township. Its coordinates are 080 47' South and longitude
430 23' East, and are at an altitude of about 1140m above mean sea level. It comprises 5 villages,
namely Igawa, Igando, Igolomo, Igomelo, Ibohora.
v



Villages around Igomelo ir-igation scheme have a total population of -------people. The main ethnic
groups in the villages are Wanyakyusa, Wasangu, Wawanji, Wabena and other smaller groups. The
majority of these are agriculturalists. Few are livestock keepers. A few Wasukuma have migrated into
the area and are engaged in both farming and livestock keeping.
The land use in the adjacent villages of Igomelo is mainly irrigation as well as rain-fed cultivation and
grazing.
The Igomelo scheme abstracts water from the Mbarali River, which has a record of 39 years. The
monthly average flow varies between 39.2 cumecs (in wet months of March) to 4.2 cumecs (in dry
months of October)
Water abstractions by upstream users for domestic purposes, irrigation and livestock are likely to
impact on the quality and quantity of water available to the scheme. Poor farming practices, especially
cultivation of crops close to the riverbanks, is increasing silt load in the river and causing siltation of
the ilTigation structures.
With the iirigation structures improvement and prospects for higher income earnings from irrigated
agriculture, there is greater loyalty to the leadership of Water Associations. Since most of the people
are irrigators and members of the water associations, the latter has greater influence beyond irrigation
matters.
The following are some of the positive effects:
*   Water availability has improved with more areas obtaining water than used to be in before
improvement.
*   Strengthening the existing Water Users Association.
*   Temporal employment opportunities were created during the construction phase.
*   Farmers have been able to construct relatively better houses.
*   Some farmers have attended on farm training and exchange visits to other areas to share
experience with other farmers as well as leaming new skills.
*   The project has brought about improvement in water distribution and management.
*   Crop production has improved a great deal
A summary of identified impacts differentiated at up-stream, down-stream and within scheme levels
for resulting from Chapter 7 and appropriate mitigation measures are summarized in the in the
Environmental and Social Management Plan as follows:

The monitoring program comprises the following attributes: water quality, groundwater, soil
conservation, biodiversity, crop diseases, afforestation, socio-economic and health indicators.
Additionally, the study main conclusions and recommendations are the followings:
In conclusion, it was found that the location of the scheme does the following two things: It enhances
as well as undermines sustainability of the scheme. This is because the scheme is located near a rapidly
growing minor townships of Igawa, Rujewa as well as Mbarali, all of which detracts people from
practising irrigation while simultaneously also providing so much opportunities that the location could
facilitate and encourage irrigation practices. One of the main recommendations is in order to ensure
sustainability of the scheme stakeholders of all levels have to participate in the capacity-building
program. The levels include, namely the following; individual farmers, households, farmer's
associations/groups/scheme committees etc. village/ward govemment, and also district authorities as
well as both public and private orgamsations: NGOs, CBOs etc.

1. BACKGROUND
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The Government of Tanzania, through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS), has
undertaken various initiatives to improve the agriculture sector in the country. One of these
initiatives is the River Basin Management and Smallholder Iirigation Improvement Project
(RBMSIIP). The Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC) is included within the
scope of RBMSIIP. RBMSIIP was developed in response to a water sholtage crisis prevalent in
many parts of the country. Water demands often exceed available resources; this is especially true
in the Pangani and Rufiji basins.
Support to smallholder traditional irrigation improvement and rehabilitation is one of the major
components of this project. SIIC focuses on improving the management of water resources and
crop husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation schemes. This is achieved through,
among other things, the improvement of natural resources (land and water) during implementation
of the rehabilitation and upgrading of in-igation schemes.
The SIIC undertaking supports the objectives of the National Irrigation Development Plan (NIDP)
which was formulated and adopted in 1994. The plan includes a management and decision-making
framework that is based on the comprehensive ranking of schemes within each management unit
(river or drainage basin).
Under NIDP the order of priority for irrigation development is as follows:
*   Improvement/rehabilitation of Traditional Smallholder Irrigation Schemes;
*   Water Harvesting Technology;
*   Opening of New Smallholder Schemes;
*   Large Scale Irrigation Schemes for Private Sector.
SIIC focuses on the improvement of water management in smallholder irrigation schemes to
ensure the sustainable use of land and water resources. Ultimately, SIIC aims to facilitate increases
in crop yields while minimizing environmental degradation. According to World Bank guidelines,
the irTigation schemes in the Rufiji and Pangani basins are classified as Category B. Under this
category, no major adverse environmental impacts are permitted and mitigation measures must be
incorporated into the scheme design, implementation and operation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC, a feasibility study was carried out that resulted in the preparation
of the Project Implementation Plan for 1996/97 - 2001/02. This plan, produced in October 1996,
contains an assessment of environmental issues together with proposed environmental mitigation
measures.
Under World Bank advisement, the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Food Security conducted an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) of the irrigation
schemes. The IEEs were used as the basis for the Scheme Improvement Assessment Studies. The
consultants, in collaboration with ECU, have been charged to conduct environmental audits in
seven Category B sites: Ruanda Majenje, Igomelo, Mangalali, Nyamahana, Soko, Kambi ya
Tanga, and Mahenge. An additional site, Lemkuna, only required the development of an
Environmental and Social Management Plan. This report is focused on presenting the findings of
the environmental audit that was conducted for the Mahenge Irrigation Scheme.
This report draws heavily on intensive field observations b y the study team. Discussions were
held with farmers and other local people, village and district officials, and project staff. A review
of various existing documents was also conducted in the preparation of this report.



1.2     UNDERSTANDING OF THE STUDY
1.2.1  Objective of the Study
The objective of the study is to get a better understanding of the present environmental conditions
and relevant impact areas (environmental audit) within the scheme. Increased awareness will
allow for improved monitoring of both negative and positive changes over time and will assist in
the formulation of more effective mitigation measures. The environmental audit will also be the
basis for the preparation of an environmental and social management plan and monitoring system.
Specifically, the study will undertake the following:
*   Assess and quantify baseline environmental and social conditions
*   Assess and quantify environmental and social impacts
*   Conduct environmental audits in order to comply with existing Government of Tanzania and
World Bank environmental and safeguard policies
*   Prepare an environmental and social management plan
*   Develop an environmental and social management and monitoring system
*   Conduct public consultations
1.3     STRATEGIC APPROACH
The consultant's environmental audit of the Igomelo irTigation scheme was characterized by three
approaches: ecosystem, farming system and participatory. The basic approach of the study is
illustrated in Figure 1-1.
1.3.1   Ecosystem Approach
In view of the fact that the project activities are wholly based in a rural area, potential conflicts
between the project and the environment are likely to arise. Thus, issues pertaining to the use of
natural resources (e.g. livestock grazing, agriculture, irrigation, water source protection, agro-
forestry, etc.) have to be studied.
In applying the ecosystem approach, the consultant not only focused on the Igomelo irrigation
scheme but also on all the ecosystems upstream and down stream that impact the environmental
and social characteristics of the area. To accomplish this, the study sought an understanding of all
activities taking place within the irrigation scheme's water catchments area. River pollution,
sedimentation, flash floods, deforestation, destabilization of riverbanks, erosion, salinity, land
degradation, a nd waterbome d iseases ( among o thers) a re all c ontributing t o d egradation o f t he
catchmnents area. In suggesting mitigation measures, sustainable practices for the use of water and
land resources must be adopted to prevent and control environmental and social problems.
1.3.2  Farming System Approach
On the ilTigation scheme level, a farming system approach was used to describe and analyse
environmental and socio-economic conditions.  Issues related to soil contamination, water
pollution, the use and dangers of pesticides and fertilizers, health, and others have been identified.
It is clear that the irrigation activities will transform village life and the whole farming system in
the Igomelo area.
The success of the proposed mitigating measures will, therefore, depend on community
involvement, improvement of the socio-economic situation, capacity building, and proper
upgrading, maintenance and operation of the irrigation infrastructure. The latter should take into
account the local environment as well as the prevailing institutional, economic and social
conditions.
2



1.3.3   Participatory Approach
A participatory approach was adopted in preparation for the environmental audit. This entailed
seeking information/experience from stakeholders (i.e. farmers, district and regional officers,
RBMSIIP and other institutions who have been involved in the project). In order to ensure
effective participation and cooperation it was necessary to inform stakeholders prior to the audit
of the environmental and socio-economic problems to be addressed. Their inputs have contributed
to the development of more realistic and appropriate mitigation measures.

1.4 METHODOLOGY
The methodology follows Tanzanian policy and legislation and the World Bank's policies on
environmental assessment (OP 4.0 and related policies and guidance documents).
Available reference documents were reviewed for purposes of identifying pertinent environmental
and s ocial i ssues. I nformation was o btained o n t he I gomelo i rrigation s cheme b efore a nd a fter
construction as well as during operation. Several meetings were held with SIIP project staff. In
particular, t he E CU t eam, which was i nvolved i n t he S cheme E nvironmental Assessment, was
consulted to discuss background and potential issues. Subsequently, a ten-day field mission was
conducted in August by the study team and members of ECU. The team was used to: 1) complete
further fieldwork at various sites in the Igomelo irrigation scheme, 2) collect additional
information, 3) work with the irrigation scheme management team, and 4) to liaise with the
various stakeholders including the district officials. During the field visits, the Public Consultation
and Disclosure Plan for disseminating the results of the Draft Environmental Audit were
developed with the ECU staff.
1.4.1  Consultation
Public consultations took place in two phases. The first phase took place during the Environmental
Audit (EA) preparation process. This initial stage allowed for the identification of the key
envirolnmental issues and involved the gathering of information on stakeholder concerns and views
of potential environmental and social impacts. During the second phase, consultations allowed
stakeholders to review findings and give their comments.
1.4.2  Analytical Tools
The following methodologies were applied in the process of the study:
*   Participatory data collection
*   Key informant interviews
*   Socio-economic and environmental analysis
*   Trend analysis of river flow and rainfall
*   Water and soil quality analysis
*   Geographical information systems (GIS)
Participatory Data Collection
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) involves problem analysis, ranking, proposal planning, role
assigning and timing. The role playing consisted of a facilitator who played the role of an advisor
on the different matters raised during the workshop (those which the team was not informed about
or aware of). In the final analysis, a Logical Framework Approach workshop (also known as
ZOPP) produced the Environmental Action Plan for the irrigation scheme.
Key Informant Interviews
In addition to group discussions, information was also obtained from key informants. These were
generally staff from the Zonal Irrigation Office (ZIO), the District Executive Director (DED),
farmers of the Igomelo scheme, village officials (including village leaders), and others
(agriculture and irrigation officers who are residents in the community).  Any inconsistent
information was cross-checked to ensure accuracy. Various officials conducted the crosschecking
of information while members of the study team facilitated the group discussions.
Socio-economic and Environment
A total of 88 household questionnaires (sample size) have been administered using the random
sampling method. This represents 20 Percent of households of the study area (upstream, down
stream and scheme level). 80 percent approximately (80 questionnaires) of selected sample size
has been administered at Igomelo village (scheme level); where as 20 percent (20 questionnaires)
has been administered at Ibohora village (downstream village).

Quantitative data relating to the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the scheme was
collected and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software.
Trend Analysis of River Flow and Rainfall
An investigation was conducted upstream and downstream on rivers that feed the scheme. Both
statistical and visual interpretations of variability analysis were applied. To further reveal any
existence o f s evere abstraction o r flow r egime c hanges, variability a nalysis was d one month t o
month. Any possible causes for the change in the flow regime were quantified. In this regard,
animual rainfall variability for stations in or around the study area was noted. Three approaches
were followed to tackle the impacts problem:
*   Visual interpretation - Understanding and interpreting the annual time series and percent
deviation time series from the annual mean.
*   Testing randomness on the annual and monthly time series data - This test indicates that if the
null hypothesis tested for randomness is accepted, no flow regime change prevails in the
record; otherwise, it shows the flow regime is changed or there is a likely impact on the river
upstream or downstream.
*   Testing of breaks - At times a break or jump may be observed in the time series of flow. If,
for example, a huge volume of water is suddenly diverted to an irrigation area, segments
before and after the diversion can have different means.
Subsequent sections provide scheme level variability analysis and interpretation of the results for
both flow and rainfall.
The flow and rainfall data were collected from various sources. Rainfall data were collected partly
from Tanzania Meteorology Agency (TMA) and partly from the Ministry of Water and Livestock
Development (MWL). Flow data were partly collected from the Ministry of Water and Livestock
(MWL) and partly from previous reports.
Water and Soil Analysis
Water and soil samples were analysed at the laboratory of the Department of Environmental
Engineering, University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS) and Mlingano Soil
Laboratory. Procedures and analysis were done according to the Intemational Standards of Water
and Soil Analysis.
Geographical Information System (GIS)
Overlay maps and GIS were used to analyse sensitive/significant/relevant features of the irrigation
scheme area. Attributes and features that were mapped and analysed included water bodies, land
use patterns, vegetation cover, and cultural structures. The technique involved the physical
overlaying of individual topographic maps to provide a composite picture of the overall
environmental and social situation. Using Arc View 3.1, analysis was carried out to link spatial
and non-spatial data.
1.5 LIMITATIONS
Data quantification proved a difficult exercise due to the following reasons:
(i)  There was insufficient baseline data related to environmental and socio-econornic parameters.
(ii) Updated meteorological and hydrological data were not available.

2.1      THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.1.1   Location
The Igomelo irrigation scheme is located in Mbarali Rural district in Mbeya region about 120 km
east of Mbeya Municipality along the Mbeya-Dar-es Salaam highway. 4 kmi soutlh of Igawa
towvnship and 8 kilometers south of district headquarters i.e. at Rujewa Township. Igomelo
schelmie lies at latitude of 080 47' South and of longituLde 340 23' East. Igomelo Nillage is boarded
bv Mbarali River to the westL which supplies wvater to the irrigation scheme to Igoimelo and
surroutndinig villages. Livingstone hills ("Cht1a`j" anda7 "Gu;nbhge') run from southeast to the
northeast of the village where as Mpanga Game Reserve is located to the south of the v illage.
Nlpanga village acts as upstream village of the scheme located about 30 km south of Igomelo.
Ibohora village las been selected as downstream village situated about 18 km north of Igomelo.

2.1.2   History of the scheme
The Mbarali River (from which the Igomelo scheme extracts its water) is one of the significant
water sources for irrigation activities in Tanzania. Its prominence grew since the end of the 2nd
world war way back in late 1940s when the colonial government decided allocated farming lards to
war veterans as reward for them services. In thus way the Mbarali Irrigation scheme started.
Having realized the benefits of irrigation agriculture several other people started their own scheme,
including the Igomelo scheme presently a few kilometres south of the Igawa Township.
Indeed presently most farmers of the Igomelo scheme are residents of Igawa Township.
Igomelo farmers have a Water Users' Association, which started in 1998 and was registered as an
association by the Ministry of Home Affairs, with a number SO 9596, in the same year. The
Association has a total of 330 members, 250 men and 80 women.
2.1.3   Existing land use
The land use in the adjacent villages of Igomelo is mainly irrigation as well as rain-fed cultivation
and grazing. Further downstream lies the Usangu swamps, which includes the Ihefu swamp, which
is ecologically important in terms of biodiversity value. It also supports livestock as grazing land.
The Igomelo irrigation scheme was constructed/rehabilitated in two phases, Igomelo phase I for
250 ha a nd phase I I for 2 90 h a. B oth p hases were c ompleted in 2 002. The s cheme has a total
irrigated area of about 540 ha. Crops irrigated include paddy, beans and vegetables.
Total irrigable land under the scheme is about 300 hectares. However 200 hectares of irrigable
land is being cultivated each year which serves about 284 people (number of people holding farms
under i rrigation s cheme). Administratively r esidents near t he s cheme b elong t o 1 0 h amlet units
namely, Mjimwema, Kaloleni, Kamficheni, Kanisani, Mpungu and Sangu. Others include; Faru,
Nyanyanjo, Nyuki and Temeke.
Land use activities in the catchments include cattle grazing and charcoal making. However, these
activities are not at present carried out intensively. In years to come if these activities are not
adequately monitored they might have impact on the overall sustainability of the catchments as a
source of water for the Igomelo scheme and downstream users.
2.1.4  Land ownership and acquisition pattern
Traditionally in most rural areas of Mbeya region, the male head of household who apportions part
of it to the sons as they grow up owns the land. Nevertheless this is not the case with Igomelo
village. Any resident on request regardless of sex and tribe acquires land in this village. Among
farmers who were interviewed there were women who own land. Apparently this has been
attributed by the fact that a foreigner, Mr. Acardo who consequently owned all the irrigated land,
constructed this scheme. As it has been mentioned earlier, after his departure the land was handed
over to the village government, which redistributed it.
Farmers who were working on Mr. Arcado's farm were the first to acquire land. These have farm
sizes ranging from 3.0 to 10 acres. The majority of them came later and have land holding ranging
from 0.25 to 2.5 acres. In this village there are no absentee landlords.
Results of the household questionnaires indicate that most of the farmers have acquired their land
by inheritance (29%) and allocation from village government (18%). Table 2.11 gives percentage
of land acquisition in Igomelo area.

Total           88              100.0
With respect to land ownership/acquisition pattern, similar with the neighbouring Rwanda -
Majenje scheme, a majority of households (about 93.0%) own between one to three farms with the
rest i.e. only about 7.0 % own more than four farms. Similarly, about 55.7% of the households
acquired land either by inheritance or by purchases, compared to 34.05 who acquired land either
by clearing the bushes or through a process with the local government. Similar with some other
irrigation schemes, residential areas of the Igomelo scheme are not far away from the farms.
2.2 THE BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.2.1   Climatic Data
Igomelo scheme lies in a semi -arid climate receiving about 681 mm of rainfall. Despite its
meagreness, the rainfall is also highly unreliable in terms of distribution (Water Resource
Assessment Annex). The amount is also variable year after year. Another characteristic of rainfall
at Igomelo area is that it is mono-modal in nature. All these rainfall characteristics make it very
difficult for agriculture development depending only on rainfall. Rainfall starts in November and
ends in April with peak in either January or February. The rest of the months in a year are dry.
Positive soil moisture balance is experienced between December and March when mean rainfall
surpasses the evapo-transpiration. (Table 3 and Fig 2).
The mean monthly temperatures vary from 25.80C in November and 21.1°C in June. The small
temperature deference (4.70C) indicates that there is favourable warm condition for crop growing
throughout the year.

2.2.2  Water Resources
Igomelo scheme abstracts water from Mbarali River. Mbarali is a perennial river carrying a much
of water in the rainy season and substantial water volume in the dry season.
The r iver f low r ecord a t g auging s tation I ocated a t I gawa (1 KAl lA) h as a r ecord I ength o f 3 9
years. The catchments area upstream of the gauging station is about 1600 sq. km. The monthly
average flow varies between 39.2 in March and 4.2 cumecs in dry season of October. The Igomelo
scheme has a water right number of 4630 issued in April 1980 for abstracting 200 Us. Total
irrigation area under scheme is about 300 ha but due to shortage of water only 184 ha of land is
being cultivated.
Domestic Water Supply
A gravity-supplied system of tap water and Mbarali River are sources for domestic water. Mbarali
River is used as alternative source of water for domestic purpose. The villagers who reside at
Igawa enjoy tape water but those who are at Igomelo depend on water from irrigation channels.
Indeed, study showed that the water supply net work is so good that none of respondent reported
that water supply accessibility is more than 250m. By Tanzanian standards this is amply very
good. There are, however, no specific watering points for livestock.
Water distribution for irrigation
There has been some continuous tension and conflict between the irrigators over distribution of
water for irrigation
Water quality
A total of ten water samples were collected from the Igomelo irrigation schemes. The sampling
locations were systematically chosen so as to track on the quality of water as it trickles down the
irrigation scheme. Samples were taken from the intake and downstream end. Others were collected

2.2.4   Biodiversity
Igomelo scheme is mainly surrounded by human settlements (i.e. rapidly growing Igawa as well as
Rujewa townships). It is also surrounded by both small-scale and large-scale farmlands with very
little woodlands left. Over many years the area has been used for agricultural activities. There are
still a few wild animals around, but mainly monkeys.
2.3 THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.3.1   Population
The area has residents of varied ethnic groups such as Wasangu, Wanyakyusa, etc., Igomelo village
has 420 households with 1842 people (1995 records), out of these 464 are females 383 are males and
995 are children. The scheme is within Igomelo village, which has a total population of 1804 people
(2003).
Farmers at Igomelo village depend mostly on family labour in conducting farm activities. Social
study at this village has revealed that division of labour by sex does exist. Women are the ones
involved in activities like food processing, childcare, house keeping collecting fire wood, fetching
water for domestic use etc. use of labour saving devises, both at the house and in the farm has been
recommended both in the social and agronomic studies. There are more females than males in the
scheme are as shown in the table below:
Table 2.6:      Population characteristics by sex:

Total              421                100
Most of the household have 1-3 farmers which are actively involved in the irrigation. Number of
men, women, boys and girls per household is depicted in the table below:

2.3.2  Occupation
The v illagelization program of early I 970s moved people from the then I gomelo village to the
present day Igawa.
The total irrigated area of Igomelo scheme is characterised by three major land uses namely; rain
fed agriculture irrigated agriculture, and livestock keeping
By far a majority of farmers (i.e. 67.0%) practice both irrigation and n on-irrigation or rain fed
cultivation. Those who practice irrigation only are only about 13.6 %, whereas those who practice
rain fed irrigation only are about 19.3%. Petty trading i.e. in form of selling agricultural products is
by far the major of occupation of about 5 1.0% of the population.
17



2.3.3  Education
Majority of population in the irrigation scheme have not reached high education levels. About
19.1% are illiterate, 37.8% have not completed standard seven, 40% completed standard seven and
only 2% reached secondary school level. Education status is present in table below.

2.3.4  Markets and Marketing Information
The findings show that farmers' access to market and market information is not a problem at the
Igomelo scheme. It was found out that majority of farmers sell their products to middlemen who
come from as far as Mbeya, Iringa, and Dar es Salaam; as well as from neighbouring countries. A
few of them sell to local buyers, while others produce for their own domestic consumption.
2.3.5  Education
Level of education and or skills/knowledge is very low among local community of the Igomelo
scheme. Only about 2.0% have gone through secondary school education and above that, only
about 0.3 % of the population. Otherwise, the rest about 98.3% fall into below or up to primary
school level .As a matter of fact of the 98.3 %, about 19.1% have had no formal education, 37.8%
could not manage to complete primary school, where 40.8% did complete the primary school
education.
2.3.6  Existing facilities near the irrigation scheme
Beside the village government that is the overall governing body in the v illage, there are other
institutions that are working together to create harmony and development of Igomelo community.
The village has one primary school, which among other things engages the children in farming. In
the r ainy season t hey grow c otton maize a nd g roundnuts while i n t he d ry s eason t hey u se t ape
water to irrigate vegetables. Some of these produces are sold to get cash to buy some of school
facilities and the school community eats some.
At the village there are many religious groups but the strongest is Roman Catholic (R.C). The R.C
Church is doing some farming to feed the disabled people residing at the village. The church also
plant trees to conserve the environment. There is one government dispensary at the village, which
serves Igomelo village itself and Lugelele village. The dispensary lacks medical experts, and
18



important medicine. Other social facilities at Igomelo include two pharmaceutical shops, 4 shops,
1 butchery, 3 bars, I pombe shop and some few domestic water centres.
Some government departments have representatives at the village. These include; agriculture,
health, education, water etc. Also the proximity to the district headquarter is an advantage to the
scheme community because they can easily get services from the district personnel
Igomelo village has one primary school and there is one village dispensary. Sanitation in Igomelo
village is generally of moderate quality due to urban characteristics. They use traditional latrines,
which do not have adequate roofing, and have poorly constructed walls.
2.3.7   Energy Supply
Fuel-wood and charcoal are the main sources of energy for cooking. About 58% use fuel wood.
Charcoal is however considered rather expensive. Electricity and kerosene are used for mainly for
lighting.

2.3.8  Household income
The major source of income is from farming (both rain fed and irrigated agriculture) which
accounts for 71% of all income sources. Findings from discussion indicate that in few famnilies
both husband and wife have control over household income. In most families men have an upper
hand on household income. About 47% of farmers are also involved in selling agricultural
commodities. Most households (59%) practice both irrigation and rain fed iiTigation. And among
the petty trade most householders live on selling agricultural products.

STAKEHOLDER
3.1    INTRODUCTION
According to the Mbarali District Council report (2003) strengthening and capacity building of
irrigators group in the district thee main programnme are identified.
Child Survival and Protection Development (CSPD)
The project is supporting district council in facilitating welfare of women and children in the
context of CRC and CEDAM.
District Basic Support of Primary Education (DBPSE)
The project is supporting district council to raise the standard of primary education in providing
training to councillors, primary school inspectors, ward education co-ordinators, and school
comnnittees in updating teaching skills with new methodologies. It also helps the district in
construction of new building structures, rehabilitation of school buildings, providing teaching
materials and furniture.
Wild Life Conservation Society of Tanzania (WCST)
Wildlife Conservation Society in Tanzania (WCST) is a non-Governmental organisation working
to conserve natural flora, fauna and environment in Tanzania. It runs its activities through
conservation programmes in Important Bird Areas. In the Usangu Plains the action is the
conservation of over 300 bird species, which have been recorded in the site of which one is  of
global importance and two are endemic in Tanzania
3.2     SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF THE USANGU WETLAND
AND ITS CATCHMENTS
The Sustainable Management of the Usangu Wetland and its Catchments (SMUWC) project began
in September 1998, in response to the seasonal drying up of the Great Ruaha River at Msembe in
the Ruaha National Park, starting in 1993. At that time this was linked in many minds to water
shortages at Mtera reservoir, which in turn led to severe national electrical shortages in the mid-
1 990s. Low a nd z ero flows i n the Great Ruaha River during the dry s eason were a ttributed b y
many to land use activities in the Usangu catchments. With these points in mind,
The SMUWC project was initiated with two broad thrusts:
*   A technical investigation into what was happening to the water, and the causes of the problem
*   A community outreach programme, to understand human use and management of water and
other natural resources, and to understand how these might be changed to release more water
to the Great Ruaha River.
In the long term, these were to come together in the development of a management strategy for
Usangu, to be agreed on by all stakeholders and informed by SMUWC findings. The project seeks
to bring these stakeholders together to develop a shared vision of the future. This will lead to a
strategic framework for Usangu that will prioritise and guide activities, encourage cross-sectoral
co-ordination, and ensure the incorporation of environmental considerations into development
planning a t a n e arly st age. T he first p hase o f the SMUWC p roject r an for 2 1/2 years, ended 3 1
March 2001.
3.2     WATER USERS ASSOCIATIONS
Igomelo irrigation scheme has only the Water Users' Association. It started in 1998 and is a
registered association in the Ministry of Home Affairs with a registration number: SO 9596.WUA
21



holds the annual general meeting (AGM), which is attended by all 330 members. This is the top
most organ of the organization, meeting once a year and normally in June or early July.
Under the AGM is found the management committee, which has twelve members, six being
female and the other six being male. E ach o f the three villages has four members in the water
committee making a total of twelve members.
The chairperson of WUA is among the twelve members of the management committee. However,
Secretary of WUA is elected by AGM and is not a member of the management committee. Office
tenure is three years and members of the management committee are allowed to re-apply for
another term.
The management committee has three-sub committees namely, resource management, supervision
and construction. Each of these sub committees has four members with well-defined gender
balance. The organization chart for Igomelo WUA is given in Figure 3-1
The aims of water user's association are:
a) To promote irrigation agriculture.
b) To control irrigation agriculture activities.
c) To collect and daily represent member views to whoever wishes to attend to them.
d) To build way's and means for strengthening irrigation agricultural activities e.g. capital/credit
facilities etc.
Credit
The project (RBMSIIP) i s not p lanning to supply c redit facilities t o the s cheme. However the
advantage the scheme is having, is the existence of the Southern Highland Extension and Rural
Financial Services Project especially the saving and Credit Co-operative Society (SACCOs)
component in its (scheme) area.
The irrigators are also encouraged to strengthen their savings account so that can later borrow
money from the savings. The Co-operative Society can also solicit credits from other sources such
as the CRDB (1996) Ltd. NBC (1997) Ltd and National Microfmance Bank Ltd. Etc.
3.3     STAKEHOLDER'S ROLE
3.3.1  Identified stakeholders
In order of vested powers in decision-making roles enforcement the identified stakeholders are as
follows:
*   District Council's i.e., through the District Executive, Director (DED) with his/her relevant
committee and functional officers e.g. District Agricultural and Livestock Development
Officer (DALDO), District Water Engineer, District Council Development office, etc.
*   Ward Executive Officers i.e., through the Ward Executive Officers (WEO) with their relevant
committee and functional offices, e.g. Ward Agricultural Officer.
*   Village Executive Officer i.e. through the village Executive Officers (VEO) with their relevant
committee and functional officer e.g. Village Agricultural Officer.
*   Water users association.
*   Farmers' groups/associations.
*   Private organization, e.g. NGOs, CBOs, etc
*   Donors
3.3.2   Analysis of stakeholders
In general for sake of sustainability influential role of all the identified stakeholders is synergetic.
For example, at the highest level, the District Council chaired by the council chairman/woman
with all its relevant committee and functional officers has to be fully involved so that they can put
in their agenda and plans financial issues of the scheme. In that way further development of the
scheme will get both the support and the authority it requires.
22



Likewise even at the lowest level (i.e. at village governmnent/famiers associations level) the
stakeholders need to be fully involved because being at grass-roots, they are capable of providing
solution on a routine bases.
3.3.3  Involvement of stakeholders in environmental audit and implementation of ESMP
In view of the above therefore different stakeholders were and will be involved in environmental
auditing and implementation of ESMP as follows:
Water users association
Managing water resources within schemes
Farmer's associations/groups
Carrying out routine activities/controlling actions.
Identifying/formulating required action to VEO.
Saving and credit organisations.
Village Executive Office (VEO)
Grass-roots representation of local government system.
Mobilizes, receives, identified required action and forwards them to WEO for considerations.
Ward Executive Officer (WEO)
Grass roots representative of local government system.
Mobilizes, receives checks and controls identified required action and forwards them to District
Council (through relevant its committees).
District Council
District development planning.
Mobilizes, receives and deliberates identified required action and incorporates  them  into  the
district development plan for financing.
Finance/overseas implementation of the identified actions.
Private Organization/NGOs/CBOs
Promotes identification and implementation of identified action.
Helps to secure funding of the actions.
Donor agency
Promotes development cooperation.
Finances/overseas implementation of action plans
3.3.4  Ensuring incorporation of concern of stakeholders in ESMP
In order to ensure the concerns of stakeholders are incorporated in ESMP, it is proposed that the
following measures be taken after finalization/submission of the ESMP:
Seeking government approval of ESMP
This government approval of ESMP is imperative because the councils are not allowed to
implement a plan unknown to the g overnment. Under these circumstances the ESMP has to be
approved firstly by MAFS, NEMC and then by PO-RALG.
Dissemination of the ESMP to relevant district
After government approval, then the ESMP should be disseminated to relevant district for
implementation. This should be followed by a series of workshops, seminar, etc. to enable public
discussion on the ESMP. The discussion should start at district level then percolate to lower and
lower levels as indicated above.
23



4. COMPLIANCE WITH TANZANIA'S POLICIES, LEGAL
FRAMEWORK AND THE WORLD BANK'S
SAFEGUARD POLICIES
4.1    NATIONAL POLICIES
Relevant policies with a bearing on agricultural and rural development in general, and irrigation in
particular, and therefore Igomelo irrigation scheme, have been examined. These include the
National Environment policy, the Land policy, the National Water policy, the Energy policy, the
National Agriculture policy, Draft Rural Development Policy, Poverty Reduction Strategy, Draft
Rural Development Strategy, Agriculture Sector Development Strategy, the Forest policy and the
Wildlife policy. These policies affect direct key sectoral activities and were examined because
they automatically affect important land uses in the area vis-a-vis: agriculture, water, livestock,
energy, forest and wildlife.
4.1.1  National Environment Policy of 1997
Implementation of the river basin management and smallholder irrigation project and particularly
the irrigation schemes under operation is consistent with the overall objectives of the National
Environment Policy. The policy provides a framework for multi-sectoral participation and
cooperation to achieve sustainable development; and seeks to ensure sustainable and equitable use
of resources for meeting the basic needs of present and future generations, without degrading the
environmental resource base or risking health and safety. The policy emphasize the need to prevent
and control degradation of land, water, vegetation and air which constitute our life support
systems; to conserve and enhance our natural and man made heritage; including biological
diversity; to improve the condition and productivity of degraded areas including rural and urban
settlements; to raise public awareness and understanding of the essential linkages between
environment and development and promote individual and community participation in
environmental action, among others.
Furthermore the policy calls for improved agricultural practices, and better utilization of the scarce
water for irrigation, ensure efficiency, minimize looses and avoid salinisation as well as proper use
of agrochemicals to minimize reduce/pollution of water sources.
The design, re-construction and operation of the schemes have taken into account the above
considerations. Additionally, planned training of farmers in effective and efficient management of
water resources intends to contribute to achievement of the objectives of the environment policy.
4.1.2  Agriculture Policy 1997
The implementation of the RBM-SIIP on the basis of farmer groups and rural community
participation is consistent with the Agricultural and Livestock Policy (ALP) of 1997, which
provides policy guidance on the development of the agricultural sector. The policy seeks to ensure
that the direction and pattern of development in the sector meets economic, social and
environmental objectives. The policy aims at accelerated growth of production and exports through
among others, assuring national food security, developing and introducing new technologies which
will increase productivity of labour and land; promote integrated and sustainable use and
management of natural resources and providing agricultural support services.
The smallholder irrigation projects aims at providing agricultural support services; improve
income of the rural poor, promote rational use of water resources and introduce appropriate
technologies among others.
4.1.3  Land Policy of 1995
The National Land Policy of 1995 provides incentives for efficient use of land and its resources. It
seeks to promote and ensure a secure land tenure system, encourage optimal use of land resources
and facilitate broad-based social and economic development without up setting or endangering the
ecological balance of the environment. Farmer groups and communities participating in the project
24



have acquired customary rights of occupancy from their respective villages and some villages are
processing granted rights. Both granted and customary rights of occupancy secure land ownership
add incentives for farmers to maintain and develop their farms accordingly, thus reducing land use
conflicts and increasing the value of land.
4.1.4   Water Policy of 2002
The National Water Policy (2002) provides a comprehensive framework for promoting optimal,
sustainable a nd e quitable d evelopment a nd use o f water r esources for su stainable d evelopment.
The policy seeks to ensure supply of good quality of water to meet domestic, environmental and
other priority development purpose. Emphasis is placed on the need to ensure more efficient
utilization of existing water resources through institutional improvements, proper soil management
to prevent soil erosion and flooding and improved monitoring to control water quality and
contamination from industrial sewerage and excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers. These
objectives requite on integrated and holistic planning and management in areas, water use and
disposal of effluents. The planned project objectives are supportive of the objectives of the water
policy through education, awareness and training on better agricultural practices, effective and
efficient utilization of water, water conservation, and application of agrochemicals to minimize
pollution of water sources to mention a few.
4.1.5   Forest Policy of 1998
The main objective of the National Forestry Policy is to enhance contribution of the forestry
sector in sustainable socio-economic development of the country, as well as conservation and
management of the natural resource-base for the benefit of both the represent and future
generations. In view of the general objective, the policy focuses its intervention in the following
four area (i) forest land management
Conservation of the forestry resources in the upper catchments is crucial for ensuring sustainable
flows of water for irrigation purposes and other uses. The establishment of the scheme is thus an
extra incentive for undertaking conservation measures in the catchments area of Mt. Meru.
4.1.6  Wildlife Policy of 1998
The main Wildlife Policy is to seek involvement of a broader section of the society in wildlife
conservation, and in particular the rural local communities, as well as the private sector with only
a role of stimulating and duly guiding both the rural local communities and the private sector by
administering, regulating and promoting management of wildlife resources. In view of this
general objective, the policy facilitates interventions in the following area: (i) wildlife protection
(i.e. incorporating management and development of protected areas) (ii) wildlife utilization (i.e.
incorporating promotion of establishment of Wildlife Management Areas conservation as well as
management measures and (iii) international corporation and coordination. Within the scheme
there are no wildlife management areas. The developments have also concentrated on the already
existing scheme, with therefore little likelihood of encroaching into wildlife areas.
4.1.7  Energy Policy of 2002 (Draft)
Sufficient and efficient supply of energy is crucial for national development. The objective of the
energy policy is therefore to contribute to the national socio-economic development process by
providing an efficient energy production, procurement, transportation, distribution and end-use
system in an environmentally sound manner and with due regard to gender issues.
Provision of energy for scheme farmers in a convenient manner will allow more time for women
farmers to participate in farm activities. It is against this background that communities are being
encouraged to use fuel-efficient charcoal and wood stoves.
25



4.2 LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The smallholder irrigation project will be implemented in the overall context legal framework that
govemns agricultural and rural development. Some of the few legal frameworks that are supportive
of the project include but not limited to: -
4.2.1   Environment Legislation
Currently Tanzania lacks a single comprehensive environmental legal framework or
environmental law. Efforts are underway to prepare such a framework. To-date, the management
of environment and natural resources is governed by fragmented sectoral pieces of legislation that
are yet to be fully harmonized.
There are some guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Government is
working on an act to make EIAs mandatory for all development projects. In this regard an
environmental legislation aimed at "promoting and managing environmental conservation in the
country" is in the making
The t erm " environmental" I egislation i ncorporates n early one h undred a cts a nd o rdinances a nd
several additional subsidiary legislation from all sectors of the economy, which affect the
environment. However, given the broad policy goal of achieving sustainable development and the
specific policy objectives, issues of unsustainable utilization of resources, deforestation,
desertification, salinization, land degradation, pollution of water resources, and impacts on rural
land use have been emphasized.
The design and operational strategy of the Igomelo scheme have taken these legal considerations
into account.
4.2.2  NEMC Act no.19 of 1983
This act establishes the National Environment Management Council as a statutory body
responsible for advising and coordinating environmental management issues. Among the many
functions of the Council, the act seeks to provide a framework for evaluation of existing and
proposed development policies, programmes, plans and activities of both public and private that
are likely to affect the environment and recommend measures to ensure adequate account of
environmental effects. Furthermore, the act provides for the specification of environmental
standards, norms, criteria, guidelines for the protection and maintenance of the quality of the
environment; enhancing cooperation between government, local authorities and bodies engaged in
environmental programmes and stimulate public and private participation in environmental and
natural resource management.
Relevant legislation pertaining to agricultural development in general, and irrigation in particular
and how it relates to the proposed projects, including Igomelo irrigation scheme was examined.
The following are the sectoral environment legislations.
4.2.3  Land Act no.4 and Village Land Act no. 5 of 1999
Both laws became operational in May 2001, following the approval of their regulations. The acts
seek control land use and clarify controversial issues pertaining to ownership of land and land-
based resources, transactions on land and land administration. The new land act identifies three
categories of land i.e. village (customary land); public/gazetted land (i.e. national parks, forest
reserves) and general land that does not fall in any of the above two categories for private
investment.
Implementation of the project is consistent with both legislations. For purposes of controlling land
in the village and to protect it from alienation to foreign investors, village governments would be
given documents indicating their boundaries. However, in-order to give value to land there is a
need for completion of the process of land survey and demarcation which amounts to land titling
and allocation to different land use categories to speed up investment in agriculture.
26



Land allocation at the Igomelo scheme was guided by existing land tenure arrangements which
are in line with these legal provisions. Both men and women have received irrigation plots.
4.2.4  Wildlife Act 1974 (with amendments of 1978)
Wildlife act provides for protection, conservation, development, regulations and control in both
acquisition and utilization of products of both fauna and flora. To this end, therefore the Act
stipulates "modus operandi", i.e. required restrictions in the following areas (i) in protected areas:
namely game reserves, game controlled areas, partial game reserves, national parks, etc. (ii)
proper procedures in hunting, capturing and photographing of wildlife and (iii) proper handling of
trophies. Furthermore, in the wake of the Wildlife policy, which stipulates for villagers'
involvement in Wildlife Management Areas (WMA), the Act also provides modalities and
procedures for designation, operation and involvement of local communities in the management
of the WMAs. Within the scheme there are no wildlife management areas.
4.2.5   Water Acts of 1974
As mentioned before the Water Acts principally seek to ensure that water is utilized without
sectoral conflicts, and without causing pollution. This is the spirit of both Act no. 42 of 1974 and
Act no. 10 of 1981. They w ere enacted to control and protect w ater resources. The legislation
defines "water" as all water flowing over the surface of the ground or contained or flowing in or
from a spring or stream or natural lake, swamp or beneath a watercourse. The Act places a regime
of water rights to govern access to water use. Pollution control norms and standards are embodied
in the water rights.
Apart from incorporating pollution control and having prevention conditionality in the water
rights, the Act goes a step fulther by putting in place a regime in consent with discharge of
effluent. Under Section 15 A (1) of the Act, no person may discharge of effluent from any
commercial, industrial or other trade waste systems into receiving waters without a consent duly
granted by a Water Officer. The Act also contains two schedules, which set standards for
receiving waters and effluent. The Igomelo irrigation has a water right in which the rights and
obligations of scheme operators, the farmers, are stipulated.
4.2.6   Forest Act 1974
The Forest Act deals with the protection of forests and forest products in forest reserves and
restrictions and prohibitions in forest reserves. The forest management plans are administered
under the Forest Ordinance (1957). Any contravention of the restrictions and prohibition is
considered an offence under this ordinance and subject to enforcement. However, the law is being
revised to meet new requirements under a new Forest Policy. There is no forest land within the
scheme area.
4.2.7   The Town and Country Planning Ordinance, Cap 378 of 1956
The Town and Country Planning Ordinance Cap 378, Part IV provides for control of urban
development while implementing a scheme of land development. Important aspects include the
designation and allocation of adequate land for solid waste disposal in any urban scheme. The law
further stipulates the design of a good sewerage system to manage liquid waste fiom various
major water consumers. The law empowers local authorities to enforce such schemes and
punishments as stipulated in the Act. The law further empowers neighbours and any individual to
take to court anyone who injuriously affects others due to his/her unhygienic activities. The Water
Users' Association at the scheme may pass by-laws to this effect. However, they would need
support from local authorities, particularly with regard to enforcement.
4.2.8   Local Government Act (District and Urban Authorities) Acts of 1982
This Act provides detailed responsibility for urban and district councils in the administration of
their day-to-day activities. Waste management is pointed out as one of the activities to be
managed by urban authorities. This Act is the backbone of the Village Government's operation,
27



powers, responsibilities of various local authorities and structure. The law requires that the
Village Assemblies act as the apex authorities in decision-making processes at the village level.
However, such meetings rarely take place in most villages, leaving decisions to be niade by few
leaders without having consulted with the village public. This being the case, many Village
Governments fail to bring about development for their villagers.
4.2.9  Land Use Planning Commission Act of 1984
The National Land Use Commission (NLUC) was established under this Act as the principal
advisory organ of the Government on all matters related to land use. Among other things, it
recommends measures to ensure that the Government policies, including those for development
and conservation of land are in harmony. It also takes adequate account of their effects on land
use and seeks for the advancement of scientific knowledge of changes in land use; it encourages
the development of technology to prevent, or minimize adverse effects that endanger man's health
and his/her welfare; it also specifies standards, norms and criteria for the protection of beneficial
uses and the maintenance of the quality of the land.
In accordance with the functions mentioned above, the Commission can indirectly help to prevent
or minimize pollution by restricting location of potential and actual pollution sources. The major
issue is the sectoralisation of the Government's operations while neglecting holistic view of each
activity on land and their impacts on others. There is a tendency of each sector making decisions
without consulting the others. For example, Wildlife Division can designate an area for game
conservation without consulting the Agriculture and Food Security Divisions to avoid grabbing
land for agriculture activities.
The Igomelo scheme is included in the National Irrigation Development Plan which has been
officially adopted by the Government.
4.2.10 The Land Acquisitions Act of 1967
The Land Acquisition Act gives powers to the President to take "land" from private occupants for
public purposes when the public's interests to do so. The new Land laws declare all land in
Tanzania a s "Public Land" a nd v ested t o t he P resident a s t rustee o f a 11 c itizens. However, t he
Land Acquisition law has been watered down by the New Land Laws, which restrict the
President's powers not to acquire land without negotiation with the owners. Again the new laws
stipulate detailed compensations to be paid on any acquired land that amounts to deterring the
President to do so without careful considerations.
4.2.11 By-Laws
All villages in Tanzania are allowed to form by-laws. This has been done in Igomelo village
whose by-laws address proper use of land and water to ensure public health.
4.3     NATIONAL STRATEGIES
In order to guide national development more effectively and systematically, Tanzania has prepared
a number of strategies aiming at operationalizing the various policies in key sectors. Some of the
strategies that have a bearing on irrigation development and discussed below include: the
Government Vision 2025, Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Rural Sector Development Strategy
and the Agricultural Sector Development Strategy.
4.3.1  Government Development Vision 2025
The Government Development Policy 2025 is guiding framework for national development to the
year 2025. It aims at achieving a high quality livelihood for the people, characterized by
sustainable and equitable growth. It also aims at attaining good governance through the rule of law
and at developing a strong and competitive economy by moving from a less developed country
(LDC) to a mniddle-income country by 2025.
28



Scheme irrigation committees and water users' associations are potential nuclei for promoting
good governance and democratic practices in rural villages. By adhering to common practices and
cropping patterns, farmers will realize more or less equal and higher incomes.
4.3.2   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of 2000
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) concentrates on efforts aimed reducing income
poverty; improving human capabilities, survival and social well-being. The PRSP has set medium
term goals to be achieved by the year 2010 through sustaining macroeconomic stability, rural
sector development and export, and private sector development.
Improvement of food supply and security is the key to infant and maternity health as well as to
income generation. A number of activities, including construction and consultancy services have
been performed by the private sector. This has contributed to local capacity building.
4.3.3   Rural Sector Development Strategy (RDS) of 2000
The Strategy aims at reducing rural poverty as m eans of m anaging resources s ustainably, s ince
widespread poverty in rural areas compels people, in search for survival, to over-exploit the natural
resources. The RDS envisages the following:
*   Revising legislation and regulations with a view to enhancing community participation in
management and utilization of natural resources.
*   Revising the licensing procedures related to utilization of natural resources.
*   Introducing procedures for cost and benefit sharing of natural resources.
*   Introducing EIA as a pre-requisite for all development projects.
*   Developing procedures for natural resources with regard to entitlement of the state,
communities and individuals.
*   Developing procedures for conflict resolution in matters of natural resources utilization.
The Igomelo scheme will contribute to the principle objective of the RDS of poverty reduction
through raising incomes and better resource utilization. The work of the water users' association
involves a number of elements targeted by the Strategy.
4.3.4  Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) of 2001
The ASDS, which was formulated through a broad based consultative process, aims at
transforming the agricultural sector into a modernized, commercial, highly productive and
profitable sector that shall utilize natural resources in a sustainable manner and shall act as an
effective basis for inter-sectoral linkages.
The ASDS will address the key weaknesses facing the agricultural sector, which include low
productivity, poor coordination and limited capacity, underdeveloped supporting facilities, erosion
of the natural resource base, inappropriate technology, dependency on rain fed agriculture,
impediments to food market access as well as low public and private expenditure levels.
The investments and other interventions made in improving the irrigation system at Igomelo are
highly relevant and well in line with the targets of the ASDS. These improvements will contribute
to higher productivity, income generation, better water and land utilization, all of which are targets
of the Strategy.
4.3.5  Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) of 2001
The ASDS, which was formulated through a broad based consultative process, aims at
transforming the agricultural sector into a modernized, commercial, highly productive and
profitable sector that shall utilize natural resources in a sustainable manner and shall act as an
effective basis for inter-sectoral linkages.
The ASDS will address the key weaknesses facing the agricultural sector, which include low
productivity, poor coordination and limited capacity, underdeveloped supporting facilities, erosion
29



of the natural resource base, inappropriate technology, dependency on rain fed agriculture,
impediments to food market access as well as low public and private expenditure levels.
The investments and other interventions made in improving the irrigation system at Igomelo are
highly relevant and well in line with the targets of the ASDS. These improvements will contribute
to higher productivity, income generation, better water and land utilization, all of which are targets
of the Strategy.
4.4 COMPLIANCE WITH WORLD BANK SAFEGUARD POLICIES
A list of World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies is listed in Appendix 2. This part
of the report contains an analysis of the compliance of the Igomelo scheme with the Bank
Safeguard policies. It is based on intensive field observation by the study team, coupled with
discussions held with the farmers and other local people, including village and district officials as
well as project staff. The report is also based on the review of various existing documents.
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)
In order to ascertain that project proposals submitted for funding are environmentally sound and
sustainable, the World Bank requires that Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposals be
carried out. An Environmental Assessment (EA) of Igomelo scheme was carried out as part of the
overall base line study of the scheme. The assessment also built on the work done earlier by the
Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.
In view of the present day nature of activities at the scheme, it was found that the scheme can not
bring about adverse environmental impacts and that depending on proper handling of several
factors; e.g. land tenure issues, its sustainability may also be ensured.
The findings of the study were discussed with farmers as well as local community leaders at
meetings held at the scheme and also with district officials at their district headquarters. Their
opinions and ideas were taken into account in finalising the Environmental and Social
Management and Monitoring Plan.
From the above-mentioned observation the Igomelo Irrigation Scheme is considered to be in
compliance with the Bank Environmental Assessment.
Natural Habitat (OP/BP 4.04)
Igomelo irrigation scheme is a relatively newly established scheme. It has only recently been
rehabilitated and improved. It expansion is restricted on all four sides in an extensively cultivated
area. There are therefore no neighbouring natural habitats which require protection and
conservation. The scheme does not therefore trigger the Natural Habitat safeguard policy of the
World Bank.
Pest Management (OP 4.09)
Use of pesticides at the Igomelo scheme is currently at low level. The farmers, through the
extension service, are encouraged to apply IPM approaches. Farmers are also trained on safe use,
storage and disposal of chemicals. These efforts will lead to greater compliance with the Integrated
Pest Management policy of the World Bank, than present day situation.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
As mentioned above, Igomelo is a relatively new scheme, which has, also only recently been
rehabilitated. The farmers have been living in the area since mid- 1 970s, in the wake of
implementation of the Ujamaa Villagelization policy. However, changes of route alignment of the
nearby Mbeya to Iringa road highway has profoundly affected pattems of the human settlements as
well as land ownership and subsequently farming activities. At the scheme area, however, no
resettlements have had to be carried out. The scheme does not, therefore, trigger the Involuntary
Resettlement safeguard policy of the World Bank.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)
As mentioned above, there was rapid growth of human settlements only in mid-1970s. The growth
involved mainly the local indigenous people themselves. They are presently permanently settled in
30



the area, and in response to the questionnaire, no household indicated plans to move away. In view
of the above, it is evident that project activities at Igomelo would not trigger the indigenous policy
of the World Bank.
Forests (OPIBP 4.36)
Neither the up-stream nor the down-stream areas of the scheme have forested areas which may be
adversely impacted by project activities of the scheme .For this reason , project activities at the
scheme may not trigger the World Bank's safe guard policy on Forests.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37)
There are presently no dams, and moreover none are under consideration at Igomelo irrigation
scheme. The scheme does not therefore trigger this safe guard policy of the World Bank.
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03 - draft OP 4.11)
The scheme does not have movable or immovable objects, sites, natural features and landscapes that have
archaeological, palaentological, historical, architectural, religious, aesthetic, or cultural significance.
Therefore, the scheme does not trigger this safeguard policy.
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50)
The scheme is using Luanyo River, which does not flow, to any other places. The scheme does not
therefore trigger this safeguard policy.
Project in Disputed Areas (OP/BP 7.60)
The scheme does not operate in disputed areas and it does not therefore trigger this safeguard
policy.
Consultation and Disclosure Requirements (BP 17.50)
The findings of study and recommendations have been discussed with farmers' representatives at
the scheme. They endorsed the findings and recommendations. The Environmental Audit report
will be submitted to the relevant government authorities for review and approval prior to the
disclosure through newspapers, district offices, MAFS, and government websites.

5.0 TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES USED IN ASSESSING AND
ANALYZING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
IMPACTS
5.1     INTRODUCTION
There are several tools and techniques recommended for predication environmental and social
impacts as follows:
* Checklists
* Interaction matrixes
* Network
* Geographical Information System
* Mathematical modelling
In undertaking the assignment, the following tools and techniques were applied for assessing and
analyzing of environmental and social impacts of the irrigation scheme in the process of the EA
study:
Checklist
The environmental checklist is used for physical observations in the assessment of the irrigation
scheme.
Geographical information system (GIS)
GIS has been used in analysing hydrological changes and trends in water quality and soil study of
the irrigation scheme.
5.2     IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Impact assessment is a complex activity and mainly utilizes a wide range of baseline data.
Depending on available baseline data, many techniques can be applied to the study:
* Mathematical models (such as groundwater and river models, noise propagation models, air
and water dispersion models, income multipliers)
* Physical models (such as hydrological models for trend analysis, wind tunnels and hydraulic
models for estuaries)
* Scientific experience, judgment and observations
*   Structured/semi-structured approaches (e.g. changes in landscape and social impacts)
Impacts analysis and assessment must also provide information on the following aspects:
* Duration (time period over which they will occur)
* Likelihood or probability of occurrence (very likely or unlikely, etc.)
* Reversibility (natural recovery or aided by human intervention)
* Area affected (size and whether near or far from the project)
* Number (and characteristics) of people likely to be affected and their locations
* Trans-boundary aspects (do impacts cross-national borders?)
Due to a lack of baseline data and time constraints, the consultant was not able to conduct an
impact assessment utilizing mathematical and physical models. For environmental and social
impacts, structured/semi-structured approaches, focused group discussions, scientific experience,
observations, judgment, and GIS were used to quantify and evaluate impacts.

6.0 CONSULTATIONS WITH COMMUNITY AND FARMERS
6.1     INTRODUCTION
Meetings
Briefing meetings were held with Village Government leaders, farmer group leaders and the
village agricultural extension officer prior to holding the focus group discussions.
Focus Group Discussion
The focus group discussions were conducted with village governments, farmer groups, and women
groups. Data and information on issues like water and land use conflicts were gathered.
Participants
During the meetings and focus group discussions, the study team witnessed active participation of
both men and women. The size of the focus groups ranged from 13 to 16 participants. Guided by
skilled and experienced facilitators, participants deliberated on a variety of issues regarding
agricultural production and environmental conservation. The participants contributed freely to the
discussions and had diverse opinions on many issues. The group size and the skills of the
facilitator helped to make the meetings successful.
6.2     MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
BY STAKEHOLDERS
Leakage of water
Water leakage around structures and conveyance canals was identified. Stakeholders indicated
that the leakage is due to poor construction workmanship and some farmers tampering with the
stream. The major impacts of this problem are water being channelled to inappropriate areas and a
reduction of water levels for crops.
Lack of sanitary facilities
Due to the inability of some farmers to create proper sanitary facilities, there are not enough pit
latrines for the number of local people present. Improper human waste management in the area is
a serious environmental hazard. Pollution of water sources is likely to increase the incidences of
diarrhea, bilharzias, and typhoid.
Lack of culverts
The scheme does not have enough culverts, division boxes (some areas), bridges and farm roads.
The effect, among others, is that farmers have to hand-carry their harvests very long distances.
Deforestation
There is a high level of deforestation occurring at the upstream water source. This is due, in part,
to wild fire p ractices a nd a p oor awareness o n the p art o f the I ocal p eople o f the value o f tree
conservation. The deforestation is disrupting the overall hydrological cycle and reducing water
levels in the river. Stakeholders suggest that training of villagers and scheme members on the
values of forest conservation as it relates to the hydrological cycle be undertaken.
Lack of women participation
There is a trend in the village to not involve women in environmental conservation and other
development activities. As a result of patriarchal tendencies, there is often poor attendance of
women in village/scheme meetings. Efforts should be undertaken to develop more means of
including women in community and environmental affairs.
Low crop yield
The crop yield per area is very low. The problem is believed to be caused by inadequate amount
of irrigation water, unreliable rainfall, and limited land area for irrigation. The effects are low
incomes and perpetuation of poverty.
33



Soil erosion
Soil erosion has been occurring around structures and along canals. The erosion is caused by poor
construction workmanship, cultivation on the edges of canals, and inappropriate diversion of
water. This has lead to depletion of soil quantities around structures, loss of soil from canal edges,
and silting of canals.
Lack of capital
Lack of capital is another burning issue. Without collateral capacity and supportive financial
organizations, farmers are unable to buy farm inputs, hire labour, and procure farm equipment.
Participatory environmental action plan developed by farmers during focus group discussions is
presented in Appendix 3.

This chapter presents a brief description of identified environmental and social impacts of
improving the irrigation scheme. The impacts are based on changes, which have or are expected to
occur, prior or post improvement of the scheme. Attempts have been made to indicate both
positive as well as negative impacts, but for the sake of preparing an effective Environmental and
Social Management Plan (ESMP), negative impacts have featured more than positive impacts.
The impacts may also be categorized (based on localities) as follows:
*   Upstream and downstream impacts
*    Scheme level impacts
35



7.2.1  Demographic trend (population changes)
Population in the catchments area is as presented in Table 7.2 below.
Igomelo village (scheme level) is estimated to have 1804 people living in 510 households. Where
as the downstream village (Ibohora) has 809 inhabitants and 211 households. No information was
collected for the upstream village (Mpanga) as it is not easily accessible from the scheme area.

In 1995, Igomelo village had 420 households with 1842 people; out of these, 464 were females
383 were males and 995 were children (SIA 1998). Total households are estimated at 510 for
Igomelo village as per the Igomelo village government office, 2003. There has been about a 0.8%
increase i n h ouseholds b etween the years o f 1995-2003. This i s n ot a s ignificant c hange i n t he
population. Rapid growth of human settlement coupled with growth of socio-economic activities
and demands have been observed. The Igomelo scheme is strongly influenced by the rapidly
growing (about 6% per annum) Igawa and Rujewa townships.
7.2.2  Hydrological Changes
Inference from statistics as well as visual analysis indicates that Mbarali River has been
significantly affected from 1965 onwards. As segmentation analysis clearly showed, the mean
discharge from of 1955-1964 is twice as much as 1964-1993. It appears that measure extraction
has taken place upstream of Igomelo scheme in 1965 as presented in Figure 7.4. This significant
hydrological regime change has been maintained since 1965 without appreciable deviation. The
variability analysis and visual interpretation of the hydrograph of 1965-1993 shows no significant
hydrological change.

Clharcoal bumiing is one of the activities in Mbarali catclunemts around Igomelo village. It covers
areas such as the Liv-ingstone Hills and areas near Mpanga Giame Reserve. The gravity of the
problem can be understood by the fact that Igomelo v-illage provides charcoal for Rujewa.
UbarLku. and Mbeva townv-s. The activities of charcoal burniig have caused significant siltation
problems in the calnal system. The old irrigation canal located dow-nstream  of the scheme at
Ibohora v illage demonstrates the problem. There is also an increase and lack of coutrol of forest
fires. CommnLities reported that incidences of forest fires are increasintg from 5 to 10 per annumi.
A topograplhical map of 1982 indicates that the upstreamii area used to be a vast scrublaund. The
dox-nstreani area. however, was covered by scattered cultivation.
37



Satellite images of 1998 show great changes in land use/vegetation cover. In upstream areas of the
present day- scheme. scrubland vegetation had generail} developed into areas wvith herbaceous trees
and shrubs. Herbaceous plants appeared both w ithin and dowvnstream of the scheme.
In the wake of scheme improvement. much clearing wvork of the herbaceous plants has occurred.
The scheme environment is presently dominated by farmlands and rapidly expanding human
settlements of the townships of Igoinelo. Rujew-a. and Nlbarali.

7.2.4   Changed water quality on downstream users
The result of wi'ater quality tests indicate die pH raniges betwieen 6.87 and 8.24. whiuch is niear the
neutral pH banid. The dissolved oxygeni (DO) raniged fromi 5,45 iig/l to 7.38 m-g/l. wiith high values
ieasuired at die initake and de lowest at the downstream end of the scheme. The dissolved oxygen
in the intake and irrigation channels still indicated fairly high v-alues signalling lo-  organic
pollution in the vater. The salinity and total dissolved solids (TDS) values of the incoming water
(measured from the initake) intdicate that the water used for irrigation is suitable for that matter. The
change of turbidity between the intake and the downstream end of the scheme.  is also remarkable
(about 19 times). The acidit- also shows large -ariation betw-een the intake and the dow-nstream
end (from 0 to 98 mg/I as CaCO3).
7.2.5   Socio economic impacts on downstream users
The significanit growi th of human settlemenit which has occurred in Igomelo has raised the lev-el of
hulnani activ-ities. The use of agrochemicals. cutting of trees for charcoal making. cutting of poles
for house construction. firew ood collection, and agricultural expansion have all impacted the
dowi nstream communities in some fashioni.

7.2.2   Water useulfiticoiic
A w-ater use efficiency study carried out before and after scheme improvement shows that
efficiencx was improved from an overall v-alue of onh 8% in February 2001 to 0.23 and 0.32 in
Februnar 2002 and September 2002. respectively. This indicates an enllancenieni of wlater use as a
result of the rehabilitationi of the schelme.

The soil pH is mildly alkaline in the whole farm. Fertility ranges from very low to low. There is good
mineralization, though available phosphorus is low (except for areas 2 and 4 which are high). The
soil shows I ow c ation e xchange c apacity a nd a medium to I ow e xchangeable s odium p ercentage.
The soil is, thusly, non sodic. However, there are already indications of sodium accumulation.
Soil sodicity tends to increase in the farms found downstream of Igomelo Irrigation Scheme. Soil
fertility is low at the Igomelo irrigation scheme.
7.2.4  River banks erosion
The erosion of river banks is threatening the life of the scheme. There are five primary spots along
the river where the soil erosion is severe.
7.2.5  Water quality
Water quality at the irrigation level is shown in the table below. The pH of 7.14-7.47 indicates that
the water is neutral. The salinity is 0. These data are comparable with data collected by an SIA
team (1998) which showed pH 7.2-73 and salinity 0.03-0.33. The water quality has not changed
and is safe for irrigation. It seems that significant amounts of inorganic substances are added to the
water as indicated by increased values of TDS (about seven times increase). The maximum faecal
coli form count was 99 FC/100 ml which was obtained at the exit o fthe Igomelo scheme. All
samples collected from the entire irrigation scheme showed faecal counts of between 60 and 90
FC/100 ml. However, this quality still meets the WHO guideline limits for irrigation water quality.
Water quality may be affected by activities going on in the scheme area (washing and bathing in
the irrigation canals).

7.2.6      Fertilizers and pesticides use and dangers
Farmers use agrochemical applications to increase their production and for control of pests. Farm
inputs such as agrochemicals are obtained from Rujewa and Ubaruku townships or even
Makambako town. More than 50% of farmers do apply chemical fertilizers and pesticides,
particularly those engaged in production of horticultural crops. Some of the fertilizers used are:
DAP, Urea, Dithane M45, Blue copper, Karate, Darsban, Thionix, etc. Farmers do apply kraal
manure and biological and pest control methods
Agrochemical application, particularly pesticides and herbicides, is on the increase, according to
discussions held with farmers at the irrigation scheme. Taking into account a variety of pesticides
and herbicides available on the market, different rates are being applied, depending on
manufacturer's guide, application time, crop, and pest types. In some cases, it may depend on the
amount a farmer can afford and the total area to be covered. The table below shows different
application rates (ranges) and the percentage of farmers applying those rates regardless of
pesticide/herbicide type.

7.2.7   Waterborne diseases (health data)
The most common diseases include: malaria, ARI, diarrhoea, pneumonia, eye, skin, and ear
infection. Outbreaks of diarrhoea are often associated with the poor quality of water the villagers
use for domestic purposes. The village community members depend on water from the irrigation
canals and rivers for domestic use. Activities taking place in the river such as washing, bathing
contribute, in one way or another, to the increased cases of waterborne diseases. Disease cases at
the village dispensary for the last couple of years are summarized in the tables below.

7.2.8   Drinking water quality and sanitation
A gravity-supplied system of tap water and the Mbarali River are the main sources of domestic
water. As tap water is intermittent, water from Mbarali River is used as alternative source.
7.2.9   Socio-economic: positive and negative impacts of villages within the scheme
Negative Impacts
*   Over population of livestock in Igomelo has created soil erosion in the scheme area and
contributed to water pollution.
*   Water-related diseases are more common
*   Low soil fertility which necessitates the use of fertilizers and other agrochemicals
*   Shortage of water for irrigation
*   Small irrigable land compared to demand
*   Land holding problems (high income people hold big farmland)
*   Water management problems(water is not released adequately in some tertiary canals)
*   Deforestation on Livingstone Hills and area near Mpanga Game Reserve
*   Irrigation water management problems (e.g. some water users claim upendeleo--favourtism)
*   Intermittent supply of tap water for domestic purposes leading people to use water from the
Mbarali River as an altemative source.
Positive Impacts
*   Farmers generated more income from selling of crops; hence the standard of living has
improved among people as evidenced by the building of better housing, increased
contributions to children's education, and better nutrition.
*   The scheme receives better extension services and training in regard to agriculture practices.
*   Permanent regular household income to irrigators
44



*   Reduction or even alleviation of famine problems
*   Employment opportunities for youth
*   Housing improvements. It is estimated that about 100 houses have been transformed or
constructed
45



8.0 IDENTIFIED MITIGATION MEASURES
8.1    INTRODUCTION
This section presents a brief description of the identified impacts and subsequent mitigation
measures. The description addresses itself to three categories of identified impacts as presented in
previous chapter, as well as four categories of identified mitigation measures. The categories of
identified impacts include the following:
*   Impacts in up-stream areas of scheme
*   Impacts at scheme areas
*   Impacts in down areas of schemes
Furthermore, the categories of identified mitigation measures include the following:
*   Environmental management
*   Enhancement of social -economic activities
*   Improving health situation
*   Revisiting engineering designs and /or construction.
8.2 UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM
8.2.1   Environmental Management
The key up-stream mitigation measure under this category of environmental management will
include:
*   Soil and water conservation activities in the upstream area should be introduced to reduce or
minimize sediment load. The farmers should be encouraged to plant trees around their
homesteads. Controlling deforestation activities through altemative mechanisms such as
introducing social forestry (community forestry).
*   Promotion of up-stream  afforestation/reforestation activities as well as environmental
protection in general.
*   Strengthening local based mechanism for control of acquisition and use of land resources,
namely to prohibition human settlements up-stream of the scheme for an appreciable distance
in kilometre away from the intake structure.
*   Strengthening and/or establisher of local based mechanism for resolution of conflicts.
Soil and water conservation
Soil and water conservation activities in the upstream area should be introduced to reduce or
minimize sediment load. The farmers should be encouraged to plant trees around their homesteads
to reduce pressure on the catchments and allow for natural regeneration in the latter. Controlling
deforestation activities through altemative mechanisms of firewood production such as introducing
social forestry (community forestry)
Watershed Management
In line with RBMSIIP approaches there is need to establish sub-catchments watershed
management programme for the Igomelo and other schemes in the catchments area. Watershed
management improves soil moisture, harvests rainwater, reduces floods, recharges groundwater
and revives greenery. In due course, it restores rainfall, revives a healthy climate, regenerates soil
regimen, rejuvenates green foliage and revivifies the environment.
For better decision making in environmental management, RBMSIIP should consider
quantification of sedimentation load, flash floods, deforestation rates, etc. at sub-catchment level.
46



In down stream areas, among others, the key mitigation measures related to environmental
management include: water management, as well as embarking on educational programs seeking
to improve irrigation practice, appropriate uses of agro-chemicals, etc.
8.2.2   Enhancement of social economic activities
In the case of the Igomelo scheme (whose water source is the Mbarali River) the key issue is
several decades of increasing extension of land put under irrigation agricultural. This places
higher and higher demands on water resources both for domestic as well as for irrigation purpose.
This has caused conflicts in uses of the resources making some communities poorer while others
richer time. Enhancement of social-economic activities in general involves promotion of
sustainable social -economic activities.
Specifically, in up-stream areas of the Igomelo scheme, the measures include promotion of
environmental consciousness in all social-economic activities. This should include establishment
of mechanisms, which should ensure controlled acquisition and appropriate land use practices.
In down -stream areas the villagers are not yet adequately conscious on high potential usefulness
of irrigation agriculture as a social- economic activity. There is, therefore, the need for promoting
this activity.
8.3    IRRIGATION LEVEL
8.3.1   Environmental Management
The key issue is inability for monitoring, surveillance and enforcement of regulation for water
abstraction, acquisition and use of land resource. For this reason mitigation measures under
category of environmental management will therefore include:
*   Establishment and/or strengthening of local based mechanisms for enforcement of regulation
e.g. prohibition of cultivation too near the course of the river, which in turn causes bank
erosion and siltation.
*   Establishment and/or strengthening of local based effective water management system,
including where feasible establishment of sub-catchment water authority.
*   Establishment and/or strengthening  of local based  mechanism  for resolution  of
competition/conflicts in the use of water and land resource.
*   Embarking on creating of awareness, improvement of skills/knowledge in integrated
approaches in irrigation agricultural practice e.g. on IPM, soil fertility management,
appropriate uses of agro-chemicals etc.
8.3.2 IPM and ISFM
Integrated pest management (IPM) has become increasingly used in recent years as a result of the
deepening realization of high cost and the adverse effects that the overuse of, and over-dependence
on, chemical pesticides produce. The objective in the development of an IPM is to find the most
appropriate blend of preventive and control methods and processes for the irrigation scheme.
Soil fertility is a major limiting factor for agricultural production in the irrigation scheme. The
maintenance, restoration and enhancement of soil fertility, particularly in areas where salinity
problems have been observed, is a key element in the development of food security and sustainable
agricultural systems in the scheme. With this in mind, it is suggested the project to incorporate
integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) in the irrigation scheme.
8.3.3  Enhancement of socio-economic conditions
The key issue is strong awareness on high potentiality of irrigation agriculture as a viable social-
economic activity. The mitigation measures of Igomelo under category of enhancing socio-
economic conditions include the following:
*   Promotion o f o x-wagons/hand c arts t o f acilitate mobility/transportation o f p roduct t o b etter
markets.
*   Promotion better productivity through improved seeds.
47



8.3.4  Improving health situation
This category of measure should be relevant for identified impacts at both scheme levels, as well
as in down-stream areas of the scheme.
One of the known environmental impacts of irrigation activities is spread of water borne diseases,
e.g. bilharzias, dysentery, malaria, and etc. Furthermore, expected influx of people, as irrigation
agriculture increases will mean that promiscuity will also arise. This calls for the need to embark
on a program for prevention of HIV/AIDS, as well as strengthening existing health and water
supply services, as appropriate.
To reduce vulnerability of the community of Igomelo scheme to the water related disease, it is
recommended to carry out the following:
*   Campaigns aimed at sensitisation of the community on the problem
*   Fragment cleaning up of canals to prevent germination of vectors
*   Appropriate drinking water and sanitation facilities
8.3.5   Revisiting engineering designs and/or construction stages
This category of measure is relevant only for down-stream as well as at scheme level. In the
scheme undesirable hydraulic characteristics arise. Their cause may be due to either inappropriate
human activities (e.g. livestock trampling on the structures) or natural change of regime, or
designing, or construction stages. Untimely handling of these impacts may adversely affect the
future life of the scheme itself.
For example at the down stream areas of the Igomelo scheme, there is need to take urgent
measures to protect areas of riverbank from further erosion. Furthermore there is need to prohibit
cultivation too near the course of the area (about 25 metres according to legislation). The project
should also consider a monitoring program, quantifying for example, deforestation rates, sediment
loads, etc.

9. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
(ESMP)
9.1    INTRODUCTION
The mitigation measures proposed in the previous chapter represent the core findings of the EA and
are important elements in implementing the current improvement of the irrigation scheme and
mitigating potentially adverse social and environmental impacts. The Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP) in the following sections presents:
*   Identification and summary of major anticipated adverse environmental impacts
*   Description of mitigation measures
*   Description of elements of monitoring program
*   Institutional arrangement
*   Implementation schedule for mitigation measures
*   Performance monitoring and reporting procedures
*   Cost estimates and sources of funds
The ESMP is based on the guidelines defined in the World Bank Operational Manual OP/BP 4.01.
9.2     OBJECTIVES
General objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the Igomelo
irrigation scheme would be to promote sustainable and efficient irrigation agricultural activities in
the area.
Specifically, the objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Plan for the Igomelo
irrigation scheme are therefore mainly two-fold; namely:
(i) To promote sustainability of the schemes through:
*   Improving capacities, knowledge/skills,
*   Establishing /strengthening mechanisms for resolution of conflicts pertaining to uses
of natural resources especially water and land resources,
*   Establishing /strengthening mechanisms for enforcement of regulations for water
abstractions and pollution control
*   Strengthening local community leadership and effective mechanism for control in
acquisition and uses of land resources.
(ii) To promote efficiency in irrigation agricultural activities, through:
*   Providing/educating on appropriate irrigation practices, e.g. on proper uses of agro-
chemicals, IPM approaches,
*   Strengthening implementation of water management concept.
*   Revisiting designing and construction stages of the scheme to assess the need for
review of the stages.

9.4 DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENTS OF MONITORING PROGRAM
Monitoring objectives
Monitoring refers to a systematic collection of data/information and due analysis, with the aim of
following up on the subsequent phenomena in the wake of implementation of the ESMP. Activities
are followed up, their status assessed, quantified and rectified accordingly. This process should be
considered as part of the ESMP. The District Council will keep a close eye on changing conditions
and keep records, as accurately as possible, to check, among others, on compliance with statutory
environmental protection provisions and World Bank Safeguard Policies.
Description o f performance i ndicators w hich p rovide I inkages t o i mpacts a nd mitigation
measures in the EA
Water quality
Water quality will be monitored as follows:
*   The water quality of the Mbarali River will be assessed continuously to determine the overall
impact of, fertilizers, insecticides or pesticides used in the irrigation project and upstream
agricultural activities.
*   The water flow volume in the river will be measured through the established gauging stations.
Water balance modeling should be done for predication proposes. This exercise will help to
assess base flows, water yields, and hydrological characteristics of the catchments area.
Ground water
*   The ground water will be checked to determine salinity of ground water as a result of project
operations.
*   The changes in pH of ground water will be monitored to check the impacts on ground water
of the various types of crops planted.
*   Changes in levels of water table will be monitored in sample areas of crops that consume too
much of ground water including the well-documented eucalyptus species.
Soil Conservation
Soil composition, texture and structure in the irrigation project area will be monitored in the
sample areas to determine impacts from various agricultural practices.
The fertility level of soils (i.e. nutrient concentration and soil moisture) in the sample crop areas
will be monitored to determine impacts from the planted crops. Changes in salinity, porosity, pH
level and types of biota in the soils will also be monitored in the sample crop areas. Alteration of
these parameters could be expected in cases where crops are grown alongside water or nutrient
demanding trees, which may consequently jeopardize the well being of the crops.
Biodiversity indicators
The following are pertinent indicators for catchments management: sedimentation rates, riverbank
erosion, flashfloods and deforestation rates. The District Natural Resource Office supported by
other stakeholder and RBM should monitor these.
Other important ecological parameters include vegetation; (i.e. both on dry land as well as on river
valleys); fish, (i.e. plankton, invertebrates); and birds, and other living organisms available in the
area.
52



Crop Diseases
The type of diseases affecting planted trees will be monitored in the sample compartments to
determine common diseases to various crops that will require special treatment in the next
rotation of crop farming or application of appropriate pesticides for treatment of the disease.
The most damaging crop pests, especially those that have caused extensive loss of production in
the farms in Tanzania will be monitored. The monitoring of emerging pests and insects in and
around the project area will help determine the most suitable disease control mitigation measure.
Afforestation
*   Provenance and species resistance to diseases and pests for planting in the community and
individual's forest plots within the project will be screened. Provenance and nursery plots
will be established. DBH and heights will be measured.
*   The amount of carbon and other greenhouse gases in the soils will be monitored in and
around the project area. The amount of greenhouse gases will be monitored to assess the
impacts of forest sequestration of greenhouse gases, especially carbon.
Socio-economic
The District Office should monitor the characteristics, activities and attitudes of the adjacent
communities in order to develop feasible extension programs. The major objectives will be to
reduce pressure on the irrigation area inter alia through encouraging alternative enterprises. The
steps would include:
*   Promoting agro-forestry in the local community farms.
*   Infrastructure development such as accessibility, marketing, education, health and other
proposed activities by the local community around the project area.
*   Net immigration monitoring of people in the local community. Population dynamics will be
monitored in sub-villages and around the project.
*   Fuel wood requirements for the local community will also be monitored to determine local
demand and develop p ossible s trategies su ch a s a gro-forestry, c ommunity f orest areas a nd
conservation of natural woodlands in the villages around the project.
Health indicators
The main health indicators to be monitored are water-bome diseases such bilharzias.
Description of parameters to be measured, methods to be employed, sampling locations,
frequency of measurements, detection limits (where appropriate) and definition of thresholds that
will signed the need for remedial actions, institutional responsibilities, timing and timescales for

9.5    INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
The fundamental area for consideration is empowerment of existing administrative and
organisational arrangements. These include farmers, local communities, both as a group as well as
in their individual capacities, in both upstream and downstream villages .The empowerment has to
be carried out through provision of capacity building, public awareness campaigns, tailor-made
training, etc.
As a strategic approach SIIC should strengthen partnership among the Igomelo community in the
use of water and land resources. Based on the adopted organisational-structure and job
descriptions of various committees to be established, for the operation of the scheme, a
framework should be established through which the stakeholders are able to actively engage in a
dialogue aimed at equitable and sustainable use of the common resources.
The project should firstly embark on a programme of key and strategic activities which are part of
the above outlined Environmental and Social Management Plan and should enhance attainment of
the above objectives. More specifically, the following are proposed:
*   Hold meetings of various committees as per agreement
*   Assist: (i) to organise ward or district- based farmers' day,
And (ii) participation in local and national events like farmers day
*   Undertake joint study visits
9.6    INPUTS REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS
Inputs
The following inputs will be required:
*   Human resources to enable capacity building for farmers, district officials and other
stakeholders
*   Involvement of NGOs, CBOs, local associations/societies etc to enable facilitation and
capacity building
*   Farmers labour
*   Private sector, residents, farmers' financial and material contributions.
*   Equipment/facilities
*   Transport/communications
*   Evaluation and monitoring facilities
Outputs
The following outputs are expected:
*   Enhanced capacity of district staff and stakeholders

10.CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.1 CONCLUSION
10.1.1 General conclusion
Based on review of baseline information, field visits to Igomelo irrigation scheme and data
analyses; it is evident that there are environmental and social issues/impacts/problems which need
to be addressed in order to ensure sustainable and sound operation of the irrigation scheme. As
outlined in above chapters (among others): in up-stream areas of the scheme, the key issues
constraining sustainability are increased incidences of forest fires as well changes of the river's
hydrological and hydraulic regime. In within-scheme areas the constraints are general poor soil
fertility coupled with land hoarding practices .In down-stream area sustainability is mainly
constrained by inadequacy of skills/knowledge of the farmers on appropriate irrigation practices.
These constrains manifest either to upstream environmental degradation, (particularly of the
catchments area), or within-the-scheme impacts, (e.g. due to inappropriate irrigation practices), or
also in down -stream areas (due to uncontrolled water abstractions) leading to community
conflicts.
Baseline data with comprehensive benchmark parameters related to various studies like
hydrogeology, socio-economic, environment, water quality, etc. at catchments and irrigation levels
were not a vailable i n t he a rea. E nvironment a nd s ocial a ssessment i mpact r equires "before a nd
after" studies, and perhaps experience from similar environments to facilitate assessment ofthe
severity of perceived problems. Quantification of impacts requires collection of data,
understanding of process and analysis of results, which takes more time and resources.
Through ecosystem, farming system and participatory approaches, the key impacts were identified
and, as far, as was possible, quantified. Additionally, measures pertaining to prevention and/or
control have been proposed. An Environmental and Social Management Plan for the Igomelo
irrigation scheme were developed.
10.1.2 Specific conclusions
Location
In conclusion, it was found that the location of the scheme does the following two things: It
enhances as well as undermines sustainability of the scheme. This is because the scheme is located
near a rapidly growing minor townships of Igawa, Rujewa as well as Mbarali, all of which detracts
people from practising irrigation while simultaneously also providing so much opportunities that
the location could facilitate and encourage irrigation practices.
Bio-physical environment
The Igomelo scheme lies in semi -arid area of Tanzania, where without irrigation, agriculture is
difficult to practice It was therefore found in conclusion that scheme improvement has been very
beneficial to the local community, and as a matter of fact the local community values it seriously.
Socio-economic environment
Field observations indicated irrigation agriculture is the major socio-economic activity of
settlements around Igomelo scheme. The minor townships also provide several opportunities for
income generation. Most people have ambitions to acquire more and more farmlands and hence,
supply of water resources from the Mbarali River does not meet demands.
Again, field observations indicated positively about the socio-culturally aspect of the people of the
area in that they are very hard working and are also very keen to practice irrigation agriculture.
However, their major constraints are lack of credit facilities and capital coupled with inadequacy
of empowerment with which to face the on-going competition and conflicts in both the acquisition
and uses of both land and water resources
61



Identified impacts
It is important that both positive and negative aspects of development emerge in assessment of
impacts because these are what motivate people to take willingly irrigation agriculture
Positive impacts
In the case of Igomelo scheme positive impacts include:
* Improved land and water management
* Increased income and production, leading to poverty alleviation
Negative impacts
The negative impacts identified up-stream of Igomelo is hydraulic changes i.e. in terms of changes
in flow regime e.g. leading to erosion of river banks. Within scheme impacts are poor soil quality
due to irrigation malpractices, and health effect caused by water conditions; this is similar situation
with down-stream areas.
Mitigation measures
A number of mitigation measures were proposed to address the iclentified impacts. As far as
possible, preventive management measure are given priority in combating soil and water pollution,
catclments degradation, and pollution of the river and disease control.
Compliance with the Tanzanian legislation and World Bank Safeguard Policies
The study team has demonstrated that the Igomelo irrigation scheme is in compliance with the
Tanzanian legislation and policies, and World Bank Safeguard Policies.
10.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
Role of Local Government authorities
Most of the identified mitigation measures are related with local community-based organization.
This means that the measures c an b e i mplemented b y l ocal g overnment a uthorities themselves
with financial and technical support from funded projects e.g. RBMSIIP, NGOs and CBOs.
Partnership building
It i s r ecommended t hat a rrangements b e made t o s hare e xperience a nd i nformation f rom o ther
partners in the area like SMUWK, SUA research project in Usangu plains, IFAD, etc. SIIC and
ECU could collaborate with these stakeholders in implementation of environmental management
interventions, which are relevant to Igomelo irTigation scheme and others in Rufiji River Basin.
In order to minimize water and land use conflicts, stakeholders of Rufiji River Basin in general
should work together as partners to improve production and sustainable development of the
watershed management and the scheme's sustainable development.
Similar projects should develop institutional arrangements geared to share responsibility (decision
making) for catchments management plan and prevention management activities in the Rufiji
River Basin. A partnership approach, however, also needs an appropriate institutional framework,
which clearly lays on the roles and responsibilities of each project, district councils and
stakeholders. Community and farmers participation could be solicited in planning, management,
financing, construction and maintenance of catchments areas and receiving bodies.
62



Environmental and social impact management plan and monitoring
A participatory environmental and social impact plan and monitoring system has been developed
for the Igomelo irrigation schemes. There is need to establish process-based plan and monitoring,
to build capacity of scheme management team and to develop a databank on the environmental
and social impact management plan including the monitoring plan.
Capacity Building
In order to ensure sustainability of the scheme stakeholders of all levels have to participate in the
capacity-building program. The levels include, namely the following; individual farmers,
households, farmer's associations/groups/scheme commnittees, village/ward government, and also
district authorities as well as both public and private organisations: NGOs, CBOs etc.
Baseline Studies
It is vital for any sustainable smallholder irrigation development and management in the river
basin that there is a minimum knowledge about water resources and quantified (baseline data)
related to environmental and social issues. It is therefore, proposed that a mechanism for regular
collection of baseline data be established some baseline studies and investigations should be
undertaken in the future smallholder irrigation improvement projects.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF GROUP
B IRRIGATION SCHEMES
PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has been implementing River Basin
Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP) since 1996 through IDA
credit.  The project aims at (i) strengthening the government capacity to manage its water
resources in an integrated and comprehensive manner that ensure equitable, efficiency and
sustainable development of the resource and address water related environmental concerns at the
National level and in the Rufiji and Pangani basins: and (ii) Improve irrigation efficiency of
selected smallholder traditional irTigation schemes in these two basins.  The Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Security and the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development are
implementing the project.
The Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component of the project is focusing on the
improvement of existing  traditional irrigation schemes.  Under existing World Bank
Environmental Policy (OP/BP 4.01), the River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation
Improvement Project (RBMSIIP) have been classified as a category "B" project requiring a limited
environmental analysis and, if necessary the inclusion of mitigation measures in project design.
This is essence means that no major enviromnental impacts are expected and that only mitigation
measures can be incorporated into the scheme design, implementation and operation (SAR 1995)
SCOPE OF WORK
The Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Irrigation section carried out the Initial Environmental
Examination (IEEs) in 15 traditional Irrigation schemes to ascertain environmental issue and
suggest mitigation measures that have to be incorporated during scheme design, Construction and
Operation and Maintenance. Based on the IEE findings, I EE Reports were prepared as part of
Scheme Improvement Assessment Studies.
The consultants in collaboration with ECU will be required to carry out Environmental Audit in
seven (7) group B Scheme of Ruanda Majenje, Igomelo, Mangalali, Nyamahana, Soko, Kainbi ya
Tanga and Mahenge irrigation schemes. The consultant did environmental Review of Lemkuna
irrigation scheme in 2001, thus it requires an Environmental and Social Management Plan only.
The schemes are now in operation phase.
The assignment is a continuation of the last activities of Environmental Audit of group A and C
irrigation schemes. This will be done in accordance with GoT and World Bank safeguard policies

AVAILABLE REPORTS
The reports available at the Irrigation Section (PFT) include Initial Environmental Examnination,
Engineering, Socio-Economic, Topographical Surveys, Agronomy/Agriculture  and Water
Resource Studies.
The consultant is therefore required to compile quantitative and qualitative information from these
supplemented by field visit in order to have baseline information on environmental issues to
develop a model for future review of Initial Environmental Examination reports under RBMSIIP.
TIMING
The consultant is expected to spend about five month starting May 2003.
OUTPUTS
The consultant will be required to produce 17 copies of reports for each irrigation scheme for
review by NEMC in hard copy and in MS Word diskette for submnission to World Bank for review.
The document should address the following issues:
* Analysis of Engineering, Socio Economic, Agricultural, Soils and Water Resources reports m
order to provide quantitative information given the qualitative information in the IEE reports.
* Compliance with EIA procedures according to the Government of Tanzania and World Bank
guidelines.
* Proper methodology and approach including criteria for assessment,
* Integrated Pest Management.
* Prepare Environmental Management plan to specify clearly who and when mitigation
measures can be implemented.

APPENDIX 3                   Participatory Environmental and Social Action Plan



APPENDIX        4              World Bank Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). Outlines Bank policy and procedure for the
environmental assessment of Bank lending operations. The Bank undertakes environmental
screening of each proposed project to determine the appropriate extent and type of EA. The Bank
classifies the project into one of four categories, depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and
the scale of the project and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts.
RBMSIIC is Category B.
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04). The conservation of natural habitats, like other measures that
protect and enhance the environment, is essential for long-term sustainable development. The
Bank does not support projects involving the significant conversion of natural habitats unless there
are no feasible alternatives for the project and its citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates
that overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If the
environmental assessment indicates that a project will significantly convert or degrade natural
habitats, the project includes mitigation measures acceptable to the Bank. Such mitigation
measures include, as appropriate, minimizing habitat loss (e.g. strategic habitat retention and post-
development restoration) and establishing and maintaining an ecologically sinmiilar protected area.
Pest Management (OP 4.09). The policy supports safe, affective, and environmentally sound pest
management. It promotes the use of biological and environmental control methods. An assessment
is made of the capacity of the country's regulatory framework and institutions to promote and
support safe, effective, and enviromrientally sound pest management.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/IP 4.12). The resettlement policy is triggered when people are
affected by loss of land, loss of property and/or loss of access to resources. It is therefore irrelevant
whether or not the impact will entail physical relocation of the affected people, the policy is
triggered in all such cases This means that the impact may be of such kind that only compensation
in cash or kind is necessary.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). This directive provides guidance to ensure that indigenous people
benefit from development projects, and to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of Bank-financed
development projects on indigenous people Measures to address issues pertaining to indigenous
peoples must be based on the informed participation of the indigenous people themselves.
Forests (OP/BP 4.36). This policy applies to the following types of Bank-financed investment
projects (a) projects that have or may have impacts on the health and quality of forests, (b) projects
that affect the rights and welfare of people and their level of dependence upon or interaction with
forests, and (c) projects that aim to bring about changes in the management, protection, or
utilization of n atural f orests o r plantations, whether they a re publicly, privately, or communally
owned. The Bank does not finance projects that, in its opinion, would involve significant
conversion or degradation of critical forest areas or related critical habitats. If a project involves
the significant conversion or degradation of natural forests or related natural habitats that the Bank
determines are not critical, and the Bank determines that there are no feasible alternatives to the
project and its citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits from the
project substantially outweigh the environmental costs, the Bank may finance the project provided
that it incorporates appropriate mitigation measures.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37). For the life of any dam, the owner is responsible for ensuring that
appropriate measures are taken and sufficient resources provided for the safety to the dam,
irrespective of its funding sources or construction status. The Bank distinguishes between small
and large dams. Small dams are normally less than 15 m in height, this category includes, for
example, farm ponds, local silt retention dams, and low embankment tanks. For small dams,
generic dam safety measures designed by qualified engineers are usually adequate.
Cultural Property (OPN 11. 03). The term "cultural property" includes sites having archaeological
(prehistoric), palaentological, historical, religious, and unique natural values. The Bank's general
policy regarding cultural property is to assist in their preservation, and to seek to avoid their
elimination. The Bank (i) normally declines to finance projects that will significantly damage non-



replicable cultural property, and will assist only those projects that are sited or designed to prevent
such damage, and (ii) will assist in the protection and enhancement of cultural properties
encountered in Bank-financed projects, rather than leaving that protection to chance. The
management of cultural property of a country is the responsibility of the government. The
government's attention will be drawn specifically to what is known about the cultural property
aspects of the proposed project site. Appropriate agencies, NGOs, or university departments will
be consulted if there are any questions concerning cultural property in the area, and a brief
reconnaissance survey will be undertaken in the field by a specialist.
Projects on International Waterwvays (7.50). The Bank recognizes that the cooperation and good
will of riparian is essential for the efficient utilisation and protection of international waterways
and attaches great importance to riparian making appropriate agreements or arrangement for the
entire waterway or any part thereof. Projects that trigger this policy include hydroelectric,
ilTigation, flood control, navigation, drainage, water and sewerage, industrial, and similar projects
that involve the use or potential pollution of international waterways. The riparian are being
notified i n a ccordance with t his p olicy, no a dditional s teps n eed t o b e t aken a t t he I evel o f t he
subprojects.
Disputed Areas (OP/BP/ 7.60): Projects in disputed areas may occur between the Bank and its
member countries as well as between the borrower and one or more neighbouring countries. Any
dispute over an area in which a proposed project is located requires formal procedures at the
earliest possible stage. The Bank attempts to acquire assurance that it may proceed with a project
in a disputed area if the governments concerned agree that, pending the settlement of the dispute,
the project proposed can go forward without prejudice to the claims of the country having a
dispute.
