1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

NOTE. The Second Rural Employment Project (SREP) became effective on November
28, 2003, was scheduled to be implemented over a sixty-seven month period and due to
close on June 30, 2009. However, due to the country's favorable balance of payments
and unexpected high revenue from its oil exports, the Government of Algeria decided to
cancel its outstanding loans with the Bank. As a result, the loan IBRD for SREP was
officially closed on October 6, 2006, after an implementation period of thirty-four
months. The Government prepaid the disbursed part of the loan and continued the
implementation of the project using the country's own financial resources. This ICR
therefore covers the first thirty-four months of SREP implementation during which the
IBRD loan was effective. The ICR does not cover the full project implementation period
(up to completion) as SREP is still under implementation.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

The rural sector in Algeria bears a disproportionate burden in terms of poverty,
unemployment and underemployment. Seventy percent of the poor in Algeria live in rural
areas and there is a close relationship between poverty and unemployment. The rural
areas are affected by underemployment due to the seasonal nature of agricultural
activities, hence agricultural labor productivity is considerably lower than that in other
sectors. Agriculture is also highly susceptible to climatic variability, particularly drought,
with some regions more seriously affected than others.            This results in risk-averse
technology choices by producers, with low levels of investment and technology and low
average yields in critical (strategic) field crops, such as cereals.

In order to stimulate the rural and agricultural sectors, the Algerian Government (GOA)
developed a National Agricultural Development Plan (Plan National de Développement
Agricole - PNDA) in 2000. In 2002, the rural dimension was added to the PNDA which
became the National Agricultural and Rural Development Plan (Plan National de
Développement Agricole et Rural - PNDAR). The PNDAR gave priority to agricultural
and rural development and focused on employment, sustainable development and
preservation of natural resources. The objectives of the PNDAR were: (a) food security;
(b) exploitation of resources based on identified potential; and (c) protection of the
environment. One important aspect of the PNDAR is that it relied more on decentralized
processes and beneficiaries' participation as a means to ensure sustainability and further
growth.

The First Rural Employment Project (REP) (1997-2004). In 1996, GOA sought Bank
assistance to finance the REP with its main objective "to generate and stimulate rural
employment in poor rural areas of Northwestern Algeria. REP was conceived in a post
conflict environment as the country was coming out of what was called the "black years"
during which armed conflicts paralyzed economic activities and displaced thousands of
rural families. As stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the project was




                                                1

addressing the problem of rural employment while emphasizing natural resource
management and protection of the environment.

REP was in line with GOA's policy of promoting employment creation and poverty
reduction, and the 1996 Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The policy gave
priority to: (a) labor-intensive rather than capital-intensive works; (b) small scale
investments accessible to small entrepreneurs; and (c) a participatory rather than a top-
down approach towards rural communities, calling for beneficiaries' participation in
project design and implementation in order to achieve greater local relevance and
sustainability of project investments.

The ICR for REP indicates that the project achieved its development objective. Through
the adoption of labor-intensive techniques, it financed 9.8 million person-days of wages
representing the equivalent of about 41,000 person-years, slightly over the 40,000
targeted at appraisal. This mainly benefited the unemployed and underemployed rural
youth and generated cash incomes of some DA 3.4 billion (US$46 million). In addition,
investments such as erosion control infrastructure created under the project and requiring
longer term maintenance are providing sustained employment to local communities. On
the other hand, agricultural development investments created under the Project generated
new permanent employment for about 30,000 farmers. Returns from the new crops added
some US$4,200 per year in terms of net profit plus wages paid to hired labor. Rural
women were able to find long-term employment opportunities and income through the
small scale production units created under this project. In addition, project-financed roads
facilitated farming and trade, improved local incomes and reduced the economic and
social isolation of the rural communities.

The Second Rural Employment Project (SREP) (2003-2006). Based on the successful
outcome of REP, GOA requested a second rural employment project to be implemented
in a different part of Algeria, the Northwestern part of Central Algeria of the country,
where poverty and land degradation problems were similar to those encountered under
the first phase in the northwestern region.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The Project Development Objective was to generate and stimulate employment in the
rural parts of the Project Area through: (i) direct employment to address the short term
problem of high levels of rural unemployment; and (ii) asset creation with a medium to
long term perspective for sustainable employment by increasing and diversifying
agricultural production.

In the short term, the SREP aimed to respond to the critical problem of unemployment in
the target rural areas through direct employment creation, using labor-intensive civil
works for natural resource management (in particular, soil and water conservation and
erosion control). In the longer term, it aimed to promote durable employment creation
through asset creation and both on and off-farm income-generating activities.

SREP was consistent with both the Bank's rural development strategy and the Middle
East and North Africa (MNA) Regional Strategy by emphasizing the social problems of
poverty and unemployment; the focus on gender issues and rural women; and the


                                            2

development of the private sector, specifically of the small and medium enterprises
(SME). The project was also consistent with GOA's strategies as expressed in the
Economic Rehabilitation Support Program (Programme de Soutien à la Relance
Economique - PSRE) and PNDAR.


The key indicators were:

    (a) creation of 36,000 person-years of direct employment through labor-intensive
        activities;
    (b) increase in rural household incomes and assets through increased production;
    (c) indirect employment and private sector development (PSD) effects from increased
        economic activity and incomes; and
    (d) improved capacity in the central and decentralized Ministry of Agriculture and
        Rural Development (MADR) and General Directorate of Forestry (DGF)
        administration through training and studies.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The project's main beneficiaries were 92,000 rural households (representing about 1.2
million people) underemployed and living in poverty in 92 rural communes in the
administrative regions (wilayates) of Tiaret, Tissemsilt, Chlef, Aïn Defla, Médéa and
Bouira.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Soil Erosion Control (Total cost: US$50.2 million; Bank financing:
                US$40.14 million)

This component was to help create direct short-term employment, using labor-intensive
techniques to implement mainly natural resource management activities targeting the
critical problem of soil erosion. The component would generate employment for
populations living in and around forests. Specific activities included reforestation, river
bank management, terracing and biological control, flood control infrastructure, forestry
rehabilitation and silviculture activities. Reforestation and silviculture were to involve
forest trees and, whenever feasible, fodder production in the agro-pastoral systems. A
participatory approach was to be adopted to facilitate the selection of activities reflecting
community and government priorities.

Component 2: Agricultural Development (Total cost: US$66.7 million; Bank financing:
                US$34.44 million)


                                             3

This component was to address employment generation in the medium and long-term in
areas practicing in a cereal-livestock system and help them diversify the production base
by developing fruit tree production. Specific activities listed under this component were:
rain-fed and irrigated fruit tree plantations; viticulture; windbreaks; land clearing; rural
roads (upgrading and rehabilitation); small livestock production; cuniculture, beekeeping
and handicraft activities, of which three specifically targeting women. Beneficiaries were
to contribute 50 percent of costs, either in cash or kind (mainly labor for digging and
planting the trees). No mechanical methods would be used except for the deep ploughing
necessary for viticulture. For land clearing, beneficiaries would contribute 30 percent of
costs ­ financially or in the form of labor. Extension services were to be provided through
the Regional Agricultural Services Directorates (DSA - Directions des Services
Agricoles) and the Regional Forestry Directorates (CDF - Conservations des Forêts).

Component 3: Water Resource Mobilization (Total Cost: US$ 15.5 million; Bank
               financing: US$12.40 million)

As water resource mobilization was critical to agricultural production and any other
human activity, this component aimed at capturing and managing existing water
resources in order to relieve some of the risks arising from variable agro-climatic
conditions and make clean potable water available to rural populations. The specific
activities under this component were small hill dams (retenues collinaires); water points;
rehabilitation of springs; and shallow (30­50 m) and deep (50­100 m) wells. The
building of small hill dams (lower than 15 m) was to comply with the Bank's Safeguards
Policies related to Safety of Dams (OP 4.37). Prior environmental impact studies and
prior establishment and training of water users associations were required.

Component 4: Institutional Development for DGF (Total Cost: US$4.6 million; Bank
financing: US$3.16 million)

This component was to support DGF structures and staff at central and regional levels. It
covered diverse activities such as training, studies, consultant services and equipment and
vehicles. The two important elements of this component were the training in participatory
approaches for project staff involving both genders and the establishment of a monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) system.

Component 5: Institutional Development for the MADR (Total Cost: US$5.2 million;
               Bank financing: US$3.45 million)

This component was to promote institutional development activities for MADR at both
the central and decentralized levels in the form of training on (a) rural development
strategies; (b) impact assessment of development policies and policy analysis
instruments; (c) M&E instruments and methods; and (d) pilot integrated rural
development projects.

Unallocated Amount: US$0.95 million.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised; however, the volumes targeted for some activities
were adjusted to meet beneficiaries' demands based on the findings of the field surveys
conducted at the start of the project period, as follows:

· Component 1: modifications in volume were made in riverbank management (-4%),
    terracing (-8%), forest rehabilitation (+3%) and reforestation (+14%); and
· Component 2: targets for beekeeping and poultry production activities were increased
    (+5%) while fruit tree plantations areas were slightly reduced (-2%). Cuniculture
    activities, on the other hand, were significantly reduced (-37%) then canceled due to
    lack of initial reproduction stock and lack of demand as rabbit meat is not
    traditionally consumed in most parts of Algeria.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

With the sharp rise in world oil prices in 2005-06, Algeria's oil revenues (an oil exporting
country) increased dramatically. This is the reason for GOA's decision to pay back its
foreign debt and cancel its ongoing loans. On February 1, 2006, GOA requested the
cancellation of the non-committed balance of several IBRD loans, including of SREP,
and undertook to pursue the implementation of these projects using its own financial
resources. The initial loan was for US$95 million and the non-committed balance of
US$81.56 million was canceled on May 17, 2006, reducing the loan to an amount of
US$13.44 million. On October 4, 2006, GOA requested a second cancellation of the
remaining US$5.78, representing the committed but non-disbursed balance of the revised
loan. GOA also fully prepaid US$7.66 million, equivalent to the disbursed portion of the
loan (principal outstanding) on May 8, 2006.

The loan was declared formally closed on October 4, 2006 but the Borrower effectively
stopped using IBRD loan funds as early as May 8, 2006 and continued to implement the
project using its own financial resources. Since the date of effectiveness was November
28, 2003, the disbursement of IBRD funds effectively occurred only during the first 29
months of the project implementation period. This ICR, however, formally covers the
period from November 28, 2003 (effectiveness) to October 4, 2006 (formally revised loan
closing date), representing a 34 months period. The initial project was expected to last 67
months, with a completion date of June 30, 2009. Since GOA continued implementing
the project using its own funds, this ICR will also mention project achievements beyond
the loan closing date, up to March 31, 2007.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)


                                              5

Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project design drew on the lessons learned from the
predecessor project, REP, as well as from the workshops and preliminary field surveys
conducted during project preparation. In addition, the project design was carried-out with
the full participation of the beneficiaries in order to promote community ownership and
commitment, and ensure sustainability beyond the project implementation period. The
critical risks were properly assessed.

The disbursement schedule should have taken into consideration the fact that little is
disbursed during the first year or two of implementation for this type of project because
the community-based participatory approach requires, once the project is effective, a
preliminary phase of community mobilization, organization and capacity building,
followed by the elaboration and approval of a Community Development Plan that defines
the investments to be funded under the project.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable)

As for most integrated rural development projects involving community participation,
SREP started slowly the first year in terms of physical and financial accomplishments
because of the time required for prior community mobilization and organization and
design of Community Development Plans. By the end of the third year, the project was
making significant progress and, by the time of the early closing of the loan after thirty
four months of implementation, it was progressing at a satisfactory speed and was on
target in view to achieve its final objective.

During Year 1, the implementing agency (General Directorate of Forestry - DGF),
focused on mobilizing the necessary human resources at the central and regional level. To
face the surge of activities caused by the project start up, the Central Project Management
Unit (CPMU) was reinforced with additional staff recruited under contract and trained.
Similarly, at the regional level, decentralized Regional Project Coordination and
Management Units (CCGW) who were also trained were established mainly using
existing staff from the implementing agency. Year 1 was also spent in preparing the first
contracts for works as these could not be prepared prior to project approval due to the
demand-driven and participatory nature of the project. Bank procurement procedures
were new to the decentralized procurement commissions and staff had to be trained.

Effective field work started in the second year and, by the end of the third year, 426
contracts for works and 36 contracts for services were processed. This constituted an
unusual and heavy work load for both the project staff and the procurement commissions.
Because of the priority given to project implementation, some of the staff training
scheduled in Year 2 was moved to Year 3 (2006), by which time the services of the
implementing agency were fully operational and all necessary financial and material
resources were made available to the project implementation units.

Up to the loan closing date, none of the critical risks envisaged at project identification
were triggered except for the adverse climate effects as the first year of planting (Year 3)
was compromised by very low rainfall and drought. This was however corrected during
the Year 4 planting season, after the loan closing date.



                                              6

The project's mid-term review was not carried-out as the Loan was prematurely canceled
and closed before the mid-term review could take place.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Due to the limited capacity of the implementing agency, at the time of project appraisal,
to carry out the project M&E task, it was decided that this would be executed by an
external agency. An international bidding process was launched but was declared
unsuccessful as the financial offers made were several times higher than the expected
cost and budget estimates. It was therefore decided to set up an in-house M&E system to
be completed by punctual external impact evaluations. The CPMU was reinforced by the
recruitment of the expert who was working for the external agency responsible for the
M&E system for the first Rural Employment Project and was in charge of the M&E
system. After the closing date, the implementing agency decided that its staff was
sufficiently trained in M&E and that the contract for the M&E expert did not need to be
renewed. Such a decision should have been delayed for an additional year in order to
fully implement a state-of-the-art M&E system for the project and assist forestry
department and other departments of MADR in setting up similar systems. Nonetheless,
the system currently in place for the project is effective and provides the essential data
required for satisfactory project monitoring and evaluation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Environment Safeguards: Environmental Safeguards were triggered under this project
and in particular the Environmental Assessment Policy (O.P. 4.01).

The environmental assessment for the project identified all relevant impacts and detailed,
as part of an Environmental Management Plan, a screening procedure to ensure that all
sub-projects would be first reviewed to assess their potential impacts and define the
proper mitigating measures. This was found to satisfy the safeguards requirement for this
project, considering its demand-driven and participatory nature where the detailed list of
activities is not known at the onset of the project. All the prerequisites set forth by the
other applicable environmental safeguards policies were taken into account. For activities
such as hill dams, reforestation and rural roads, the project carried out detailed
environmental assessments. The hill dams to be built under the project were subjected to
a feasibility study and also to an environmental impact assessment. The same was done
for the reforestation activities.

The Project Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) included an environmental
specialist. Both the CPMU Regional Project Coordination and Management Units were
provided guidance in terms of screening and environmental safeguards procedures.
Among others, the Bank advised the staff on how to assess the situation in terms of use of
pesticides. Although these pesticides could not be procured under the loan, they could be
purchased by farmers in the local market. The team discussed with the project teams the
steps for carrying out such assessment.

Social Safeguards: Social Safeguards Policies were not triggered under this project
because the complex legal environment governing expropriation practices and the



                                             7

complexity of customary land tenure laws meant that no land was expected to be acquired
within the time-frame of the project. Therefore, project design opted for using public land
or land that was voluntarily donated by communities to construct the 12 hill dams.

The project put in place a rigorous system for verifying land ownership and use in the
suggested areas and hired a consultant to verify if lands donated were indeed done on a
voluntary basis. The Bank also included a review of this process as part of its supervision
missions. As an illustration, of the 12 sites initially identified for hill dams, only seven
passed the Bank's OP 4.12 test and are currently undergoing technical feasibility and
environmental impact studies. Whenever communities had difficulty reaching consensus
on donating land for this purpose the sites were relocated to neighboring public land.
Such screening could not be done prior to project start because the target communities
could not be precisely identified upfront and their specific needs were not known.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed
by present operation, O & M arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Although the Borrower cancelled the balance of the loan and prepaid the disbursed
portion, it has decided to pursue the implementation of the project as initially designed,
using its own budgetary resources. The table below indicates that, of a total project cost
of US$142.89 million, the cumulative disbursements as of September 30, 2006, were
US$21.31 million (Borrower US$11.08 million, IBRD US$7.66 million and
Beneficiaries US$2.57 million).From October to December 2006, GOA disbursed
US$2.67 million equivalent of its own funds. For 2007-2008, it allocated US$65.27
million equivalent, of which US$37.27 million had already been committed. The balance
of US$53.64 million equivalent is unlikely to be spent in the remaining first six months
of 2009 but GOA plans to extend the project for another year to complete all the tasks
initially identified under this project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

As indicated in Section 1.1, the project was aligned with GOA's strategy towards fighting
poverty and reducing unemployment. It was also in line with the objectives of the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy aimed at increasing employment and improving the
effectiveness of GOA's rural strategies and policies. The project design was sound and
based on the findings of the REP, the preliminary surveys and workshops were conducted
during project preparation with the participation of the beneficiaries. In order to
maximize labor utilization and local income generation, mechanized works were
excluded.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDOs)
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details
on outputs in Annex 2)

By the revised loan closing date of October 4, 2006, a total of 1.64 million person-days of
direct (first generation) employment were created due to the simple creation of the
project investments. This is equivalent to about 6,400 person-years (PY) and represents
74% of the targeted figure for that period (8,600 PY) and 18% of the final target (36,000
PY). This last rate appears low considering that the project is at the end of its third year
of implementation but it is a known fact that this kind of project always has a slow initial
uptake during the firs two years then, gradually, gains momentum. This was the case in
the first Rural Employment Project.

Based on the current wage rates, the direct -first generation- additional rural income
generated was US$12 million as of September 30, 2007. The table below indicates the
direct employment by component created.

           Components

1. Soil Erosion Control               22,684     5,514        4,511       20%            82%
2. Agricultural Development           12,621     2,868        1,759       14%            61%
3. Water Resource Mobilization         1,178      222          123        10%            55%

               Total                  36,483     8,604        6,393       18%            74%
Note: 1 person-year = 240 person-days

In addition to the direct -first generation- employment created by the simple establishment
of project investments, indirect -second generation- employment were created when
populations started putting some of these investments into production or were involved in
their operation and maintenance.



                                                 9

The longer term objective of creating assets for stimulating more sustainable employment
(indirect -second generation- employment) in the project areas was only partly achieved, as the
project is still under implementation.      It is estimated that the first investments created
(particularly the tree and vineyard plantations) and the income-generating activities initiated
(micro-réalisations) have generated about 7,600 jobs, mainly for production and maintenance
activities. In total, 11,000 households (of which 1,800 are lead by women) have already
benefited from second generation employment.

Expertise was developed at the regional level in dealing with the private sector, preparing
and processing procurement documents and contracts and promoting competition. As a
result, the project supported the emergence of 110 new small and medium local private
enterprises that were awarded a total of 426 contracts for works. This constitutes a plus for
the local economy.

Confidence between GOA agency staff and communities was improved through
improved communication skills and dialogue and the financing of income-generating
activities.

In addition to the creation of employment and substantial socioeconomic benefits to the
participating population, a large part of the works were aimed at preserving or improving
the conditions of the natural resource base (soil, water and vegetation) and protecting the
environment. As described in the table in Annex 2, a total of 1,239 ha of forest tree
plantations were established, 762 ha of natural forest were treated and 303,000 m3 of
earth work for soil and water conservation were completed as of October 2006. By March
2007, these figures had significantly increased (4,130 ha, 3,255 ha and 362,000 m3
respectively). The environmental impact of these actions has not yet materialized and
will not before several more years, however, it has been scientifically demonstrated that
they will increase the vegetation cover and in the long run, will increase carbon
sequestration, reduce soil erosion and water runoff, protect watersheds, prevent water
reservoir from silting and protect socioeconomic infrastructure.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms,
least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Since GOA decided to cancel the IBRD loan for this project less than three years after its
official starting date, but de facto after two years of effective project implementation, the
calculation of an economic rate of return (ERR), at this stage, would be difficult to carry
out. It was recommended that individual income-generating investments be subject to a
cost-benefit analysis to ensure their financial sustainability for the beneficiaries.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Satisfactory.

By October 2006, project accomplishments were 18% of the project's targeted values but
were 74% of the prorated values for Year 3. Since (a) most of the issues that were raised
in Year 1 were, at the time of this ICR, resolved; (b) the project started moving at a
satisfactory pace; and (c) the progress recorded for the period October 2006 through


                                               10

March 2007 (see table in Annex 2) confirm that achievements had significantly
improved, it is considered that the project deserves a "Satisfactory" rating for its overall
outcome.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

The project's impact on poverty alleviation is measured in terms of employment
generation. In the short-term, the project generated 1.64 million person-days of direct
employment, equivalent to about 6,400 Person Years utilized mainly to create durable
investments which in turn created permanent jobs for their maintenance. Since this ICR is
based on data at loan closing, but before project implementation completion, impacts
cannot be measured but can be projected based on effective actions already implemented.
It is expected that investments such as agricultural activities will generate downstream
production, processing and marketing activities which will translate into revenues and
further stimulate the local economy.        In terms of social development, improved
communication through the creation and/or repair of access roads has made it possible to
link isolated rural communities to urban centers and markets.

More than 1,800 women received support from the project for income-generating
activities. About 50% of these women were provided beehives and trained in the
production of honey, a high value-added product on the local market. Similarly, about
700 women were given sewing equipment and trained in its utilization. This is expected
to provide them with additional income in the near future. In terms of social impact, the
first Rural Employment Project experience showed that most of the additional income
earned by women was utilized for improving the nutrition, health and education of the
family members, principally children. The preliminary survey carried out in 2002 in the
SREP targeted area confirmed this pattern.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)

The project contributed to the strengthening of the implementing agency in the area of
participatory approach; dialogue with the communities; decentralization; multi-sector
project design and implementation; results-based project program design; and M&E. No
institutional restructuring or reorganization was required, only a change in approaches to
development and to modes of operation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The assessments of risk to development outcome at appraisal (A) and at the time of loan
closing (C) are indicated in the table below.

Nine of the above 13 criteria had their ratings remain unchanged and four had theirs
improved. Government staff ­ community relationship (criteria 2 and 6) has greatly
improved. Security conditions (criteria 8) have significantly improved although security
remains a problem in some areas. Rural development strategies and policies (criteria 5)
are being fine tuned, implementation programs have been adopted and are being
implemented.        MADR recently launched the Locally-Based Integrated Rural
Development Project (Projets de Proximité de Développement Rural Intégré - PPDRI)
that draws lessons from both REP and SREP and intends to replicate them in other parts
of the country. MADR has sought the Bank's advice on how to implement this program
and set up an effective M&E system. It is expected that such technical assistance will
contribute to a decrease in the above risks in the future.

Based on the above, the Overall Risk Rating has been changed from Substantial to
Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Satisfactory

Project identification was carried out with the assistance of two local consulting firms
that had a very good understanding of the national and local environment. The Bank
preparation mission organized two workshops and field surveys in 2002 that helped
design a project that reflected the needs and expectations of the targeted populations. Key
actors involved in REP were invited to the workshops to share their experiences. In
October 2003, the Borrower and the Bank organized a project launch workshop attended
by several stakeholders including the Ministry of Finance and the Algerian Development
Bank (BAD). At this occasion, working groups were organized around different project-
related themes. The workshops helped stakeholders in understanding the project purpose,
its implementation mechanisms and calendar and the role each partner was expected to
play.

A preliminary survey, using project staff who received basic training in participatory
approaches, assisted by trainers who had received training under the REP and
coordinated by a team of consultants, used diverse techniques to assess the needs and
constraints of men and women in the project zones. This was a new experience for both
the project staff and the beneficiaries, the former for being able to work closely with the
beneficiaries and respond to their needs, and the latter to find GOA agencies interested in
their perspective on issues and priorities. As a consequence, project components were
modified during project preparation to reflect the critical constraints in the project zone.
These changes were mainly in the increased emphasis on water resource mobilization and
technical aspects of diversification. Ultimately, project implementation was conceived to
entail a degree of flexibility, as was the case under REP, to adapt to evolving conditions.

All other relevant aspects for ensuring quality at entry were addressed during preparation
(strategic relevance and approach, technical, financial and economic, poverty, gender and
social development, environmental, fiduciary, monitoring and evaluation, etc.).

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

Eight supervision missions were carried out by the Bank in these first three years of
project implementation. Very early on, the missions identified problems related to the
procurement procedures and most bids initiated at decentralized regional level (wilaya)
in Year-1 had to be revised. The Bank team provided advice and assistance to the CPMU
to improve procurement skills and prepared models of bidding documents and contracts
to be utilized. In March 2005, a local procurement consultant was hired by the project
which resulted in a significant improvement in the processing time for contracts.




                                              13

In the field, the Bank supervision teams provided expertise on technical, social and
environmental issues. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the project, its social and
environmental dimension and its geographical spread, the project would have certainly
benefited from more frequent supervisions by larger teams of experts but this would have
required supervision budgets beyond current norms.

The Bank carefully reviewed the project progress reports prepared by the CPMU and
provided regular comments and guidance. It also assisted in the redesign of the M&E
component and in the preparation of new Terms of Reference for that component.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Based on the above assessment, the overall Bank performance is rated
satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The General Directorate for External Financial Relations (DGRFE) in the Ministry of
Finance closely monitored and actively supported the implementation of the project;
following up quickly on any issue that required action. Except for delays in releasing the
funds from the Ministry of Finance to the implementing agency experienced in year 1,
the regular supply of funds to the project was satisfactory.

Similar interest and support was provided during the initial stage by the Directorate for
Investment Planning and Economic Studies in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (DPIEE). Cooperation and coordination between DGF and DPIEE were
frequent and excellent. Since change of leadership in both departments and loan closure,
the level of cooperation between both departments seems to have diminished.

Financial audits were carried-out regularly and were rated satisfactory.

After the cancellation of the IBRD loan, GOA continued to support the project as initially
designed and made all the necessary financial resources available to the project, and in a
timely manner. The project is currently in its fourth year of implementation and the rate
of achievement is satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies' Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

After a period of adjustment and resource mobilization in Year 1, the implementing
agency implemented the project with due diligence. The difficulties encountered in the
beginning in understanding and applying Bank procurement procedures were
subsequently overcome and the project teams were able to process 462 contracts for
works.

On the technical side, the works executed under the project by contractors were found
satisfactory by the supervision missions, indicating proper control and monitoring by the
project staff.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance


                                            14

Rating: Satisfactory
Based on the above explanations, the overall Borrower's experience is rated
"Satisfactory". It is important to highlight the fact that this project was being
implemented under conditions that remain precarious. After decades of centralized
administration and ten years of armed conflicts, the Algerian Administration is back on
its feet, has adopted the participatory approach and is promoting decentralization. Given
this context, the Borrower's current performance has to be commended. The low rates of
physical accomplishment and financial disbursement during the first two years are typical
for this type of demand-driven integrated rural development projects. In Year 3, a
positive trend appeared and performance improved. The results recorded as of the first
quarter of Year 4 are very promising (March 31, 2007 progress report).

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

SREP has demonstrated that it is possible to simultaneously resolve rural unemployment
problems and promote agricultural growth, improve the conditions of the natural resource
base and protect the environment. It has become obvious that such holistic approach
requires close collaboration between several government services (mainly Agriculture
and Rural Development, Water, Equipment and Infrastructure, and Local Collectivities)
and that local communities must be fully involved in the design and implementation of
the project in order to obtain best results and substantial sustainable benefits.

The funding of income-generating activities must be based on prior sound technical and
economic feasibility studies to avoid failing investments that would adversely affect the
beneficiaries financially and create mistrust vis-à-vis the Administration. Although
investment funding decisions were made using good and reliable information, more time
should be given in future for more sound feasibility studies.

As for most projects of this type, little is achieved, in physical terms, during the first two
years of implementation because the bottom-up and participatory approach requires that
most of the investments be designed and decided upon with the beneficiaries, after the
project is approved and becomes effective. Therefore, such projects should devise a
disbursement profile that reflects such specificity.

Note: The low financing rate for IBRD (8%) compared to the Borrower's rate is explained by the fact that
the Borrower stopped using IBRD funds immediately after its decision to cancel the loan (Feb. 01, 2006)
and started using its own financial resources while the official closing date was fixed as Oct 4, 2006.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Soil Erosion Control

Activities under this component were: reforestation, forest rehabilitation, silviculture,
terracing, riverbank protection and flood control structures (see Section 1.5 in the main
text). These activities aimed at generating 60% of the direct short-term employment
planned under the project while improving the conditions of the natural resource base. The
rates of physical achievement remain modest compared to the final project objectives fixed
for the five-year period. They were respectively 15%, 17%, 46%, 11%, 13%, and 38%. The
reasons for low performance were explained above in Section 2.2 and 5.2 reforestation,
forest rehabilitation, and silviculture were not ready until Year 3 of the project. The initial
bid advertised was for the supply of 18 million seedlings, a quantity that no single
contractor could produce. It was then decided to regionalize the contracts and make them
on an annual basis. This program is now moving fast and delays will likely be completed
by the end of the project.

Component 2: Agricultural Development

The main activities under this component (rainfed and irrigated fruit tree plantations;
viticulture; plant material production; windbreaks; land clearing; rural roads; small
livestock production; and handicraft activities aimed at creating longer term, sustainable
employment and income in addition to removing the isolation of remote villages and
facilitating communication.

One of the key thrusts was to encourage crop substitution in mountainous or hilly areas, to
replace annual crops (mainly cereals) by fruit tree plantations and viticulture that cause less
erosion and land degradation and have higher value-added. Achievements, compared to
final targets, have been good for rainfed fruit tree plantations and windbreaks (41% and
44% respectively) but lower for irrigated fruit tree plantations (31%) and vineyard
plantations (25%) because water resource mobilization needed to be secured before these
plantations were in place. The plantation program should have been scheduled to start one
or two years after the water resource mobilization program (Component 3) was executed.
The beekeeping and poultry production programs were achieved at 23% and 6%
respectively. As for most activities, the achievements were just starting to take of at the
time of the premature loan closure. This can be illustrated by the performance results
recorded as of March 31, 2007, six months after the formal loan closing date (see table
below). For instance, for the beekeeping program, the acquisition of beehives increased
from 4600 at the end of October 2006 to 8250 at the end of March 2007 bringing the rate of
achievement 23% to 40% in six months. Similarly, the poultry production program jumped
from 6,000 units (6%) to 24,000 units (24%) during the same period.

The rural road program is behind schedule because of the delays in carrying out the impact
evaluation studies. These studies were completed at the time of loan closing and final blue
prints were being finalized. Cuniculture was not started due to lack of reproduction stock
on the local market and a low demand for rabbit meat that is not part of Algerian culinary
tradition. It was decided to reallocate the resources to other activities for which the demand
is very high, principally to beekeeping activities that are also carried out by women. Since
this is a demand-driven project, the story about cuniculture is not considered as a failure
but, on the contrary, as a capacity of the project to be flexible and adjust to beneficiaries
needs and priorities.



                                                 18

Beneficiaries were directly involved in the choice, design and implementation of these
investments and proactively contributed in kind to their funding, providing the labor. This
represented up to 50% of the cost (in the case of fruit tree plantations).

Component 3: Water Resource Mobilization

Water resource mobilization is a prerequisite for the establishment of all the irrigated plantations
programmed under the project. The rates of establishment and/or rehabilitation of springs and
water points were 36% and 31% of total project projections. The programs for deep boreholes
and small hill dams were stalled.

(a) The boreholes program suffered from unexpected price hikes and from the fact that water
    depths were underestimated. In addition, the clearance procedures for the establishment of
    boreholes were underscored: boring permits granted by the Regional Water Directorate
    (Direction de l'Hydraulique de Wilaya - DHW) required a land title that most rural
    families did not possess. As a result, only 12 boreholes on public land could be approved out
    of 163 initially planned. There is a sense also that the Forestry Department lost some interest
    in initiating and funding this program which does not fall under its responsibility.

(b) As for the boreholes, the digging and restoration of wells also requires authorization from the
    Regional Water Directorate and cannot be obtained without land title. In total, 12 new wells
    were dug and 15 deepened or restored out of 150 and 100 respectively planned.

(c) The creation of small hill dams (retenues collinaires) had to satisfy Bank procedure (OP
    4.12) on Involuntary Resettlement that requires for each site, official documents be produced
    confirming that the legal owners of the land on which the dams were to be built formally
    agreed, on a voluntarily basis, to such construction. Unfortunately, most families do not
    possess a land title. Also, some of the land to be occupied by the dam reservoir was under
    cultivation. As a result, the procedures were very time consuming and, in some cases, could
    not be completed and, after more than one year, only seven out of the 12 dams were cleared
    for construction.

Component 4: Institutional Development for the DGF

This component includes training, studies, acquisition of equipment, material and vehicles, and
M&E. All equipment, material and vehicles were procured during the first year.

Studies.

The baseline survey was completed and the data collected are serving as a reference base to
measure the progress and changes which occurred over the project life, and its impact. The
environmental study fur the rural road program was completed. For the execution study on rural
roads, the bidding documents have been received. The environmental and feasibility studies for
small hill dams are in progress and the execution study will follow thereafter.

Training.

Five types of training were planned:

(a) Training in Planning and Management Techniques for decentralized projects. Two modules
    were planned: (i) M&E Methods for 30 people; and (ii) the training for Management
    Information Systems for 20 people. The first module was carried out by an Algerian private
    training institution and 26 people, including 9 women, were trained. All the trainees were
    from DGF, of which over half were staff from the central and regional PIUs.

(b) Training in Participatory Approach. Three modules were scheduled: (i) training of trainers (7
    people); (ii) training of Development Agents (60 people); and (iii) study tour for 20 people.


                                                19

   The training of trainers was carried out overseas and involved 14 people including three
   women. The training of development agent was postponed and is due in 2007 because of the
   priority given to the launching of the field activities that required the heavy mobilization of
   these agents. A first study tour was organized for 12 people.

(c) Training in Soil Conservation Techniques. Training was planned for 30 people and was
    completed by a first group of 13 project staff including 3 women. A study tour for 10 staff is
    scheduled in 2007 (after loan closing date) and will be funded through government budget.

(d) Training in Environmental Assessment. Planned for 20 people, this training, benefited a first
    group of 14 staff members including 5 women. Study tours for 15 staff are scheduled for
    2007.

(e) Technical Training for Local Community Members. The purpose of this training was to
    develop the technical skills for community members responsible for the management,
    maintenance of infrastructure and of equipment procured under the project. This training has
    not yet been executed due to unsuccessful bidding. This program is in addition to the training
    provided to community members who benefit from income-generating equipment and for
    which the training is provided by the supplier of the equipment.

Component 5: Institutional Development for MADR.

Four training sessions were scheduled:

   (a) Rural Development Policies and Strategies. This training was successfully
        completed for 116 staff of MADR, of which 83% came from field offices.

   (b) Project Management. The procurement process was canceled because the terms of
        reference were not respected. New Terms of Reference were being finalized at the
        time of preparation of the ICR.

   (c) Participatory Approach. A consulting firm was selected but contract negotiations
        failed to be completed in a timely and satisfactory manner. A new procurement
        process was being launched at the time of the ICR.

    (d) Pilot Integrated Rural Development Projects. The firm has been selected and the
        contract being finalized as of March 2007.

The Second Rural Employment Project (SREP) was carried out based on detailed studies
and takes into account government policies on mountainous area development, especially
those policies outlined in the National Agricultural Development Plan (PNDA).

The project covers 92 communes and an area of 14,272 km2, with a population of more
than 1,200,000 living in six wilayas of the country's central-west section, namely Tiaret,
Tissemsilt, Chlef, Ain Défla, Bouira and Médéa.

The project was implemented over five years starting in September 2004 at a total cost of
DA11,431,200.

The project objectives were stimulation of employment, rational natural resource
management, environmental protection, water resource mobilization, and development of
income-generating rural activities.

This approach was adopted during project implementation and includes labor intensive
activities and techniques to ensure beneficiary involvement and which is essential to
ensure sustainable development.

II.  Status of Implementation (November 30, 2006)

Financial Aspects

Three budget allocations were performed under the project:

   -    The first allocation (ND5.227.4.265.740.45 of May 10, 2004) amounted to DA
        1.8 billion and covered the first year provisional program and part of the second
        year.
   -    The second allocation (ND5.227.4.265.740.46 of June 1, 2005) amounted to DA 2
        billion and covered the remaining activities during the third year (2006), and a
        portion of activities under years 4 and 5.
   -    The fourth reallocation totaling DA 1.2 billion would cover remaining activities
        under years 4 and 5.

The only remaining allocation would be used for the water mobilization program, i.e., hill
dams, well digging and rehabilitation.

In summary, out of a total of DA 11.43 billion, budget allocations were undertaken for
DA 7.8 billion, representing a funding availability of 70%.         Total commitments,
including signed and approved contracts, reached DA 3.5 billion and actual expenditures
amounted to DA 1.38 billion, i.e., 40% in terms of commitments and 18% for budget
allocations.

      recruited and financial proposals will be opened on December 15, 2006.

  -   Hill dam implementation study: terms of reference are under preparation. This
      study will be launched following submission of the first initial feasibility study
      currently underway.

  -   Rural roads study: technical bids are currently under review.

  Training

  -   Mountainous land restoration techniques: this training was taken by two project
      engineers in June 2005, offered by the Montpellier IAM.




                                           30

    - Participatory approach: 12 engineers took this course offered by Montpellier
      IAM in June 2006.

    - Project planning and management:         this course was given by the Ecole de
      Formation en Techniques de Gestion from May 27 to December 2006. Twenty-
      five engineers participated.

    - EIA techniques: IAM Montpellier offered this course in November 2006 to 14
      engineers from 13 different wilayas.

    - Rural development and infrastructure management training:          this course was
      cancelled by DGF due to poor timing.

Component 5: Institutional Strengthening of MADR

    - Agricultural and rural development strategy development training: this
      course was offered by an international consulting firm. It was completed on June
      30, 2006, and 116 people attended this training.

      due to non-compliance with the terms of reference. New terms of reference were
      prepared by DPIEE of MADR and bid proposals will be launched.

    - Participatory approach: negotiations with the selected consulting firm did not
      result in contract finalization. New procedures will be launched.

    - Pilot projects in rural development (9): currently under negotiations with the
      French consulting firm BRL.

III. CONSTRAINTS

The project faced early constraints during implementation:

    - Delays in actual project launch due to the departure (for personal reasons) of CGP
      staff who had participated in training sessions during project preparation.

    - Transfer of project responsibility at the World Bank (due to retirement) which
      caused an adjustment period for counterpart staff.

    - Lack of knowledge on the Bank's procurement procedures which caused work
      delays in two wilayas (Médéa and Bouira) during year 2 (these two wilayas
      represented 38% of works committed during 2004).

    - Procurement units in the wilayas did not follow approval and signature
      procedures stipulated in the project Loan Agreement.

    - Initial staff deficits in important wilaya units and who were also managing other
      activities.

    - Large number of contracts due to the Bank's procedures which state that bids
      cannot exceed US$500,000.         This caused an increased workload for project
      management units at both the wilaya and central levels.

    - Difficult relationships existed between the various ANEP departments responsible
      for issuing bid documents. Thus, bid documents were published late and were
      poorly targeted.



                                            31

    -   Measures lacking initial focus, e.g., viticulture planned in geographically or
        socially unsuitable areas; or underestimated costs as in the case of well drilling
        and rural roads.


IV. MEASURES TAKEN


The following measures were taken to address the constraints mentioned above.

    · Publication of invitations to bid in daily national newspapers.
    · Preparation specific technical specifications for newly created enterprises.

    · Recruitment of contractual staff for conservation works.
    · Staff training in management and planning.

In order to implement the 2007 program, the following additional measures were taken.

    · Tiaret: the conversion of 500 ha in Years 3 and 4 of dune fixation works to
        reforestation (625 ha).

    · Tissemsilt: the conversion of 50 ha in Year 4 of viticulture to rustic fruit tree
        plantations (164 ha).

    · Chlef: the conversion of 500 ha in Year 3 of rustic fruit tree plantations to
        irrigated fruit tree plantations (320 ha).

    · Bouira: the conversion of 15 ha of viticulture planned for Year 4 to 31 ha of river
        bank fixation works.

    · Médéa: the conversion of 1,000 ha in Year 3 of rustic fruit tree plantations to new
        reforestation works (400 ha) and dam fixation works (320 ha).

    · Wells: cost allocation is low, thus conversion or cancellation.
    · Viticulture: conversion to rustic fruit tree plantations for Ain Défal Wilaya and
        reforestation for Bouira Wilaya.

    · Terracing: conversion to reforestation works for Médéa Wilaya.

V.    RESULTS AND IMPACTS

Short-terms results: the project was able to create a total of 1,848,148 work hours of
direct and immediate employment, equivalent to 7,701 jobs, through investments
financed under the project. This represents 74% of the total planned objective. This ratio
is satisfactory in light of constraints faced during the first year of the project. Moreover,

since the project's main objective was creation of labor in areas with a high rate of
unemployment, it is fair to say that this objective was achieved.

Currently, it is untimely to assess the longer term economic, social and environmental
impacts of the project. In the long term, a consulting firm will be retained to assess the
project impacts. In reality, the project is only in its second year of implementation.
However, it is clear that revenues derived from income-generating activities, especially
those targeting women, have mainly focused on improving accessibility to food,
nutrition, health and education. Upgrading and rehabilitation of rural roads has alleviated
the isolation faced by many communities by linking production areas with markets and
thus increasing agriculture's value added. The large number of contracts for works have
helped create 110 small and medium local enterprises which approved more than 400
contracts, greatly stimulating the local economy. The central and regional services of
MADR, more specifically the forestry service, were strengthened through training and
the provision of communication and transport equipment. Moreover, greater trust and
cooperation were achieved between government service departments and the
communities due to exchange of information, better communication and dialogue among
all concerned parties, as well as through wise investment decisions. The first investments
thus developed were able to subsequently generate a large number of permanent as well
as seasonal jobs (7,600) and were the direct result of management, development and
maintenance of these investments.

Through sound and sustainable management practices, a large number of investments
targeted environmental protection works as well as the preservation and rational
development of natural resources in the project area. As of end October 2006, 1,239 ha
of reforestation, 762 ha of forestry development and 303,000 m3 of torrential adjustments
were completed. These figures are expected to rise by March 2007. In the long term,
these works will help to increase the vegetation cover, and thus carbon emission
confinement; will reduce erosion, especially in watersheds, will protect social
infrastructures against flooding and dams against silting.


VI. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WORLD BANK

During the entire project life, the Bank regularly monitored operations and conducted
regular supervision missions in spite of the transfer of responsibility for the project.

In its early phase, the project faced procurement difficulties. However, through joint
efforts on the part of the Bank and DGF, measures taken had a positive impact: project
partners are now highly knowledgeable in Bank procedures.

Finally, the project would have greatly benefited from a mid-term review during its
second year to help identify initial areas of concern, to improve project performance and
to compensate for implementation delays.
