development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satsifactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) the project has demonstrated that it is\n            possible to simultaneously resolve rural unemployment\n            problems and promote agricultural growth, improve the\n            conditions of the natural resource base and protect the\n            environment; 2) the funding of income-generating activities\n            must be based on prior sound technical and economic\n            feasibility studies; 3) although investment funding\n            decisions were made using good and reliable information,\n            more time should be given in the future for more sound\n            feasibility studies; and 4) as for most projects of this\n            type, little is achieved, in physical terms, during the\n            first two years of implementation because the bottom-up and\n            participatory approach requires that most of the investments\n            be designed and decided upon with the beneficiaries, after\n            the project is approved and becomes effective."}, "docdt": "2007-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
