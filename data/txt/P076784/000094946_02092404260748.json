Basically, the\n            project entails agricultural diversification, substituting\n            crops, such as cereals, for reforestation on lands\n            susceptible to erosion, through high intensive labor, which\n            entails resettlement, along with infrastructure development,\n            and resources mobilization. To this end, given the\n            environmental, and natural resources fragility, mitigation\n            measures stipulate the following. Reforestation activities\n            will take place during the rainy (humid) season to prevent\n            soil erosion; soils should be nurtured prior to\n            reforestation - since as a result of extensive dryness, and\n            livestock practices - require appropriate filter systems to\n            contain water, including vegetative propagation; ensure\n            rehabilitation of gutters, subject to periodic inspection,\n            to prevent both potential flooding, or extreme dryness, thus\n            ensuring perennials, and soil structure; ensure rational use\n            of fertilizers, preferably biodegradable chemicals, taking\n            into account seasonal mineral inputs, and considering\n            adequate selection of resistant native plants; conduct\n            periodic analysis on water quality, particularly on sewage\n            waters, with provisions minimizing excavation or soil\n            extraction; adequate protection of drainage systems to\n            minimize surface water runoff, and, ensure appropriate\n            construction designs to control soil stability."}, "docdt": "2002-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
