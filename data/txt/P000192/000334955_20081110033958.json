The credit\n            was closed on December 31, 1991, or originally scheduled. It\n            was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on May 14,\n            1992. The project's major objectives were to: (i)\n            improve the quality and quantity of water provided to the\n            rural population; (ii) improve the living conditions of the\n            rural population by reducing walking distances to water\n            supply points; (iii) give the rural population greater\n            responsibility in the area of maintaining its water supply\n            facilities; and (iv) help the Government make proper\n            institutional and financial arrangements for the rural water\n            supply sub-sector. Overall, the project was successful in\n            meeting its primary objective of improving access to potable\n            water in rural areas covered by the project. In addition, it\n            had a considerable impact on the sub-sector as a result of\n            the proposed institutional and financial arrangements, which\n            helped the Government, adopt a viable policy giving full\n            responsibility for operation and maintenance of water-supply\n            systems to the beneficiary population, with oversight from\n            the communes and guidance from DGHER. Despite the\n            difficulties encountered at the time the policy was adopted\n            5), the project led to the creation of 82 Communal Water\n            Authorities in the country's 114 communes. Although\n            these authorities are not yet running smoothly, their\n            creation represents an encouraging first step, and the\n            ongoing Water Supply Sector Project, approved on July 16,\n            1991, should further improve the situation. The project also\n            financed the feasibility and final design studies for\n            preparation of the ongoing Water Supply Sector Project."}, "docdt": "1993-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
