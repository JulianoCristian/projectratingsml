about: (a) a higher productivity in jute\n            cultivation; and (b) better marketing for raw jute. The\n            project will, over a five year period, aim at: (a) raising\n            yields and reducing costs of production of jute on one\n            million acres by improved extension activities and credit;\n            (b) establishing a pilot jute marketing scheme aimed at\n            increasing farmers' returns; and (c) improving\n            production and marketing equipment (seed drills, hand hoes,\n            storage sheds, baling equipment, etc.). In addition,\n            technical assistance will be provided through consultants;\n            the project will include overseas training of staff, local\n            training of selected farmers and project evaluation\n            services. Improved marketing practices, in particular\n            through the pilot marketing scheme and ultimately through\n            the establishment of intelligence and price management\n            mechanisms, will contribute to stabilizing the supply of\n            jute fiber and goods around a level adequate to meet the\n            requirements of local jute mills and for export at\n            competitive prices."}, "docdt": "1978-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
