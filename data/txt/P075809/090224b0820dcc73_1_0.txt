                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term objective of the Government's higher education program is: to improve the knowledge, competency, and skills of graduates so that they can contribute to
                         a more knowledge based and diversified economy.

                         The proposed project would support parts of the first five-year phase (2006-2011) of this program.

                          The development objective of the proposed project is to support the implementation of the Government's PDESAQ program to develop the higher education system by
                         increasing the capacity and efficiency in expanding access and improving the quality of education and institutional performance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured in December 2011 and the closing date extended to November 30, 2013. However, the disbursement of the loan continues to be slow. To date, the
                         progress towards the PDO achievement continues, though it is slow and uneven. Procurement delays continue posing a challenge for the implementation of activities under
                         Components 1 and 2. On the other hand, Component 3, which mostly consists of grants (PAQ sub-projects) to improve academic quality and institutional performance, has made so

                         far some very good progress. As of September 10, 2013, a total amount of €36.7 million (i.e. 60% of the total loan amount) was committed and €28.9 million (i.e. 47% of the total loan
                         amount) was paid. The two expenditure categories "Works" and "PAQs " have the highest payment rates of 75% and 64% respectively while the expenditure categories "Equipment" ,
                         "Training", and "Consultants'' services" are still very low with 8%, 3%, and 10% respectively. The Project's audit report for the fiscal year 2012 was completed and sent and was
                         satisfactory to the Bank.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) has sent to the Bank on November 08, 2013 a request for the extension of the project for 6.5 months. This extension would allow
                         completing the works under Component 1 and provision of equipment of some institutions while enabling the completion of capacity building activities under Component 2 and PAQ
                         sub-projects’ ongoing activities under Component 3. The team agreed with MoHE that about €15 million (25 percent of the loan amount) would be canceled in the framework of the
                         extension and related restructuring, subject to World Bank management approval.
