                          The development objective of the proposed project is to support the implementation of the Government's PDESAQ program to develop the higher education system by
                         increasing the capacity and efficiency in expanding access and improving the quality of education and institutional performance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured in December 2011 and the closing date extended to November 30, 2013. However, the disbursement of the loan continues to be slow.

                         As of May 25, 2013, the commitment rate represented 59.7% of the loan while the payment rate was 46%. The commitment and payment rates by category of expenditure show that

                         "Training and consultancy services" are still disbursing very slowly at 3%, 6% and 10% respectively.
