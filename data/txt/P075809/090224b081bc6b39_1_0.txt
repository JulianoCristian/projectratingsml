                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term objective of the Government's higher education program is: to improve the knowledge, competency, and skills of graduates so that they can contribute to
                         a more knowledge based and diversified economy.

                         The proposed project would support parts of the first five-year phase (2006-2011) of this program.

                          The development objective of the proposed project is to support the implementation of the Government's PDESAQ program to develop the higher education system by
                         increasing the capacity and efficiency in expanding access and improving the quality of education and institutional performance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured in December 2011 and the closing date extended to November 30, 2013. However, the disbursement of the loan continues to be slow. The
                         disbursement rate as of January 2013 was 36.8% and the commitment rate only 48.5%.

                         In order to accelerate and maximize the utilization of the loan and the implementation of activities planned under the project by the closing date of November 30, 2013, the team
                         agreed with the Government that it is imperative that a close monitoring of the activities be carried out so that the rates of commitments and payments can reach 85% and 70%,
                         respectively, by November 30, 2013.

                         In January 2013, the Bank recruited two consultants to work closely with the Ministry of Higher Education and a short visit by the TTL took place in March 2013. During this visit, it
                         was agreed that in order to reach a substantive level of project activities completed by the closing date, the project should achieve by May 2013 a commitment rate of 71% and
                         payment rate of 52%.
                         The Bank team has scheduled a full supervision mission in May 2013 and agreed on specific actions with the Ministry, highlighted in the attached aide-memoire, to improve
                         disbursements.
