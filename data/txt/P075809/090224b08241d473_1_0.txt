                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The long-term objective of the Government's higher education program is: to improve the knowledge, competency, and skills of graduates so that they can contribute to
                         a more knowledge based and diversified economy.

                         The proposed project would support parts of the first five-year phase (2006-2011) of this program.

                          The development objective of the proposed project is to support the implementation of the Government's PDESAQ program to develop the higher education system by
                         increasing the capacity and efficiency in expanding access and improving the quality of education and institutional performance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite strong commitment towards achieving the project objectives demonstrated by the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), the Project Management Unit, and the implementing
                         entities, the project's overall progress has continued to be slow over the last few years. In particular, procurement delays have continued to pose a challenge for the implementation of
                         activities under Components 1 and 2. Consequently, based on discussions between the Government and the Bank team during the September 2013 mission and a request sent on

                         November 14, 2013 by the Minister of Development and International Cooperation, the Bank restructured on November 27, 2014 the project by : (i) extending the closing date of the
                         project by 6.5 months to June 15, 2014; (ii) canceling €15 million (i.e., 25% of the loan amount) - resulting from the cancellation of works and equipment under Component 1 and
                         consultant services and some equipment for Component 2; and (iii) amending the Results Framework. This restructuring will help focus efforts on completing substantive activities in
                         the time remaining and capturing them in the Results Framework and will specifically allow the completion of:

                         •         Civil works for the completion of the remaining three sites which have completion rates ranging between 82 % and 95 % and the delivery of some of the equipment for three
                         of the six sites (four higher education and research institutions and two student centers) under Component 1;

                         •         The remaining activities planned for the Program for Teachers’ Training (PRIFF) and the Program for Employment Certification (PRICE);

                         •         Training of 150 financial specialists and managers for higher education which started on May 20, 2013 and is expected to be completed by May 31, 2014;

                         •         All 43 PAQ (Programme d’Appui à la Qualité - sub-grants to Universities) sub-projects ongoing activities.

                         Further, it will allow the Bank to support the establishment of the external quality assurance agency for higher education under Component 2; an area where significant progress has
                         been made in the past 6 months.

                         errors while others have either become obsolete due to the cancellations of related activities or have not been monitored due to the absence of baseline, unclear description or
                         because they lack relevance. This 6.5 months extension will allow the completion of ongoing works under Component 1 and the provision of equipment for some institutions while
                         enabling the completion of capacity building activities under Component 2 and PAQ sub-projects’ ongoing activities under Component 3. It will further allow adequately support of the
                         establishment of the National Authority for the Evaluation, Quality Assurance and Accreditation of Higher Education (IEAQA).
