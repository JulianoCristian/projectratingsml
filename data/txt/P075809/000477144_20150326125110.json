"The Second Higher Education Reform\n            Support Project for Tunisia received a moderately\n            satisfactory outcome rating with moderate risk to\n            development outcome. The Bank\u0092s performance was deemed\n            moderately unsatisfactory while the Borrower\u0092s performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Two restructurings took place\n            during this project. The first restructuring (a) reduced\n            from eight to four the number of higher education and\n            research institutions that were to receive civil works and\n            equipment under the loan, (b) reallocated savings from\n            Component 1 to components 2 and 3, and to the purchase of\n            teaching equipment for existing higher education\n            institutions (Component 1), (c) expanded the activities\n            under each subcomponent of Component 2 to improve the\n            effectiveness of each subcomponent, and (d) extended the\n            closing date by two years. The second restructuring extended\n            the closing date of the project by a further 6.5 months,\n            cancelled part of the loan and consultant services and\n            equipment under Component 2), and amended the results\n            framework to reflect the actual situation. Several lessons\n            were learned from this project and include: (1) project\n            development objectives and key performance indicators need\n            to be chosen carefully to reflect the actual expected\n            benefits of project interventions, (2) investments in\n            expanded education capacity need to be justified by a\n            careful analysis of demographic evidence, (3) the Bank and\n            the Borrower need to maintain attentive oversight of project\n            activities in order to take timely action when the project\n            context changes, (4) efforts to build ownership and\n            implementation capacity during project preparation result in\n            better implementation performance, (5) team assignments and\n            management oversight should take care to ensure that team\n            members interact with counterparts in a constructive and\n            supportive working relationship throughout implementation,\n            and (6) Performance monitoring is useful only if it is\n            accompanied by thoughtful evaluation."}, "docdt": "2015-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
