1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of project appraisal in 2006, Tunisia’s economic growth was robust -- averaging
over 5 percent per year, leading to steady improvements in household income and reduced
poverty levels. But despite this strong performance, Tunisia had been experiencing
persistent high levels of unemployment, averaging about 14% of the active population.
Unemployment rates were generally lower for university graduates than for less-educated
job seekers, but there was concern that unemployment was increasing even among
university graduates. Unemployment rates for university graduates had increased sharply
over the prior decade -- from 3.8% in 1994 to 10.4% in 2004.

In the decade prior to project appraisal, higher education in Tunisia had moved from a
small, elitist system to one open to all students graduating from high school. Higher
education enrollments had tripled during the decade. Although the Government made a
serious effort to devote more resources to accommodate the expansion in higher education
enrollments, resources did not keep up with the expansion of enrollments.1 The rapid
growth of enrollments contributed to overcrowding of classrooms and laboratories,
complaints of erosion of quality in higher education programs, and predictions of a collapse
of higher education in Tunisia unless action were taken to reverse the decline. As higher
education enrollments expanded, drop-out rates increased during the first and second years
of study. Graduates also faced increasing problems in getting jobs at the completion of
their studies, giving greater urgency to the problem of falling higher education quality and
raising questions about the relevance of higher education programs. Meanwhile, higher
education programs remained centrally managed within a regime of resolutely centralized
management of the Tunisian economy.

The Bank worked closely with Tunisian higher education officials, other higher education
stakeholders, and international partners to raise awareness of the potential benefits of
relaxing central control of higher education and moving towards greater autonomy for
individual institutions, thereby empowering and encouraging individual institutions to take
responsibility for the quality of their programs and the labor-market outcomes for their
graduates. In spite of some resistance, decentralization became a central thrust of the
Government’s new program of higher-education reform for the period 2006-2014. This
program, called PDESAQ (Programme de Developpement de l’Enseignement Supérieur et
d’Appui à la Qualité) aimed to improve the knowledge, competency, and relevance of skills
so graduates can contribute to a more knowledge-based and diversified economy. In doing
so, it aimed to support Tunisia’s economic strategy, which emphasized structural reforms
to improve competitiveness and build a strong and diversified knowledge-based economy.

The Bank supported an initial set of higher education reforms in Tunisia under the Higher

  Government expenditures on higher eduation grew by 7.2% per year between 2000 and 2005, while
enrollments grew by 11.6% per year, implying declining resources per student. (PAD Annex 10 and
http://www.mesrst.tn)
                                              1
Education Restructuring Project (1993-2001, Loan No. 3456-TUN). The project aimed to:
a) diversify the higher education system through the creation of Higher Institutes of
Technology, b) provide incentives to encourage universities to strengthen practical work,
greater student participation, and learning through experience, and c) establish a new
normative system of budgetary allocation for higher education. The 2002 completion
report for the project assessed the project’s outcome as “Satisfactory.”2

The reforms under this first higher education project were followed up under the Higher
Education Reform Support Project (Projet d’Appui à l’Enseignement Supérieur, or PARES,
Loan No.5741-TUN), effective in 1998 and completed in 2004. The project completion
report rated the project outcome as “Satisfactory.” The Second Higher Education Reform
Support Project, or PARES II (Projet d’Appui à la Réforme de l’Enseignement Supérieur)
was prepared in 2006. PARES II was designed to support implementation of selected parts
of the first five-year phase (2006-2011) of the Government’s PDESAQ program through
investments to:

       expand capacity,
       revise the legal framework to give greater autonomy to universities,
       develop a quality assurance and accreditation system, and
       develop financing mechanisms that provide higher education institutions with
        incentives to improve their quality and performance.

The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)3 proposed to assist the Government in
addressing three major challenges: a) reducing unemployment by improving the
investment climate and economic management, b) improving the quality, relevance and
financial sustainability of education in order to support Tunisia’s move to a knowledge-
based economy, and c) strengthening social programs and making them more fiscally
sustainable.

The objectives and design of the PARES II project were consistent with all three CAS
objectives – particularly, the second one -- improving the quality, relevance and financial
sustainability of education in order to support Tunisia’s move to a knowledge-based
economy. The project’s activities to improve quality of higher education directly address
the second CAS objective, while its support for actions to improve the relevance and
quality of higher education indirectly addresses the CAS goal of reducing unemployment.

Original Project Development Objectives (PDO)

The Project Appraisal Document4 (PAD) for the Second Higher Education Reform Support
Project describes the Project Development Objective (PDO) in the following terms:
        “The development objective of the proposed project is to support the
        implementation of the Government’s PDESAQ program to develop the higher
        education system by increasing the capacity and efficiency in expanding access and
        improving the quality of education and institutional performance”.5
This statement of the PDO blurs the objectives of improved efficiency and improved access.
It also appears to limit the objective of improved efficiency to efficiency in expanding
access, which does not appear from the sector background in the PAD to be the authors’
intention.

The Loan Agreement presents a clearer statement of the PDO:
      “The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in the implementation of its
      Program aiming at developing its higher education system by increasing the
      capacity in expanding access to said system, strengthening the efficiency and
      institutional performance of said system and improving the quality of higher
      education.”6

This version of the PDO identifies three specific objectives that the project aimed to
achieve:

       increasing access to higher education by expanding capacity,7
       strengthening institutional performance, including efficiency,8 and
       improving the quality of higher education.

This version of the PDO is cited in the project ISRs and in the project Restructuring Papers.
It is the basis of this ICR’s 9 evaluation of the project’s effectiveness in achieving its
development objectives.

  Implementation Completion and Results Report
                                                    3
The PAD presented the following PDO indicators for the project:
          1. “Increase access to higher education by 13,000 places as evidenced through the
             construction of 8 new higher education institutions (as well as 1 restaurant and
             1 student residence) by project closing date.
          2. Revise the legal and regulatory framework to better support institutional
             autonomy - including revision of the law 2000-67 regarding the status of
             universities. This is to be achieved by December 31, 2009.
          3. Develop the National Evaluation Committee into a National Authority for
             Evaluation and Quality Promotion (Instance Nationale d’Evaluation et de
             Promotion de la Qualité -- INEPQ), as part of developing a comprehensive
             quality assurance system for higher education, so that it is capable of
             completing evaluations of the academic and operational quality of higher
             education institutions in Tunisia. This is to be achieved by the project closing
             date.
          4. Establish and effectively operate the new Quality Promotion Fund (PAQ) so
             that at least one round of competitive grants for the improvement of academic
             quality is awarded and under implementation by the project mid-term review
             scheduled for April 30, 2009.
          5. Improve performance of Project implementation entities through improved
             management of the schedule set forth in the Procurement Plan. ”10

PDO indicators were worded somewhat differently in Schedule 7 of the project Loan
Agreement, with the most significant differences being in indicators 2, 3 and 5. Those
actions were presented in the Loan Agreement as follows:
          2. “revised legal and regulatory framework governing the Borrower’s higher
             education system granting increased autonomy to universities by December
             2009;
          3. strengthened capacity of the National Evaluation Committee, including
             enhanced ability to complete evaluations of the academic and operational
             performance and quality of higher education and research institutions;
          5. improved performance of Project implementation entities through improved
             management of the schedule set forth in the Procurement Plan as follows:

                  a. 60% of contracts signed within the schedule set forth in said Plan for
                     the year 2007;
                  b. 75% of contracts signed within the schedule set forth in said Plan for
                     the year 2008; and
                  c. 90% of contracts signed within the schedule set forth in said Plan for
                     the year 2009.”

The Loan agreement version of PDO indicator 2 is more restrictive than the PAD version
because it states that the revised legal and regulatory framework aims not only to “support”
increased autonomy for universities, but actually to “grant” them increased autonomy. In


10
     PARES II PAD, page 34.
                                               4
contrast to this, Loan Agreement version of PDO indicator 3 is much less restrictive,
deleting mention of the National Authority for Evaluation and Quality Promotion and its
carrying out of evaluations of higher education institutions by the project closing date, and
simply referring to strengthened capacity of the National Evaluation Committee. It also
removes the reference to this action “as part of developing a comprehensive quality
assurance system for higher education.” Finally, the Loan Agreement version of PDO
indicator 5 is more specific than the PAD version, setting specific benchmarks for contract
signature under the procurement plan.

1.3 Main Beneficiaries

Among the project beneficiaries, the primary target group comprises the higher education
students who experience improved success in completing their studies and, subsequently,
in their labor market experience as a result of the improvements supported under the project.
Indirect beneficiaries include the enterprises – and the economy as a whole -- which benefit
from the improved qualifications of graduates as a result of the various project
interventions.

1.4 Original Components (as approved)

The project as appraised comprised three components:
Component 1: Expand Access to the Public Higher Education System (US$76.3 million
total, Bank financing US$62.0 million including contingencies)

This component was designed to support the expansion of physical infrastructure of the
university system to accommodate the anticipated growth in higher education enrollment
by financing:
     construction and related equipment and materials for approximately eight
       specialized higher education institutions, as well as one university restaurant and
       one student residence, and
     technical assistance to reinforce the capacity of the Department of Civil Works and
       Equipment of the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) 11 and the Ministry’s
       Department of University Reform to prepare impact studies, carry out design and
       supervision studies for civil works, and implement procurement.

Component 2: Modernize the Higher Education System by Strengthening Quality
Assurance Mechanisms, Institutional Autonomy and Financial Sustainability (US$4.4
million total, Bank financing US$4.4 million including contingencies).
The objective of this component was to develop resources and capacity at the central level
for quality assurance of Tunisia’s higher education system by:
     supporting the development of a new Evaluation, Quality Assurance and


11
  Since then, the Ministry’s role has been expanded. It is now the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific
Research, and Information and Communication Technologies (Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur, de la
Recherche Scientifique, et des Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication, or MESRSTIC).

                                                    5
           Accreditation Agency (Instance d’Evaluation, d’Assurance Qualité, et d’
           Accréditation, IEAQA),
          revising higher education curricula to conform to international norms under a new
           structure of bachelors, masters , and doctoral degrees, and in so doing become more
           relevant to emerging labor-market needs, and
          developing the technical and managerial capacity of the Ministry of Higher
           Education to lead the reforms needed to move towards greater autonomy for
           universities.

At appraisal and project approval, this component comprised five sub-components:
       Sub-component 2.1 -- Developing and strengthening the present higher education
       National Evaluation Committee (NEC) into an effective quality assurance system by
       developing procedures, capacities, and structure for the new accreditation body,
       allowing central oversight to progress from limited program audits and evaluations to
       the more complex process of comprehensive accreditation or restructuring of overall
       institutions and professional disciplines and programs.
       Sub-component 2.2 -- Revising higher education curricula to match international norms
       and become more relevant to labor market needs, involving adoption of a new bachelor,
       masters, and doctoral degree structure, upgrading engineering programs, and
       introducing an entrepreneurship perspective across programs.
       Sub-component 2.3 – Strengthening governance of higher education reform by
       developing revisions to existing laws and regulations to facilitate institutional
       autonomy and the introduction of program-based budgeting (GPO 12 ), in which the
       MoHE role changes from direct control of higher education institutions to oversight
       within the new quality assurance framework.
       Sub-component 2.4 -- Strengthening the technical and management capacity of higher
       education institutions to operate effectively as autonomous institutions.
       Subcomponent 2.5 -- Strengthening management capacities of MoHE units in policy
       analysis, stakeholder consultation, communication strategies, contract management,
       procurement, financial management and environmental management. This sub-
       component was also to support activities to set up the competitive grant selection
       process under Component 3.

Component 3: Provide Grants to Improve Academic Quality and Institutional Performance
(US$14.3 million total, Bank financing US$9.6 million including contingencies)
The objective of this component was to establish a new resource transfer mechanism (PAQ,
or Programme d'Appui à la Qualité)13 through the use of competitive block grants awarded
directly to the investment budgets of universities. The PAQ was designed to provide two
forms of grants:



12
     Gestion Budgétaire par Objectifs
13
     Quality Promotion Fund
                                                6
        competitive block grants to universities for quality improvements in teaching and
         learning, thereby building accountability and capacity to manage in a decentralized
         environment and motivating and enabling innovations to improve quality, and
        non-competitive management capacity grants to universities to support technical
         assistance, training, and materials (particularly software and hardware) to improve
         management information systems and IT infrastructure, financial management,
         procurement, human resource management, and non-tuition revenue generation
         related to academic activities.

1.5 Revised Components

The project was restructured twice. The first Restructuring14 was triggered by a decline in
higher education enrollments (Section 2.2) and an increase in construction costs. The
MoHESR15 and the Bank took this opportunity to reallocate funds from the civil works
component to invest more on quality improvement and alignment with international
standards. These changes were discussed with the Government during the December 2009
and June 2010 supervision missions and agreed by the Bank in December 2011. This first
Restructuring:

        reduced from eight to four the number of higher education and research institutions
         that were to receive civil works and equipment under the loan,
        reallocated about EUR16 million of loan savings from Component 1 to components
         2 and 3 (as shown in Table 1), and to the purchase of teaching equipment for
         existing higher education institutions (Component 1),
        expanded the activities under each subcomponent of Component 2 (shown in Table
         2, below) to improve the effectiveness of each subcomponent, and
        extended the Closing Date from November 30, 2011 to November 30, 2013.




14
   A level 2 restructuring, involving no change in the PDO or safeguard categories and approval by Regional
Management.
15
   At the time of restructuring, the MoHE became the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research
                                                    7

The Project Development Objective was not changed in the Restructuring, but PDO
                                        8
indicators were revised as follows:
        1. “Increased access to higher education by about 13,000 education places as
           evidenced through the construction of four (4) new higher education and
           research institutions, one university restaurant, and one university student
           housing by the Project Closing Date;
        2. Revised legal and regulatory framework governing the Borrower’s higher
           education system granting increased autonomy to universities by November
           2013;
        3. Strengthened capacity of the National Evaluation Committee, including
           enhanced ability to complete evaluations of the academic and operational
           performance and quality of higher education and research institutions;
        4. PAQ is fully operational and at least one (1) round of Competitive Block Grants
           has been awarded and under implementation by Mid-term Review; and
        5. Improved performance of Project implementation entities through improved
           management of the schedule set forth in the Procurement Plan as follows:

                (a) 60% of contracts signed within the schedule set forth in said Plan for
                    the year 2007,
                (b) (b) 75% of contracts signed within the schedule set forth in said Plan for
                    the year 2008; and
                (c) (iii) 90% of contracts signed within the schedule set forth in said Plan
                    for the year 2009.”16

These indicators differed from the original key performance indicators in two main
respects: a) The first indicator reduced the number of new higher education institutions to
be constructed under the project from 8 to 4, and b) the third indicator presents the Loan
Agreement version of PDO indicator 3 rather than the PAD version. The latter change
eliminated any mention of the new Accreditation Agency and eliminated the specific target
under which the new Accreditation Agency was to carry out by the project closing date an
external evaluation of the academic and operational quality of all higher education
institutions in Tunisia, replacing it with a vague target to “enhance the ability” of the
National Evaluation Committee to carry out such evaluations. This change constitutes a
significant scaling back of the performance target that was presented in the PAD.

The Results Framework presented in Annex 1 of the 2011 Restructuring Paper presents
conflicting versions for two of these PDO indicators. The target for expanded enrollment
capacity under PDO indicator 1 is presented as “about 13,000 education places” in the list
of revised indicators presented on page 8 of the Restructuring Paper, but as “6,000 places”
in the revised Results Framework in Annex 1 on page 13 of the same document. Also, the
text of the 2011 Restructuring Paper cites the Loan Agreement version of this indicator,
whereas the Results Framework in Annex 1 of the Restructuring Paper cites the PAD
version, mentioning the new Quality Assurance Agency, situating its work in the context

       A second project Restructuring,17 was discussed with the Government in September 2013
       and agreed by the Bank in November 2013. This second Restructuring was triggered by a
       recognition that it would not be possible to complete project implementation and full
       disbursement of the loan by the project Closing Date. The second Restructuring extended
       the Closing Date of the project by a further 6.5 months to June 15, 2014, cancelled €15
       million of the original €61.3 loan amount (resulting from cancellation of civil works and
       equipment under Component I and consultant services and equipment under Component
       2), and amended the Results Framework to reflect the actual situation.18 PDO indicators
       were revised as follows:

       higher education institutions “because it is not directly supported under the project” and
       because it was already formally implemented (although, as acknowledged in the 2013

       2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

       2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

       Project Design

       At the time of project preparation, there was among higher education professionals a
       widespread urgent need for reform. But at the same time, there was considerable resistance
       among some higher-level officials to the fundamental reforms of higher education
       management that were sought under the project, and there were some attempts to limit the
       scope of the project to supporting the construction and equipping of new university
       facilities (Section 5.2a). It required persistence and deliberate involvement of a broad
       spectrum of stakeholders to help overcome this initial reluctance.

       The Government’s interest in expanding higher education capacity under the project was
       based on an expectation that the rapid growth experienced in the recent past would continue
       for the foreseeable future. But the Bank’s project preparation team raised questions about
       the justification for expanding enrollments under the project in view of the shrinkage of




                                                          11
the university-age cohort that was projected to occur by 2015. 20 Despite the Bank’s
reservations about the rationale for capacity expansion under the project, the Government’s
position was that the project’s support for capacity expansion was a non-negotiable element
of the project.21 The Bank and the Government ultimately agreed to proceed with a project
incorporating significant expansion of facilities as well as a progressive set of higher
education reforms. As described in Section 3 of the ICR, this compromise solution
addressed the priorities of both the Government and the Bank, but ultimately led to
problems in assessing project’s added-value on sectoral reforms.

The project was prepared through an extended participatory process involving central
Ministry staff, managers of higher education and research institutions, and other
stakeholders. A key element of project preparation was the two-week workshop during
which separate groups of MOHE staff, high-level experts, and stakeholders worked
together under the guidance of a professional facilitator to develop the individual project
components. A manual of procedures was also finalized to guide implementation. (This
participatory process helps to explain the comparatively high cost and long duration of
project preparation.) Particular attention was focused on developing a consensus around
the competitive grants under Component 3 – a totally new approach for higher education
financing in Tunisia -- and developing detailed implementation procedures and staff
capacity for effective implementation of that component.

Project design reflected the experience and lessons of earlier higher education operations
in Tunisia – particularly of the prior project, the Higher Education Restructuring Project –
and of lessons of global experience. The decentralization reforms supported under the
project aimed to bring the management of Tunisia’s higher education system into
alignment with OECD trends. As described in the PAD, key lessons reflected in project
design were:
        Successful implementation requires involvement of key stakeholders in project
         design. (During project preparation and appraisal, universities and other
         stakeholders were involved in the design of the project.)
        Increased university autonomy is essential to allow universities to manage staff and
         resources to meet evolving educational needs, thus improving quality and relevance
         of higher education programs. (Increased autonomy was a central goal of the
         project.)
        Successful reform implementation requires clear implementation responsibilities
         and oversight of various aspects of reform by a project Steering Committee.
        Competitive funding mechanisms are an effective approach for piloting educational
         innovations. (Component 3 supports a competitive model for educational
         innovations to improve quality and relevance of higher education.)

Project design also reflects the recommendations of the March, 2006 Quality Enhancement
Review (QER), including the following:

        “The Panel strongly recommends that the building up of a quality assurance system
         for the Tunisian higher education system is accompanied with greater institutional
         autonomy.”
        “It is important that NEC develops into a professional quality assurance
         organization, which primary function is to promote quality in higher education
         teaching and learning,” and
        “It is the assessment of the Panel that a competitive fund is an appropriate
         instrument given the objective in Tunisian higher education of (i) improving quality
         in the context of expansion and (ii) enhancing institutional autonomy with
         accountability for results.” 22

2.2 Implementation

Project implementation went through several phases, with quite different performance
across components:
        During the first phase, from Board presentation in June 2006 to the May 2009 Mid-
         Term review, Component 1 made little progress; there was some progress under
         Component 2 (although well short of targets); and implementation of Component
         3 was generally timely and effective. During the Mid-Term Review mission, the
         Government proposed to cancel construction of the Music Institute at Sfax and the
         Sports Institute at Sousse. It later proposed also to delete the Institutes of Science
         at Kasserine and Manouba, and to reallocate the loan proceeds from the four
         cancelled facilities to Components 2 and 3, with the addition of several new
         activities to Component 2.
        The second phase of implementation covered the period from the Mid-Term
         Review to December 2010 and the “Arab Spring.” Although the Government and
         Bank teams had informally agreed the elements of the Restructuring in May 2009,
         this period was characterized by continued delays for several reasons: during the
         restructuring phase, an ad hoc task group was mandated to carry-out a study on
         employability of graduates, the conclusions and recommendations of which would
         serve to restructure the project and reallocate unused funds. Other delays were due
         to the revolution in December 2010 and the various changes that occurred after at
         the levels of MES and coordination unit of PARES II.
        The third phase of implementation covered the period from the abdication of
         President Ben Ali and the installation of a new Government in January 2011 to the
         November 2013 Restructuring. In March 2011 the new Government submitted the
         Restructuring request and appointed as PCU director the team leader that had
         managed the successful Component 3. Despite these gains, project implementation
         continued to be affected by the aftermath of the Arab Spring and the 2010/2011
         revolution. The revolution had been motivated partly by public frustration with
         corruption under the former Government. Following the revolution, there was
         acute political sensitivity to any appearance of corruption in public procurement.

                                              13
         This concern led to a tightened control of all evaluation reports and contract awards
         by the Commission des Marchés -- that resulted in slower implementation. Because
         the Commission lacked the capacity to deal with the additional workload in a timely
         fashion, this additional step in procurement review contributed to ongoing delays
         in project procurement and ultimately to cancellation of some procurement
         packages. By November 2013, immediately prior to the revised project closing
         date, only 57% of the loan had been disbursed.
        The fourth and final stage of project implementation covered the period from the
         November 2013 Restructuring to the new (and final) closing date of June 15, 2014.
         The Restructuring cancelled part of the loan and focused activities on what could
         reasonably be expected to be completed by the new closing date. This period was
         marked by more vigorous progress under all three components, and an acceleration
         of disbursements to 82.4% of the revised loan amount at project closing. Loan
         payments at closing as a percentage of loan allocations by component were 78.9%
         for Component 1, 69.9% for Component 2, and 92.2% for Component 3. The lower
         figure for Component 2 partly results from the fact that a number of planned
         technical assistance activities under the component were carried out with
         concessionary bilateral and multilateral funds instead of loan funds.

Staff and Counterpart Turnover. Implementation was also affected by turnover of key staff
on the Government side and on the Bank supervision team. During the seven and a half
years of project implementation, there were six Ministers of Higher Education (and
consequently six consecutive chairmen for PARES II Steering Committee), four PCU
coordinators, and 3 Bank task team leaders. The change of the Bank’s project team leader
a year after project launch led to a decline in mutual trust between the Bank and the
Borrower (Section 5.1b) that was not restored until a new team leader was assigned in
August 2013. On the Borrower’s side, overall project implementation benefitted when the
component team leader for the successful Component 3 was given responsibility for overall
project coordination in March 2011. She remained in that position through project closing.

Enrollment Changes. Another development that affected implementation was the decline
of higher education enrollments that became apparent early in implementation. One of the
two main objectives of the project was to increase the capacity of higher education
institutions in Tunisia to absorb increasing student enrollment. Higher education
enrollments had tripled over the decade prior to appraisal, and the PAD projected that
enrollments would continue to increase at the same pace.23 But actual higher education
enrollments increased only briefly after initiation of the project, rising from 326,200 in
2006/07 to 349,100 in 2008/09, and falling steadily for all but the final year since then
(Figure 1). At project closing, they were just 305,783 – 16% lower than they were in
2008/09 and 10% lower than they were at the time of project appraisal.24 This development
(as well as higher-than-expected bid prices for civil works) led to a decision by the Ministry
to cancel four of the institutions scheduled for expansion under Component I of the project.

 The causes of this decline are discussed in Section 5.1b. Enrollment figures are from the Ministry’s
website, http://www.mesrst.tn/francais/index.htm.
                                                   14
The cancellation of these sites was approved under the 2011 Restructuring (Section 1.6).
As shown in Table 4, enrollments in the new institutions created under the project are below
projected enrollments, and enrollments declined in the 2013/14 academic year. This
development may reflect a transitional situation, reflecting not fully operational facilities.

Despite the shrinkage of overall enrollments, the project contributed to improved equity of
access and regional balance in access to university places. As described in Section 3.5, the
2011 Restructuring deliberately gave priority to the new Institut Supérieur des Études
Technologiques and related facilities for the new university campus in Tataouine, a
relatively remote, poor and underserved area, whereas the cancelled facilities included
those for the relatively prosperous and well-provisioned existing universities in Sousse and
Sfax. The project also contributed to quality improvements in existing higher education
institutions in poorer regions of the country. Reallocation of loan proceeds under the 2011
restructuring gave priority to poorer regions in providing updated laboratory equipment
and other teaching equipment to existing universities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. There were several weaknesses in M&E design, as well as in M&E
implementation. In order to allow effective evaluation, performance monitoring indicators
need to be feasible and realistic. The Results Framework for the project included a number
of outcome indicators for which data were not being routinely collected by the Ministry’s
data-collection body – the BEPP. Some of the indicators – including levels of student and
employer satisfaction with skills acquired in various programs -- would have required
elaborate purpose-built surveys for which no financing was provided either under the
project or in the Ministry’s budget. Moreover, the Results Framework did not provide
baseline figures for any of the outcome indicators, making it difficult to assess progress
achieved under the project even if data for the indicators had been collected during project
implementation. These deficiencies were recognized and addressed in the 2013 project
Restructuring, which revised some of the objectives and performance indicators in the
Results Framework to reflect greater “realism, consistency, and relevance to the PDO, as
some of the [original] indicators have some factual errors while others have either become
obsolete due to the cancellations of related activities or have not been monitored due to the
absence of baseline, unclear description or because they lack relevance.”25

M&E Implementation. Bank supervision missions reported that the Ministry did not
provide adequate monitoring of project outcomes during the initial years of

     ISR 16 (April 2014)

                                                  16
implementation26. The May 2009 Mid-Term Review noted that “the table of monitoring
indicators and the analysis of indicators are not being included in the project progress
reports and are not provided to the Bank prior to each mission.” 27 Data on project
outcomes at the level of each higher education institution were to be collected by new
“Observatories” that were to be established at each higher education institution. As late as
April 2102, the supervision mission reported that “most of the Observatories exist on paper.
The project will staff them and build their capacity to monitor labor market needs and
graduates’ employment rates after graduation.” 28 Despite this, M&E performance was
rated as “moderately satisfactory” in all but one of the first 13 ISRs (from November 2006
through December 2012.) Under new team leadership, the M&E performance rating was
downgraded to “moderately unsatisfactory” after the May 2013 supervision mission, where
it stayed through project closing (although some improvement was noted during the final
year of project implementation). Supervision missions, however, generally reported
outcome indicators for which data were available in published sources.

M&E Utilization. Although Bank supervision reports did include data that showed falling
enrollments starting with the 2009-2010 academic year, Bank supervision failed to react to
this important and unexpected development or to report its implications for project
implementation (Section 5.1b). And although falling higher education enrollments
motivated the Government’s request for the 2011 Restructuring, falling enrollments are not
mentioned in the Bank’s 2011 Restructuring Paper and supporting documentation. This
oversight indicates a mechanical approach to monitoring and evaluation on the part of the
Bank – collecting the required data, but not using those data to draw the appropriate
conclusions about project performance and the need for project restructuring. Fortunately,
in this case, the Government promptly noticed the decline in enrollments and took the
appropriate action -- requesting cancellation of the remaining new facilities – even if the
Bank failed to do so.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

No significant safeguard and fiduciary compliance issues arose in the course of
implementation. During implementation, World Bank supervision missions and audit
missions by the Conrôle Général des Finances commended the MOHE for the conformity
and transparency in the procurement process.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The Borrower’s project completion report includes a sustainability plan for the activities
carried out under PARES II, including a plan for budget financing of the ongoing project
activities carried out after the eligibility deadline for financing under the loan. Preliminary
discussions with the Government were held during the completion mission about possible

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

Relevance of objectives, design, and implementation is rated as high. ICR guidelines state
that “the relevance test in this rating requires that the achievement of objectives is judged
by the development priorities and circumstances prevailing at the time of the ICR, not
those at the time of loan approval.” 29 Although the objectives of Component 1 were not
entirely relevant in light of the decline in higher education enrollments that occurred under
the project,30 the objectives, design, and implementation of Components 2 and 3 were, in
comparison, highly relevant to Tunisia’s needs and priorities at the time of project
preparation and proved to be even more relevant at project completion. These components
supported reforms in the management, content, and delivery of higher education programs
to make them more relevant to labor market needs. The project achieved real successes
under Component 2 and 3 in spite of very challenging conditions that prevailed during
most of the implementation period (i.e. the 2010 revolution and uncertain political climate
that followed, combined with a global financial crisis). The frustration of higher education
graduates who were not able to obtain jobs was a major contributing factor to the
2010/2011 revolution, and unemployment rates for university graduates are even higher
now than they were at project appraisal. These developments make it ever more urgent to
improve employment prospects for university graduates – a key objective of the project.
This objective is a central priority of the new Government. The successful – and, in some
cases, highly successful - implementation of programs delivered under PARES II such as
the PAQ produced promising long-term results that convinced the Government that
reforms launched under Components 2 and 3 of the PARES II project are highly relevant
to the country’s needs and priorities. Consequently, the Government has requested Bank
support for continuing to build on the foundational programs delivered in PARES II under
a follow-up project. This is clear evidence of the project’s continuing relevance.




3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

   The objectives of Component 1 would have been more relevant if the PDO had been expressed in terms of
improved equity and regional balance in enrollments, since the project did make an undeniable contribution
to enrollments in Tataouine – an underserved and relatively poor region. However, the objectives and design
of Component 1 as expressed in the project documentation made no mention of a regional balance objective.
Instead, the justification for Component 1 was presented as supporting an overall expansion in higher
education capacity to accommodate increasing total higher education enrollments which proved to be not
fully relevant at project completion because of the contraction of higher education enrollments(Section 2.2).

Other accomplishments under the project are summarized in Annex 2.

The “substantial” rating for achievement of project development objectives is more
positive than the “moderately unsatisfactory” PDO ratings reported in the last four ISRs
and with the “moderately unsatisfactory” rating in the recent IEG 31 Country Program
Evaluation rating for the Bank’s contribution to education sector reforms in Tunisia, 32
reflecting not only the progress made during the final year of project implementation, but
the very positive results achieved in some foundational programs. These successes
encouraged the Government to pursue its reforms and were a basis for the Government’s
request for Bank assistance to continue these initiatives. The ICR rating for achievement
of project development objectives is based on the fact that three of the four 33 key
performance indicators for the project were fully met, even if some of their intended
outcomes have not yet been achieved. These achievements are summarized in Table 4 and
further described below.

Expansion of Access. As described in Table 4, the project fully achieved its performance
targets in terms of capacity expansion, even if it did not achieve the higher education
enrollment increase that was sought and expected from the capacity expansion. The project
contributed to enhancing the regional network with an emphasis on underserved regions,
which was a critical need at the time. The Results Framework for the 2011 Restructuring
included among its intermediate indicators a performance target of expanded student
capacity from the May 2010 baseline of 346,079 -- the number of students enrolled in
public-sector higher education institutions during the 2009/2010 academic year. Actual
enrollments were 305,783 at project closing according to the Ministry’s final monitoring
report34 -- a decline of 9%.

Revised Legal and Regulatory Framework. The Government adopted new legislation and
implementation decrees on institutional autonomy, including:
               Law No. 2008-19 on Higher Education, one third of whose articles are
                 dedicated to quality and quality assurance;
               Decree No. 2008-2716 of August 4, 2008 on the organization of
                 universities and higher education and research institutions and the rules
                 for their operation;
               Decree 2008-3581 establishing the conditions for transformation of the
                 universities and public scientific research institutions into scientific and
                 technological public institutions with greater financial autonomy;

    This reflection includes the performance indicator relating to the development of institutional autonomy
legislation because although it was deleted in the 2013 Restructuring, this activity remains a central element
of the project and of the Government’s reform program (Section 1.6).

                     National Authority for Evaluation, Quality Assurance and Accreditation
                     and its operating procedures.
In some respects, however, the content of the legislation fell short of expectations, as noted
by the Sector Manager in a 2007 implementation report:
        “The reform process is clearly hesitant and political commitment to the agreed
        institutional reforms is much weaker than the commitment to implement the project
        physical investments. In fact, the Government is preparing a new organizational
        law for higher education, but this law seems much less ambitious than comparable
        ones from Egypt and Jordan, especially with respect to institutions’ autonomy,
        quality assurance and academic freedom.” 35

Creation of a new Quality Assurance Agency. The National Authority for Evaluation,
Quality Assurance and Accreditation was created under the project and its officers and staff
named. However, there is still a need to clarify the new Agency’s priorities. At a June,
2014 workshop on the activities of the new Quality Assurance Agency, it was observed
that the priorities of the Agency had yet to be decided, including whether its focus was to
be evaluation or accreditation, and whether this was to involve programs or institutions.36

Implementation of the PAQ Program. PAQ program implementation has exceeded targets
and expectations. Three rounds of competitive grants have been carried out, and the results
of evaluations to date indicate generally successful outcomes. The competitive grants
(PAQ) under Component 3 led to a constructive new mentality of competition among
institutions and programs that is likely to deliver longer-term benefits quite apart from the
financial support provided under the project. Competition for funding was an alien concept
for higher education and research institutions at the start of the project. Many of the
institutions that participated in the PAQ competitions were not able to develop strong
proposals in the early rounds, but improved their submissions and succeeded in obtaining
grants in successive rounds of the competition. The requirements of the PAQ competitive

process required institutions to undertake an analysis of their strengths, weakness, and
needs that should serve them well as higher eduation institutions move to autonomous
management

The “substantial” rating for achievement of project development objectives also reflects
the ambitiousness of the reforms sought under the project and the significant progress
achieved against this ambitious reform agenda: the project aimed to achieve changes in
content and management of higher education programs that took decades to achieve in
most countries in Europe and North America (Section 2.1). 37 Despite the shortfall in
achievement of some of the specific expected benefits of the project, the project was
instrumental in launching this paradigm shift – in laying the groundwork that is enabling
and incentivizing higher education institutions to take responsibility for improving the
quality and relevance of their teaching programs. The actions supported and carried out
under the project should provide a solid basis for individual institutions to move ahead with
further improvements to the quality and relevance of their programs, with long-term
benefits for graduates and for the Tunisian economy. In particular, project-supported
reforms have introduced a critical new dimension of accountability to the work of
universities, under which universities and programs will be evaluated and supported
according to their effectiveness in responding to actual skill needs of the labor market.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Moderate

Project efficiency is rated as “moderate.” The shrinkage of enrollment during project
implementation suggests that the expansion of university capacity under Component 1 was
not necessary in terms of total university enrollments, although it clearly did contribute to
improved equity and regional balance in availability of higher education. If it were not for
this evolution in total enrollemnts, project efficiency would have been rated more
positively because of the gains achieved in launching a process that should yield economic
benefits and budget savings in the future and because the costs of carrying out the various
project activities appear to be reasonable in relation to cost comparators. Civil works and
equipment costs under Component 1 were consistent with cost estimates and with costs
experienced in the Ministry’s procurement under other financing sources. Introduction of
the LMD degree structure contributed to budget savings by lowering the average unit cost
of university graduates at the bachelors and masters degree levels. Costs of technical
assistance were also reduced by substitution of bilateral and other concessionary financing
for loan financing under the project. Although graduate unemployment actually increased
under the project due to the sharp reduction in economic growth that dampened the
absorption of graduates into the labor market, the project is expected to contribute to lower
graduate unemployment in the future as economic growth recovers, and as the reforms
initiated under Components 2 and 3 relating to institutional autonomy, accountability,


37
   In fact, Bologna/LMD reforms are still ongoing in many European countries as the 2012 Bologna
Stocktaking report shows. (Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA P9 Eurydice),

                                                23
quality, and relevance are deepened and embodied by a larger share of the working labor
force. In the view of the ICR, formal cost-benefit analysis is not appropriate for ex-post
evaluation of the benefits of the project because of the enrollment contraction that occurred
under the project, and because of the intangible and long-term nature of the benefits sought
under Components 2 and 3. External evaluation of the activities financed under the
competitive grants in Component 3 found widespread benefits in terms of improved
teaching and learning environment and processes (Section 3.6). (See Annex 3 for
additional information on economic and financial performance.)

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating for the project is “moderately satisfactory”, reflecting the “high”
rating for relevance of objectives, design, and implementation (Section 3.1), the
“substantial” rating for achievement of project/program development objectives (Section
3.2), and the “moderate” rating for efficiency (Section 3.3).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Project implementation gave priority to poverty impacts in two significant respects. First,
the decision of which facilities were to be retained and which were to be cancelled under
the 2011 Restructuring deliberately gave priority to the new Institut Supérieur des Études
Technologiques and related facilities for the new university campus in Tataouine, a
relatively remote, poor and underserved area, whereas the cancelled facilities included
those for the relatively prosperous and well-provisioned existing universities in Sousse and
Sfax. Reallocation of loan proceeds under the 2011 Restructuring also gave priority to
poorer regions, both for laboratory and other equipment to be supplied to existing
universities, and to the expanded PAQ grant program under Component 3. In addition, the
last round of PAQ grants in 2012 was earmarked for young universities and underserved
regions.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional change was a major objective of the project. The project successfully started
a process of devolving responsibility for management of higher education institutions from
the central level to the institutions themselves, under which individual institutions are
starting to be empowered to undertake curriculum changes, staffing changes, and other
changes to improve the quality and relevance of their programs. Project support for
institutional change and capacity building included the development and adoption of a new
legal framework for devolution and autonomous management under performance-based
contracts for each university, provision of an extensive program of training for managers
of the decentralization process and staff involved in the development of new degree
programs under the new LMD degree structure, and support for education quality and
management enhancement initiatives under the PAQ program.


                                              24
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The provision of laboratory equipment and other teaching and learning equipment under
Component 1 (post 2011 Restructuring) had an unexpected demonstration effect, and led
to “creative jealously” on the part of programs and institutions that did not receive these
improvements under the project. In a number of cases, this resulted in budget financing
for improved teaching equipment for institutions and programs that had not received these
upgrades either under the project or under earlier budget financing.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

External evaluations were carried out for the activities financed under the PAQ program in
Component 3. Separate evaluations were carried out for grants awarded in each of six
subject areas: management capacity, engineering, arts and letters, health, sciences, and
social sciences. Evaluations were carried out for each subject area using the “results-
oriented monitoring” approach, which looked at each activity in terms of its relevance,
efficiency, impacts, and sustainability. Evaluation findings were generally very positive,
citing diverse benefits in terms of teaching and learning environment and processes. As
summarized in the Borrower’s completion report (Annex 7), an overall benefit of the PAQ
program was “a closer alignment of higher education and research institutions to the
priorities of the Government, notably in terms of employability, absorption of graduates
into the labor market, and equity, as well as greater influence over the performance of the
institution and creation of a culture of quality.” (Detailed findings of the PAQ evaluations
are available in the project file.).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The initial reluctance on the part of some parties within the Government to endorse the
educational reforms sought under the project (Section 2.1) and the hesitant start of the new
Quality Assurance Agency and questions about its intended direction (Section 3.2) signal
a risk that some elements of the reform could ultimately be undermined by a lack of
commitment to the underlying principles of the reform. This risk is judged moderate but
not severe because the project-supported actions at the institutional level – including the
extensive training and competitive grant programs supported under components 2 and 3 –
have created a broad base of support for the reforms and the expectation of further progress
that would be difficult to reverse.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as “moderately unsatisfactory,”
despite the highly relevant objectives and design for Components 2 and 3 and the care that
went into preparation of those components (Section 3.1). During preparation, the project
team requested and received guidance of a Quality Enhancement Review panel on the
design of key features of the project (Section 2.1). The design of Components 2 and 3 was
consistent with best practice in Europe and North America, and with the recommendations
of the QER panel. On this basis alone, the rating for Bank performance in ensuring quality
at entry would have been at least ‘satisfactory,” if not “highly satisfactory.” The
“moderately unsatisfactory” rating reflects the fact that there were several significant
deficiencies in project design – particularly for Component 1 -- that reflect shortcomings
in Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry. As mentioned in Section 3.1, these
include: a) inconsistent presentation of the PDO and PDO indicators, b) lack of a baseline
for performance monitoring, c) lack of attention to demographic trends affecting future
enrollments, d) presentation of instruments rather than development outcomes in the PDO
and key performance indicators, and e) questionable rationale for capacity expansion. The
first of these shortcomings is described in Sections 1.2 and 1.6, the second in Section 2.3.
The remaining ones are briefly described below.

Lack of Attention to Demographic Trends Affecting Future Enrollments. Project design
did not reflect the reversal in the growth of higher education enrollments that undermined
one of the two project development objectives (Section 2.2). The PAD projected that
enrollments in public universities would increase by about 6.6% annually to about 470,000


                                                 26
in 2010, followed by growth at 2.2% per year until stabilization in 2015. 38 Had this
occurred, higher education enrollments would have reached 519,000 in 2015. Actual
higher education enrollments reached a maximum of 360,200 in 2008/09, and declined
thereafter to 305,783 in September 2014 – 41% less than the projected level. 39 This
reversal could have been anticipated at the time of appraisal, since the imminent shrinkage
in size of the higher education cohort was already apparent in the form of published data
on primary and secondary enrollments, as well as age-specific data available in census and
population projection data. As shown in Figure 3, the size of the university-age cohort
reached a maximum in 2005 and was projected to contract sharply thereafter, based on the
observed sizes of the younger cohorts. This information, which was readily available from
the UN Population Division at the time of appraisal, should have revealed the questionable
rationale for capacity expansion. Had that development been given more attention during
project preparation, it would either not have supported the decision to support expanded
capacity under the project, or would have motivated a reformulation of the objective and
design of Component 1 to emphasize the regional balance and equity benefits of facilities
expansion under the project rather than growth of overall higher education enrollments.

Instruments Rather than Development Outcomes. The project’s stated PDO was “to assist
the Borrower in the implementation of its Program.…” The objective of that program is
described as “development of its higher education system,” which it aimed to achieve by
increasing capacity, institutional performance, and quality of education. The only one of
these activities that is actually a development outcome is improved education quality.
Expanded capacity is an instrument for expanded higher education enrollment. But as
project experience has demonstrated, it is not a sufficient condition to ensure enrollment
expansion. (Education capacity expanded under the project, but enrollments declined.)
Quite apart from the inconsistent description of project objectives and performance
indicators (described in Sections 1.2 and 1.6), the presentation of project objectives and
performance indicators in project design would have been more satisfactory if it focused
on desired development outcomes rather than instruments for achieving development
outcomes.

Questionable Rationale for Capacity Expansion. As described in Annex 3 of the ICR, the
economic and financial analysis in the PAD conflicts with the design of the project, since
that analysis advocated avoiding new construction (which the project supports) and
diversifying financing for higher education (which the project does not directly support).
The 2011 Restructuring also inadvertently raised a question about the appropriateness of
the project’s support for capacity expansion: The 2011 Restructuring Paper states that
“four other sites have been cancelled based on the assessment that it would be more
efficient to accommodate new students without necessary [sic] building new sites.”40 This
statement, which is not further explained in the Restructuring documentation or elsewhere
in the project file, calls into question the project’s rationale for supporting construction of
new higher education facilities, even if enrollments had continued to increase as expected.

 (b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The quality of supervision is rated as “moderately unsatisfactory,” reflecting successful
supervision at the start and finish of implementation, but significant shortcomings during
the middle years of project implementation. Implementation counterparts reported that
there was a very positive working relationship between the Government’s implementation
team and the Bank’s supervision team at start of project implementation, characterized by
mutual trust and respect, but that that relationship deteriorated under the next team leader.
Moreover, there were several deficiencies in project supervision during this period,
summarized below. On the basis of these shortcomings alone, the quality of Bank
supervision would have been rated as “unsatisfactory.”

However, supervision standards improved during the final ten months of implementation
under the final Bank task team leader that was appointed in August, 2013. This period
included a second Restructuring that pragmatically focused on completing actions that
could reasonably be concluded under the final 6½ month extension. The final ISR for the
project described the rationale for that restructuring, and suggested that the 2011
Restructuring might have addressed those needs earlier:
           “This restructuring, coming at a late stage in implementation, is intended to ensure
           an orderly project closure. Activities that can realistically be completed will be
           completed, and those that cannot have been canceled. The changes are reflected in
           the Results Framework where a number of indicators for which it has not been
           possible to collect data have been removed. An earlier intervention – for example
           a level one restructuring that calibrated the PDO and Results Framework more
           closely to the pace and scope of progress on the ground – would have afforded
           greater opportunities for course correction. As it is, this restructuring is intended to
           focus efforts on completing substantive activities in the time remaining and
           capturing them in the Results Framework.”41

Based on the strong supervision performance at the start and end of project implementation,
with a weaker performance during the longer middle period of implementation, the overall
quality of Bank supervision is rated as “moderately unsatisfactory.”

Apart from the Bank-Borrower relation issue and the positive conclusion of the project,
described above, the notable positive and negative aspects of the supervision experience
are summarized below.
          Supervision missions were generally timely and unusually amply staffed –
           generally with six or seven specialists, and were often joined by sector and Country
           management. Missions usually met with the Minister and other senior Ministry staff,
           and often carried out field visits to examine on-site progress. Aides Mémoires were

         very detailed and went to considerable lengths to inform the Government and
         management of the actions needed to achieve the objectives of each project
         component. Although the Ministry did not provide adequate monitoring of project
         outcomes during much of the implementation, supervision missions generally
         monitored performance indicators.
        To strengthen the capacity of universities implementing PAQ projects as well as
         the capacity of Central services of the MoHE, the Bank designed and delivered
         during project implementation several training sessions and procurement clinics to
         address procurement related issues and try to resolve them. Several procurement
         tasks were delegated to the Central Coordination Unit (PCU), including: a) requests
         for rejection of bids and re-launch of the procurement process, b) sole-source
         selection and direct contracting up to a stipulated threshold, and c) approval of
         revised procurement plans in agreed situations.
        Bank supervision did not report and respond to the reversal of higher education
         enrollment growth that appeared in 2009, and did not present an accurate
         motivation for the 2011 Restructuring. The 2011 Restructuring Paper includes no
         mention of falling enrollments as a motivation for cancellation of the planned
         expansion at the four sites. On the contrary, it erroneously states that “the
         cancellation of these sites has not changed the achievement of the increased access
         rate, and the Ministry has been able to meet its enrolment targets.”42 As noted
         above, enrollments contracted starting in 2009 and continued to fall thereafter.
        Most of the early supervision missions provided misleading positive reports of
         project performance. In March 2009, just before the mid-term review, only 5% of
         the loan had been disbursed, but the supervision mission reported that “the project
         is on track to achieve the development objectives.” Critical comments on project
         performance by the Country Director’s office in March 200943 played an important
         role in calling attention to implementation shortcomings and the need for corrective
         actions. Following this input, performance ratings were downgraded and
         discussions were initiated with the Government on the need to restructure the
         project. The problems with project implementation and the need for restructuring
         might usefully have been flagged earlier by sector management review.
        Despite slow disbursements and serious delays in implementation of Components
         1 and 2, the first Restructuring was not approved until December 2011 – five years


42
   Page 1, 2011 Restructuring Paper. The Government had requested that the enrollment capacity indicator
be reduced from 13,000 to 6,500 to reflect the deletion of four of the sites formerly planned for expansion.
This error was corrected in the 2013 Restructuring (Section 2.3).

   “This project is approaching its mid-term review and it is less than 5 percent disbursed. Thus, there are
clearly some issues that will need to be addressed. The "soft" part of the project as regards the reform program
seems to be working well but the "hard" part (i.e. procurement of civil works) is not yet off the ground. One
would thus question whether a MS rating is justified for this project given the long delays in this component
and the weak overall disbursement. For certain, the S rating for Procurement must be reviewed as it does not
seem to reflect the reality of the lack of progress there. The MTR will have to consider whether this project
should be restructured in order to perform better and whether some of the loan amount should be cancelled.
The ISR states that the project is on track to meet its development objectives: if this is indeed true, then the
MTR should look at whether the financial envelope of the project is appropriate. A project of $76m with just
$3.36m disbursed at the half-way point presents several questions which would need to be reviewed carefully
at MTR stage.” ISR 6

             after effectiveness. This late response to lagging implementation resulted largely
             from processing delays by the Government and the Bank. Discussion of the need
             for Restructuring was initiated much earlier – at the May, 2009 mid-term review.
             The 2½ year delay that elapsed between the mid-term review and Restructuring
             arose for two reasons. After agreement in principle to the key elements of the
             reallocation at the mid-term review, the Government’s formal request for the
             Restructuring was delayed first by the appointment of a new Minister (in December
             2009) who asked for a review of project implementation before transmitting the
             reallocation request to the Bank, and then by the revolution and change of
             Government in January, 2011. The second source of delay resulted from the Bank’s
             slow response to the Government’s request for Restructuring, which it received in
             March 2011. It was not until December 2011 that the Bank approved the request.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall Bank performance is rated as “moderately unsatisfactory,” reflecting the
“moderately unsatisfactory” ratings for Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and
for quality of supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
 (a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Despite the initial reticence of some Government’s representatives about the project’s
reform agenda and the significant delays in implementation that were observed during the
first four years of implementation, Government performance is rated as moderately
satisfactory because of the improvements that were observed following the Arab spring
and the change of Government in January 2011. The design of the project represented a
compromise (Section 2): Throughout project preparation, the Ministry of Finance had some
reservations about the reform elements of the project and opposed borrowing for technical
assistance. Although the Bank and some reprentatives of MoHE saw the reforms of higher
education under Components 2 and 3 as the raison d’être for the project, the Ministry of
Finance reportedly was primarily more inclined to support activites related to construction
and equipment for university faculties.44 On the part of most Government counterparts,
there was reluctance to be seen to be supporting reforms that were inconsistent with centrist
principles at the time.45 These elements – combined with the appointment of a project
coordinator quite new to the management of donor-financed projects - affected project
implementation until the 2010/2011 revolution ushered in a new Government. Although
the Borrower and the Bank project teams informally agreed on reallocation of loan
proceeds at the May 2009 Mid-Term Review, the Government did not actually request the
project Restructuring until after the January 2011 change of Government.

There was a distinct improvement in Government performance after the Arab spring and
the 2011 change of Government. Just two months after its installation, the new
Government took two critical actions that brought new energy to project implementation:
It requested the Restructuring that had been pending since the May 2009 Mid-Term Review,
and it appointed as Project Coordinator the team leader who had managed the successful
Component 3. Although procurement continued to suffer from delays related to the new
Government’s acute concerns to eliminate the corruption of the former regime, this marked
a turning point in the project: A number of new reform activities were added to Component
2 and implementation of these reforms began to see real progress. The new Government
also confirmed its commitment to the reforms sought under the project. Ministry leadership
during the final year of project completion reiterated the Government’s commitment to the
reform goals of the project. The “moderately satisfactory” rating for Government
performance reflects this situation of somewhat ineffective Government and project
leadership during preparation and early implementation of the project, but more positive
performance in the final years of implementation. Although the period of ineffective
project management was longer than the more dynamic leadership that was observed
towards the end of project implementation, this rating weights the latter performance more
heavily in order to recognize the contributions of the democratically elected Government
and to reflect the status of implementation progress at project closing.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Implementation agency performance is rated as “moderately satisfactory”. Implementation
performance in the initial years of implementation performance would have merited an
“unsatisfactory” rating for implementing agency performance, due to the delays mentioned
above, that affected Components 1 and 2. The ICR’s “moderately satisfactory” rating
balances this situation with: i) the vigorous effort by the project coordination unit to make
up the lost time in implementation during the final three years of implementation, ii)
reaffirmation by the current Minister of the Ministry’s commitment to the systemic reforms
under Component 2, and iii) and an exceptionally thorough and well prepared Borrower’s
completion report.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall Borrower performance is rated as “moderately satisfactory,” reflecting the
“moderately satisfactory” rating for Government performance and the “moderately
satisfactory” rating for implementing agency performance -- recognizing in particular the
improvements in most areas of project implementation following the January, 2011 change
of Government.

6. Lessons Learned

Project development objectives and key performance indicators need to be chosen carefully
to reflect the actual expected benefits of project interventions. In this project, as in many
completed projects, ICR ratings do not capture the full range of project benefits because
those benefits were not included in the statement of project objectives and key performance
indicators (Sections 3.4 and 5.1a.) This situation understates actual project benefits and
gives a misleading, negative impression of project outcomes. Greater care in drafting
project development objectives, key performance indicators, and results frameworks could
ultimately lead to higher performance ratings for projects. Indicators of actual
development outcomes rather than instrumental variables (Section 5.1a) should be chosen
as key performance indicators.

Investments in expanded education capacity need to be justified by a careful analysis of
demographic evidence. A detailed demographic analysis during project preparation would
have documented the unlikelihood of meeting the project’s expectations for continued
enrollment growth.

The Bank and the Borrower need to maintain attentive oversight of project activities in
order to take timely action when the project context changes. The unexpected reversal of
higher education enrollment growth in 2009 led to changes in the project only in December
2011. A more active engagement by the Bank and the Government in monitoring and
evaluating the needs of the project would have led to a more timely response to this change.

Efforts to build ownership and implementation capacity during project preparation result
in better implementation performance. The unusually extensive efforts during the
preparation stage to build ownership among key stakeholders and implementation capacity
for the competitive grants under Component 3 led to successful implementation of this
activity, even as implementation of other project components got off to a slower start.

Team assignments and management oversight should take care to ensure that team
members interact with counterparts in a constructive and supportive working relationship
throughout implementation. Like most Bank-financed projects, PARES II was
implemented in an environment that was significantly constrained by exogenous events –
including, in this case, the political instability in 2010 and 2011 and the exceptional
procurement controls that were put in place after the revolution. Bank supervision needs
to reflect an awareness of these constraints and to be sensitive to evidence of the good-faith
implementation efforts by counterparts under these less-than-ideal circumstances. Team
                                             32
leaders should be selected not only on the basis of their technical skills, but also on the
basis of their people-management and leadership skills and their ability to motivate both
their team colleagues and their implementation counterparts (Section 5.1b). Bank
management review should remain sensitive to this need as implementation progresses.
Bank management should take swift corrective action if problems arise in the Bank team’s
relationship with the Borrower. Whenever possible, project implementation would benefit
from continuity of the same Bank team leader from project preparation through
implementation.

Performance monitoring is useful only if it is accompanied by thoughtful evaluation.
Monitoring data are useful only when they are used. Although Bank supervision reports
did include data that showed falling enrollments, Bank supervision did not react to this
important development and did not consider its implications for project implementation
until the Government requested cancellation of four of the planned university expansions
(Sections 2.3 and 5.1b). This oversight indicates a mechanical approach to monitoring and
evaluation on the part of the Bank – collecting the required data, but not using those data
to draw the appropriate conclusions about project performance and the need for project
restructuring. Periodic revalidation of the results chain underlying a project’s design could
help to prevent oversights of this nature. As the implementation experience for PARES II
demonstrated, this would require a more thoughtful reporting of project outcomes as
implementation progresses.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Implementing agency partners reported that they found Bank procurement procedures
onerous and a source of unnecessary delay throughout implementation. They found it
ironic that the Bank would not consent to their request to delegate procurement authority
to individual institutions, given that the project’s raison d’être was decentralization of
authority to higher education institutions. The Bank supervision team seriously considered
this request, but judged that institutional capacity at the institutional level was not yet well-
enough developed to ensure compliance with the Bank’s procurement guidelines. In any
case, with the increased attention to procurement in the aftermath of the revolution, closer
review by the Bank of project procurement provided an additional safeguard against
possible charges of any irregularities.

The Borrower’s completion report (Annex 7) made a number of constructive
recommendations to reflect the lessons learned under PARES II implementation and to
sustain and spread the benefits that it achieved. These include recommendations to:

       decentralize implementation responsibilities (which contributed to successful
        performance of the competitive grants under Component 3),
       reflect the new skills and responsibilities called for under the decentralization of
        higher education management in a new structure of career development, with
        appropriate incentives to attract the necessary skills – as for job-insertion training,


                                               33
      continue training in project management, procurement, and monitoring and
       evaluation in order to broaden and deepen implementation skills at the institutional
       level, and
      extend the competitive mechanism to cover other programs of higher education
       institutions.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The economic and financial analysis presented in Section D.1 of the PAD focuses on
financial sustainability of higher education. It concludes that financial sustainability of
higher education can be maintained in a situation of stabilizing enrollments after 2015
through implementation of the Government’s reform program – in particular, by: a)
avoiding construction of new buildings through more intensive use of available buildings
(including space available in primary education schools), b) diversifying sources of
financing (including more parental and student participation), and c) improving internal
efficiency by reducing repetition and drop-out rates and shortening the average duration of
studies by implementation of the new LMD degree structure.

The analysis in Section D.1 of the PAD conflicts with the design of the project, since that
analysis maintains that financial sustainability of higher education depends upon avoiding
new construction (whereas the largest component of the project supported new
construction) and diversifying higher education financing (whereas the project does not
explicitly include measures to diversify financing).

The economic and financial analysis presented in the main text of the PAD does not discuss
the economic benefits of the project in terms of the rate of return to higher education – i.e.,
the discounted benefits of higher education through enhanced lifetime earnings of
graduates, net of the social and private costs of higher education – other than to say that
“economic returns are contingent on the capacity of the economy to absorb the flow of
graduates which in turn depends primarily on the positive and high rates of growth during
the coming years.” During the past few years, experience has shown that a growth rate of
5 percent has been insufficient to absorb the growing numbers of graduates.”46

The PAD Annex on Economic and Financial Analysis presents a broader discussion of the
expected economic and financial benefits of the project, including the individual benefits
for university graduates. It describes the expected economic benefits of the project in the
following terms:
          “The project financed by the World Bank, by improving quality, will have two
          major impacts on the economic rate of return of higher education: (i) improvements
          in completion rates in higher education through continual improvements in pass
          rates; and (ii) reduction in unemployment of graduates due to an improvement in
          the relevance and quality of training. An improvement in on-time completion rates
          from 77 percent to 85 percent and a reduction in unemployment rates for graduates
          from 10.2 percent (in 2004) to 5 percent in 2010. Operational costs do not change
          but are restructured in favor of non-salary costs, and reforms reduce unit investment
          costs by 10 percent. The rate of return for higher education, with the project, is
          estimated at 11 percent, and without the project, it is estimated at 8.7 percent.”47

        “The major objective of PDESAQ consists of improving the quality of higher
        education through various actions, investments, reforms and mechanisms. For the
        purposes of the present analysis, the key objective is the 50 percent reduction of the
        repetition and dropout rate by 2010. The importance of this objective is observed
        even during the implementation period of this Program. The economic benefit in
        terms of public expenditures is estimated to be TND193 million. The economic
        benefits accrue on the one hand due to the lower cost of producing a graduate (more
        than 26,570 additional graduates due to the improvement in internal efficiency) and
        on the other hand due to the opportunity cost of dropouts entering the labor force
        without a degree (almost 14,000 fewer dropouts in the period 2007-2010). The real
        saving in public expenditures for an equivalent number of university graduates over
        the period 2007-2010 reaches TND548 million. That represents more than 15
        percent of total expenditures over the period 2007-2010.”48

The sizable improvement in the rate of return to higher education that is projected in Annex
10 of the PAD is assumed to result from two sources: a) the lower cost of producing higher
education graduates due to lower dropout and repetition rates, and b) lower unemployment
rates for higher education graduates due to project-supported improvements in higher
education quality and relevance. Unlike most education rate-of-return analysis, the PAD
analysis does not include in the rate-of-return estimates the benefit of an increased number
of university graduates with higher earnings throughout their working lives. Since
Component 1 was designed to accommodate a significant increase in higher education
enrollments, a rate-of-return analysis reflecting this differential would have been
appropriate to help document the justification for the project.

Data from the 2010 Enquête Nationale sur la Population et l’Emploi and administrative
databases from the National Social Security Funds showed the following employment
outcomes for adults with secondary and higher education attainment:49

higher in 2010 than they were for labor-force participants with just secondary education,
unemployment was much higher among labor-force participants with tertiary education

than it was for participants with just secondary attainment. The PAD economic analysis
had projected that unemployment rates for higher education graduates would decline from
10.2 percent in 2004 to 5 percent in 2010. Instead, the graduate unemployment rate in
2010 more than doubled by comparison to its level in 2004. It would be inappropriate to
conclude from the observed increase in graduate unemployment that the project failed to
improve quality and relevance of higher education. This is true for two reasons: first,
because of the significant slowdown in economic growth that began as the project was
being launched,50 and second because even in a situation of stable growth the effects of
improved higher education quality and relevance would affect average graduate
unemployment rates only gradually, as graduates from the improved programs came to
represent a larger share of the employed labor force.

The same data were used to estimate rates of return to higher eduation in Tunisia, using
three different estimation methods:51

       Table A.3.2 – Estimated Rates of Return to Higher Education for Males and Females
                           Under Three Different Estimation Methods
                               Short-Cut                   IRR               EmploymentAdjusted
                                                                                    IRR
            Male                  18%                      20%                      19%
           Female                 19%                      23%                      11%
Source: Brouni and Broecke, op. cit.

As shown in Table A.3.2, estimated rates of return differed widely according to the
estimation method used. The lowest estimates were for employment-adjusted rate of
return. This finding reflects the high unemployment rates for labor-force participants with
tertiary education. For females with tertiary education attainment, the lower IRR also
reflects the lower rate of labor-force participation for women. All of these estimated rates
of return based on 2010 data are higher than the with-project rate of return as projected in
the PAD analysis, reflecting the fact that they are based largely on the observed earnings
differential between higher education graduates and secondary school graduates (which is
not included in the PAD analysis).

   GDP growth declined steadily from a high of 6% in 2006/07 to negative growth in 2011.
(http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG/countries/TN?display=graph).
51
     The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that equates the present value of higher education costs
      (including foregone earnings) with the present value of incremental expected lifetime earnings (based on
      observed age-earnings profiles) attributable to higher education (i.e., the earnings differential between
      higher education graduates and secondary school graduates). The short-cut estimator (developed by
      Psacharopoulos and Patrinos) is based on a comparison of current average earnings levels of higher
      education graduates and secondary graduates. (George Psacharopoulos and Harry A. Patrinos, “Human
      capital and rates of return,” in G. Johnes and J. Johnes (ed.), International Handbook on the Economics
      of Education, 2004, Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.) The employment-adjusted
      estimator is an IRR estimate that incorporates probability of employment into the age-earnings profile.
      All of these methods project currently observed earnings of workers at different ages into the future, thus
      implicitly assuming stability in the underlying parameters affecting productivity.

                                                         39
However interesting they may be in their own right, these estimated rates of return to higher
education have limited relevance to the PARES II project experience because they
represent the benefits of expanded numbers of graduates earning the higher salaries
observed for currently employed university graduates, whereas the number of higher
education graduates actually contracted during the project. Another reason that limits the
usefulness of rate-of-return information for assessing the PARES II experience is that the
Government’s recently enacted policy of eliminating competitive entry to higher
education52 is likely to have altered the general level of qualifications among incoming
students, leading to a different labor-force experience for current graduates and future
graduates than is reflected in the estimated returns for past graduates.

If the project did not affect earnings and employment prospects by expanding enrollments
or improving employment prospects, then what were its economic and financial benefits?
There are two broad categories of benefits. The first are the improvements in quality and
relevance of higher education programs that resulted from the project-supported
interventions. The second are the improvements in efficiency that resulted from project
interventions.

Improved Quality and Relevance of Higher Education Programs. The unusually high rate
of unemployment among higher education graduates suggests a problem with quality and
relevance of higher education in the past. As described below, the project made an
important contribution to improved quality and relevance of higher education. Although
the number of new facilities supported under the project was reduced under the 2011
Restructuring, the facilities that were constructed under Component 1 are better equipped
with up-to-date teaching and learning materials and laboratory facilities than are most
existing higher education institutions. This constitutes one of the tangible quality
improvements supported under the project. The 2011 reallocation, through additional
grants that were intended to modernize practical work in engineering schools, and other
institutions and faculties of sciences under Component 1, and through the competitive
grants that were received by all higher eduation institutions under Component 3 broadened
this support for upgraded teaching and learning equipment to all universities – particularly,
for science and engineering equipment.

These activities financed the equipping of science laboratories and other facilities in
exising universities, which led to a significant upgrading of the teaching and learning
environment in these institutions. These upgrades, which improved the teaching and
learning environment for all students served by them -- should result in improved teaching
effectiveness and learning achievement. Although there are no internationally accepted
metrics for measuring higher education quality or for gauging the effects of improved
higher education quality on individual earnings and national economic performance, there
is evidence that improvements in cognitive skills yield economic benefits both at the

  All secondary graduates are now guaranteed a university place, according to a competitive orientation
system. Competitive entry is still operative for the most prestigious programs.

                                                   40
individual level and at the aggregate level.53 Presumably, the upgrades in teaching and
learning resources that were supported under the project are yielding and will continue to
yield similar benefits.

The project also supported improved relevance of higher education programs through the
introduction of the new LMD degree structure and through the development of new
employment-oriented course offerings that were jointly developed by higher education
institutions and by local businesses. Longer-term benefits in improved quality and
relevance are expected from the process changes that were introduced under the project,
including strengthened accountability of higher education institutions under performance
contracting and the accreditation process, and institutional autonomy in developing
programs and in mobilizing and using resources. The effects of these changes should
appear in the future in the form of lower unemployment rates for higher education
graduates, and potentially in the form of higher productivity and earnings of graduates.

Improved Efficiency of Higher Education Programs. The project aimed to improve
efficiency by shortening the duration of studies to achieve a given degree or diploma. As
shown in Figure 4, the average duration of studies to complete a given degree or diploma
generally did decline under the project. The average duration for attainment of a bachelors
(licence fondamentale) degree declined from 4.2 years when the new degree was
introduced in 2010 to 3.9 in 2012. For the masters (maîtrise) degree, average duration of
studies declined from a total (including bachelors-level studies) of 7.4 years in 2006 to 5.3
years in 2009, then rose again to 6.4 years in 2011 and 2012. For short-cycle (cycle court)
programs, average duration declined from 3.9 years in 2006 to 3.3 years in 2011 and 2012.
Average duration of studies for science and technology (ISET, licence appliquée) initially
declined, then rose, before returning in 2011 and 2012 to the level of 2006. As of the
writing of this ICR, unit-cost data to translate these changes into budget savings were not
available. Although the efficiency gains observed to date fall short of those projected at
appraisal, they should nevertheless yield significant budget savings in the future.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

Internal evaluations were carried out for the activities financed under the PAQ program in
Component 3, including surveys of the institutions that benefitted from upgraded teaching
equipment under the project. Separate evaluations were carried out for grants awarded in
each of six subject areas: management capacity, engineering, arts and letters, health,
sciences, and social sciences. Evaluations were carried out for each subject area using the
“results-oriented monitoring” approach, which looked at each activity in terms of its
relevance, efficiency, impacts, and sustainability. Evaluation findings were generally very
positive, citing diverse benefits in terms of teaching and learning environment and
processes. As summarized in the Borrower’s completion report (Annex 7), an overall
benefit of the PAQ program was “a closer alignment of higher education and research
institutions to the priorities of the Government, notably in terms of employability,
absorption of graduates into the labor market, and equity, as well as greater influence over
the performance of the institution and creation of a culture of quality.” (Detailed findings
of the PAQ evaluations are available in the project file.)

Performance de l’emprunteur

Comme mentionné auparavant, le projet a connu trois périodes de déploiement et les
performances de l’emprunteur du point de vue de la mise œuvre, ont été analysées
séparément, de manière à mettre en exergue la maturation progressive du projet d’une part
et l’effet de son écosystème d’autre part.

En particulier, les points forts suivants méritent d’être rappelés :

   a) Les principes de bonne gouvernance ont été appliqués par l’Emprunteur à travers:

           a. La participation de toutes les parties prenantes (EESR, universités,
              départements ministériels, patronat) dans le pilotage et le suivi-évaluation
              des programmes phares du projet et la coordination avec d’autres bailleurs
              de fonds et agences internationales de coopération. Cette démarche a eu
              pour effet la compréhension commune des objectifs du projet et des
              responsabilités (notamment celles qui concernent le transfert des activités
              développées grâce au projet aux niveaux des universités et des EESR) ainsi
              que l’appropriation des acquis qui sont autant de gages pour la durabilité
              des résultats.
           b. La transparence et la « redevabilité » dans la prise de décisions (annulation
              des 04 constructions), l’octroi des financements aux EESR et des
              universités dans le cadre du PAQ (base compétitive) et la sélection des
              formateurs et des administrateurs qui ont bénéficié des programmes PRIFF,
              PRICE et PROFAC.
           c. L’équité régionale et du genre par la mise en place d’un volet spécifique du
              PAQ dédié aux jeunes universités et par le rapprochement régional des
              centres de formation des administrateurs conseillers.

   b) L’Emprunteur a fait preuve de réactivité vis-à-vis de l’évolution du contexte du
      projet. L’essentiel des annulations ont été dictées par le souci d’efficience et le
      Ministère a pris bien soin de s’assurer de la prise en charge par le Trésor public des
      marchés non financés par le prêt (marchés non notifiés au 20 septembre 2013) et
      d’atteindre de ce fait les objectifs du projet.

   c) L’Emprunteur a entrepris des initiatives qui n’étaient pas prévues par le projet, en
      particulier l’exercice d’auto évaluation de ses programmes phares dans le but d’en
      tirer les leçons pour les étapes à venir. Le Ministère a également entrepris la mise
      en place de mesures de durabilité des résultats avec, à titre d’exemples, la
      réglementation et l’organisation des centres de certification (projets de textes en
      cours d’examen par le Conseil des universités) et la révision des textes organisant


                                              49
       l’ouverture sur l’environnement socio-économique des institutions universitaires et
       de recherche.

Au cours de son évolution, le projet a gagné en ambition, à l’image de la volonté du
département pour réformer le système en profondeur. Toutefois, la performance de
l’Emprunteur a été handicapée par une capacité organisationnelle –qualitative et
quantitative- qui est restée en deçà de ce qui est attendu, malgré tous les acquis. Ce constat
est valable à tous les niveaux du système et a été relevé systématiquement par les rapports
d’auto évaluation du PRIFF et du PAQ. Le projet a ainsi souffert d’une grande mobilité du
staff administratif et le risque de démobilisation du staff académique est omniprésent,
principalement en raison d’un manque de mesures incitatives (structurelle et matérielle) ou
de reconnaissance pour fidéliser les acteurs principaux. Cette mobilité des compétences a
eu pour effet le déploiement d’efforts supplémentaires de formation (gestion de projets et
passation des marchés public) qui sont restés insuffisants car non structurés.

Enfin, et si on intègre dans cette analyse les facteurs exogènes propres au contexte traversé
par le pays (mouvements sociaux à proximité des chantiers de constructions, changements
structurels à tous les niveaux du système d’ES, contestation des décisions et projets initiés
avant janvier 2011, examen renforcé des marchés, etc..), nous estimons, de notre point de
vue que l’Emprunteur a relevé le défi de la performance.

Performance de la Banque

La Banque a participé activement à la préparation et à la restructuration du PARESII. A
travers la disponibilité de son staff résident, ses missions de supervision et l’expertise
rendue disponible notamment en fin de parcours, elle a appuyé activement l’Emprunteur
dans la mise en œuvre des activités du projet et dans l’atteinte de ses objectifs.
Ces efforts se sont intensifiés durant les derniers 18 mois et se poursuivent à ce jour : la
Banque soutient actuellement, par le biais d’une assistance technique de haut niveau, les
efforts du Ministère dans l’achèvement d’étapes clés de sa réforme de l’ES à savoir : la
mise en place de son système d’assurance qualité externe et interne, la révision des contrats
de performance et l’employabilité des jeunes diplômés à travers l’entreprenariat et l’auto
emploi.

La Banque a également contribué à la valorisation des résultats du projet et a donné toute
la visibilité à ses acquis ; ceci s’est concrétisé par les visites de ses hauts responsables
(Administrateurs) et de délégations de pays voisins (Mali, Yémen, Guinée) désireux de
mettre en place des programmes similaires au PAQ, à la co-construction et à la formation
et certification des formateurs et des étudiants. L’Emprunteur a également bénéficié de la
visibilité donnée par la Banque avec l’organisation conjointe avec l’UTICA de la
Conférence régionale autour de la Gouvernance universitaire et l’assurance qualité en juin
2014. Les résultats du PARESII et en particulier ceux du PAQ ont été l’objet d’un intérêt
particulier si on se réfère au nombre des participants aux visites des EESR bénéficiaires
du PAQ.
La mission résidente de la Banque a particulièrement appuyé la Cellule de coordination qui
a bénéficié de l’expertise de proximité de ses spécialistes en passation de marchés dont la
réactivité et la disponibilité est à a saluer ici.
                                             50
Pour toutes ces raisons, nous estimons que les efforts de la Banque en direction du système
d’ES tunisien ont été à la hauteur de ses engagements passés. Pour cela, le Ministère
conscient de la valeur ajoutée de ce partenariat et soucieux de le perdurer, a formulé une
requête pour une mission d’identification ; celle-ci s’est déroulée 4 mois après la date
d’achèvement du PARESII et a pris pleinement conscience des leçons tirées de l’exercice
du PARESII à tous les niveaux, y compris du partenariat.

Arrangements pour la durabilité des résultats

La pérennité des résultats du PARESII a été prise en considération à la conception du projet
comme démontré en §3.2-C ; l’effort de s’assurer de cette durabilité s’est poursuivi durant
l’exécution du projet avec, en particulier les mesures suivantes :

      L’institutionnalisation des centres de certification créées dans toutes les universités
       tunisiennes via leur association avec les Centres de carrières nouvellement installés
       et la révision des textes organisant leur fonctionnement et de manière plus globale,
       des textes régissant l’ouverture des universités sur leur environnement socio
       professionnel. Un autre volet de la stratégie de sortie de projet a consisté à mettre à
       la disposition des centres habilités -via leurs universités respectives- des frais de
       passage d’examen de certification (ou vouchers) de manière à impulser la
       génération de ressources propres.
      La signature de conventions de partenariats avec les agences de coopération
       bilatérale et multilatérale (IFT, British Council, Amideast, AUF) qui dépassent la
       date de clôture du projet et garantissent ainsi la continuité des activités. Grâce à
       cette initiative, les composantes du PRIFF continuent leur montée en puissance
       durant l’année 2014-2015 avec les financements propres de ces mêmes partenaires
       (IFT, British Council et AUF) pour l’enseignement des langues française et
       anglaise.
      La formation (et la certification) de formateurs de formateurs référents au sein de
       chaque université est censée renforcer les capacités de celle-ci en termes
       d’autonomie académique et l’effet « cascade » a été planifié et est attendu sur les
       fonds propres des universités.
      L’ouverture de nouvelles perspectives dans le domaine de la formation des
       formateurs et de la certification des étudiants grâce à la dynamique créée dans le
       cadre du partenariat international ; c’est notamment le cas avec le démarrage d’un
       projet TEMPUS dédié à la formalisation de la formation des formateurs en
       pédagogie et didactique dans la continuité des travaux de l’UVT et de l’ISEFC.
       C’est également le cas de perspectives concrètes pour développer des MOOCs
       grâce au support de l’AUF aux fins de la préparation des étudiants à la certification
       en langue française.


                                             51
 L’appui technique de la Banque dans le domaine de l’assurance qualité, de la
 contractualisation et de l’entreprenariat (et l’auto emploi) constitue également une
 initiative pour assurer la continuité du PARESII en attendant des financements
 complémentaire.

Leçons tirées

Rappelons les principales conclusions de ce rapport :

  i.   L’évaluation des objectifs du PARESII a montré leurs pertinences, toujours
       d’actualité, et leur adéquation avec les politiques sectorielles, la stratégie de la
       réforme de l’Enseignement Supérieur en cours et les attentes de l’environnement
       socio-professionnel ; la restructuration du projet a été une opportunité pour
       réorienter les efforts vers l’amélioration de la qualité et de la pertinence des
       formations par rapport aux besoins du marché du travail.
 ii.   La qualité de la conception du projet s’est distinguée par (i) la part accordée aux
       parties prenantes dans la participation aux différentes étapes de consultation,
       pilotage, suivi et évaluation de ses composantes, (ii) la prise en compte des aspects
       transversaux tels que l’équité sociale et du genre, l’environnement, la bonne
       gouvernance et la synergie avec les autres bailleurs de fonds et, (3i) la logique
       d’intervention qui s’est affinée en cours d’exécution pour mieux servir l’atteinte
       des objectifs du projet. Il y a lieu de capitaliser ces bonnes pratiques et continuer à
       les disséminer.
iii.   La conception du projet n’a pas suffisamment pris en considération les risques liés
       à la mobilité du staff administratif et académique ni à la centralisation excessive de
       la passation des marchés au niveau de la Commission départementale des marchés.
       Les recommandations suivantes ont été avancées (Cf. §3.3) :

           o Décentraliser les activités, notamment celles qui bénéficient directement
             aux universités; ce nouveau paradigme nécessite une redevabilité accrue via
             la contractualisation, l’instauration d’un système de suivi/évaluation de la
             mise en œuvre et la mise en place d’un programme contextualisé de
             développement des compétences dans le domaine de la gestion des projets,
             de la passation des marchés et de l’élaboration de termes de références et de
             cahiers des charges techniques.
           o Doter les structures de pilotage (à l’échelle centrale et au niveau des IES)
             d’une organisation qui fidélise les administrateurs et les enseignants en leur
             permettant une évolution légitime dans leur carrière au sein de la structure
             même ; le recrutement du personnel (à tous les niveaux y compris le haut
             management) devrait se baser sur les compétences requises via un appel à
             candidatures qui délimiterait les missions ainsi que les résultats attendus.

 iv.    La conception du projet (initiale et lors de la restructuration) ne permet pas de
        mesurer, à sa juste valeur, les résultats atteints dans le domaine de la qualité et du
        développement des capacités humaines (formateurs et administrateurs). Il s’agit
        d’une déficience grave qui peut porter préjudice à l’évaluation externe du projet. Il
        est possible d’y remédier à l’avenir en renforçant les compétences des équipes
        chargées de l’élaboration des projets.

  v.    Concernant la mise en œuvre du projet, il y a lieu de souligner le contexte
        exceptionnel qui a influé directement sur son efficience ; pour cela, nous avons
        distingué trois périodes remarquables : période allant du démarrage à la mi-
        parcours, la période de restructuration et la période de reprise.

 vi.    Les retards dans la mise en œuvre ont été à l’origine de l’annulation du tiers des
        fonds du prêt ; ces retards trouvent leur origine à différents niveaux tels que a) les
        changements successifs au niveau du management du projet et de ses composantes
        (Ministère, Universités et EESR) ainsi qu’au niveau du suivi du projet par la
        Banque (3 TTL se sont succédés avec un engagement et une relationnel avec
        l’Emprunteur très inégaux), b) l’examen renforcé des marchés publics par la
        Commission des marchés et retards dans la prise de décision et dans la transmission
        des avis, c) le développement continu des compétences des intervenants
        insuffisamment pris en considération par le projet et, d) des textes juridiques relatifs
        à l’ouverture sur l’environnement socioprofessionnel obsolètes.

vii.    Pour cela, rappelons les recommandations suivantes :

             o Capitaliser et organiser l’expérience acquise dans l’analyse des besoins, le
                montage des projets, leur gestion, le suivi de la mise en œuvre et leur
                évaluation ; ce point concerne toutes les structures et un réseautage devrait
                être mis en place avec la création de cellules pour la veille, la planification
                stratégique (contrats programmes), l’ouverture sur l’environnement et, de
                manière générale, la génération de ressources propres (et la levée de fonds).
             o Valoriser les activités d’ouverture sur l’environnement socio économique
                des IES et actualiser les textes les régissant, en particulier ceux portants sur
                les modalités et taux de rémunération des experts et personnel d’appui.
viii.   L’évaluation des activités du projet a mis en exergue la nécessité de continuer de
        soutenir et de pérenniser les projets phares du PARESII, à savoir le PAQ, le PRIFF
        et le PRICE.

 ix.    Concernant le PAQ, il a été à l’origine de l’introduction de la culture de la qualité
        et de la notion de la redevabilité au sein des institutions porteuses de projets ; il a
        su également créer une dynamique autour de l’appel à propositions basé
                                              53
        essentiellement sur la compétition et permis d’ancrer l’appartenance à l’institution
        et à l’université. Compte-tenu de l’appropriation de cet instrument par les
        universités et les établissements d’enseignement supérieur, il y a tout intérêt à
        pérenniser le PAQ car il permet à la fois l’orientation stratégique des projets par
        le Ministère et l’autonomie des établissements dans l’élaboration et la gestion de
        leurs projets. Si cet instrument était pérennisé, la levée des difficultés systémiques
        du programme relevées dans l’autoévaluation du PAQ ainsi que
        l’institutionnalisation et la légitimation accrues de ses structures seraient
        nécessaires.

  x.    Concernant le PRIFF et le PRICE, ils participent au renforcement de l’autonomie
        académique des universités et au pilotage de la qualité par le biais de la formation
        (et de la certification) de référents formateurs de formateurs au sein de chaque
        université et de l’habilitation de centres pour la préparation à la certification et pour
        la certification.

 xi.    Au sujet du PRIFF, il y a tout avantage à ce que les universités capitalisent les
        bonnes pratiques et assurent « l’effet cascade » sur leurs fonds propres ou dans le
        cadre des opportunités offertes par les programmes internationaux (notamment
        Erasmus +). Un intérêt particulier devrait être réservé à la co-construction des
        licences et mastères en partenariat socio-professionnel, à l’entreprenariat (et à
        l’auto-emploi) et à la professionnalisation des étudiants (soft skills et langues
        étrangères).

xii.    Concernant le PRICE, le MESRSTIC a entrepris l’institutionnalisation des centres
        de certification par l’élaboration des textes organisant leur fonctionnement et de
        manière plus globale, des textes régissant l’ouverture des universités sur leur
        environnement socio professionnel. Ces centres devraient profiter aussi bien aux
        étudiants qu’aux diplômés en quête d’emplois qui souhaiteraient faire valoir et
        reconnaitre leurs compétences dans un domaine donné. Les universités sont
        conscientes de ces avancées et ne manqueront pas d’en assurer la durabilité.

xiii.   Enfin, les acquis du système d’ES en matière d’assurance qualité aussi bien interne
        qu’externe sont palpables et bénéficieront d’un appui accru du Ministère et de ses
        partenaires.Annexes
