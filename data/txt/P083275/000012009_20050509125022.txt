                              CREDIT AND PROGRAM       SUMMARY

Borrower:      Republic o f Niger.

Beneficiaries: Populationo fNiger.

Amount:        SDR 26.6 million (US$40 million equivalent).

Terms:         Standard IDA Terms.

Description:   The proposed credit is designed to help implement the Government's economic
               reform program during 2005-2006 and Niger's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
               (PRSP) by supporting key policy measures aiming at: (i)      deepening the reforms
               in public expenditure management; (ii)increasing the impact on the poor of
               public spending in key priority areas, including public service delivery in
               education and health, and investments for agricultural growth and rural
               development; and (iii) improving the monitoring and evaluation system for the
               implementation o f the PRSP and its revision.

Benefits:      The proposed operation i s expected to help the implementation o f the poverty
              reduction program by: (i)improving budgeting and public expenditure
               management by enhancing budget preparation, execution, and controls in the
               context o f the implementation o f the action plan o f the PEMFAR report (Public
               Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review, Report No.
               29752-NE); (ii)improving basic service delivery in the social sectors and
               achieving a better integration and coordination o f the initiatives implemented for
               faster poverty reduction in rural areas; and (iii)revamping the monitoring and
               evaluation system.

Risks:         Four main risks could influence the expected outcomes o f the proposed credit: (i)
               external factors such as adverse climatic conditions, social and political
               upheavals in neighboring countries, and shortfall in donor support could have a
               deterring impact on growth, reduce government resources and affect its ability to
               conduct its reform program; (ii)  policy reversals and/or slippages in key reforms
               could affect the Government ability to maintain a stable macroeconomic
              environment and focus expenditure on poverty reducing priorities identified in
              the PRSP; (iii) human, institutional, and managerial capacity could slow
                                weak
              down the pace o f improvements in budgetary reforms; and (iv) fiduciary risks
              with regard to the use o f public funds remain as internal and external control
              mechanisms remain weak and capacity of the Chamber o f Accounts i s limited.
              These risks are mitigated by the strength o f the Government's ownership and
              commitment affirmed at the highest level to implement the proposed measures
              and the Government's resolve to advance its reform agenda, by an active policy
              dialogue between the Bank and the Government, and by close collaboration
              between donors to provide technical assistance to improve capacity-building and
              ensure full implementation o f the reformprogram.

I.INTRODUCTION

1.      Emerging from an economic crisis and political instability in the late 1990s, Niger has
achieved substantial progress in implementing a number o f reforms. The Government's structural
adjustment program has established fiscal discipline, improved public expenditure management,
opened up the economy, and enhanced the private-sector environment. A number o f social
indicators have also improved over the past four years, in particular for education and health. Yet,
the country's output remains dependent on weather, private-sector-led growth has not yet
materialized, and the authorities still face critical challenges to build a sound, efficient and
transparent public expenditure management system.           Poverty remains widespread and social
indicators are among the weakest in the world. To tackle these challenges, the Government has
firmly expressed its commitment to pursue its reform programwith the assistance o f donors.

2.      Tlie Bank's main instruments for supporting the government's reform program in recent
years have been the Public ExpenditureAdjustment Credits (PEAC Iand 11)'. The Niger PRSP
identifies public expenditure management as a strategic priority for Niger. Building upon the
achievements and lessons o f PEAC I,PEAC I1 and the recently completed Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR, report No. 29752-NE), the
proposed Public ExpenditureReform Credit (PERC) will aim to (i)         deepen the reforms in public
expenditure management; (ii)increase the impact on the poor o f public spending in key priority
areas, including public service delivery in education and health, and investments for agricultural
growth and rural development; and (iii)improve the monitoring and evaluation system for the
implementation o f the PRSP and its revision. These objectives are closely aligned with the PRSP.

11. NIGER'SECONOMY

A. Political and Social Context

3.      Niger has undergone a fundamental political transition during the last four years. The
militaryjunta that had assumed power after the April 1999 coup handed power over to a civilian
Government, following orderly presidential and legislative elections in December 1999. Tlie
coalition Government headed by President Mamadou Tandja has stabilized and restored
confidence   in Government for the last four years through improved political and economic
governance, and by restoring sufficient discipline in public finance. Presidential and legislative
elections were successfully held in November-December 2004. The peaceful and democratic
transition between civilian Governments i s the first in more than a decade. Local elections were
also successfully completed inJuly 2004 as part o f a program o f political decentralization.

4.       The country's PRSP was adopted in January 2002. The PRSP is based on four pillars: (i)

support to PRSP objectives in its CAS3 o f January 2003. The Government has translated the
PRSP into a medium-term reform program focusing on: (i)           improved management o f public
resources; (ii) greater coverage and better quality o f basic social services and (iii) improved
                                                                                       an
environment for growth through the development o f both agriculture and the private sector. The
overall reform program builds on the economic, financial and social reformpolicies implemented
between 2000 and 2004 with support from the international financial community.

5.       Assessment o f progress towards PRSP targets i s hampered by the lack o f recent
household survey data. The available evidence is summarized in Annex 1. There has been a
large increase in gross primary enrollment from 29 percent in the early 1990s (and 41.7 percent in
2001) to 50 percent in 2004, and an increase was also observed in the ratio o f girls to boys in
primary schools, to 40 percent in 2004. On the other hand, poverty projections based on per
capita GDP growth suggest that the share o f the population inpoverty in 2004, at 64 percent, was
essentially the same as in 1993, at 63 percent. Child malnutrition also remains high, at 40 percent
to 50 percent depending on the data sources, and it i s unlikely that it has gone down significantly.
The child mortality rate decreased slightly in the 1990s from 322 per thousand to 274 per
thousand, and the relatively slow pace o f increase in real health coverage together with the
detrimental impact on the poor o f the current health recovery policy (which does not include
exemptions for the poor) suggest that gains since then may also have been limited. While Niger
has been able to avoid high rates o f HIV/AIDS infection, malaria prevalence remains very high.
Access to drinking water has increased somewhat thanks to the construction o f wells in rural
areas and the provision o f social connections to the network in urban areas, but overall, access
rates probably remain limited, with the poor paying more for their water than the better o f f in
urban areas, and having to walk longer periods o f time to access water inrural areas.

6.       Progress has been achieved in part thanks to social infrastructure investments fimded
under the Special Program o f the President o f the Republic. The President's program was created
in 2001, and it has benefited from the vast majority o f the resources allocated to Niger under
HIPC debt relief. A recent and independent audit o f the program requested by the Government
suggested that more than 5,000 new physical investments have been implemented between 2001
and 2003 through the program, including 1992 classrooms, 1930 community health posts, 861
water wells, 120 dams and other similar works, and some 20 irrigation and agriculture projects.
Apart from increasing access to education and health services, and helping agricultural producers
through better access to water and better water management, the program has also injected
important sums o f money into rural areas. However, the audit suggests that socio-economic
impacts have been limited versus what might have been hoped for, due to both technical
difficulties in the implementation o f some initiatives, and an insufficient integration o f these
activities in broader strategies o f line Ministries. Also, some recommendations have been made
inthe areas o fprocurement and accounting by the audit team. Comments have been sent jointly
by the World Bank and the IMF to the Minister o f Economy and Finance on the preliminary
report on the Special Program submitted to the government by the audit team, and this operation
takes the audit report, as well as the joint World Bank and IMF comments into account (see
paragraph 32).

B. Recent Macroeconomicand FiscalPerformance, 2000-2004

7.      Improved macroeconomic performance. The new civilian Government which took
office in December 1999 inheriteda deteriorating macroeconomic situation. Real GDP fell that
year by 0.6 percent. On an accrual basis, the fiscal deficit (including grants) increased to 5.2
percent o f GDP. The Government also accumulated large external and domestic arrears. Against
this background, the new civilian Government moved quickly inimplementing a reformprogram
supported by the Bank through a Public Finance Recovery Credit (PFRC) and two successive
Public Expenditure Adjustment Credits (PEAC Iand PEAC II),          and by the IMF through its
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The reform program sought to restore
macroeconomic stability, improve public finance management, and boost economic growth. The
outcomes o f the implementationo f the reform program has been satisfactory.

8.      Macroeconomic performance improved substantially over the 2001-2003 period, despite
an unfavorable environment generated by the recurrence o f domestic and regional socio-political
tensions, and difficulties in securing timely and adequate external assistance. Real GDP grew at
an annual average rate o f 5.1 percent over 2001-03 (yielding a per capita real GDP growth o f
about 2 percent per annum), in part thanks to a strong performance o f 7.1 percent in 2001. This
compares to an average decline in GDP growth o f one percent per year over 1999-00. The strong
growth performance over the 2001-2003 period reflected both favorable weather conditions and
the impact o f measures to promote growth, including improvement in fiscal management and
increases capital expenditures on infrastructure. This improved macroeconomic environment has
increased investor and consumer confidence. On the demand side, private investment increased
by two percentage points o f GDP between 1999 and 2003, rising to 5.7 percent o f GDP.
Similarly, private consumption grew faster in nominal terms during 2000-2003 than in the
previous three years. On a 12-month basis, inflation fell from 4.7 at end-2000 to a negative 1.5
percent at end-2003 as a result o f continued prudent BCEAO monetary policies, sound fiscal
policies, and better output growth performance, especially in the rural sector. Political and
economic instability in Niger's two major regional trading partners, CBte d'Ivoire and Nigeria did
not result in large losses ingrowth.

 Box 1:The Challenge of AchievingHigher Growthin Niger

 After decades o f decline, GDP per capita has stabilized inNiger after the 1994 devaluation o f the C F A
 Franc. Figure 1provides the long term trend in per capita GDP and predictions up to 2007 (the data
 are inconstant local currency units indexed at a value o f one for 1994), as well as the trend inpoverty
 (share o f the population inpoverty, usingavailable data and simulation techniques). Since 1994, GDP
 growth has beenjust high enough to offset the negative impact o f population growth on standards o f
 living. While this constitutes an improved performance considering that the standards o f living were
 halved during the 30 years preceding the devaluation, Niger's post-1994 per capita GDP growth.
 compares poorly with the experience o f other West African Economic and Monetary Union countries.
 For example, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal, experienced much higher per capita
 growth rates after 1994 due to both higher GDP growth, and lower pressure from population growth
 (Niger has had one o f the world's highest population growth rates, estimated at up to 3.5 percent
 growth per year since 1995, compared for example to 2.4 percent per year for Senegal). As a result,
 poverty remains very high. On the basis o f simulations, we can conjecture that the population living
 inpoverty has remained at around 63-64 percent, the level observedin 1994-95.

 Part of the lack o f growth after the 1994 devaluation may have been related to Niger's relative
 isolation from world markets (Le., the country's combined lack o f a strong export base, as compared
 to cotton in Mali, lack o f resources from remittances, as compared to Burkina Faso, and status as a
 land-locked country). This isolation has shieldedNiger from recent political and economic instability
 in CBte d'Ivoire and Nigeria, its two major trading partners, but it also has restricted opportunities
 for growth. In addition, the country has continued to be affected by weather shocks, the lack o f a
 strong private sector, and political turmoil before the return to democracy in2000.

 The present PERC does not focus on growth issues, because there is no analytical base for policy
 recommendations in this area. Efforts to build such analytical base are being undertaken through a
 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) with a focus on sources o f growth, the preparation o f an
 Investment Climate Assessment study, and the implementation o f a new nationally representative
 household survey. These studies and the household survey should be available in the Fall o f 2005 or
 Spring o f 2006, so that the recommendations from these studies and the analysis o f the survey can
 then be usedin future development lending operations.

9.       Persistent vulnerability. Nevertheless, Niger's economic recovery still remains fragile
as evidenced by the impact on growth o f the 2004 drought and locust attacks. Growth
performance has remained largely correlated with growth in agriculture sector and therefore
vulnerable to external factors. In 2004, the combined effect o f less favorable weather conditions
and a locust plague led to growth in GDP o f only 0.9 percent, reflecting a decline in agriculture
production o f 12 percent4. This translated into a decline inper capita GDP o fmore than 2 percent.
Due to lower production o f food stuff and higher energy prices, end-period inflation increased at
an estimated 3.7 percent compared to -1.6 percent in 2003. Meanwhile, the external current
account deficit remained stable, estimated at 7.3 percent o f GDP, compared with 7.6 percent in
2003.

10.      Fiscal stability. Fiscal performance has been satisfactory owing to the implementation o f
fiscal adjustment policies and an improvement inpublic finances. Policies were aimed at ensuring
a sustainable fiscal position and complying gradually with the convergence criteria o f the
WAEMU. Revenue increased from 8.6 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 9.9 percent in 2003.
Government expenditure remained stable at an annual average o f 17.7 percent o f GDP over 2001-
2003. Current expenditure declined from 11.2 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 10.1 percent in 2003,
Meanwhile, capital expenditure increased by about 1.6 percentage points o f GDP over the same
period, from 5.7 percent o f GDP to 7.3 percent o f GDP, in line with the implementation o f the
Poverty Reduction Strategy and supported in part by resources freed by the HIPC Initiative. The
overall budget deficit (on a commitment basis, excluding official budgetary grants) declined to
7.7 percent per annum between 2001 and 2003, versus 9.9 percent over 1999-2000. The basic
budget deficit declined to an annual average o f2.4 percent o f GDP over 2001-2003, from a yearly
average deficit of 3.9 percent o f GDP in the previous two years. In addition, the Government has
made remarkable efforts to clear domestic arrears. In2004, fiscal performance remained strong as
the basic and overall budget deficits are estimated at 1.1 and 7.6 percent o f GDP, respectively.
However, due to low domestic revenue mobilization, these performances are mainly the results o f
strong expenditure control, including tight cash management practices. The deficits were mainly
financed by grants and concessional loans.

11.      The successful implementation o f the reform program enabled Niger to reach the
Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative on April 12, 2004, and to receive
additional debt relief (topping-up) in the amount o f US$142 million. Also, after three years o f
implementation of the 2000-2003 reform program, the sixth PRGF review and the ex-post
assessment o f Performance under IMF-supported program conducted in June 2004 concluded that
Niger's economic and financial management during this period was appropriate for
macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction.

C. Medium-TermMacroeconomic Frameworkand FinancingRequirements, 2005-07

12.      Macroeconomic objectives. In line with the objectives spelled out in the PRSP, Niger's
macroeconomic objectives for 2005-2007 are to: (i)achieve an annual real GDP growth rate o f
about 4 percent; (ii)limit annual inflation to under 3 percent; and (iii)    reduce the external current
account deficit (excluding official transfers) to about 6.3 percent o f GDP by 2007. Assuming a
return to good weather, continued prudent financial policies and government investment in
infrastructure, real GDP should grow at 4.2 percent on average during 2005-2007.                     Key
macroeconomic indicators for the medium-term macroeconomic framework are given in Table 1.

    Agriculture, excluding livestock, accounts for about 23 percent o f GDP (the primary sector as a whole
    accounts for 40 percent o f GDP).

                                                 7


Growth would be driven by a rebound in agricultural production. Investment in infrastructure and
other programs to modernize agriculture are expected to reduce the vulnerability o f this sector to
severe droughts. Robust growth in non-agriculture sectors would also continue, benefiting from
HIPC-based investments in social sectors. Improvements in economic policies o f Niger's regional
partners (including Nigeria) would help to improve growth prospects, as would higher
investments and a strengthening o f non-mining activities, particularly agriculture and services
(commerce, transportation, and tourism). New gold mining activities would also boost growth
temporarily, and help reduce the current account deficit (excluding budgetary grants) from 7.3
percent o f GDP in2004 to 6.3 percent o f GDP in 2007, and stabilizing at an annual average o f 6.8
percent over 2005-2007. Inflation would remain at about 2.0 percent as a result o f a recovery in
supplies o f agriculture goods and prudent monetary policy at the regional level as well as a stable
real exchange rate. Gross investment would increase from 15.9 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 17.4
percent in 2007, reaching on average 17 percent o f GDP over 2005-2007. Gross national savings
would also slightly increase, from nearly 10 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 10.2 percent o f GDP in
2006 and stabilizing at an annual average o f 10.3 percent over 2005-2007.

13.      Over 2005-2007, outcomes could, however, be less favorable than suggested by the
above scenario. First, favorable weather conditions that have underpinned the growth
performance over the last few years (except for 2004) may not continue.          Droughts tend to
reappear in Niger every 4 to 5 years, and history shows that such droughts reduce growth by
several percentage points. Second, delays in implementing structural reforms could compromise
the expected increase inprivate sector investment. Third, failure to mobilize domestic resources
and shortfalls in domestic revenues could impair fiscal performance. Fourth, delays in
mobilizing external financing for the public expenditure program and investment projects and in
implementing them could jeopardize achievements, especially in the social sectors. Finally, debt
sustainability remains a concern. Although Niger reached the Completion Point and was granted
an additional debt relief (topping-up), recent preliminary estimates reveal that the debt situation
(measured by the N P V o f the debtiexports ratio) remains fragile, requiring constant monitoring.
This mightrestrictNiger's ability to attract foreign financing and future growth.

14.      The fiscal framework for 2005 targets a basic budget deficit (excluding grants) o f 0.8
percent o f GDP (CFAF 14.7 billion) by increasing revenue by 0.6 percent o f GDP from 10.5
percent of GDP in2004 to 11.1percent in 2005, while holding the line on expenditures other than
externally-financed investment outlays. Government spending i s projected to increase by 0.6
percent o f GDP to 18.8 percent in 2005, reflecting mainly an expected rise in HIPC-financed
expenditure, which i s projected to reach 2.1 percent o f GDP (from 1.5 percent o f GDP in 2004).
Recurrent expenditure will remain around 9.8 percent o f GDP (CFAF 170 billion) from 9.0
percent o f (CFAF 157.8 billion) in 2004. The wage bill i s projected to be contained at 3.6 percent
o f GDP (CFAF 61.9 billion). Capital expenditures are expected to increase by 0.5 percentage
point o f GDP, mainly financed by foreign aid. In line with the PRSP objectives, total spending
on health and education would increase to 5.5 percent o f GDP from 4 percent in 2004. Domestic
payments arrears would be reduced by FCFA 18.4 billion (1.1 percent o f GDP) and the stock o f
domestic arrears would fall to CFAF 32.7 (1.9 percent o f GDP) in 2005 from CFAF 51.1 billion
(3.1 percent o f GDP) in2004.

15.      Aid pledges for 2005 are short of projected requirements. The overall fiscal deficit
(on a commitment basis and excluding budgetary grants) i s projected to decline from an estimated
7.7 percent o f GDP (CFAF 132.2 billion) to 6.7 percent by 2007 (CFAF 132.6), reaching an
annual average of 7.3 percent o f GDP over 2005-2007. The basic fiscal balance turning to a
surplus projected at 0.2 percent o f GDP by 2007 and complying with WAEMU convergence
criteria. Under this base scenario and after taking into account external debt amortization

                                                            8


payments, net reduction in domestic arrears, and identified external resources for the investment
budget, a financing gap o f about CFAF 153 billion (annual average o f 2.7 percent o f GDP) i s
projected for 2005-2007, including CFAF 60.1 billion for 2005 (3.4 percent o f GDP). 75 percent
of the 2005 financing gap will be covered by IDA and the European Union, through loans and
grants of CFAF 20 billion and CFAF 25 billion, respectively. The remaining financing will be
provided by France (CFAF 7 billion) and the African Development Bank and other bilateral
donors (CFAF 8 billion). In light with financing assurances provided by major donors in 2005
and the government's strong commitment to pursue the reform program, the authorities are
confident that the residual financing gap for 2006-2007 (about CFAF 90 billion) will be covered
through budgetary support.

111. NIGER'SMEDIUM-TERMREFORMPROGRAM

16.        This section provides a discussion o f Niger's medium-term reform program around the
issues o f focus o f PERC, namely (i)                deepening public expenditure management reforms; (ii)
increasing the impact on the poor o f public spending in priority areas, especially public service
delivery in education and health, and investments for agricultural growth and rural development;
and (iii)   improving the monitoring and evaluation system for the implementation o f the PRSP and
its revision.

A. Deepeningthe Reforms in PublicExpenditureManagement

17.     Since 2000, budget management reforms have been implemented with the support o f the
World Bank (PEAC Iand 11). In addition, in 2004, in close collaboration with the Government
and the European Union, the Bank prepared a Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR, report No. 29752-NE).                The PEMFAR emerged from an
agreement in 2002 between the Government, the European Union and the World Bank to
undertake a comprehensive assessment o f Niger's public financial management systems and
capacities. The analysis provided in the PEMFAR was carried in the subsequent year, with the
results discussed at a validation workshop held inNiamey in June 2004. The workshop led to the
adoption by the Government o f an action plan to address key weaknesses in public sector
management and accelerate reforms in the areas o f budget preparation, execution, reporting and
control. This action plan was then revised in October 2004 during the pre-appraisal mission for
PERC, inorder to take into account comments from donors, especially the European Union. The
final action plan, as agreed by all parties, i s presented in the detailed PEMFAR matrix reproduced
inAnnex 6. The matrix includes measures that should be implementedover the next 5 years. A
few o f these measures have already been implemented, and others are the focus o f PERC.
Additional measures will be tackled in subsequent operations.

18.     The recommendations proposed in the PEMFAR are at the core o f many o f the proposed
measures in PERC, especially in the area o fpublic expenditure management. However, one must
recognize that in a country as poor as Niger, reforms over a long period o f time are needed to
reduce poverty, and the measures proposed in PERC should be viewed in this context. In the
context o f the implementation o f the PEMFAR, the Government adopted eight priority measures
to strengthen public finance management in Niger in 2005. The measures are: (i)submit
documents accompanying Budget Law to the National Assembly highlighting the consistency o f
budget proposals with the poverty reduction strategy; (ii)       prepare budget-programs for primary
education and health sectors; (iii)allocate HIPC funds to finance recurrent expenditures in
priority sectors consistent with the PRSP; (iv) define in each key sector and rank vital
expenditures that need special protection; (v) Integrate transactions that are not handled by public
accountants, notably externally-financed investment expenditures into Treasury operations; (vi)
integrate all external debt transactions into Government accounts; (vii) Reactivate the clearance
process o f domestic arrears by adopting a new plan, which clearly defines clearance procedures
and rules; and (viii) organize public expenditure reviews by MEF and key sectoral ministries by
the end o f each fiscal year.

19.      The Government has made progress in implementing these measures (see Box 2).
Budget-programs have been prepared in basic education and health sectors. The revised budget
law has ensured an increase in HIPC resources allocated mainly to priority sectors. The execution
of the cash allocation plan has followed the PRSP priorities as translated into the budget and
protected vital expenditure. A new software was installed as a first step to integrate all external
debt transactions into Government accounts. The clearance o f domestic arrears has continued.
These achievements notwithstanding, there i s a need to speed-up the implementation process o f
the priority measures to firm up the ground for the implementation o f the comprehensive public
finance  reform designed under the PEMFAR action plan. To this end, PERC will help the
Government implement the remaining measures, and strengthening the application o f those
already partially implemented. A discussion o f recent achievements in public expenditure
management follows.       Details on the measures recommended under PERC are provided in
Part IV of this document.

1Box 2. Status of the PriorityMeasuresAdoptedby the Governmentfor 2005

 The design o f PERC has been informed by the PEMFAR report prepared jointly by the European
 Union, the Government o f Niger, and the World Bank, with inputs from other donors and the IMF.
 Close coordination was maintained with other donors, especially the European Union and the IMF,
 throughout the preparation o f PERC and for the finalization o f the PEMFARreport. InJuly 2004, the
 Government adopted an action plan for 2005 based on eight measures from the PEMFAR report (see
 the PEMFAR matrix inAnnex 6). Since the action planwill be implemented throughout 2005, only
 part o f the measures have been completed to this date. Implementation status i s as follows:

 1. Coherence between the budget and the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS): The coherence between
 the revised Budget Law for 2005 and the PRS has been reinforced thanks to higher allocations to the
 priority sectors (see Annex 3).

 2. Program-budgets for basic education and health: These program-budgets have been prepared by the
 respective Ministries. In 2006, the preparation o f program-budgets will be extended to the Ministries
 incharge ofrural development.

 3. Integration o f HIPC funds into the programs and budgets o f line Ministries: Following the
 recommendations o f the audit o f the Special Program o f the President o f the Republic to which a
 majority of HIPC funds are allocated, a commitment has been made by the Minister o f Economy and
 Finance for better integrating HIPC funds into the budget (see the annex to the Letter o f Development
 Policy provided inAnnex 12).

 4. Definition and urotection o f urioritv exuenditures: The budget regulation process has been
 implemented in 2004 on the basis o f the priorities o f the PRS, which has helped to protect priority
 expenditures.     However, the seasonality o f some types o f expenditures was not fully taken into
 account in the execution o f the cash management plan. In 2005, the authorities have amended the
 budget regulation in order to better associate line Ministries to the preparation o f the regulation, while
 at the same time requiring better reporting from line Ministries on the final use o f the resources
 allocated to them under the budget regulation process (conditionality for PERC).

 5. Integration into the operations o f the Treasury o f operations not handled by uublic accountants: this
 i s a difficult measure to implement by the government alone, since it involves detailed collaboration
 from donors, especially for externally financed investment expenditures. The Government will
 regularly provide progress reports to donors on progress achieved inthis area.

 6. Integration o f all external debt transactions into Government accounts: A new software has been
 installed for this purpose, as a first step towards this integration.

 7. Review o f the clearance process o f domestic arrears: This measure is included into the new PRGF
 program o f the IMF, so that the Government will prepare a review by June 2005 that will clarify the
 status o f arrears and adopt a timeframe for their clearance.

 8. Implementation o f annual uublic expenditure reviews: A budget o f FCFA 20 million has been
 allocated in the Budget Law for 2005 in order to prepare a review o f public expenditure in selected
 priority sectors. In addition, the Ministryo f Basic Education has prepared terms o f reference for such
 a review inthe area of basic education.

                                                    11


20.      Budget preparation and formulation have improved since 2000.                   Dual budgeting
practices have been reduced with the general and investment budgets presented in the same
document since 2001. A new budget nomenclature has been adopted in July 2002, allowing a
more homogenous and transparent recording o f all financial transactions o f the State, and
facilitates the analysis o f budgetary operations outcomes according to internationally recognized
standards. A new charter o f accounts i s contributing to improving the management, analysis and
transparency of government accounts. The consistency between the new budget classification
and the new charter o f accounts is facilitating the reconciliation o f cash and accrual data, as well
as the compilation o f fiscal summary statistics. Program-budgets have been developed by the
Education and the Health ministries and similar efforts are underway for the Ministries dealing
with Rural Development. Finally, to improve budget preparation, an Arrete' was issued by the
Prime Minister in September 2003, delineating the budget preparation process, establishing the
sequence and dates o f actions as well as the role and responsibilities o f all ministries, services and
other actors involved inthe budget preparation process. Still, budget preparation remains weak, in
part because medium-term expenditures framework and multi-year sectoral allocations have not
been hlly integrated into the process. As a result, there i s a risk o f a lack o f consistency in the
budget between recurrent and investment expenditures, and the correspondence between the
budget and the objective o fthe PRSP is not sufficiently established.

21.      At the Budget execution level, the introduction o f the Financial Management
Information System (FMIS) has led to a computerization o f budgetary processes, allowing
information to be available in real time from the Budget Directorates (responsible for approving
expenditure commitments and issuing payment orders) and the Treasury (responsible for actual
payment and public accounting). However, the scope o f the system has remained limited to the
commitment and payment order sub-phases. An interface with the treasury IT system was
introduced but not completed, and key actors have not yet been connected, including financial
controllers and credit managers in sectoral ministries. The budget execution process also remains
cumbersome and overly centralized in the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF). It takes on
average 33 days to complete the administrative phase, leading government officials and suppliers
to use exceptional procedures, mainly cash advances and direct payment without ordonnancement
(PSOPs). In 2003, close to half of domestically-financed expenditures were paid through cash
advances and PSOPs, which makes it difficult to monitor public finance performance and
evaluate the structure of public expenditure5. The use o f such exceptional procedures also limits
the effectiveness of ex-ante controls and obscures the transparency o f the budget process.



     The high levels o f use o f PSOPs in 2003 was due in part to exceptional circumstances. There was a
     dispute as to whether the 2003 Budget Law and the amendment by decree o f the Organic Law of end-
     2002 regulating public finances were in conformity with the Constitution. The amendment o f the
     Organic Law aimed at taking into account the new budget nomenclature and charter o f public
     accounts, while ratifying the merging of the capital budget with the recurrent budget. The fact that no
     budgetary appropriations could be released during the debate caused the government to resort to the
     special procedure o f payments without prior commitments (called PSOPs) to effect spending. This
     procedure made the government operate essentially on the basis o f cash transactions during the first
     quarter, thereby generating suspense accounts, that are temporary treasury accounts, which in turn
     required subsequentbudgetary regularization. The PSOPs were the only practical solution to keep the
     government running until a decision was handed down by the Constitutional Court. Following the
     Constitutional Court's decisions, the government had the National Assembly adopt the Organic Law
     on Public Finance on April 1,2003, before appropriations were made under the 2003 Budget Law. The
     Government also restored normal budget execution procedures and properly posted the PSOPs that
     were effected inearly-2003.

                                                   12


22.      At the Budget reporting level, budget review laws (lois de r2gZement) o f 1997, 1998,
1999, and 2000 have been adopted by the National Assembly in December 2002. Closure o f
budgetary accounts o f 2002 has been completed. The draft project o f the budget review law for
2003 has been transmitted for adoption to the Government, and the Supreme Court's Audit
Office, which was dormant until 2000, has produced its first report on budget execution.
However, controls remain weak, both internal and external. While internal and ex-ante controls
are in principle performed by financial controllers, two factors limit the effectiveness o f internal
controls. First, resources available to the Direction du ContrBle Financier (DCF) are insufficient,
with many financial controllers working only part-time. Second, PSOPs and other expenditures
handled through exceptional procedures are never reviewed by financial controllers. External
controls are exercised by the Chamber o f accounts o f the Supreme Court, and by the National
Assembly through its Finance Committee. Yet the Chambre des comptes i s a young institution,
which does not have the resources and capacity to perform in-depth evaluations o f government
accounts and institutional performance, and which lacks autonomy. It does not have an
independent budget nor adequate staff.

23.      An important achievement has been the introduction in2004 o f a Cash Allocation Plan
to protect priority allocations in favor o f the social sectors. That is, to cope with severe liquidity
problems, the government has put in place budget regulation (Zibdration des crddits) and cash
management systems (plans de trksorerie), which regulate the flows o f expenditures. The budget
regulation process i s completed at the beginning o f each quarter in order to provide broad
indicative allocations to Ministries for the quarter. The cash management process takes place
weekly to assess which expenditures can be paid, on the basis o f the most recent information on
the level o f the available resources for such payments. While the system is functioning, a number
o f improvements must be made at the line Ministry level for the use o f the funds, and at the
interface between line Ministriesand the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF). Also, public
accountants do not produce daily statements o f their accounts with the Treasury, with the lack o f
an automatic determination o f the cash position o f the government constituting an obstacle to
effective cash management. The cash position o f the government i s established manually on the
basis o f daily statements o f the Treasury account at the BCEAO, but the balances o f the treasury
accounts are only reconciledonce a month with the Treasury account.

24.      Progress has also been achieved in terms o f arrears management. In 1999, the
government created an institution responsible for managing domestic debt and launched a
program aimed at clearing internal arrears. Some FCFA 50 billions in debt were cleared over
2001-2002, which corresponds to 1.7 percent o f GDP on average over the period, as a result o f
the implementation o f the arrears clearance program. A further FCFA 12.2 billion o f domestic
arrears was cleared in 2003. However, two critical issues need to be addressed. First,the lack o f
accuracy o f data on the stock o f debt remains a major concern as different confusing figures are
provided. Second, the rules o f reimbursement o f government's debts owed to private businesses
are not transparent.

B. Increasingthe Impact on the Poor of PublicSpendingin PriorityAreas

25.      Key Achievements and Challenges in Education and Health. Niger's education
indicators have been steadily improving since the mid-1990s. Progress i s continuing as the
Ministryof Basic Education and Literacy is implementing its ten-year educationprogram (PDDE
2003-2013) in collaboration with donors within the framework o f the Fast Tract Initiative (FTI).
The objectives o f the Government include (a) increasing access to both formal and non-formal
basic education, in particular for children in rural areas, girls and the poor; (b) improving the
quality and relevance o f education; and (c) developing capacities for the strategic and operational

management o f the sector at both the central and regional levels, and increasing responsibilities
assumed at the community level. Recent achievements are as follows: (i)in terms o f access, the
primary gross enrollment rate has reached 50 percent in 2003-2004, in large part thanks to the
construction o f new schools and the recruitment o f contractual teachers, which have increase the
share   o f students ever going to school; (ii)in terms o f quality, completion rates in basic
education have also increased, to 32 percent in 2003-2004, and repetition rates have been
reduced; and (iii)in terms o f management, a first Medium-Term Expenditure Framework has
been prepared by the Ministry o f Basic Education and Literacy in 2004, in order to guide pluri-
annual decision making and budget allocations. Also efforts to empower communities in school
management have been pursued (at least 1000 COGES were functioning in 2004). On the other
hand, low level o f quality in education and a weak institutional capacity remain as key
challenges. A more detailed discussion o f recent achievements i s provided inAnnex 1.

26.     Broad Strategic Orientations for Health Sector Development have been defined in a
document covering the period 2001-2011 prepared on the basis o f the PRSP, and adopted by the
Government in 2002. Key objectives are to increase real access o f the population to quality care,
increase the performance o f priority health programs, and improve overall sector management
and financing. This broad policy document i s being translated into a five-year action plan which
will give priority to making functional existing health centers (i.e., providing the necessary
personnel and operating costs), expanding access through outreach strategies, ensuring
affordability for the poor through an exemption policy for the cost recovery policy, and puttingin
place institutional reforms to support the strategies set forth and implement core civil service
reforms. Annex 1 provides some details on recent achievements in the health sector; here, we
briefly highlight key successes in terms o f access, quality, and management. First, in terms o f
physical access, the share of the population within 5 kilometers from a health center increased to
47.6 percent, thanks to the construction and provision o f equipment o f integrated health centers
and health posts. Vaccination rates for children have also increased. However, lack o f drugs,
materials, and personnel imply that persistent difficulties remain for access to care. Second, in
terms o f quality, human and institutional capacity has been reinforced through training o f
community health agents running rural health posts, but issues remain in terms o f staffing.
Third, in terms of management, the Ministry o f Public Health also prepared in 2004 its first
MTEF,and a pilot project was launched towards performance-based contracts at the district level.

27.      While the Ministries o f basic education and public health have prepared for the first time
in2004 draft medium-term expenditure frameworks or budget-programs, the quality and level o f
detail o f these plans must be further improved, especially in the case o f health. In addition, as
discussed earlier, these plans have not been hlly taken into account inthe discussion o f the sector
allocations in the budget law for 2005. As a result, discrepancies exist between the budgets
requested by Ministries and the actual budgets to them. Key expenditures need to be covered
better, among others for contractual teachers, COGES, the CAPED, and food programs in
education, and for personnel, medicines and vaccines in health. Progress has been made in that
direction through the revision o f the 2005 Budget L a w (see Annex 3.) In education, another
important issue relates to progress towards the implementation o f the reforms related to the
education quality, in particular o f the Ecoles Nationales in charge of teacher training. Inhealth,
other core challenges include (a) insufficient financial resources for the sector and heavy reliance
on external aid, (b) human resource issues (training and redeployment o f personnel to rural
areas); (c) lack o f affordability for the poor o f services due to cost recovery mechanisms; (d) lack
o f implementation o f a sound reproductive health strategy; and (e) required institutional reforms
to improve performance. Given high levels o f recent investments made for health centers using
HIPC resources, it will be especially important to assess whether recurrent expenditures allow for
proper functioning o f health facilities. Additional efforts must also be made to ensure that the

                                                  14


purchase o f drugs (and, to a lesser extent vaccines) by the Ministryo f Health i s adequate. Indeed,
despite a protection o f such purchases in the National Budget and cash management plan (albeit
to a level insufficient to cover needs), the Ministry has not been able to carry the required
purchase, which impliesa higher burdenon the poor for the cost recovery mechanisms.

28.     Population Growth. High rates o f population growth make it extremely difficult for
Niger to achieve the rates o f GDP growth that would lead to a substantial reduction in poverty.
Population growth is also expected to lead to high levels o f demand for a wide range o f services
inthe areas o f education, health, and access to basic infrastructure, all ofwhich will putpressure
on a tight budget. Finally, the growth o f the population also has a number of direct negative
impacts on MDGs-related outcomes, including infant and child mortality. The adoption o f a
strong national population strategy, encompassing not only reproductive health issues but also
other issues affecting reproductive behavior (including vulnerability to shocks) needs to be
prepared and implemented. A recent World Bank report on population growth provides an
analysis o f key issues which could inform the adoption o f this nationalpopulation strategy.

29.     Rural Development. Agriculture including livestock employs 80 percent o f the active
population and generates 40 percent o f GDP. Apart from facing diminishingrainfall, increasing
temperatures, and higher variability in rainfall (droughts) over time, the rural population has
suffered from poor land quality, and low educational levels leading farmers to adhere to
traditional cultures and tools, with limited use o f animals for farm work and transport. This
together with a lack o f fertilizers and adequate pesticides and the presence o f natural predators,
have resulted in low yields. Farmers also have limited access to credit, with investments in land
improvement taking place slowly and being at risk o f conflicts between farmers and livestock
owners. The road network and means o f transportation are limited, as are opportunities for crop
stocking and conservation. Finally, the extension system i s centralized with few technical experts
working with farmers, and with rural organizations being weak in relation to private traders. Yet,
despite all these constraints, agricultural production grew on average at 11 percent per year in
nominal terms between 1994 and 2003, versus 7 percent for GDP.               This performance was
achieved inpart thanks to two exceptional years in 1998 and 2001. For future growth, cash crops
and livestock will be key, yet both require better water management to develop and stabilize
production (production could be increased substantially through irrigation and better access to,
and maintenance of, water holes). Water management i s a major axis in the government's rural
development policy, and water projects have accounted for 40 percent o f investments made using
HIPC funds. Therefore, PERC will ensure that budgetary allocations to these areas are adequate
and well managed.

30.     In November 2003, the Government approved a rural development strategy (RDS)
centered around three pillars: (i)improving the access o f rural populations to economic
opportunities; (ii)protecting rural populations against risks and improving food security (and
managing natural resources sustainability); and (iii)  enhancing the capacity o f public institutions
and rural organizations to improve the management o f the rural sector. The RDS describes 14
structural and sectoral programs dealing with a wide range o f issues, including water
management. In a related area, the Government has also prepared and recently adopted a well
formulated and documented National Road Sector Strategy, covering both road infrastructure and
road transport, accompanied by a specific Action Plan. The main objectives o f the Strategy and
action plan are to ensure the existence and the maintenance o f the national road network,
connecting areas o f agricultural production with markets in the urban areas, and generally, to
reduce rural isolation. While the strategy should make it easier to provide adequate funding to the
sector, including the CAFER, it will also be important to implement an institutional and
management reform o f the CAFER to ensure the establishment o f a true second generation road

                                                  15


maintenance fund. This may require the introduction o f a financing mechanism aimed at
ensuring the continued and actual availability o f funds for road maintenance.

3 1,     Unfortunately, the RDS does not rely on an economic analysis o f potential investments,
nor does it provide a cost-benefit analysis o f the proposals put forward. The analysis o f impacts,
viability, sources o f finance, budget, and economic returns o f the types o f programs suggested in
the RDS was relegated to the preparation o f action plans and programs invarious areas. The RDS
also does not elaborate on the human resources and incentives required to implement the strategy.
These weaknesses are due in part to the fact that the preparation o f Medium-TermExpenditure
Frameworks in the four Ministries at the core o f the R D S is only at the preliminary stage, and
also to limited budgetary allocations to these Ministries. In order to implement the RDS, apart
from providing support to the Ministries involved for both their planning and programs, an
improved integration between Ministry programs and the projects implemented under the Special
Program o f the President will also be required, as suggested in the audit o f this program (see
below).

32.      Use of HIPC Resources. From an initial allocation o f FCFA 8.7 billion in 2001, the
HIPC resources have grown to FCFA 28.9 billion in 2004, accounting for more than 7 percent o f
the total budget. With the topping-up granted to Niger, resources from debt relief will further
increase as o f 2005 to FCFA 40.9 billion per year (9 percent o f the budget), and much o f this will
continue to be allocated to the Special Program, at least initially. It i s worth noting that allocating
the full FCFA 40.9 billion o f HIPC relief to priority sectors was not easy for the Government
because part o f the funds were not initially actually paid on an annual basis by Niger to its
creditors. That is, these FCFA 40.9 billion in debt relief did not actually represent net additional
resources which could simply be shifted from debt-related payments to other uses. In order to
allocate all HIPC funds to priority sectors, authorities had (among others) to make adjustments in
other categories o f the budget, which was done in the revised Budget Law for 2005 (see
Annex3.) Ensuring an optimal use o f these funds is paramount for poverty reduction and
progress towards the MDGs. As mentioned earlier, a recent and independent audit o f the program
requested by the Government has demonstrated important achievements o f the Program in terms
o f investments in education, health, and rural development projects. At the same time, a number
o f technical, socio-economic, and financial management issues have been identified inthe audit:


     0   Technical issues: Defaults in terms o f conception or quality and delays have been
         observed in the implementation o f the program. These come from a variety o f sources,
         including the absence o f preliminary studies for dams and buildings, strict prices imposed
         in contracts that are often below market prices (especially in remote areas), delays in
         payments to contractors, and insufficient supervision from contractors.


     0   Socio-economic issues: Beneficiaries o f projects do not always take good care o f the
         infrastructure constructed due to a top-down approach used in implementing the projects.
         The process for selecting the projects does not ensure that investments focus on the most
         urgent needs o f the populations, as local communities are not always informed and
         consulted enough. Projects also suffer from a lack o f financing for complementary
         investments needed for achieving impacts (e.g., irrigation). Environmental concerns are
         also somewhat ignored inthe design, implementation and utilization o f the investments.


     0   Financial management issues: Budget monitoring for the Special Program does not
         include an information-based accounting system, which would facilitate disaggregating
         expenses by ministries, region, or other categories. On the positive side, payments on the
         books do reflect budget items with adequate documentary evidence.

                                                  16




    0    Integration o f activities with line Ministries: Some o f the issues identified in the audit
         report are due to the fact that projects implemented by the Special Program were not
         sufficiently  integrated into the strategies and activities/programs o f line Ministries.
         Therefore, an improved integration o f HIPC resources (including those allocated to the
         Special Program) into the sectoral strategies for the reduction o f poverty has been called
         for. By improved integration, it is meant that line Ministries benefiting from the Program
         should gain more responsibility for the investment decisions (e.g., construction o f social
         and productive infrastructures) made under the program, with the HIPC allocation
         integrated into their budget-programs. The line Ministries should also be more involved
         in the decisions to commit expenditures related to the Program.            A coordination,
         supervision, and advisory role should be kept at the level o f the unit in charge o f the
         Special Program.

C. Improving Niger's Monitoring and Evaluation System

33.      Reform of Niger's statistical system. The implementation, evaluation, and revision o f
the PRSP require a good information base and the existence o f a strong monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system. Progress has been achieved with a new law o f April 18,2004, creating
a National Statistical Office (NSO), which replaces the Direction o f Statistics and National
Accounts o f the Ministry o f Finance. This offers greater autonomy to the NSO in budget,
personnel, and strategic matters. The NSO will include a Poverty Observatory which, among
other tasks, will define data needs and analyses to carry out. There i s also interest for developing
within the Poverty Observatory an integrated Geographic Information System that would permit
the identification o f needs and the design o f projects at the local level. The key priority i s now
for the NSO to complete key household surveys, and for the General Director o f the NSO to be
appointed, so that a medium-term plan can be adopted in terms o f data collection and analysis. In
addition, the National Statistical Council, also created by the April 2004 Law, must become
operational.

34.      Household surveys. PRSP progress reports have repeatedly stressed weaknesses in the
area o f household surveys, but progress has been achieved recently. A survey on employment and
living conditions was completed in Niamey in 2004, and used (together with the latest national,
dating back to 1994-95). A new national survey i s under implementation since January 2005,
with modules on employment, education, health, income sources, household consumption,
agriculture, micro-credit, perceptions and priorities o f the poor, and evaluation o f projects and
investments carried in communities. The Government has budgeted funds for a follow-up budget
and consumption surveys, which will be useful to revise the national account and measure
inflation, among others. Finally, UNDP i s fundingwork to assess basic needs requirements inthe
country.

35.      Analytical work for revision of the PRSP. Progress has also been achieved in terms o f
the information base for the implementation o f the PRSP and its revision. A draft Bank report
providing a diagnostic as to where Niger stands towards the MDGs, as well as simulation tools
for analyzing the MDGs has been completed. In addition, a study on sources o f growth has been
prepared by local researchers with assistance from the World Bank, and additional work will be
carried by the World Bank as part o f a Country Economic Memorandum. Recent World Bank
Country Status Reports on education and health are also available. The authorities have funded an
independent technical and financial audit o f the special program o f the President o f the Republic.
This audit will be complemented by a qualitative analysis o f the factors that enable households to
emerge from poverty to be launched with Bank-support by the PRSP secretariat. Inaddition, the

                                                  17


coordination unit for the Rural Development Strategy has requested a separate study on ways to
maximize the impact o f the rural investments funded by the President's program. Together, these
initiatives should provide a stronger information base for revising the PRSP early in 2006, but
close follow up will be needed to avoid delays, and ensure that all these initiatives are part o f a
coherent strategy towards better monitoring and evaluation.

D. ImplementingStructuralReforms

36.      Privatizations.Privatization operations were completed in 1997-98 for dairy, cement,
and textile companies.      Since 2001, the focus has been on telecoms, water, electricity, and
petroleum. The sale o f 51 percent o f SONITEL and its mobile affiliate SAHEL COM took place
in 2001, In 2000, Niger also awarded two GSM licenses to TELECEL and CELTEL Niger.
Today, CELTEL Niger has 80,000 subscribers, TELECEL 8,000, and SAHEL C O M 35,000. The
number o f telephone subscribers has grown six-fold, and interconnection o f the functional
cellular telephone networks was achieved in 2004. In water, a ten-year leasing contract was
granted to SEEN (Socie'ti d'Exploitation des Eaux du Niger) in 2001 for production, transport
and distribution o f safe water in 51 centers previously managed by the Socie'te' Nationale des
Eaux (SNE).      Privatization o f the public works equipment service Socie'te' de Location du
Matiriel des Travaux Publics (SLMTP) was completed in 2002. In electricity, the government
has been exploring privatization options and has held discussions with two potential private
sector operators, but these discussions are stalled over issues such as the scope o f the private
sector operator's commitment.      In petroleum, o f 51 percent o f shares o f the local petroleum
distribution company (SONIDEP) offered to professional investors, only 6.88 percent were
subscribed (by GNDPP, an association o f local professionals in the sector), but payment has not
yet been made to the authorities. Among international operators gathered in the GPP (Grouping
of Petroleum Professionals: TAMOIL, TOTAL, MOBIL), only TOTAL was interested in the
operation but i s pending submitting a formal offer until issues related to profit margins and
management control are resolved. Following slow progress in privatizing NIGELEC and
SONIDEP (reflecting, in part, ambivalence on the part o f the government and a limited appetite
from the private sector), the authorities are revisiting the approach to be used for private sector
participation in these sectors on the basis o f lessons learned. Separately, new petroleum pricing
mechanisms since 2001 have led to better functioning markets without subsidies and an increase
inrevenue collection for authorities without highertransport costs.

37.      Regulatoryreform.The Multisectoral Regulation Authority incharge o f overseeing the
water, electricity, transport, and telecom sectors has been fully staffed and has been conducting
work on tariff issues in the liberalized sectors, as well as the modalities o f collection o f royalties,
the respect o f specifications by strategic partners (SEEN, SONITEL, G S M providers) and the
assessment of training needs of the National Council o f Regulation (CNR). Compensation issue
for ARM staff are still pending a government decision. N o w that the ARM i s operational, it
needs to conduct in-depthanalytical and regulatory work among others on the poverty impact o f
alternative tariff structures and in general the impact o f privatizations and network extension, so
that the contribution of the privatization process to the objectives o f the PRSP can be assessed,
and corrective or complementary measures can be taken where necessary to increase impact.

38.      Financial sector reforms. Audits o f major micro-finance institutions have been
completed.    The restructuring o f commercial Banks has been successfully conducted: the
International Bank o f Africa (Banque internationale pour 1'Afrique, BIA), which had been under
strict oversight, i s once again on a sound financial footing. The Commercial Bank o f Niger
(Banque commerciale du Niger, BCN), which was under provisional administration for over a
year, was recapitalized in 2002, with the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank agreeing to carry the

                                                 18


Government's share for a period o f two years, duringwhich time private Nigerien partners will be
sought. An agreement was reached in 2003 with the former stockholders o f the Niger Islamic
Trade and Investment Bank (Banque islamique du Niger pour le commerce et 1'investissement,
BINCI) to absorb past losses and boost its capitalization to the prudential level. The post office i s
also being restructured with the creation o f a new independent postal financial institution. This
should help to bring financial services (deposit mobilization and transfer o f payments) to remote
areas. Staff reduction has also started. Nevertheless, much remains to be done to accelerate the
implementation     o f   the   comprehensive      financial   reform   program,     including    the
privatizatiodliquidation o f the Housing Bank (CDN), the restructuring o f the Community
Lending Bank (CPCT), micro-finance institutions, as well as the social security institution,
CNSS.

39.      Reform of the civil service. Past measures have improved the information base and
enabled the retirement o f a number o f civil servants. Additional measures should include: (a) the
connection o f the Ministry o f Public Administration and Labor (Ministhe de la Fonction
Publique et du Travail, MFPIT) to the integrated file network o f the Ministry o f Finance and
Economy (MF/E) and the implementation of specifications pertaining to the MFP/T's connection
to the network and acquisition o f computer equipment; (b) the preparation o f a general headcount
o f government employees; and (c) the production o f a compensation manual and the creation o f a
mechanism for the automatic monitoring o f compensation. Concerning the modernization o f the
administration, measures under consideration include: (i) elaboration o f a system for assessing
                                                           the
the productivity of government employees; (ii)the approval o f General Articles and their
enabling legislation; (iii)the use o f consultant services for the enhancement o f the Integrated
Program o f Modernization o f Public Administration in Niger (Programme Intigri de
Modernisation de 1`AdministrationPublique du Niger, PIMAN) and the development o f an action
plan for its implementation; (iv) the execution o f the position description study for purposes of
anticipatory management and the establishment o f the ministries' job hierarchies; (v) the launch
o f a study for the formulation o f a National Employment Policy; (vi) the implementation o f a
training program on human resource capacity-building; (vii) the implementation o f conclusions
and recommendations from the analysis o f the conversion o f the National Retirement Pension
Fund (Fonds National de Retraite, FNR) into an Autonomous Retirement Fund for Public
Employees (Caisse Autonome de Retraite des Fonctionnaires, CAFWO); (viii) the execution o f a
study concerning the reform o f budget line items in order to take into account the option o f
Government decentralization; and (ix) the completion o f the computerization o f the managerial
departments o f the MFP/T and of the Administrative and Financial Affairs Divisions (Directions
des affaires administratives etjnancih-es, DAAF) o f the line ministries.

40.      Indirect taxation reforms. Given that Niger has the lowest revenue base among all
WAEMU countries, it is important to find ways to increase domestic taxation in order to fund
programs aimed at promoting growth and reducing poverty. Following recommendations made
by the IMF, the Government adopted a series o f measures in the revised Budget Law for 2005
aimed at reducing the number o f goods for which exemptions to the imposition o f the VAT are
granted. These measures, and more generally an increase in the price o f a range of goods
(probably in part due to poor harvests), resulted in demonstrations in the streets in March 2005.
An agreement was however reached inApril 2005 between demonstrators and the Government to
adapt some o f the measures previously taken in the revised Budget Law for 2005, and adopt
complementary measures so that the Government would not suffer from any financing gap.

IV. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

A. Backgroundand Rationalefor the Credit

4 1.     Ina country with low capacity such as Niger, sustainedpolicy reforms over a longperiod
of time are neededto help reduce poverty. Even if substantial gains can be achieved in some areas
relatively quickly, the overall outcome o f the reform program should be evaluated in the medium
to long run. The measures proposed in PERC should be viewed in this context. For example, in
the case o f Public Expenditure Management, the PEMFAR matrix (Annex 6) proposes a wide
range o f measures to be implementedover the next 5 years. Only some o f these measures can be
integrated right away in the PERC. Building on successes achieved since 2000, PERC will
support such reforms and the implementatiodrevision o f the PRSP. Specifically, the credit will
focus on the areas highlighted in Section I11notably improving public expenditure management,
increasing the impact on the poor o f public spending inpriority areas, and improving monitoring
and evaluation. Overall, the challenge i s to help Niger maximize the effective use o f its scarce
resources. Due to the status o f knowledge on other structural reforms areas, this credit will not
include measures devoted to other structural reforms mentioned in Section D of Part I11above.
New analytical work i s currently planned and will feed into the next development policy lending
operation. This new analytical work includes a Country Economic Memorandum on the sources
o f Growth and an Investment Climate Study. As for the road map for improving budget
preparation, execution and controls proposed in the PEMFAR report, it i s linked with sectoral
policies through the Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks prepared by key Ministries. The
issues of the impact of public spending in priority sectors, and o f the monitoring and evaluation
system, are also closely related to each other, as well as to public expenditure management since
the budget is the main instrument for the government to improve the living conditions o f the
population. Finally, assessing (where feasible) the likely impact on poverty o f structural reforms
i s required to implement the PRSP.

42.      Macroeconomic projections demonstrate that achieving a growth rate sufficient to raise
per capita income will require substantial external assistance. This assistance needs to be
provided on a sustained, predictable and timely basis and sequenced with Niger's budget cycle in
order to maintain the momentum o f reform. In the past, lower than forecast revenues and delays
in external assistance have led the Government to tighten the execution o f expenditures with
adverse effects on priority social sectors. The proposed Public Expenditure Reform Credit o f an
amount equivalent to US$40 million will provide a substantial part o f the financing necessary to
support and facilitate the continuation o f the reform process. The operation will be implemented
inclose collaborationwith other donors, and especially the EuropeanUnion.

B. LessonsLearnedfrom PreviousAdjustmentCredits

43.      The design o f PERC has been informed by lessons learned from previous adjustment
operations, both in its conceptual framework and its operational modalities. The first lesson i s the
importance o f Government ownership and commitment to the reform program. The main
components o f PERC are derived from the Government's own reform program and are in line
with the PRSP's objectives. Second, reform o fpublic expenditure management is a medium-term
process that requires sustained effort and strengthened institutional capacity. While building
capacity, public expenditure reforms must be tailored to existing capacity in Niger. The reform
program supported by PERC i s grounded in the PEMFAR which was prepared jointly with the
Government and development partners. The program focuses on priority policy measures that are

                                                    20


challenging, but can be implemented in 2005-2006, taking into account capacity constraints
within Ministries and other governmental institutions. Third, adjustment operations require a
sound system o f monitoring and evaluation. While weaknesses have been identified in the
monitoring and evaluation system o f Niger's PRSP, there has been progress recently, and PERC
will support additional measures to strengthen monitoring and evaluation as well as the revision
o f the PRSP.

44.      To be sustainable, expenditure reform must be accompanied by measures to increase
domestic resource mobilization. The low level o f domestic revenues, currently at about 10
percent o f GDP, has been partially compensated by external aid, but even if high levels of aid
could be sustained for some time, higher domestic resources will be required in order to make
faster progress towards the MDGs. While PERC does not include revenue enhancing measures,
this issue is beingaddressed inIMFprograms.

C. ProposedReformProgram

C.l. Deepeningthe Reformsin Public Finance Management

45.      Link between PERC and the PEMFAR. The government adopted a series o f laws and
decrees to reformpublic finance management procedures, including a new budget classification, a
new charter o f accounts and an organic law on the presentation o f Budget Laws. Additional
reforms based on PEMFAR recommendations have also been initiated, including: (a) a decree
restructuring the budget preparation process, strengthening the role o f the Budget Directorate
(DGB), giving more time to sectoral ministries to prepare budget proposals, and introducing the
concept of medium-term expenditures framework (MTEF); (b) the introduction o f a new cash
management system identifying priority expenditures that need protection during budget
execution; (c) the revision o f the Constitution to establish an autonomous Court o f Accounts; (d)
the creation o f a Committee to handle the longstanding issue o f Treasury balances; and (e) the
issuance by the MEF o f a directive aimed at accelerating the settlement o f crddits ddldguds
(budget lines managed by regional or local authorities). The government adopted an action plan
in July 2004 (based on the PEMFAR matrix) with eight measures (see Box 2 in Section 1II.A
above), Implementation of these measures and other PEMFAR recommendations will be at the
core of PERC. The measures focus among others on:

     0   Greater participation o f line ministries in the budget preparation and execution process to
         strengthen strategic budget choices and better target poverty reduction expenditures.
     0   Accelerating the computerization process to promote a more integrated management o f
         public expenditures and appropriate interface between departments.
     0   Improving the reliability and timeliness o f government accounts.
     0   Better monitoring o fpublic debt (internal and external).
     0   Strengthening internal and external controls.

46.      Budget preparation. Preparation o f the 2005 budget law followed the 2003 decree,
which called for a total restructuring o f the budget planning process. In 2004, the circulaire
budgdtaire6 was issued in April, two months earlier than in previous years. A lettre-plafond then
established a ceiling for budget allocations to individual ministries. Finalization o f the draft
budget law was done by the Budget Directorate (DGB), instead o f being divided between the
DGB and the DGF (responsible for investmentplanning and monitoring), which had ledto some

     The circulaire budgktaire provides the context and defines the policies that will influence the size and
     the structure o f future budget proposals.

                                                  21


inefficiencies. Most HIPC-financed expenditures were identified through a special code and
allocated via the special Program o f the President. The issuance o f the circulaire budgdtaire and
lettre-plafond were steps in the right direction, but the circulaire did not provide enough details
on projected revenue and expenditures, and thus does not help sectoral ministriesunderstand the
specific constraints that will influence the size and structure o f the future budget. The lettre-
plafond was issued before any discussion with sectoral ministries, thus depriving ministries from
an opportunity to present their views on budget priorities at an early stage in the budget
preparation process. Most o f the decisions.about the budget law were still made by the MEFwith
limited inputs from sectoral ministries. The Ministries of Health and Basic Education prepared
program-budgets, but the strategic thinking that accompanied this exercise had little influence on
the budget proposals made by the Ministries and their final allocations. The rationale for the
budget law had also been insufficiently developed in terms o f the implicit trade-offs and how
these trade-offs related to the objectives o f the PRSP. Through PERC, the following
improvements inthe budget planning process will be sought:

     0   The circulaire budgktaire i s based on a lettre de cadrage which should include a more
         detailed analysis o f the economic and financial situation o f the country in order to enable
         line ministries to prepare spending projections based on three different scenarios. The
         lettre de cadrage should itself be progressively based on preliminary discussions with
         line Ministries. In 2006, these discussions should take place on a pilot basis with the
         Ministries o f Basic Education and Public Health.
     0   The MEF should organize inter-ministerial discussions before preparing the lettre-
         plafond in order to give sectoral ministries an opportunity to better assess their priorities
         and influence the structure o f the future budget.
     0   The government should conduct an analysis as to the potential benefits and/or costs o f
         merging DAAFs (Direction des Affaires Administratives et Financidres) - responsible
         within line ministries for planning and monitoring recurrent expenditures - and DEPs
         (Directions des Etudes et de la Programmation) - responsible for investment planning
         and monitoring.
     0   The government should organize training programs to help sectoral ministries prepare
         MTEFs and programbudgets inline with the country's poverty reductionstrategy.

47.      Budget execution. To prevent accumulation o f arrears and protect critical expenditures,
the government has introduced: (a) a budget regulation mechanism that limits quarterly spending
authorizations based on projections o f domestic and external resources, and (b) cash management
plans (plans de trdsorerie) which regulate actual payments on a quarterly and weekly basis.
Although the two mechanisms did not always prevent the creation o f new arrears, they have
helped in improving the overall fiscal performance o f the government over the past few years.
However, three main deficiencies limit the efficiency o f these two systems. First, the budget
regulation mechanism and cash management system are controlled by the MEF, while sectoral
ministries are often better placed to identify priority expenditures and understand the seasonality
of specific activities (which may justify quarterly allocations above 25 percent for a given
quarter). This means that line Ministries should be more actively involved in the budget
regulation process. Second, together the two mechanisms helped protect a number o f high-
priority expenditures, but this was at the expense o f some other critical expenditures. Third, the
use o f exceptional procedures - mainly PSOPs7- i s declining but continues to be significant. This

     PSOPs or Paiements sans ordonnancement prdalable are payments ordered by spending ministries
     outsidethe regular commitment cycle, thus without verification by financial controllers. PSOPs are not
     subject to the same limitations as other expenditures under budget regulation and cash management
     mechanisms.In2003, about FCFA 45 billions were processed through PSOPs. In 2004, the volume of

                                                   22


affects the quality o f ex-ante controls and defeats the purpose o f budget regulation and cash
management since PSOPs are not included in quarterly spending authorizations by the MEF.

48.      Two sets o f measures should be envisaged to address these three budget execution issues.
First, the government should clarify criteria for using PSOPs and other exceptional procedures.
Instructions shouldbe prepared that would ban the use o f exceptional procedures - mainly PSOPs
-for expendituresthatdonotmeettheagreedcriteria.Byitself,thismeasureshouldsignificantly
reduce the volume o f PSOPs. Second, the government should improve the budget regulation and
cash management systems with a view to: (a) enabling sectoral ministries to participate
effectively in the design and implementation o f the two systems, (b) better protecting high-
priority expenditures, and (c) making implementationmore transparent. To this end:


    0    Sectoral Ministries managing priority expenditures should participate in quarterly
         meetings for budget regulation. Therefore, they should prepare at the beginning o f each
         quarter a list o f expenditures that they would like to have protected, and indicate an order
         of priority inthese expenditures so that trade-offs can be made in case available resources
         are lower than expected. This would enable Ministries to be closely consulted before
         submission o f quarterly budget regulationplans to the Council o f Ministers.
         Quarterly spending authorizations and weekly plans de trdsorerie should be consistent
         and based on the same set o f priorities, with implementation inline with agreed priorities.
    0    Cash management plans should be computerized integrating data collected on tax receipts
         and other resources and budget execution data (ordonnancements). Reports on
         implementation o f plans de trdsorerie should be prepared and circulated to sectoral
         ministries on a monthly basis, and shouldbe made available publicly on a regular basis.

49.      Computerization.The government has introduceda computerized financial management
system that needs to be improved and expanded. Four main deficiencies limit the effectiveness o f
the present system: (a) while commitments are fully computerized, the liquidation phase is not
included; (b) the interface between DGB-produced budget execution data and treasury accounts i s
incomplete (payment orders being automatically transferred to the Treasury but the system does
not provide the DGB with data on actual payments); (c) line ministries and regional/local
authorities are not yet included in the system; and (d) several MEF departments (Debt, DGF, Tax
and Customs administration) are also not included. Full computerization o f the chain o f
expenditures would go a long way towards simplifying and accelerating the budget execution
process, as well as improving the monitoring of public expenditures. The most urgent reforms are
to complete the interface between the Budget Directorate and the Treasury, and to gradually
extend the system to line ministries and regional and local services. More specifically:


    0    Priority should be given to completing the interface between the Budget Directorate and
         the Treasury to enable the DGB to monitor actual payments by the Treasury o f payment
         orders issued by the DGB. This would help the DGB monitor the creation o f arrears.
    0    Extending the computerized information system to line ministries will enhance the
         spending authority o f credit managers in these ministries, help promote deconcentration
         and improve the efficiency o f ex ante controls by financial controllers. The first phase
         should be the creation o f a central computer center (salle informatique) within the MEF
         that will be accessible to credit managers and financial controllers in line ministries. This
         salle informatique should be fully operational before the end o f the second quarter o f


    PSOPs declined to FCFA 24 billions for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, which still represents 20
    percent o f domestically financed expenditures.

                                                  23


          2005. A manual o f procedures should be prepared and a training program developed to
          help credit managers and financial controllers use effectively the new facility.
     0    The computerization o f regional payment offices (paieries) should also be completed,
          and the government should initiate the computerization o f recently created regional
          payment order sub-centers (Centres de Sous-Ordonnancement). This would simplify and
          accelerate the processing and settlement o f crddits dddguds, an important reform in the
          context of the deconcentration and decentralization policies initiated by the government.

50.       Accounting systems. The adoption o f a new chart o f accounts has not been accompanied
by significant improvements in Niger's accounting practices. The closing balances for the
previous fiscal year are not carried forward into opening balances for the following fiscal year.
Suspense accounts record a large number of budget transactions that have not been regularized
(FCFA 32 billion as o f September 30, 2004). Government accounts do not integrate externally
financed expenditures and physical assets, and despite recent improvements debt monitoring i s
deficient. The government initiated a number o f reforms, but additional efforts are required. For
example, the government has created a Committee to review the issue o f closing and opening
balances, but the committee gives priority to settling accounts until 1996, as a prerequisite to
reviewingcash positions in the more recent years      - an important first step should be to assess and
integrate closing balances since 1997. Also, projections o f externally-financed public
expenditures are included in the budget law, but actual public expenditures are not processed by
public accountants. While the DGF i s making significant efforts to improve its monitoring o f
externally financed expenditures, its reZevds de ddpenses provide data that can not be integrated
into DGB accounts. The following measures are recommended inthese areas:

     0    A solution must be found to the long standing problem o f closing and opening balances,
          by integrating the closing balances for all the previous fiscal years since 1997 into the
          cash management accounts for 2002 and the following years.
     0    Integrating externally-financed expenditures into government accounts will require the
          combined efforts o f several MEF departments and the donor community. With the help o f
          major donors, the government should set up a task force to review this issue and propose
          ways and means o f integratingthese expenditures into government accounts, startingwith
           expenditures managed by government officials and eventually projects directly managed
          by donors. Additional resources, staff training and computerizationo f Information system
           are necessary to keep records, manage and account for physical assets.

51.       Debt management. A major effort has been made to settle internal arrears and the stock
o f internal debt has been reduced from FCFA 296 billion in 1999 to 206 billion in 2004.'
However, conditions applied to creditors are not uniform. A more transparent debt settlement
system should be put in place. Also, while the HIPC Initiative has substantially reduced the stock
o f external debt, sound management o f the country's remaining external debt remains critical. A
new software for monitoring external debt has been installed by the Debt Directorate (DDP) and
will be extended to the DGB and the Treasury. However, DDP relies on DGF (which negotiates
loan agreements and controls withdrawal applications) to provide information on loan
disbursements. Despite recent improvements, the lack o f appropriate exchange o f data on a timely
basis between DGF and DDP affects the reliability o f debt data produced by DDP. Two sets of
measures should be taken to improve the management of the country's internal and external debt.



*            ~~




     I t seems that in 2004 the government was able to settle about FCFA 6 billion in old arrears, but, as
     mentioned earlier, new arrears totaling FCFA4 billion had been created as o f September 30.

                                                  24



    0   The government should undertake a new inventory o f its internal debt, which would
        include criteria for validating or rejecting claims. Based on this inventory, the
        government should define a medium-term settlement plan for outstanding internal debt.
    0   To improve data exchange between the DGF and DDP, a formal agreement between the
        two departments should provide for immediate communication to DDP o f withdrawal
        applications and actual loan disbursements. The new software on external debt
        management should be extended to DGB and the Treasury and training programs should
        be organized. The cycle will be completed when software i s extended to DGF and the
        interface between all departments concerned i s organized.

52.     Internal and external controls. With the help o f the European Union, the government
has carried out an audit o f its internal and external control agencies, which describes the lack o f
resources and autonomy o f most o f these agencies. A workshop in October 2003 endorsed the
conclusions o f the audit, which the PEMFAR report fully supports. Since then, very little has
been done to strengthen existing controls. For instance, the government has not created the
Committee which i s expected to design, implement and monitor a reform program. The most
important measure has been the revision o f the Constitution which transformed the Chamber o f
Accounts into a more autonomous Court o f Accounts. A major effort i s needed at this time as the
government i s taking steps to increase the spending authority o f line ministries and give more
powers to regional and local authorities, in the context o f its deconcentration and decentralization
policy. Virtually all control agencies need more resources and improved capacity. However, the
most urgent measures are to: (a) strengthen the capacity o f the financial controllers, who will play
a major role in the operation o f the salle informatique and the gradual delegation o f the spending
authority to line ministries, and (b) build on the recent reform o f the Chamber o f Accounts to
create a stronger, more capable and more independent Court o f Accounts. To this end:


    0   The government should appoint the members o f the reform committee formally created
        by a decision o fthe Prime Minister inDecember 2003.
    0   Resources available to the Directorate o f Financial Control (Direction du Contrde
        Financier or DCF) should be increased. The DCF should organize extensive training
        programs for its controllers and prepare a detailed manual o f procedures - defining
        clearly the types o f controls to be carried out by financial controllers - in order to reduce
        the risk o frejection o f spendingproposals at the payment order stage (by the Direction de
        1'Ordonnuneemeno or at the payment stage (by the Treasury).
    0   The creationo f a Court o fAccounts has not been accompanied by the definition o f a new
        status that would firmly establish its independence, nor by appropriate efforts to increase
        its budget and human resources (it has only four judges). The government should submit
        to the National Assembly the draft Organic L a w definingthe new status o f the institution.
        The number o f judges should be increased and a plan should be prepared to strengthen
        the capacity o f the Court's judges and auditors.

53.     With respect to other control institutions, the following measures should also be
envisaged:


    0   The Inspection o f Finances lacks independence (it reports to the Secretary General o f the
        Ministry o f Finance) and resources. The number o f inspectors has declined, the
        maintenance o f its equipment i s not assured and the status creating the Corps
        d 'Inspecteurs des Finances has not been approved. The government should approve the
        new status, review the location o f the institution (inthe context o f a broader review o fthe
        structure o f the Ministry o f Finance) and prepare a capacity buildingprogram for staff.

                                                  25




     0   The National Assembly and its Finance Commission lack the capacity to analyze public
         finance policy and management issues. A training program for members o f the
         Commission should be envisaged. The government should systematically prepare a
         document highlightingthe coherence between budget proposals and the poverty reduction
         objectives o f the PRS. This document should be disseminated through the local media.

C.2. Increasingthe Impacton the Poor of PublicSpendingin Priority Areas

54.      Funding for priority sectors. In the original Loi de Finances for 2005 approved in
October 2005, HIPC resources had been underestimated (at FCFA 24.4 billion, instead o f FCFA
40.9 billion, due in large part to an error in accounting for the topping up received in 2004).
Some other support from donors also had not been fully taken into account (e.g., funding from the
Fast Track Initiative for primary education).      This resulted in a relative lack of funding for
priority sectors, with associated risks in terms of public service delivery in education and health,
as well as in rural development. The government revised the Loi de Finances for 2005. The
revised law was approved in January 2005 by the National Assembly, and it provides additional
funding for the priority sectors. An analysis o fthe main changes made by the Government versus
the previous Budget Law i s given in Annex 3. Some 75 percent o f the additional resources have
been allocated to the priority sectors, with an additional FCFA 9.7 billion for the Ministry o f
Basic Education and Literacy (using both HIPC and Fast track Initiative resources); FCFA 5.0
billion for the Ministry of Equipment (mostly for road maintenance and construction); FCFA 4.0
billion for the Ministry of Agriculture, and FCFA 2.1 billion for the Ministryo f Public Health.

55.       Education. An expansion in access and higher enrollment rates has been achieved in
recent years. Yet beyond access, measures must be taken for improving quality and an assessment
should be made (as part of the Ministry's Medium-Term ExpenditureFramework) on whether the
balance between investment and recurrent spending in basic education i s appropriate, and on the
level o f funding that will be required infuture years. Priorities for the sector include:

     0    Continuing to rely on contractual teachers who represented 52 percent o f basic education
         teachers in 2004, but cost less than half the cost o f statutory teachers. This will enable
         Niger to keep costs under control in the face o f mounting pressures in coming years from
         higher enrollment rates, while not lowering quality according to a recent study suggesting
         no large differences inperformance betweencontractual and statutory teachers.


     0    Ensuring that at least 50 percent o f education spending remains allocated to primary
         education despite pressures from higher levels as children graduate from primary.


     0   Progressively conducting an assessment o f education outcomes and, as importantly, o f
         the benefits o f a better education for the population in both urban and rural areas (in
         terms o f wages, agricultural productivity, health outcomes, etc.), among others using the
         new 2005 national household survey under implementation, the first survey o f this type in
         more than 10years.


     0   Within the context of the reform o f the Ecoles Nationales in charge o f teacher training,
         producing an implementation report on the achievements to date o f the reforms and the
         progress made toward achieving autonomy for these institutions.

                                                    26



    0   Ensuringover the next few years a more pro-poor geographic allocation o f resources in
        education using the recently completed carte scolaire and the poverty map under
        preparation using the 2001 census, and ensuring through a proper Geographic
        Information System framework that solutions for improvements in various areas are
        adapted to the needs o f these various areas.

        Improving and expending the scope of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
        prepared by the Ministryand ensuringthat it better informs budget allocations for 2006.

56.     Health and Population. Outcomes are not improving rapidly, and health spending
remains concentrated in urban areas and controlled by central agencies. While most pressing
needs are in rural areas, staffing rules (ability for centrally recruited staff to quickly return to the
capital) make it difficult to maintain qualified personnel there. Also, while investments have
expanded physical access, actual coverage in rural areas and recurrent spending remain low,
thereby requiring higher cost recovery. From 1996 to 2003, utilization rates o f health facilities
have declined, with 50 percent o f the persons interviewed in a recent beneficiary assessment
stating poor quality as a major issue and 43 percent pointing to consultation fees as a major
barriers to health care, particularly at the hospital level. Priorities for the health sector include:


     0  Adopting a strong population and reproductive health strategy. While the issue of
         population growth must be tackled within a multi-sectoral approach, the health sector can
        be a key contributor, among other through a strong reproductivehealth strategy.

     0   Ensuring that new health posts created (mostly through contractuals) are effectively
         assigned to (rural) areas which need this staff by adopting the appropriate measures
         through a decree fixing such posts inthe regions.


     0   Conducting an evaluation o f the cost recovery policy, focusing on rural areas, and
         implementing the recommendations o f this evaluation. This evaluation should not only
         include an assessment o f the barriers to care among the poor, but also propose a medium-
         term strategy for providing care at an affordable cost. Ifan exemption from cost recovery
         for the poor i s implemented, additional resources may need to be provided to the Ministry
         o f Public Health to offset the loss inrevenues from the exemption policy.

     0   Improving the impact o f spending through performance-based management techniques
         and budgeting at the district level, and ensuring that budgetary allocations (provided to
         the Ministryo f Health by the Ministry o f Finance under the priority rules governing the
         cash management plan) for the purchase o f drugs and vaccines are indeed used by the
         Ministryfor this purpose and allocatingresources basedon criteriato ensure equity.


     0   Improving the performance o f priority public health programs (apart from reproductive
         health programs), among others through an increase in immunization coverage and
         stronger programs to combat malaria AIDS and tuberculosis, with a translation o f these
         initiatives into the revision o f the preliminary MTEF prepared in2004.

     0   Ensuring a rationalization of investments and a pro-poor geographic allocation of
         resources by completing the carte sanitaire and linking it to the poverty map being
         prepared with the 2001 census. A study should also be carried on the fiscal impact o f
         incentive packages provided to decentralized health personnel for better service delivery
         inrural areas.

                                                 27




    0  Improving overall sector management through the adoption o f a health sector
       development plan based on targets, required inputs and sustainable financing, and the
       formulation o f a strategy for recruitment, training and deployment o f staff to the field,
       together with an expansion o f decentralized budget programming and execution and the
       implementation o f institutional reforms.

57.    Rural development. Despite good rainfall in 2000-03, Niger remains vulnerable to
shocks, as witnessed by the 2004 drought and locus attack. Food production i s growing at a rate
below that o f population growth, and agricultural exports have been declining. The sector suffers
from low productivity, and weak capacity in key ministries. The adoption o f the Rural
Development Strategy (RDS) in November 2003 i s an important step forward, but the strategy
must now become more operational and be implemented. Priorities in the area o f rural
development include:


    0  Action plans for the 14 structural and sectoral programs o f the RDS must be prepared,
       with adequate cost-benefit analysis o f proposals put forward. More generally, planning
        and preparation o f Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks in the four Ministries at the
        core o f the RDS i s only at the preliminary stage, and needs to be expanded substantially.


    0   Integration i s required between the activities o f line Ministries and the investments
        funded under the President's program. For example, the Ministries must be able to cost
        and implement complementary actions that would help to maximize the economic impact
        o f the infrastructure built by the President's program, especially in water management.
        Preparation o f action plans for the RDS i s an opportunity to achieve this coordination. In
        addition, ensuring that the implementation o f projects under the President's Program i s
       progressively shifted to the line Ministries dealing with rural development.


    0   Ensuring that following the adoption o f the National Transport Strategy by the
        Government in October 2004, the strategy i s now implemented and funded, with special
        focus on maintenance issues as well as improvements in the rural transport network.
        Implementingthe road and transport strategy will also require the preparation o f MTEFs
        inthe Ministries o fTransport and Equipment.

58.     Use of HIPC Resources. The allocation o f HIPC resources through the President's
program has helped in building rapidly education, health, and rural infrastructure. However,
based on the experience acquired to date, reforms can now be implemented. The main issue i s
that while in some sectors such as education, the allocation o f hnds (e.g., new classrooms and
contractual teachers) i s based on propositionsby Ministries, the coordination in many other areas
remains weak. Priorities include:


    0   Ensuringthat there is a broad consensus and a higher level o f participation from various
        stakeholders in terms o f inter-sectoral trade-offs and allocations o f HIPC resources. The
        revision o f the PRSP in 2006, together with efforts to cost priority actions necessary to
        make faster progress towards the MDGs, should be an occasion to reach this consensus.


    0   Integrating the program in line Ministries. In the short to medium run (depending on
        capacity in various sectors), HIPC resources should be programmed and managed
        directly by line Ministriesto maximize synergies with programs run by these ministries.

                                               28


       An Action Plan for the integration o f the program into the line ministries should be
       preparedby the Government.


    0  Adopting the appropriate procedures and time frame to ensure that projects are well
       implemented technically, with appropriate consultation o f local authorities and
       populations. Consultation and preliminary studies may delay investments but they are
       necessary to ensure beneficial outcomes; appropriate project funding (at market price)
       and stronger project supervision on the part o f project managers i s also required.


    0  Examining the possibility for budgeting and accounting purposes o fbetter disaggregating
       spending data related to the program. In addition, disbursement procedures for
       investments at the local level could be improved to follow rules inspired from
       Community Driven Development (CDD) projects in order to increase accountability and
       transparency.


    0  Considering the possibility o f a gradual shift from investment to higher recurrent
       spending in the program if this would help to ensure good quality o f public service
       delivery and ensure higher budget execution rates.


C.3. Improving Niger's Monitoring and Evaluation System

59.    The revision o f the PRSP scheduled for 2006, as well as more generally the evaluation o f
government policies and programs, require an efficient system for monitoring and evaluation.
Following the recent reorganization of the National Statistical system, key priorities include:

    0  Appointing the General Director o f the NSO so that a medium term statistical and M&E
       master plan can be prepared and adopted.          This plan should include among others
       measures for improving the information base o f the National Accounts and a medium-
       term strategy interms o f household survey data collection.


    0  Implementingthe new national extended CWIQ (Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire
       -QUIBBinFrench) surveyfor2005,andcomplementingtheanalysisofthissurveywith
       a qualitative review o f the factors enabling households to emerge from poverty. This
       would represent an update o f the 2002 participatory poverty assessment conducted by the
       PRSP unit; both qualitative and quantitative data should be used to evaluate the
       interventions implemented under the existing PRSP, especially those o f the President's
       program. While the audit provides insights, it does not assess impacts.


    0  Analyzing the spatial dimensions o f poverty inNiger (construction o f a poverty map) and
       assess the feasibility o f creating a geographically disaggregated information system to
       inform budget allocations at the local level and to help local authorities within the context
       o f the move towards decentralization. This GIS could integrate existing sources o f data
       (Census 2001, School Map at Ministryo f Education, HealthNational Information System
       at Ministry o f Health, Geographic Information System of Niger or SIGNER at the
       Ministryo f Hydraulics) into a more coherent and flexible overall unique system. Ifsuch
       a system were to be created, much o f the work involved here would consist in ensuring
       consistency in data formats and geographic code identification, and in building a user-
       friendly data for accessing these data. Support will need to be provided to the country for
       implementingthis GIS system.

                                                   29




    0   Establishing a code in the budget nomenclature that will facilitate monitoring over time
        o f poverty-related expenditures. Note that the categories o f spending deemed to be
        directly related to poverty reduction are likely to be different from the list o f priority
        expenditures to be protected under the budget regulation and cash management process,
        as some o f these expenditures (e.g., part o f the wages to be paid to public servants) are
        not necessarily related to poverty-related activities, and some poverty-related activities,
        while important, may not need to be protected at the same rate as other types o f spending
        inthe short run. A better identification and classification o fexpenditures considered to be
        directly linked to the fight against poverty will also help to strengthen the coherence
        between Budget Laws and the objectives and targets o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy.

60.     PERC will also provide support and incentives for conducting impact evaluations o f
selected reforms. For instance, in the area o f utility privatization and regulatory reforms, the
structure o f tariffs and connection costs for water and electricity should be analyzed with respect
to their impact on the poor. For example, because few o f the residential consumers o f water
consume less than 15 m3per month are poor, the recently agreed reduction inthe lifeline level for
the inverted block tariff structure for water from 15 m3to 10 m3is not likely to have had any
major impact on poverty. But the more important objective should be to help households who are
not connected to the water network to obtain a connection at an affordable price, since the cost o f
obtaining water from vendors or public fountains appears to be 3 to 5 times higher than the
average price paid by households who are connected to the network. An assessment o f the cost
implications and o f the quality o f the targeting to the poor o f 11,200 branchement sociaux (social
connections) funded through a Bank financing since 2002 would be useful to learn from that
experience. In addition, priority should be givento expand the number o f public fountains, and as
importantly, to regulate the (currently high) fees that operators o f such fountain charge to
consumers. More generally, analyticalwork on the utilities and poverty will be launchedinNiger
to provide information that can be usedto increase the benefits o futility services for the poor.


V. CREDIT FEATURES

A. Poverty Impact

61.     Implementation PRSPs progress reports prepared by the World Bank and the IMF have
repeatedly noted that PRSPs are not explicit enough in terms o f key priorities and tradeoffs
involved in policy making and budgetary allocations. To strengthen PRSPs and achieve faster
poverty reduction and progress towards the MDGs, paying more attention to public expenditure
management (i.e., better linkages o f the PRSP to the budget) i s often the most important reform
that governments can take. This i s the case in Niger, and the proposed credit i s focused on these
issues, with practical proposals for the country to move forward. Apart from strengthening public
expenditure management, the reforms proposed inthe credit will be instrumental inincreasing the
impact on the poor o f public spending in key areas and in improving the monitoring and
evaluation system for the implementation and revision o f the PRSP. Some o f the measures
proposed in this operation should thus have a positive impact on poverty. This i s especially the
case for the better integration o f the Special Program o f the President with the activities o f line
Ministries and the decree fixing health posts in the regions as well as the measure for the
decentralization o f health personnel. None o f these measures in this credit i s expected to have
negative impacts on the poor, so that Poverty and Social Impact Analysis to identify and mitigate

                                                   30


such potentially negative impacts i s not necessary. Still, the Government has requested a number
of studies inthese areas in order to. obtain the largest benefits possible from the reforms.


B. Linkageswith the CAS

62.     The CAS focuses on the four strategic areas identified in Niger's PRSP with the aim to
orientate IDA'Ssupport to Niger's economic, social and poverty reduction priorities. The CAS
mid-term review has concluded that IDA will continue to provide support to all four pillars o f the
PRSP, with a particular emphasis, at least with regard to financial support, on public expenditure
management and service delivery. PERC is the Bank's main budget support instrument to support
the continuation o f the implementation o f the CAS. Apart from ensuring fiscal and
macroeconomic stability, which i s critical in facilitating robust and sustained growth over the
medium- to long-term, the credit will contribute to the realization o f the strategic focus o f the
CAS over its remaining implementation period by: (a) improving budget preparation and
execution, and improving transparency and accountability o f budget management, which i s
instrumental for promoting good governance; (b) identifying ways to increase the impact o f
public spending on the poor; and (c) strengthening the monitoring and evaluation system for the
PRSP, including through analysis o f the poverty impact o f sectoral reforms where feasible.

63,     The movement to full programmatic budgetary support will probably be delayed to FY07
inorder to enable PERC (and a subsequent operation) to strengthen the pre-requisites for shifting
Bank's assistance to programmatic support. First, the proposed operation will enhance budget
preparation and execution processes, thereby strengthening the link between public expenditure
and the objectives set forth in the PRSP. Second, it will help reinforce the fiduciary framework,
strengthen accountability inpublic expenditure, procurement and financial management. Third, it
will advance the budget-program approach by reinforcing the links between sectoral strategies
and corresponding program budgets.

64.     PERC's contribution to the transition to an eventual PRSC will be reinforced through
forthcoming analytical work (e.g., poverty monitoring and analysis based on the new national
survey, qualitative participatory poverty assessment to evaluate current policies and the factors
enabling households to move out o f poverty - including the President's special program, poverty
and social impact analysis o f selected reforms, and a Country Economic Memorandum on the
sources o f growth), which will provide the knowledge base for an eventual PRSC. The move
toward a programmatic lendingwould also require strengthening capacity inNiger. Inparallel to
PERC, the Bank will continue helping the Government reinforce capacity needed for
programmatic lending through the implementation o f the PHRD grant.               The Bank will also
continue to work closely with other development partners involved in capacity building in the
area of budgetary reforms, inparticular the European Union.

C. Benefitsand Risks

65.      The main benefit o f this credit will be to continue deepening policy reforms in the public
expenditure management. These reforms should increase the impact o f public spending on the
poor. Improving budget preparation will help improve the allocation o f scarce resources to key
priority sectors. Enhancing budget execution and the cash budgeting system should increase the
efficiency and equity o f public expenditures while improving fiscal discipline. In addition, the
reform program supported by PERC i s expected to contribute to the PRSP's key objectives o f
improving basic service delivery in the social sectors, achieving a better integration and

                                                 31


coordination o f the initiatives implemented for faster poverty reduction in rural areas (especially
inthe terms o fwater management), andrevampingthe monitoring and evaluation system.

66.      There are several risksassociated to this credit.

      The first risk is that the reform program supported by PERC could falter as a result o f
      policy reversals and/or slippages inkey reforms, which could affect the Government ability
      to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and focus expenditure on poverty
      reducing priorities identified in the PRSP. Counterpart commitment to the proposed
      reforms under the previous adjustment operations (PEAC Iand PEAC II),          and now under
      PERC has been reaffirmed at the highest level o f government. In addition, a number o f
      significant up-front actions have been taken, which bear witness to the Government's
      resolve to advance the reform program. Moreover, most o f the reforms supported by
      PERC, especially in budgetary management and in the social sectors, were initiated by the
      Government and ownership o f and commitment to the proposed actions are demonstrated.

      The second risk is the economy's vulnerability to external factors such as adverse climatic
      conditions, social and political upheavals in neighboring countries, and shortfall in donor
      support. While Niger's economy has not been affected too much from the crisis in Cate
      d'Ivoire, it has proven to remain fragile in face o f the 2004 drought and locus attack.
      Measures to strengthen the budget regulation and cash management system should help
      protect priority sectors against potential adverse effects o f potential shortfalls in domestic
      revenue mobilization or donor support. In addition, the close collaboration between Bank
      staff and other donors involved in budget support during the preparation o f PERC
      (especially the European Union) should help improve the timing o f disbursement o f major
      donors' support during implementationperiod o f this credit.

      The third major risk is the weak institutional capacity. Despite some achievements under
      previous adjustment operations, major constraints to the implementation o f reforms remain
      due to weak institutional capacity to prepare and implement reforms. This could slow
      down the pace o f improvements inbudgetary reforms inNiger. Cognizant o f this risk, both
      Bank staff and the Nigerien authorities are committed to work closely together to ensure
       full implementationo fthe proposed reformprogram supported byPERC.

       The fourth risk is fiduciary. Despite the Government continued efforts to reinforce
       financial management and procurement systems, some fiduciary risks with regard to the
      use o f public funds remain. Internal and external control mechanisms remain weak and
       capacity in the Chamber o f Accounts i s limited. PERC contains measures to strengthen
       controls mechanisms and improve accountability through both internal and external
      controls. The risks associated to enforcement, institutional capacity and weak governance
      tiedup to procurement are thus mitigated by the very design and content o f the credit.

D. Collaborationwith Other Donors

67.      The programs financed by the Bank and the Fund have been closely coordinated since
adjustment assistance to Niger resumed in 2000. The macroeconomic framework and balance o f
payments needs are jointly agreed by the Bank, the Fund and the Government. The staffs o f IDA
and the IMF verified that the contents o f PERC and the new three-year IMF-PRGF program be
coordinated to ensure that these budget-support instruments complement each other. Budgetary
measures supported by the ongoing PRGF program are in large part drawn from the PEMFAR

                                                  32


policy matrix. Inaddition, the reform program underpinningthe proposed credit i s consistent with
the macroeconomic program supported by the PRGF. The full PRSP was discussed by the Bank
and Fund boards in January 2002. The HIPC Completion Point Document was jointly prepared
by Bank and Fundstaff and approved by the Boards o f the two institutions inApril 2004.

68.      Bank staff have also collaborated with other major donors including the European Union,
the AfDB, and France. The strategic focus, contents, and conditionalities o f PERC have been
jointly designed and prepared with staff o f the European Union, who participated in the pre-
appraisal mission. Both staffs have also prepared the PEMFAR, a strategic framework for
strengthening public expenditure management reform over the short- and medium-term.
Moreover, Bank staff have consulted closely with other major donors including the AfDB,
Belgium and France, who are providing budgetary assistance as well as technical assistance for
budgetary management and other reforms. Bank staff have shared information and documents
regarding PERC with representatives o f these various institutions, with an especially close
coordination with the European Union. Along these lines and consistent with the PEMFAR
framework and process, programs o f donors will be derived from the PEMFAR policy matrix and
aimed at providing budgetary support.

E. Credit Amount and DisbursementProcedures

 69.     Credit Amount. The proposed credit amounting to SDR 26.6 million (equivalent to
US$40 million) will be disbursed in one tranche to support the 2005 budget. The tranche will be
released upon effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement (Le., upon satisfaction o f the
 IDA standard conditions o f effectiveness: provision of evidence that the Development Credit
Agreement has been signed, delivered and ratified in accordance with applicable law, and o f a
 legal opinion confirming that the Development Credit Agreement is valid and binding upon the
 Borrower), PERC will also include triggers for a subsequent operation.

 70.     Disbursement. Disbursement arrangements will follow OP 8.60. The proceeds o f the
 credit will be deposited by IDA in a Central Bank account at the request o f the Borrower. Ifafter
 deposit in this account, the proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes (i.e., to finance
 items imported from non-member countries, or goods and services on the Bank's standard
 negative list), IDA will require the Borrower to refund the amount directly to IDA, inwhich case
 IDA will cancel an equivalent amount o fthe Credit.


 F. Prior Actions for PERC and Triggersfor subsequent operation

 71,     The full program o f actions to be supported by the proposed Credit i s set out inthe Policy
 Matrix (Annex 6). The actions listed in the next paragraph have already been undertaken and are
 therefore considered as prior actions. Actions to be taken for effectiveness o f the credit are also
 listed. Finally, other actions to be taken in the next twelve months in the context o f the
 recommendations o f the PEMFAR matrix have been identified as triggers for a subsequent
 operation. The maintenance o f a satisfactory macroeconomic framework as described in the
 Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) included in this document will be necessary to release
 PERC.

 72.     Prior Actions completed by the Government(See Annex 7):

A. In the area ofpublic expenditure management:

                                                 33



    0   To ensure adequate levels of budgetary resources for priority sectors in 2005: A
        revised budget law 2005 includes allocations for the full amount o f debt relief received
        under the HIPC initiative and provides substantially higher fundingfor the Health (FCFA
        2.1 billion), Education (FCFA 9.7 billion), and Rural Development sectors (FCFA 4
        billion). A detailed analysis i s provided in Annex 3.

    0   To enhance budget execution: Lineministries have participatedinthe preparation o f the
        2005 Cash Allocation Plan established on the basis o f the 2005 revised budget law. A
        lettre circulaire satisfactory in form and substance for IDA has been sent by the Ministry
        of Economy and Finance to all ministries to indicate the changes implemented in the
        budget regulation process in order to ensure a better participation o f line ministries on a
        quarterly basis. A copy o f this lettre circulaire has been sent to IDA. (See PEMFAR
        Matrix, Action 10).


    0   To reactivate the work of the Committee to establish opening balances: The
        Committee in charge o f the preparation o f the opening balances for 1996 has met and has
        provided its report to the Ministry o f Economy and Finance.          This report includes
        recommendations as well as a calendar for the finalization o f the 1996 opening balance
        and the use o f the comptes de gestion and lois de r2glements for updating the opening
        balances after 1996. IDA has received a copy o f this report. (See PEMFAR Matrix,
        Action 17).

B. In the area of social sector reforms, poverty, and the monitoring and evaluation system:

    0   To improve health service delivery in remote areas: In order to improve the provision
        o f health care in the regions and prepare the decentralization o f health services, a decree
        has been prepared by the govemment to establish statutory rules applicable to new
        contractual health workers. This decree fixes new health posts inthe regions. A copy o f
        the decree has been sent to IDA.


    0   To improve the monitoring and evaluation system: The new nationally representative
        household survey (extended QUIBB 2005) that will be used to inform the revision o f the
        PRSP has been launched by the INS.


    0   T o improve the integration of HIPC resources into the sectoral strategies for the
        reduction of poverty: The Minister o f Economy and Finance has indicated in its Letter
        of Development Policy (see Annex 9) its intention to improve the integration o f HIPC
        resources into the sectoral strategies for poverty reduction. To this end, a preliminary
        action plan for strengthening the management mechanism o f the Special Program o f the
        President, in form and substance agreeable to IDA, has been submitted by the Minister o f
        Economy and Finance to IDA. (See paragraph 32 of this Program Document and the
        annex to the Letter of Development Policy).

Conditions of Effectiveness

73.     As a condition for effectiveness o fthe credit, the following will be met:

    0   To improve health service delivery in remote areas: the decree prepared by the
        govemment to establish statutory rules applicable to new contractual health workers will

                                                 34


        have been adopted by the Government and a copy o f the adopted decree will have been
        sent to IDA.


   0    To improve the monitoring and evaluation system: The Director General o f the I N S
        have been nominatedby the Government, and documentation to this effect will have been
        provided to IDA.

74.     Triggers for subsequent operation. The prior actions for a subsequent operation will be
determined during pre-appraisal and appraisal missions for that operation.       However, in the
specific area o f public expenditure management for which a medium term plan has been agreed
with the government through the PEMFAR, the followingtriggers will be used:


   0    To ensure adequate levels of budgetary resources for priority sectors in 2006: The
        draft Budget Law for 2006 to be submitted to the National Assembly will provide
        adequate resources for priority sectors (including recurrent costs) and include an
        overview highlighting the consistency of budget proposals with PRSP targets and
        priorities, among others for health, education, rural development, and transport. Sectoral
        allocations will take into account the Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks in the
        Ministries having prepared such frameworks. (See PEMFAR Matrix, Action 3). In
        addition, a budget code will be used in the 2006 Budget Law in order to better track
        poverty-reducing expenditures.


   0    To improve the integration of HIPC resources into the sectoral strategies for the
        reduction of poverty: The strengthening o f the management mechanism for the Special
        Program o f the President will have been implemented satisfactorily in accordance with
        the plan included inthe Letter o f Development Policy prepared by the Government.


   0    To improve budget preparation: Following the process engaged in the Ministries o f
        Basic Education and Public Health, the Government will pursue the preparation o f
        budget-programs, especially for the rural development sector. (See PEMFAR Matrix,
        Action 5).

   0    To improve budget execution: The Minister o f Economy and Finance will provide to
        IDA a report on the execution o f the cash management plan with detailed information on
        the allocations receivedby each Ministry. The Ministries o f Basic Education and Health
        will prepare a review o f their respective public expenditures. (See PEMFAR Matrix,
        Action 32).

    0   To improve health service delivery in rural areas: A study will be prepared on the
        potential cost o f alternative incentive packages that could be provided to decentralized
        health personnel and an action plan for the decentralization o f health care personnel will
        be prepared.


    0   To improve budget execution and controls: The Government will prepare a report on
        the use o f exceptional budget procedures (including PSOPs). This report will include the
        strategy and specific measures for reducing PSOPs. Inaddition, the Committee in charge
        o f overseeing the reformprogram for controls will have been set up by the Government.

   0    To reinforce capacities for public expenditure management: As recommended in the
        PEMFAR report, a study will be implemented for improving the structure and

                                          35


  functioning o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. This study will provide
  recommendations among others in the following areas: (a) the preparation o f quarterly
  reports on external debt, and the clearance process and timeframe for domestic debt ;(b)
  the identification o f overlapping control mechanisms that could be streamlined and an
  action plan for such simplification; (c) the identification o f line Ministries that should
  benefit from the de-concentration o f expenditure administration; and (d) a better
  integration inthe budget and follow-up o f externally financed investments.


0 To ensure the implementation of the recommendations of the PEMFAR: The
  Council o f Ministers will adopt each year an annual program outlining actions,
  timeframes, and specific responsibilities for the various agencies concerned.

                         ANNEX 1:PROGRESSTOWARDS THE MDGs
                        (WITHFOCUSON EDUCATIONAND HEALTH)

1. Progresstowards the MDGs. An indication o f progress towards various targets set forward
inthe MDGsis provided inTable A1 While the assessment ofprogress is hampered bythe lack
                                         .
of recent household survey data, a number o f conclusions can be reached. First, as GDP per
capita has remained overall flat since the early 1990s (with ups and downs related to weather
conditions), it i s likely that poverty has not been reduced. Simulations based on data from 1994
and using GDP per capita growth as an indicator for likely changes inper capita consumption at
the household level suggest that the share o f the population in poverty at the end o f 2004 may
have been at 64 percent, versus 63 percent in 1993. Child malnutrition also remains high, at 40
percent to 50 percent depending on the data sources, and it i s unlikely that it has gone down
significantly. Primary gross enrollment has increased to 50 percent in2004, and an increase was
also observed in the ratio o f girls to boys in primary schools, to 40 percent in 2004. Child
mortality decreased from 322 per thousand to 274 per thousand during the 1990s.                While
HIV/AIDS infection rates are low, malaria prevalence i s very high. Access to drinkingwater has
probably increased somewhat, but overall, access rates remain low, especially inrural areas.

2. Progress in education. In Niger's ten year education program (PDDE 2003-2013), key
objectives include: a) increasing access to both formal and non-formal basic education, in
particular for children in rural areas, girls and the poor; b) improving the quality and relevance o f
education; and c) developing capacities for the strategic and operational management o f the
sector at both the central and regional levels, and increasing responsibilities assumed at the
community level. Progress so far towards these objectives i s as follows:


    0   Access. The Government has expanded the construction and rehabilitation o f classrooms
        inpart usingHIPC resources via the Special Programo fthe President. This has ledto the
        construction and equipment o f 1,695 classrooms and the recruitment o f 2,702 contractual
        teachers. As a result of these initiatives, the access rate in the first year o f primary
        education reached 55 percent in 2003, which i s close to the target that was set in the
        PRSP o f 56 percent.        In rural areas, the access rate reached 48.4 percent, or 2.4
        percentage points above the target. There has also been a reduction in gender disparities,
        but the share o f girls inprimary education still remains low at about 40 percent. Progress
        was also achieved for secondary education, as detailed inPRSP progress reports.


    0   Oualitv. Completion rates in basic education increased from 24.7 percent in 2002/2003 to
        32.2 percent in 2003/2004 inpart thanks to a higher increase in students entering primary
        school, and thanks to higher survival rates in the system. Repetition rates have been
        reduced, yet drop-out rates remain high, at 10.4 percent (11.1 percent in rural areas). The
        decentralized recruitment o f volunteer teachers on a contractual basis since 1998 has
        enabled the Ministryo f Basic Education to increase supply at a limitedcost, but it has led
        to concerns about the quality o f teaching. To address these concerns, since 2001
        contractual teachers receive training at the ENIs and the basic education curriculum has
        been adapted.

    0   Management. Policy reforms have been initiated and in some case completed.               The
        strategy for the sector i s described in the development plan for education (PDDE), on the
        basis o f which the education strategy presented in the PRSP was prepared. In 2004, the
        Ministry o f Basic Education prepared its first MediumTerm Expenditure Framework in
        order to guide pluri-annual decision making and budget allocations.

                                                 37



3. Progress in health. Broad Strategic Orientations for Health have been defined in a document
covering the period 2001-2011 adopted by the Government in2002, and are now being translated
into a five-year action plan. This plan i s to give priority to making functional existing health
centers (i.e., providing the necessary personnel and operating costs), expanding access through
outreach strategies, ensuring affordability for the poor through an exemption policy for the cost
recovery policy, and putting in place institutional reforms to support the strategies set forth and
implement core civil service reforms. Progress so far interms o f access, quality, and management
o f the health sector i s as follows:

     0   Access. Physical access to health care has been expanded through the construction and
         provision o f equipment for close to 1,000 integrated health centers and health posts over
         the last few years in large part under HIPC funding through the special program o f the
         President. To staff the new local health centers, the government has piloted decentralized
         contractual recruitment for qualified health personnel. Financial management procedures
         were defined between the Treasury and the Ministry to ensure the regular and timely
         payment o f the personnel, even in remote areas. As a result o f these initiatives, the share
         o f the population living within 5 kilometers from a health center increased to 47.6
         percent. However, this does not translate into actual coverage as issues o f personnel,
         shortages o f drugs and other materials, and o f financial access continue to limit the
         utilization o f services. Vaccination rates for BCG, DTCP3 and measles have also
         increased, by 15-20 percentage points between 2001 and 2003-04, to reach close to two
         thirds o f children. With the help o f donors, the Government has prepared a strategic
         action plan to fight HIV/AIDS. The building o f a national blood transfusion bank i s
         underway as well as the implementation o f activities to halt the transmission o f the virus,
         primarily among high risk groups (e.g., a mother-child transmission program i s being
         implementedwith UNICEF; other programs target highrisk groups.)

     0   Quality. Apart from an increase in access, actions have been implemented to improve the
         quality o f care, including more use o f prevention and hygienic practices. The sector's
         human and institutional capacity has been reinforced through training o f community
         health agents runningrural health posts, as well as health agents and doctors from public
         and private practices (among others on infectious diseases).

     0   Management. Work towards the preparation o f a development plan for 2005-2009 in the
         health sector i s underway. The Ministry o f Health also prepared in 2004 its first draft
         MTEF covering the period 2005-2007, expanded training o f health personnel, and
         launched pilot initiatives for performance-based contracts which will help inthe future to
         transfer resources from the central to the district levels.

                               ANNEX 2: CASH MANAGEMENT

1. Cash management was introduced at the end o f the 1990s with the aim o f tightly controlling
expenditures inorder to avoid liquidity and solvency problems. Niger's cash management system
consists of a budget regulation mechanism (rdgulation budgdtaire) and a treasury management
mechanism (plans de trdsorerie). The budget regulation mechanism, introduced in 1998, controls
spending authorizations at the commitment stage o f the budget execution process. The treasury
management mechanism, introduced in 2001, regulates cash payments at the payment stage.
Both mechanisms protect important expenditure items in the following order o f priority: wages
and salaries, external debt service, HIPC financed expenditures and other PRSP priorities (mainly
social sector spending).
2. Cash management, while contributing to improved fiscal stability, has been partly responsible
for the disparities between voted and executed budgets and inadequate execution o f priority
activities in priority sectors.    More important, past budget regulation practices and cash
management plans have not fully reflected the priorities o f sectoral programs and the PRSP. In
addition, decisions related to cash management have not followed a fully transparent process and
excluded important actors, in particular representatives from line ministries. In case o f treasury
management, an inter-ministerial committee has been created to help prepare and monitor cash
plans.
3. The lack o f automatic determination o f the cash position o f the Government constitutes a
further obstacle to the preparation and implementation o f effective cash management plans. The
cash position o f the Govemment i s established manually on the basis o f daily statements o f the
Treasury account at the Central Bank (BCEAO). The balances o f the treasury accounts are only
reconciled once a month with the Treasury account at the BCEAO.
4. Increasing budget realism at the budget preparation stage i s a prerequisite for strengthening
cash management.      This requires improving the quality o f revenue projections and taking a
conservative view o f the expected available resources. Ensuringliquidity will require measures
to compensate for seasonal fluctuations in resource availability. This could include introducing
the issue o f Treasury bills to bridge liquidity bottlenecks by establishing adequate cash balances.
It would also require enhancing coordination with donors to ensure appropriate spacing o f
disbursements.

5. The authorities recognize the need to reform the cash management system, in particular
increasing transparency o f decision making and protecting priority expenditures. In 2003, the
Government undertook a review o f its cash management plans with a view to strengthening the
links with agreed macroeconomic and sectoral priorities. The reform should also provide for
more transparency in decision making by giving the inter-ministerial committee a more
systematic role.    A similar reform should then be undertaken for the budget regulation
mechanism.

           ANNEX 3: ANALYSIS OF THE REVISED BUDGETLAW FOR 2005


1. The Nigerien Government revised the 2005 Budget Law (Loi des Finances), which was then
approved by the National Assembly in January 2005. The budget was increased from FCFA
401.8 billion to FCFA 450.2 billion, an increase o f FCFA 48.4 billion or 12.05 percent. The
largest share o f this increase came from the inclusion o f FCFA 16.5 billion in additional debt
relief to be received by the country as o f 2005 (FCFA 40.9 billion in 2005, versus FCFA 24.4
billion in 2004; the difference had not been taken into account in the initial budget law). Note
that for accounting purposes, the increase o f FCFA 16.5 billion in debt relief i s counted twice in
the Budget Law, once as additional resources for the Ministry of Finance, and once in terms o f
additional budgetary allocations to various Ministries(that is, the increase inHIPC relief accounts
for about FCFA 33 billion out o f the FCFA 48.4 billion increase in the revised budget). The
revised budget law also includes additional loan resources confirmed by donors. Because the net
increase in debt relief is included twice in the Budget Law, the net increase in actual resources i s
at FCFA 31.9 billion (i.e., FCFA 48.4 billion minus FCFA 16.5 billion on the receipts side o f the
budget accounting for higher debt relief). Thus, o f this increase o f FCFA 31.9 billion, about half
comes from the higher level of debt reliefgranted to Niger, and the rest from international aid.

2. As shown in Figure Al, 75 percent o f the overall net increase in public spending o f FCFA
31.9 billion was allocated to priority sectors (i.e., education, health, transport, equipment, rural
development, and community development).            Another 20 percent was allocated to other line
Ministries. The remaining 5 percent was allocated to central services (most o f this increase was
devoted to institutional support for the CNEDD in the Prime Minister office).         Note that the
allocation for the Ministry o f Defense was reduced by FCFA 1.6 billion (7 percent).

2. The overall increase in allocations for the priority sectors, at FCFA 23.8 billion (a 12.5 percent
increase), i s larger than the increase in HIPC funding, at FCFA 16.5 billion, thereby indicating a
substantial effort by the Govemment to support sectors considered as key for the implementation
of Niger's Poverty Reduction Strategyg. As shown on Figure A.2, among the additional budgets
allocated to the priority sectors (education, health, and rural development, plus transport and


     Note that in terms of the expenditures specifically identified as corresponding to the HIPC initiative
     ("PPTE" in French), the net increase in allocations i s at FCFA 6.6 billion. The rest o f the increase
     (about FCFA 10 billion, Le., FCFA 16.4 billion minus FCFA 6.6 billion innew spending) comes from
     considering as HIPC-related spending some expenditures which before were not considered as such.
     Inother words, there has been a reclassification of expenditures towards the priority sectors as "PPTE'
     resources.

   3. Details on the revisions of the allocation o f resources for the two education Ministries (basic
   education, and secondary and higher education) are inTable A3. With regards to basic education,
   the largest expenditure increase in the amount of 5.4 billion FCFA i s for contractual basic
   education teachers. Part of this increase, however, consists of a reclassification of expenditures
   (for 2.2 billion FCFA) as PPTE resources. Still, this represents a net increase of 3.4 billion
   FCFA. Other categories of funding registering an important increase include various schooling
   materials (1.1 billion FCFA), funding for the COGES and other programs (1.O billion FCFA),
   fundingfor food programs (0.7 billion FCFA), and about 3.5 billion FCFA for various investment
   programs.    At the secondary and tertiary level, additional funding was provided mainly for
   contractual teachers at the secondary level (net increase o f 0.5 billion FCFA), various school
   materials (net increase of 0.4 billion FCFA) and the University of Niamey (1.4 billion FCFA).

 4. Details on the revisions o f the allocation o f resources for other priority Ministries are given in
 Table A3. With respect to equipment expenditures, there are three large changes: 2 billion FCFA
 for road covering and public lighting, 2 billion FCFA for the Lawandi-Djadjiri road, and one
 more billion FCFA for the CAFER, the organism in charge o f road maintenance (the full budget
 o f 5 billion FCFA i s now classified as PPTE resources). On agricultural development, the
 increase corresponds to an IDA loan (4 billion FCFA) previously not accounted for. In health,
 the total increase is 2 billion FCFA, a majority o f which is allocated to investments (including 0.5
 billion for the construction o f a center for the fight against cancer).

 5. Overall, the revisions made the 2005 Budget Law go in the right direction, by raising the
 resources allocated under the HIPC initiative, strengthening the priority sectors for the
 implementation o f the PRSP, and allocating higher resources for recurrent expenditures in a
 number o f line Ministries (especially in the case o f education, with better funding for contractual
 teachers and schooling materials, among others).          Weaknesses remain in some areas, among
 others in health which has relatively low allocations and where the burden o f the cost recovery
 mechanisms i s high for the poor. These remaining imbalances will need to be corrected in future
 years, on the basis o f the Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks to be prepared by Ministries.

              ANNEX 4: REGIONAL INTEGRATIONAND PUBLIC FINANCE


1. Niger is a member o f the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and, as
such, shares a common currency (the CFA franc, FCFA) and a common central bank with seven
other West African countries (Banque Centrale des Etats de 1'Afrique de 1'Ouest, BCEAO). The
BCEAO monetary policy i s mainly geared toward supporting the fixed exchange rate. For an
individual country, the burden o f adjustment to shocks needs to be borne by fiscal policies. Fiscal
management was tightened under the Regional Pact o f Convergence, Stability, Growth, and
Solidarity, adopted by the Conference o f Heads o f States o f WAEMU in December 1999 (See
Box Al). In this context, Niger's fiscal objectives are determined by the need to meet the
regional fiscal convergence criteria (See Box Al). Niger has been making progress toward
meeting the WAEMU convergence criteria, since 2000, in particular those related to fiscal
performance. By 2003, Niger had reduced the number o f unmet criteria to four (See Table A5
below).

2. WAEMU and BCEAO membership have implications for Niger's fiscal situation. The recent
elimination o f the statutory rule allowing national treasuries to access,central bank overdraft
facilities (statutory advances) has left Niger with an estimated FCFA 8 billion in debt owed to
BCEAO at end-2003. In addition, the shift o f the financing o f Government fiscal deficits from
central bank direct advances to the issuance o f securities in the regional capital market has
added an additional constraint on Niger's fiscal framework. The effectiveness of the issuance
o f Government securities to finance    fiscal deficits will depend much on the demand for these
securities and the absorptive capacity o f the regional capital market. The success o f such issues
i s hard to predict, as Niger has not yet conducted such an operation.

3. Regional integration and WAEMU membership have also led to the implementation o f trade
liberalization policies, including the adoption o f a common external tariff (CET) in 2000 and
the progressive harmonization o f regulations in other areas such as public finance.            The
WAEMU CET agreement includes a compensatory facility to cover revenue losses from the
implementation o f the CET. The FCFA 10 billion (Government's estimate in M a y 2004) owed
to Niger in compensation for the implementation o f the CET has not yet been transferred. In
any case, these compensatory payments are temporary and will be phased out by 2007.

Box Al: Regional Pact of Convergence, Stability, Growth and Solidarity

The Regional Pact of Convergence, Stability, Growth, and Solidarity, adopted in December 1999, i s a
formal agreement among the member states o f the WAEMU. The Pact has four main objectives: (i)
strengthen the convergence of WAEMU economies; (ii)            reinforce macroeconomic stability; (iii)
                                                                                                      accelerate
economic growth; and (iv) enhance solidarity among the member countries.
T o this end, the Pact defines two sets o f convergence criteria (primary and secondary criteria) that member
states o f the WAEMU must comply with.
The five primary criteria are:
0    The ratio o f the basic fiscal balance to nominal GDP must be inbalance or in surplus (key criterion);
0    The ratio o f outstanding domestic and external debt to nominal GDP must not exceed 70 percent;
0    The average annual inflation rate must not surpass 3 percent;

0    The variation on the stock o f domestic payment arrears must not be positive; and

0    The variation on the stock o f external payment arrears must not be positive.
The five secondary criteria are:
0    The ratio o f the wage bill to tax revenue must not exceed 35 percent;

0    The ratio o f domestically financed public investment to tax revenue must exceed 20 percent;
0    The ratio o f the external recurrent account deficit, excluding grants, to nominal GDP must not ex eed
     5 percent; and
     The tax-to-GDPratio must b e higher than 17 percent.

111.     IMFBudgetarySupport


1.       Over the last decade, the IMF involvement in supporting Niger's reform program has
taken the form of: a Stand-By Agreement (SBA, 1994-95); an Extended Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF, 1996-99); and a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, 2000-03).

2.       The Ex-Post Assessment o f Performance under IMF-supported Programs carried out
jointly by the Nigerien authorities and IMF staff in June 2004 concluded that the SBA-supported
program was unsatisfactory as the program went considerably off-track. Program implementation
was mixed under the first and second annual ESAF arrangements, owing mainly to difficult
domestic and external environment.

3.       Following a transparent and democratic elections at end-1999, the newly elected
government resumed financial relations with its development partners and quickly established a
new,economic, social, and political agenda.

4.       Insupport of the authorities' efforts to move their reform agenda, the Executive Board o f
the IMF approved, on December 14,2000, a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 59.20 million (about US$76
million). The PRGF program aimed to: (i)     fight poverty; (ii) to invigorate economic activity
                                                                seek
ina context o f financial stability, and (iii) and sustainable growth.
                                             high

5.       The implementation o fthe PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory. The sixth and
last review o f the program has been completed in June 2004. A successor new three-year PRGF-
program in an amount equivalent to SDR 6.58 (10 percent o f quota), has been approved by the
IMF Board on January 31, 2005. The new PRGF arrangement will support the Government's
reform program for 2005-07, which focus on: (i)fiscal consolidation; (ii)       public and financial
sector reforms; and (iii)development o f social and priority sector strategies.

6.       The Ex-Post Assessment highlights lessons learned from the implementation o f Fund-
supported program in Niger over the past decade. These include: (i)successful adjustment
requires the existence o f a stable government, as well as a broad-based national consensus in
support o f reform; (ii) adjustment process necessarily requires a sustained effort in which
                         the
perseverance and continuity are critical; (iii) a successful reform effort in Niger requires a major
revenue increase; (iv) program performance has been affected by exogenous shocks, including
weather conditions and disruptions in external aid flows; (v) Niger's limited institutional and
human capital capacity contributed to the delays encountered in the execution o f the reform
agenda; and (vi) the staffs of the IMF and World Bank have generally complemented each other
well inproviding assistance to Niger, and collaboration has been close.

IV.      African DevelopmentBank (AfDB)

 1.      The AfDB provides substantial budgetary assistance (ranked third after the Bank and
EU). The Board of Directors o f the African Development Fund (ADF) has approved a loan o f
 13.1 million Units o f Account (UA), equivalent to 18.7 million U S dollars and a grant o f 1.2
million UA, equivalent to 1.7 million U S dollars (in total 20.4 million U S dollars) to finance the
4th Structural Adjustment Program in Niger (PAS IV 2003-2004). This Program which aims at
improving the living conditions o f the people and reducing poverty in a sustainable way, falls
within a framework o f the implementation o f operational program for the poverty reduction
strategy.

                                                 49


2.      The program has three major components: (i)     promoting good governance by improving
the efficiency and the quality o f public expenditure; (ii) strengthening social sectors; and (iii)
restructuring the financial sector and accelerate the implementationo f the privatization program.

3.       The AfDB will support the implementationo f all the components. But it will focus more
particularly on the mechanisms for the implementation o f good governance. Through the grant,
the AfDB will support the Government's efforts which aims at: (i)fighting against corruption and
misuse of public hnds; (ii)fighting against money laundering; and (iii)   improving monitoring the
budget implementation.

4.       The program also includes specific measures to reduce poverty and improve social
conditions of the population. These include an improvement o f the basic education and health
services through the allocation o f budgetary resources and quality o f human resources.

5.       The AfDB has already financed three Structural Adjustment Projects in Niger: SAP Iin
1997, a public finances reform program in 1998 and SAP I11in2001.

6.       The operations of the AfDB in Niger commenced in 1970. By the end-December 2003,
45 operations had been approved amounting to US$350.9 million. Total disbursements stood at
US$256.7 million.


VI. OTHERS DONORS'BUDGETARYSUPPORT

Other bilateral donors (Norway and Holland) are providing budgetary support in the context o f
the implementation o f the EFA-FT initiatives. Belgium i s planning to support education and
health sectors through budgetary support in the upcoming years if the overall macroeconomic
context continues to improve.

                         Annex 8: OutcomesofPrevious AdjustmentOperations

1.       The EconomicRecovery Credit (ERC, March 1984). In the context o f the devaluation o f the
CFA Franc in January 1994, the ERC, a single tranche adjustment operation, was prepared with the main
objective o f supporting Niger's post-devaluation reform program. Outcomes o f this operation were
disappointing and unsatisfactory. While GDP growth was slightly higher than the target of 3.9 percent,
the overall fiscal deficit worsened, reaching 12.5 percent o f GDP against a target o f 9 percent for 1994.
Arrears were partially settled. On the structural front, reforms in the public enterprise sector were limited.
The planned independent audits were carried out on time for NIGELEC and CNSS, but delayed beyond
the end 1994 for ONPPC and SONIDEP. The liquidation o f COPRO-NIGER was delayed to 1995 and the
privatization o f NIGELEC is still not done. With regard to the Private Sector Development, neither the
objective o f eliminating the Government monopoly over hiring nor the revision o f the Labor Code was
achieved.

2.       The Public Sector AdjustmentCredit (PSAC, March 1997). This one tranche operation focused
on addressing public finance and public enterprise problems. In the context o f relative political stability,
outcomes o f this adjustment credit were satisfactory. While GDP growth was lower than the target, 2.8
percent compared to 4.3 percent, the overall budget deficit reached 7.5 percent against a target o f 8
percent. Most o f the revenue mobilization measures were undertaken. A number o f structural reforms
were initiated in 1997. These included the rationalization o f the civil service and the payroll system, by
the revision o f the salary scale, the completion o f a civil service census, the launch o f a redeployment
program for the health sector and the tax collection agencies and the adoption o f a civil service statute in
1998 which introduced mandatory retirement after 30 years o f service or 55 years o f age. However, inthe
area o f public enterprise reform, progress was slow, mainly due to the resistance o f powerfultrade unions,
weak technical and administrative capacities.

3.       The Public FinanceReform Credit (PFRC-October 1998). The overall objective o f this three-
tranche credit was to support the implementation o f the economic reform program in1998-99, designed
with the leadership o f the Government in place. Outcomes o f this operation were mixed. The April 1999
coup damaged severely economic and financial stance. GDP growth fell to -0.6 percent in 1999
compared with 10.4 percent in 1998. The wage bill could not be contained and domestic arrears could not
be settled, As the result, the second and third tranches o f the credit were cancelled. The revenue targets
were not met and the widening o f the tax base did not materialize.

4.       The Public FinanceRecovery Credit (PFRC-September 2000). This credit aimed at supporting
the stabilization efforts and the fiscal management reform conducting by a new-elected and reform-
oriented civilian Government. Outcomes o f this operation were satisfactory as the implementation o f the
program was successful. Real GDP grew by 7.6 percent in 2001 owing mostly to good rainfall. Revenue
mobilization targets were achieved in both 2000 and 2001. The budget management system was
strengthened. Budget preparation was improved as programming issues were solved. But still problems
remained at the levels o f allocations for scholarships, autonomous entities, and utility consumption. The
Government introduced two key measures to improve budget execution, including a strict forward-
looking cash management system and the prioritization o f expenditure. However, institutional weaknesses
limited progress. Fiscal reporting was improved thanks to the computerization o f budget execution. But,
the reconciliation o f data between the different agencies o f the Ministry of Finance and Economy, in
particular between budget execution and the Treasury's balance sheet. External control and oversight o f
budget execution and audit were established. However, limited capacities o f the Chamber o f Accounts
and the lack o f adequate resources reduced the effectiveness o f the budget oversight system. The
Government tackled the problem o f domestic arrears. It established a settlement plan o f domestic arrears
and created a settlement structure so-called the CAADIE. The plan proved effective: CFAF 26 billion
were settled in 2001-02 out o f the total o f CFAF 295 billion at end 1999. On the structural front, progress
was made in the public enterprise reform: in 2001, SONITEL and SNE were privatized and the licenses

                                                       61
for mobile phone awarded. However, the privatization o f SONIDEP and NIGELEC encountered long
delays.

5. PublicExpenditureAdjustment Credit I(PEAC I,October 2001).

The Context and the Overall Objective

This adjustment operation was prepared in the context o f the elaboration o f Niger's PRSP. The program
o f reform supported by PEAC Iwas grounded in the I-PRSP elaborated in October 2001 and endorsed by
the Bank and the Fund. PEAC Iaimed at: (i)continuing the support to the Government's budgetary
management reform program; (ii)supporting its efforts to improve public expenditure allocations; (iii)
supporting the implementation o f key social sector and structural reforms. The program o f policies
underpinning PEAC I focused on efficient and equitable use o f public resources through the
implementation of public expenditure reforms, improving access and quality o f basic social service
delivery as well as privatizing State-owned enterprises and strengthening o f the regulatory and financial
environment for private sector-led growth.

The Outcomes

This credit outputs were broadly satisfactory. The first tranche was disbursed upon effectiveness in
December 2001. The second tranche was released in August 2002, after progress against tranche release
criteria had been judged as satisfactory. In 2001, real GDP grew by 7.1 percent owing to exceptional
rainfall, but fell to 3 percent in 2002. Inflation was stabilized at 4 percent in 2001 and 3 percent in 2002.
The current account deficit (excluding grants) declined from 7.5 percent to 6.7 percent in 2002, below the
target o f 8.6 percent. Although the fiscal stance strengthened, the bulk o f adjustment has heavily relied on
expenditure cuts. Revenue mobilization i s still very weak and Niger's has one o f the lowest revenue/GDP
ratio of 10.6 percent in 2002 in the WAEMU.

A number of budgetary management reforms took place. A new budget nomenclature was adopted
and a new Charter o f Accounts was introduced.           A new information technology was used for the
preparation o f the 2003 budget law. The 2002 and 2003 budgets reflected PRSP priorities, particularly in
key social sectors. However, many limitations existed, including: (i) continuation o f dual budgeting
                                                                          the
practice: (ii)the lack of full integration of the preparation o f the general budget and the investment
budget; (iii) the need for key actors of the budget preparation to fully master the new budget preparation
tools; and (iv) the need to develop program-budgets. At the budget execution level, the introduction o f the
FMIS led to a computerization of budgetary processes, formerly tailored to manual recording. The new
FMIS allows information to be available in real time from the Budget Directorates (responsible for
approving expenditure commitments and issuingpayment orders) and the Treasury (responsible for actual
payment and public accounting). Still, the FMIS i s not fully exploited and needs to be expanded. At the
Budget reporting level, budget review laws of 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 were adopted by the National
Assembly in December 2002. Closure of budgetary accounts o f 2001 was completed. The draft project of
the budget review law for FYOl was transmitted for adoption to the Government. The Supreme Court's
Audit Office (the Chamber of Accounts), which was dormant until2000, producedin2002, its first report
on budget execution for FY 1997.

Social sector reforms were also implemented in line with the prioritiesof the PRSP.Inthe education
sector, these reforms included the extension o f the contractual and decentralized recruitment o f primary
school teachers, support to double shift teaching. The draft law o f the reform o f teacher training program
was adopted by Parliament in November 2002. In the health sector, the Government launched a
decentralized contractual recruitment on a pilot basis. Operating costs o f the HIV/AIDS coordination unit
and expenditures to launch a household expenditure survey were included inthe Budget.

With regardto structural reforms, irreversible steps toward the privatizationo f SONITEL were a trigger
for the negotiation of PEAC I.This helped to bring SONITEL to the point o f sale in November 2001. In

                                                     62
the area o f financial sector, progress was made. The Banque Commerciale du Niger (BCN) was re-
capitalized and placed under the temporary management o f the BCEAO. An agreement was reached to
limit state contribution to the Banque IslamiqueduNiger pour le Commerce et 1'Investissement (BINCI).
However, the privatization o f Credit du Niger (CDN) did not occur. Many reforms were delayed. These
include: the actuarial audit o f the Caisse Nationale de SecuritC Sociale, the financial and organizational
audit o f micro finance institutions, the restructuring o f the postal branch o f the Office Nationale de la
Poste et de 1'Epargne (ONPE) and the creation o f a financial subsidiary o f ONPE.


6. PublicExpenditureAdjustment Credit I1(PEAC 11, October 2003).

The Overall Objective
PEAC I1was designed to help implement the Government's economic reform program during 2003-2004
and Niger's January 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) by supporting key policy measures
aiming at: (i)consolidating sound macroeconomic and financial policies; (ii)        strengthening the public
expenditure management reform program; and (iii)supporting the ongoing implementation o f key social
and structural reforms.

The Outcomes

This credit outputs havebeenbroadlysatisfactory. The first tranche was disburseduponeffectiveness
inDecember 2003. The second tranche was released inAugust 2004, after progress against tranche
release criteria had beenjudged as satisfactory. In2003, real GDP grew by 5.3 percent. Average inflation,
on a 12-month basis, fell from 4.0 at end-2001 to -1.8 percent in 2003. Fiscal performance was
satisfactory. The basic budget deficit declined to 2.0 percent o f GDP.

Public expenditure reforms have been strengthened. Budget formulation and programming has
continued to improved. A framework which delineates the budget preparation process, establishes the
sequence and dates of actions as well as the role and responsibilities o f all ministries, services and other
actors involved in the budget preparation process was established and used for the preparation o f Budget
Law 2005. The new budgetary tools put inplace in 2002, including the new budget nomenclature and the
new charter o f accounts were used successfully for preparing the 2004 and 2005 budget laws. Medium-
term expenditure framework and budget programs have been formulated in particular in key social
sectors, including education and health. Budget execution has been reinforced. The framework for a cash
allocation plan was strengthened to better integrate the execution o f government's expenditures and
identify allocations of government's resources to priority social and poverty alleviation sectors. However,
the execution o f the 2003 budget in social priority sectors, including health and education, was less
satisfactory than in 2002, reflecting mainly shortfalls in external assistance and over-programming o f the
investment budget in these sectors. Budget accountability, reporting and control has also been
strengthened. Budgetary accounts for FY2002 were closed. The budget execution law (Loi de Rbglement)
for FY2001 was submitted to the Chambre des Comptes o f the Supreme Court in July 2003. The new
modernized chart of accounts and the new code o f public accounting which enhance the transparency o f
public accounts are being used in the budgetary process. Although public procurement reform was slow,
under PEAC 11, progress was achieved through the issuance o f several decrees to implement the new
procurement code. The Government also prepared, in close collaboration with major donors involved in
budget support in Niger, a comprehensive action plan for reinforcing budgetary and public finance
management over the next three years (PEMFAR). Key priority measures were selected to strengthen
budgetary management inFY 2005.

Social sector reforms have progressed satisfactorily. In the education sector, PEAC I1 helped the
Government to continue implementing its 1O-year development plan for basic education. The major
policy actions undertaken under PEAC I1 included: (i)the hiring o f 3,702 new contractual teachers for
school year 2003-2004; (ii)  the implementation o f a pilot program for decentralized block grants; and (iii)
the buildingo f new classrooms, most o f which are in rural areas. Budgetary allocations for the education

sector were also increased in 2003. In the health sector, PEAC I1 supported the implementation o f the
"Strategic Orientations for Health Sector Development". Specific achievements included: (i)the
recruitment o f 490 additional health workers in 2003 and (ii)the adoption o f a plan to improve
availability o f essential drugs in rural health centers inJanuary 2004.

Structural and regulatory reforms have been less satisfactory. Although progress was made in
bringing SONIDEP to the point of sale, the transaction was not completed (See paragraph 36). Also,
NIGELEC still awaits privatization. With regard to regulatory reform, the multi-sectoral regulatory
agency (ARM) was established in late 2003 and is currently operational. However, issues related to
compensation for ARM staff are still pending a government decision.

INTRODUCTION

1.      L e Niger, pays sahClo saharien de 1 267 000 kilomktres carrCs, est peuplC de
10,790 millions d'habitants, selon l e recensement general de la population et de l'habitat
effectut en 2001. I1est confronte a de lourds handicaps naturels lies a l'ariditk croissante
du climat, a une forte pression demographique (3,3%) et a la faiblesse des ressources.
Situ6 au cOeur du continent, ilsouffre Cgalement de l'enclavement qui grkve le coat de
ses importations et de ses exportations car le port le plus proche est situ6 A plus de mille
kilombtres de Niamey. L a capitale et le pays ne disposent d'aucune infrastructure
ferroviaire.

2.      Enplus de ces donnees physiques peu favorables a l'expansion Cconomique et a
l'amklioration du niveau de vie des populations, le Niger a connu au cours des dkennies
80 et 90, une strie de chocs economiques et sociopolitiques (effondrement du marche de
l'uranium, crise de la dette, informalisation croissante de l'kconomie, rebellions armees,
coups d'etat militaires,      greves,   etc.) qui ont contribuk      a l'extension et      a
l'approfondissement accderts de la pauvrete.

3.      Pour faire face a cette situation, plusieurs programmes d'ajustement et de
stabilisation furent mis en euvre depuis 1982 avec des resultats mitiges dus
essentiellement au contexte sociopolitique peu favorable a la mise en Oeuvre de rkformes
structurelles. Armees de volontk politique, les Autorites de la Cinquikme RCpublique,
ont depuis leur installation en 1999 apres des elections libres et transparentes, mis en
Oeuvre en accord avec les partenaires au dkveloppement, un Programme triennal 2000-
2003 appuye par la Facilite pour la Reduction de la Pauvrete et la Croissance (FRPC) du
FMIet des credits d'ajustement successifs soutenus par la Banque Mondiale.

4.      L a mise en Oeuvre satisfaisante de ce programme de rkformes a permis de reduire
sensiblement les deskquilibres internes et extemes de l'economie.

5.      Enoutre, le Niger avec l'appui des Institutions de Bretton Woods et de ses autres
partenaires, a adopte et mis en Oeuvre une StratCgie de Reduction de la Pauvret6 que les
institutions nationales et l'ensemble de la communaute intemationale considerent
desormais comme le cadre de reference dont doivent s'inspirer les politiques
macroeconomiques et sectorielles du pays et les interventions de ses partenaires.

6.       Au vu des rksultats obtenus et de la feme determination des Autorites a
poursuivre les rkformes engagkes, les partenaires au developpement du pays ont convenu
de conceder au Niger unallegement de la dette extirieure dans le cadre de 1'Initiative en
faveur des Pays Pauvres Tres EndettCs (PPTE). L e Niger a atteint le point d'achkvement
de l'hitiative PPTE le 12 avril 2004. A ce titre, ilbCnCficie de mesures gknkreuses
d'allegement de sa dette dont les produits sont entikrement affect& a la rCduction de l a
pauvretk et au developpement des secteurs sociaux prioritaires, dans le cadre d'activitks
financees notamment par le Programme SpCcial du President de la RCpublique.




                                                                                            1

7.       Cependant, en dkpit des progrbs rkalisks, des rkformes-clks restent A mettre en
Oeuvre pour atteindre une croissance kconomique plus Clevke et rkduire la pauvretk. De
plus, le Niger continue de faire face a des chocs exogknes importants, en particulier les
fortes fluctuations des conditions pluviomktriques. Dans un tel contexte, il faut
nkcessairement plus de temps, plus de capacitks humaines et matkrielles judicieusement
utiliskes et plus de coordination entre les diffkrentes parties impliqukes pour espkrer
enregistrer des rksultats durables en matikre de dkveloppement. D'autres facteurs seront
kgalement nkcessaires pour gagner la bataille contre la pauvretk. I1s'agit notamment : (i)
une plus grande adhksion non seulement de l'klite mais aussi de l'ensemble des
travailleurs et de la population aux rkformes ; (ii)  les rkformes doivent Ctre considkrkes
comme un tout et &re mises en Oeuvre de manikre harmoniske et ordonnke ; (iii)l e
soutien des partenaires doit continuer aussi bien en termes de ressources financikres plus
importantes qu'en termes d'assistance technique dans les domaines ou des insuffisances
de capacitks ont ktk identifikes.

8.       Aprks tant d'annkes d'efforts et de rkformes, les dkfis que le Niger doit relever
sont encore importants. I1 s'agit en effet de : (i)accklkrer la croissance kconomique et
relever son niveau pour espkrer rkduire la pauvretk de manikre significative. ;(ii)   crker
des emplois par une politique de diversification de l'kconomie, la crkation d'un cadre
juridique et institutionnel propice au dkveloppement du secteur privk ; (iii)rkduire la
pauvretk devenue un phknomkne endkmique ; (iv) appliquer les rkformes structurelles-
clks permettant d'obtenir des performances budgktaires solides et soutenues par un
renforcement considerable de l'effort d'ajustement budgktaire, la mise en place d'un
systkme d'intermkdiation        financikre plus efficient pour favoriser l'kpargne       et
l'investissement ainsi que l'expansion d'un rkseau d'institutions de micro finance opkrant
sur des bases financikres saines.

9.       L a prksente lettre de politique de dkveloppement est une traduction du Programme
Economique et Financier 2005-2007 dans le domaine de la gestion des dkpenses
publiques et la rkduction de la pauvretk. Elle est essentiellement bade sur le Plan
d'Actions Prioritaires issu de l'exercice PEMFAR qui s'est ktalk de Novembre 2003
(mission principale) a Fkvrier 2005 (adoption par le Gouvernement du rapport final).

10.     Les quatre demibres annkes ont et6 marquees par des reformes politiques et
kconomiques intenses qui ont donnk des rksultats trbs positifs, en dkpit de problkmes
causks soit par un environnement regional et international difficile (crise politique en
CBte d'Ivoire et hausse des prix du petrole), soit en 2004 par des conditions climatiques
trbs dkfavorables.

11.     Sur le plan politique, aprbs la pkriode d'instabilitk qui a prkvalu sur la periode
1996-1999, les elections democratiques, libres et transparentes de la fin 1999 ont permis
de renouer avec la stabilitk politique et sociale. L e Gouvemement issu de ces klections, a
depuis lors su maintenir le climat sociopolitique serein existant dans le pays depuis
l'arrivke du Prksident Tandja au pouvoir. Cela a ktk rendupossible grace a un dialogue
permanent entre les Autorites, l'ensemble de la classe politique et les partenaires sociaux,
le paiement regulier des salaires a terme kchu et la poursuite de l'apurement des arrieres
antkrieurement accumules. Les actions du Programme Spkcial du Prksident de la
Rkpublique qui bknkficient directement aux couches les plus pauvres de la population ont
kgalement contribuk       prkserver ce bon climat social. Ainsi, le premier mandat du
President Mamadou Tandja a permis de consolider les institutions dkmocratiques du
pays, comme l'ont prouvk les conditions dans lesquelles se sont dkroulkes les elections
locales, presidentielles et lkgislatives de 2004, organiskes selon des mkthodes que les
observateurs nationaux et intemationaux ont jugkes totalement conformes aux principes
dkmocratiques.

12.     Sur le plan kconomique, la politique du Gouvemement a permis de relancer la
croissance et de restaurer la discipline budgktaire aprbs de nombreuses annkes de
stagnation kconomique et de dkficits budgktaires financks par l'accumulation d'amerks
intkrieurs et exterieurs. Les donnees prkliminaires disponibles indiquent que la
performance macroeconomique en 2004 devrait etre moins satisfaisante que prkvue.
L'activitk kconomique serait moins vigoureuse, dans un contexte domink par la
skcheresse, des attaques acridiennes au Sahel et par la remontke des cours mondiaux des
produits petroliers. L e taux de croissance devrait etre limite a 0,9% (contre une prevision
initiale de 4,1%), en raison principalement d'une forte baisse de la production agricole
que la bonne tenue d'autres secteurs n'a pu compenser, y compris celui de l'or dont les
activitks ont ktk lanckes en 2004. L'inflation s'est etablie a 3,7% en dkcembre 2004, en
glissement annuel et 0'2% en moyenne. Le deficit du solde extkrieur courant (excluant les
transferts courants) devrait legbrement s'amkliorer pour s'ktablir a environ 7'3%
(compark    7,6% en 2003) en raison des nouvelles exportations de l'or et de la baisse des
paiements au titre d'intCrCts sur la dette extkrieure, like a 1'Initiative PPTE. L e Niger a
contribuk positivement aux reserves extkrieures de la BCEAO grace notamment aux
financements concessionnels et aux allkgements de dette obtenus.

                                              73



 13. Dans le domaine des finances publiques, le Gouvemement a mis en ceuvre les
 mesures nkcessaires permettant d'atteindre ses objectifs budgktaires rkvises au titre de

 prevision de 171,8 milliards de FCFA, kquivalent A 10,5% du PIB, grace a des efforts
 l'exercice 2004. Au niveau des recettes, les rkalisations se seraient situkes au niveau de la

 soutenus de renforcement de l'administration fiscale et douaniere qui ont permis de
 contenir l'impact nkgatif des fermetures rkpetees de la frontikre avec le Nigeria. A fin
 Octobre 2004, les dkpenses totales ont atteint pres de 80% du total programmk pour
 l'ensemble de 1'annCe ; elles devraient des lors Ctre contenues dans la limite de 18,6 %
 retenue pour 2004. Ainsi, le solde budgetaire de base et le solde budgktaire global (hors
 dons, base engagement) ne devraient pas dkpasser les previsions annuelles. En tenant
 compte de la reduction equivalant a 1,l % du PIB du montant des arriCrCs intkrieurs nets,
 le besoin total de financement de l'Etat s'kleverait ti 8,8% du PIB, et serait presque
 entibrement couvert par des ressources extkrieures.


  14. L e Gouvemement a poursuivi la mise en ceuvre des mesures d'amklioration de la
 gestion budgetaire. Ainsi, des cadres de dkpenses a moyen terme (CDMT) pour les
 secteurs de la santk et de l'education ont kte finalisks au cours du deuxieme trimestre
 2004 et utilises dans la prkparation du budget de l'Etat pour l'exercice 2005. L e
 Gouvemement a par ailleurs debut6 la mise en euvre des mesures identifikes par la revue
 des depenses publiques, effectuee dans le cadre de l'exercice PEMFAR (Public
 Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review) avec l'assistance de la Banque
 mondiale et de 1'Union Europkenne.

  15. Sur le plan monetaire, les avoirs interieurs nets du systkme bancaire au cours du
 premier semestre 2004 ont augmente de 21% par rapport a la masse monktaire en debut
. depkriode, en liaison avec unedkgradationde laPositionNette duGouvemement (PNG).
  Celle-ci s'est cependant sensiblement amklioree au second semestre ; et le crkdit a
  l'kconomie s'est renforce, augmentant de pres de 4% en 2004.

  L a sante financiere des banques est demeuree globalement satisfaisante.

  16. Dans le domaine des rkformes structurelles, la privatisation des compagnies
  d'electricitk (NIGELEC) et de distribution de produits pktroliers (SONIDEP), ainsi que
  la mise en ceuvre de l'agenda de reformes prevues dans le secteur financier n'ont pu etre
  achevkes. Toutefois, les Autorites ont lanck un nouvel appel d'offres en 2004, qui a
  abouti a la cession de 6,9 % du capital de la SONIDEP a des distributeurs pktroliers du
  secteur prive national. Pour ce qui est de la privatisation de NIGELEC, l'investisseur
  potentiel, la Nigerian Electrical Power Authority (NEPA), a continue A faire face a de
  graves difficultks financieres. Les rkformes relatives au CDN, a la CPCT et a 1'ONPE
  n'ont pas abouti au cours de l'annke 2004, en raison de retards dans la mise en place,
  avec l'appui technique et financier de la Banque mondiale, de 1'Unitk de Gestion de ces
  rkformes.

  17. Sur le plan social, des efforts considerables ont ktC entrepris pour amkliorer l'accbs de
  la population @lus particulierement des pauvres et des groupes vulnkrables) aux services
  sociaux de base.


                                                                                             4

                                              74



18. Les rksultats obtenus sont particulierement remarquables dans le secteur de
l'education. L e taux de scolarisationprimaire (infkrieur a 30% au dkbut des annkes 1990)
atteignait dkja pres de 42% en 2001-2002. I1 a continuk de progresser au cours des trois
demieres annkes pour atteindre 55% en 2004.

19. Cette amklioration du taux de scolarisation primaire a ktk accompagnke par une
augmentation du pourcentage de filles (40% en 2004). L a scolarisation des filles est en
effet un objectif essentiel de la StratCgie de Rkduction de la Pauvretk. Des rksultats
kgalement significatifs ont ktk enregistrks dans le secteur de la santk. Grice a la
construction et a la rkhabilitation de formations sanitaires, le taux de couverture
(pourcentage d'habitants ayant acces a un centre de santk situk a moins de 5 Km) est
passk de 47.6% en 2000 A 49.8% en 2003. Meme s i la plupart des indicateurs de santk
(notamment les taux de mortalitk matemelle) sont panni les plus bas du monde, des
progres sensibles ont ktk rkalists en matibre de programmes de vaccination et            de
rkduction des taux de mortalitk infantile et juvknile.

20. L e Programme Spkcial du Prksident de la Rkpublique a jouk un r61e capital dans le
financement du dkveloppement rural, des secteurs sociaux et d'autres activitks prioritaires
pour la reduction de la pauvretk. Outre des puits, des petits barrages et un grand nombre
de petits projets agricoles et d'irrigation, le programme a financk des ecoles et des salles
de classe et des centres de santk. I1 a kgalement permis l'augmentation du nombre
d'enseignants du primaire en finanqant les salaires de contractuels dont le recrutement a
rendupossible laprogressionacceleree dutaux de scolarisation.

21.     Malgrk l'importance des rkformes entreprises et des rksultats obtenus, le
Gouvernement est conscient qu'il est encore trbs loin d'atteindre les Objectifs de
Dkveloppement du Millknaire (ODM) et les objectifs a long tenne de sa Strategie de
Reduction de la Pauvretk. Dans un pays oh le taux de croissance demographique dkpasse
3%, des taux de croissance kconomique moyens de 4 a 5% sont encore insuffisants pour
rkduire la pauvretk de faqon significative pendant la prksente dkcennie et faciliter une
amklioration progressive du revenu des mknages. Le secteur agricole (de loin le principal
employeur de la population active), reste tres vulnkrable aux caprices du climat.
L'augmentation du taux de scolarisation doit &re accompagnke par des efforts
substantiels pour ameliorer la qualitk de l'enseignement et les progrbs rkalises sur le plan
de l'amklioration des taux de couverture sanitaire doivent etre completks par une
amklioration de la qualitk des services et une nette augmentation des taux d'utilisation. L e
nouveau Gouvernement qui vient d'etre form6 par le President Tandja se fixe donc
comme principal objectif de sa politique la poursuite et l'accelkration des programmes de
rkformes engagks par le prkckdent Gouvemement au cours de la pkriode 2000-2004 dans
le cadre de la prksente lettre de politique de dkveloppement.

11.Contexte:Larkformedela gestiondesfinances publiquesauceur du
Programme

22.     L a rkforme de la gestion des finances publiques est l'un des principaux
instruments de la politique kconomique et sociale du Gouvemement et de la Stratkgie de
Rkduction de la Pauvretk. En effet, dans un pays oh les recettes publiques dkpassent A
peine 10% du PIB et oh l'aide extkrieure est importante, mais volatile, c'est l'efficacitk
de la depense publique qui permettra de progresser vers l'accomplissement des objectifs
de croissance kconomique, de dkveloppement social et de rkduction de la pauvrete. Dans
ce domaine, des rksultats importants ont Ctk obtenus, tant au stade de la preparation du
budget qu'8 celui de l'exkcution et du suivi des dkpenses.

23.     En ce qui conceme la prkparation du budget, les principales mesures ont CtC
l'adoption d'une nouvelle nomenclature budgktaire, la rkforme du calendrier et des
methodes de preparation du budget et la formulation par certains Ministbres clks de
cadres de dkpenses A moyen terme et de budgets programmes pluriannuels. L'adoption et
la mise en place d'une nouvelle nomenclature budgktaire et d'un plan comptable basks
sur les directives de 1'UEMOA facilitent une analyse plus transparente des programmes
de dkpenses et des rksultats budgktaires sur la base de standards internationaux.
Dksormais, les budgets soumis A 1'Assemblke Nationale tentent de consolider les
previsions de dkpenses courantes et de dkpenses d'investissements, mCme quand celles-ci
sont financees par des bailleurs de fonds. L a reforme du calendrier budgetake a pour but
de mieux impliquer les Ministkres techniques dans les choix budgktaires concernant leurs

(notamment dans les secteurs sociaux), vise a encourager les Ministkres concemks a
secteurs. Enfin, la preparation de CDMT sectoriels et de budgets programmes

optimiser leurs propositions de depenses sur la base d'une vision stratkgique de leurs
priorites.

24.     En ce qui conceme l'execution et le suivi du budget et le contr6le des dkpenses
publiques, les principales reformes ont et6 l'introduction progressive d'un systeme
informatise de gestion financikre, la mise en place de mecanismes de rkgulation
budgetake et de plans de Trksorerie, l'exkcution d'un plan d'apurement des arrikrks
interieurs, la preparation et l'adoption de lois de reglement, le renforcement progressif du
contr6le financier et la transformation de la Chambre des Comptes en Cour des Comptes
independante.

25.     L'informatisation progressive de la gestion et de l'information financibre est
pleine de promesse. A ce stade, elle permet surtout A la Direction GCnkrale du Budget de
suivre en temps reel l'engagement et l'ordonnancement des dkpenses.

26.     L e principal objectif de la rkgulation budgktaire et des plans de trksorerie est de
prkvenir l'accumulation d'anikrks intkrieurs en limitant les engagements et les paiements
en fonction des ressources disponibles. Depuis 2004, le systeme est aussi utilisk pour
proteger les activitks les plus essentielles, notamment les depenses des secteurs
prioritaires pour la rkduction de la pauvretk.




                                                                                           6

  paiements sans ordonnancement prealable (PSOP), qui ne sont pas soumis au contrble des
  contrbleurs financiers et Cchappent a la rkgulation budgktaire. En 2004, l e recours aux
  PSOP a considkrablement diminuk.

  28.     Unplan d'apurement des arriCrCs intkrieurs a CtC lance en2000. Dans le cadre de
  ce plan, la dette intkrieure du Gouvemement a et6 rkduite de plus de 70 milliards de
  FCFA de 2001 A 2004.

  29.
  exercice a fait l'objet d'une reconciliation grice a la preparation d'une L o i de Rkglement
          En 2000, pour la premikre fois depuis quinze ans, la totalite du budget d'un

  et a la soumission d'un compte de gestion A la Cour des Comptes. Depuis cette date,       l e
  Ministere de 1'Economie et des Finances s'efforce de rkduire les retards dans la
  production des Lois de Rkglement. Ainsi, le projet de L o i de Rkglement pour l'exercice
  2002 a Cte adopt6 par 1'Assemblke Nationale.

  30.     La Direction du Contrble Financier a entrepris un programme systkmatique de
  formation de ses contrbleurs pour mieux les prkparer aux nouvelles responsabilitks qui les
  attendent dans le cadre d'une delegation progressive de l'ordonnancement aux Ministkres
  techniques. Un amendement a la Constitution a transform6 la Chambre des Comptes en
  Cour des Comptes, dont l'independance sera officialisee quand sera adopt6 un projet de
  L o i Organique sur le fonctionnement de cette institution.

  31.     En outre, ilconvient de noter les directives du ministkre de 1'Economie et des
. Finances pour accklerer le rkglement des crkdits dkleguks et la crkation d'un comitt
  charge de trouver des solutions adequates au problkme des balances du TrCsor

  32.     L e Gouvemement considere que la reforme de la gestion des finances publiques
  est de la plus grande importance pour l'avenir economique et le dkveloppement social du
  pays. C'est aussi une Oeuvre de longue haleine, qui nkcessitera des efforts continus des
  Autorites Nigkriennes avec l'appui de la communautk intemationale. L a poursuite de
  cette reforme est au centre de programme de reforme des dkpenses publiques pour la
  periode 2005-06, pour lequel le Niger a demand6 l'appui financier de la Banque
  Mondiale.




                                                                                              7

111.Principalesorientationsdu programmederiformes

33.     Le Niger reste confront6 a des contraintes sociokconomiques majeures, se
traduisant par l a prevalence de conditions de vie pr6caires pour la grande majoritk de la
population. L e Gouvernement entend mettre en Oeuvre les politiques et mesures
nkcessaires pour lever progressivement ces contraintes, dans le cadre de la poursuite des
objectifs de rkduction de la pauvretk qu'il s'est fixes pour le moyen terme. Dans cette
perspective, les efforts de mobilisation des recettes publiques seront renforcks et le
Gouvemement veillera a assurer une reorientation des dkpenses publiques vers les
infrastructures et les secteurs prioritaires de la santk, de l'kducation et du developpement
rural.

34.     Telle que dkfinie dans le DSRP, le Niger a une strategic de croissance axke sur le
renforcement, tire par le secteur priv6, de l'activitk dans les secteurs de l'agriculture et de
l'klevage, du tourisme, des services et des mines. Ces secteurs ont CtC identifies comme
posskdant un fort potentiel de croissance. Dans ce contexte, le Gouvemement entend
renforcer son programme de securite alimentaire et developper des activites generatrices
de revenus, notamment par des projets finances par 1'IDA dans les domaines des services
de vulgarisation, de la recherche agronomique et de petits projets privCs d'irrigation. Pour
redynamiser le tourisme, l'administration compte entreprendre des actions de promotion
de la destination Niger. Dans ce cadre, le Gouvemement s'assurera de la fluiditk des
conditions de passage aux postes frontaliers et aidera a l'amklioration de l'infrastructure
et des installations hbtelibres existantes. Parmi les initiatives envisagees, ilfaut relever les
suivantes : (i)developpement de deux nouveaux sites touristiques le long du fleuve
Niger ;(ii)remise en Ctat de certains etablissements hbteliers ; et (iii)  initiation d'actions
de promotion du Festival International de la Mode Afi-icaine (FIMA). SimultanCment, des
efforts sont entrepris pour diversifier la production minibre au-del& de l'uranium et de
l'or, par l'intensification des activites de prospection pktrolibre et de recherche d'autres
minkraux. Ces initiatives devraient favoriser une plus grande implication des opkrateurs
prives dans la dynamisation des secteurs economiques cles evoques ci-dessus, se
traduisant par la creation d'emplois remunkrateurs.

35.     Objectvs macroe`conomiques du programme. Les objectifs macrokconomiques
pour 2005-07 sont de : i)realiser une croissance rkelle moyenne du PIE3 d'au moins 4 %
par an, afin d'accroitre le revenu par habitant de plus de 1%par an; ii)maintenir le taux
annuel d'inflation au-dessous du seuil de 1'UEMOA qui est de 3%; et iii)rkduire le
deficit du solde exterieur courant (transferts officiels exclus) pour le porter de 7,3% du
PIB en 2004 a 6'3 YOen 2007.

36.     Envue de realiser ces objectifs, le Gouvemement est determinea mettre en Oeuvre
des mesures ambitieuses de mobilisation des recettes et de mener une gestion prudente
des dkpenses, en veillant A maintenir l'alignement des dkpenses sociales sur les objectifs
duDSRP.

37.     Les mesures de mobilisation des recettes intkrieures porteront sur la reforme du
systkme fiscal et l'amklioration de l'administration fiscale et douanikre, dans une
perspective d'elargissement de l'assiette fiscale et d'amklioration de la performance des


                                                                                               8

                                               78



 rkgies financikres. Ces mesures devraient permettre de porter progressivement le taux
 d'imposition a environ 12,1% du PIB en 2007, a partir d'un niveau estime a 10'5% en
 2004.

 38.     L e Gouvemement veillera A amkliorer la hikrarchisation des dkpenses publiques,
 conformkment au DSRP. Pour atteindre cet objectif, il entend mettre rapidement en
 Oeuvre les recommandations des ktudes recemment realiskes sur la gestion des finances et
 des dkpenses publiques avec l'appui technique du FMI, de la Banque mondiale et de
 1'Union Europkenne.

 39.     En effet, avec l'appui de la communautk intemationale, notamment la Banque
 Mondiale et 1'Union Europkenne, et sur la base de consultations avec les reprksentants du
 secteur public, du secteur privk et de la sociktk civile, le Gouvemement a entrepris en
 2003-2004 une analyse critique de la gestion des dkpenses publiques, qui a abouti            la
 production du rapport PEMFAR et a l'adoption d'un plan d'actions prioritaires. L e
 rapport PEMFAR est maintenant considkrk par le Gouvemement et ses partenaires
 comme la base commune de leurs politiques et de leurs interventions futures dans cet
 important domaine. Dans le cadre du diagnostic et des recommandations de PEMFAR, le
 Gouvemement va donner la prioritk a un ensemble de mesures qui visent a amkliorer la
 programmation, l'exkcution et le suivi du budget, a rendre plus transparents les comptes
 publics, a amkliorer la gestion de la dette et a renforcer les contrbles intemes et extemes.

 40.     En ce qui concerne la pre`paration du budget, en dkpit de la rkforme des
 methodes et du calendrier de sa prkparation, les Ministeres techniques n e disposent pas
'encore du temps et des moyens nkcessaires pour optimiser leurs propositions budgktaires
 en fonction des prioritks stratkgiques de leurs secteurs. L e Gouvemement prendra donc
 un certain nombre de mesures destinkes a mieux organiser la participation de ces
 Ministkres au processus de programmation budgktaire. I1 s'agira notamment : (i)
 d'amkliorer le contenu de la note de cadrage ; (ii)de mieux consulter les Ministkres
 techniques avant la mise au point de la lettre-plafond ; (iii)   d'encourager les Ministkres
 clks a mieux dkfinir leurs priorites, dans le cadre de strategies sectorielles, de C D M T et
 de budgets programmes cohkrents et rkalistes ; et enfin (iv) de poursuivre l'intkgration
 des dkpenses courantes et d'investissements, quelle que soit la source de financement.

 a) Amilioration du contenu de la note de cadrage. I1 est essentiel que les Ministeres
 techniques puissent initier trks tBt leurs rkflexions sur les prioritks de leurs programmes
 de dkpenses. L'un des moyens de rkaliser cet objectif est d'amkliorer le contenu de la
 note de cadrage, par laquelle le Ministere de 1'Economie et des Finances lance le
 processus de prkparation du budget. Cette note devrait donner des indications plus
 completes sur les perspectives kconomiques et financikres du pays, permettant ainsi aux
 Ministeres techniques d'initier la prkparation de propositions budgktaires dktaillkes sur la
 base de trois scenarii. A cet effet, la note de cadrage sur laquelle repose la lettre circulaire
 sera progressivement baske sur les rksultats de discussions prkliminaires avec les
 ministeres dkpensiers selon un processus qui sera declenchk dans le cadre de la
 preparation de la loi de finances 2006 a partir d'une expkrience pilote concemant deux
 ministeres (Education et Santk). Ces demiers entreprendront une rkflexion portant sur



                                                                                                9

                                              79



trois scenarii dont les principales conclusions seront prises en compte pour enrichir l a
note de cadrage.

b) Consultation des Ministeres techniques avant l a preparation de la lettre-plafond. C'est
la lettre-plafond qui fixe les enveloppes budgetaires de chaque ministere. Aujourd'hui,
cette lettre plafond est prtparee par le Ministere de 1'Economie et des Finances sans
discussions prkalables approfondies avec les Ministeres techniques. Desormais, l e
Ministere de 1'Economie et des Finances consultera plus Ctroitement les Ministbres
techniques avant d'entamer la preparation de l a lettre-plafond. I1 organisera a cette fin
une serie de conferences entre l a Direction GCnerale du Budget et ces Ministbres. L a
lettre-plafond pourra donc tenir compte des observations des ministeres, pour autant que
ceux-ci auront deja reflkchi aux priorites de leurs programmes de depenses sur l a base de
scenarios rkalistes. A partir de l a L o i de Finances 2006, cette lettre precisera le montant
des ressources PPTE A allouer a chaque ministere sectoriel.

c) Prkparatiodmise A iour par les ministeres clks de strategies sectorielles detaillees et de
CDMT et de budgets programmes cohtrents visant A optimiser leurs programmes de
depenses. Disposant de plus de temps pour preparer leurs propositions, les ministkes cles
seront plus capables d'integrer les rksultats de leurs reflexions stratkgiques dans l a
conception et l a justification de leurs propositions budgetaires.           CombinCe avec
l'amelioration graduelle mais continue de leurs CDMT et de leurs budgets programmes,
cette mesure facilitera l'hannonisation progressive de ces CDMThudgets programmes
avec les grandes orientations des budgets des ministkes. Pour accelerer ce processus, il
est necessaire d'apporter des appuis techniques et financiers aux ministeres techniques
(qui sont concemks par les CDMT), notamment en matiere de formation permanente sur
le CDMT, d'kquipement informatique, de collecte et de traitement d'informations. A cet
effet, l e Gouvemement sollicitera un appui des partenaires au developpement.

d) Meilleure coordinatiodintewation des dtpenses courantes et des investissements dans
les programmes et les budgets des Ministeres techniques. M e m e s i l a presentation de l a
L o i de Finances integre tous les types de depenses, quelle que soit l a source de
financement, les propositions budgetaires des Ministkes refletent encore l a structure des
budgets classiques. L a preparation des budgets des Ministeres n'est d'ailleurs pas
unifiee : elle &mane de deux directions distinctes, les Directions des Affaires
Administratives et Financieres (DAAF), qui s'interessent surtout aux depenses courantes,
et les Directions des Etudes et de l a Programmation (DEP), dont l a principale fonction est
de programmer les depenses d'investissement. En vue d'ameliorer la coordination dans l a
preparation du budget, les DEP et les DAAF seront renforcees l a oh elles existent et
creees dans les Ministkes Techniques qui e n sont depourvus. En outre, tous les
Ministeres Techniques seront encourages a privilegier le travail en equipe dans le cadre
de l'klaboration des propositions et arbitrages budgetaires.

41.      En ce qui concerne I'exkcution du budget, les principaux objectifs du
Gouvernement seront de renforcer les mecanismes de regulation budgetaire et les plans
de tresorerie, de rkduire l'emploi des procedures exceptionnelles et de poursuivre
l'extension du systbme informatis6 de gestion financiere aux Ministeres techniques, aux



                                                                                            10

                                            80



autres dkpartements du ministkre de 1'Economie et des Finances et aux collectivitks
decentralisees.

a) Regulation budgktaire et plans de tresorerie. L a regulation budgetaire et les plans de
trksorerie ont deux butsprincipaux : Cviter la creation de nouveaux arrikres et proteger les
,activites essentielles, notamment les depenses des secteurs prioritaires pour la reduction
de la pauvrett. En2004, les deux mecanismes ont permis de limiter la creation d'arrikrks
et ont effectivement protege certaines activitks prioritaires. Nkanmoins le systeme a
fonctionnk de fagon imparfaite et, sur la base de cette experience, les ameliorations
suivantes paraissent desirables : (i)I1 s'agit tout d'abord d'une participation plus active
des Ministkres techniques a la conception et la mise en oeuvre de ces mkcanismes.

I1 convient d'encourager les Ministkres techniques a rkflkchir le plutbt possible aux
catkgories de depenses qui mkritent une protection sptciale pour atteindre les objectifs
strategiques du ministhe. Ceux-ci peuvent le faire notamment a l'occasion de la
preparation de leurs CDMT et de leurs budgets-programmes. I1s'agit ensuite d'organiser
des consultations entre le ministere de 1'Economie et des Finances et les Ministkes
prioritaires avant de soumettre les plans de regulation budgetaire au Conseil des ministres
(en particulier pour tenir compte de la saisonnalite de certaines depenses). I1 s'agit enfin
de mettre en place unsuivi plus attentif de l'execution des plans trimestriels de regulation
budgktaire et des plans hebdomadaires de trksorerie pour vkrifier qu'elle est conforme
aux objectifs prioritaires qui ont inspire ces plans. Les instruments de ce suivi seront
d'une part, l'informatisation des plans de tresorerie (sur la base des donnees des
applications de gestion des recettes et des depenses), et d'autre part, la diffusion
mensuelle aux Ministkres techniques d'un rapport sur les previsions et executions de
tresorerie. L a definition d'une liste unique des depenses de reduction de la pauvretk (qui
englobent les depenses PPTE et les dkpenses du plan de trksorerie), actuellement en cours
 au niveau du Ministkre de 1'Economie et des Finances, contribuera significativement a la
resolution de l'ensemble des questions prkcitees. Dans l'immediat, a partir de l'execution
 du budget 2005, le Ministrede 1'Economie et des Finances instituera par lettre circulaire,
unmecanisme tendant         impliquer davantage les Ministeres depensiers dans le processus
 de conception, d'arbitrage et de suivi du plan de tresorerie. Cette circulaire qui
 interviendra au plus tard a la fin du mois de mars 2005, fera en conskquence obligation
 aux Ministeres techniques d'envoyer periodiquement au Ministhe de 1'Economie et des
 Finances, des rapports d'extcution des. plans de tresorerie trimestrielle et annuelle qu'ils
 auront contribue a mettre en place.

 b) Procedures exceptionnelles. En 2003, des retards dans l'approbation du budget par
 1'Assemblke Nationale ont contraint le Gouvemement a appliquer des procedures
 exceptionnelles, notamment des paiements sans ordonnancement prealable (PSOP), qui
 ne sont pas soumis au contrble des contrbleurs financiers et kchappent A la regulation
 budgetaire. En2004, le recours aux PSOP a considkrablement diminue.

 L e Gouvemement s'engage a limiter l'utilisation des PSOP aux seules situations
 exceptionnelles prkvues par la loi et a proceder systematiquement aux rkgularisations y

prioriti. Les deux mesures les plus urgentes a mettre en czuvre avec l'appui de la Banque
c) Informatisation. L'extension du systeme informatisC de gestion financibre est une

Africaine de Dkveloppement, sont de completer la liaison Budget TrCsor (notamment la
liaison retour sans laquelle la direction gCnCrale du budget est incapable de suivre le
paiement effectif par le TrCsor des mandats Cmis par le budget) et d'initier la dkltgation
de. l'ordonnancement aux Ministeres techniques, g r k e notamment a l'installation et au
bon fonctionnement d'une salle informatique accessible aux administrateurs de cr6dits et
a leurs contr8leurs financiers. Dans le cadre du processus de dkentralisation et d'un
traitement plus efficace des crCdits dklkguks, il est egalement important d'achever
l'informatisation des paieries et d'initier celle des centres de sous ordonnancement. Enfin,
ilest essentiel que le systeme soit progressivement Ctendua toutes les directions du
ministere de 1'Economie et des Finances. C'est seulement de faqon progressive, au cours
des prochaines annees, que le Gouvemement sera en mesure d'achever le processus
d'informatisation de la chaine de la dCpense. I1va neanmoins demander a la Direction de
l'hformatique du Ministere de 1'Economie et des Finances et aux Ministeres et
Directions concemkes de definir unplanprecis pour la mise en Oeuvre de ce programme.

42.     En ce qui concerne la transparence des comptes, le rapport PEMFAR a identifie
plusieursrkformes qui sont indispensablespour amCliorer la qualitk et la transparence des
comptes publics.

a) L a plus urgente est d'achever les efforts entrepris pour rksoudre le probleme de
l'intkgration des soldes des exercices prkckdents dans les comptes du Trksor pour les
nouveaux exercices. L e comite Cree a cette fin a commence A examiner le probleme de
l'apurement des comptes des annees anterieures a 1996. L e Gouvemement va demander a
ce comite d'accelerer ses travaux. L e comite considere que le traitement des comptes
anterieurs a 1996 est unprealable a l'introduction des soldes dans les comptes actuels.

b) Une autre action tres importante a longterme est l'intkgration dans les comptes publics
des dkpenses financkes par les bailleurs de fonds. L a Direction Genkrale du Financement
(DGF) qui suit ces opkrations tente de systematiser la remontke de l'information sur
l'exkcution des projets via des releves de depenses dont le traitement comptable ne parait
pas realisable a ce stade. Notons en outre qu'il n'est pas possible d'achever cette
integration tant que les bailleurs de fonds ne donneront pas au Gouvemement dans des
delais raisonnables et sous une forme `appropriee les donnkes relatives a l'execution des
projets dont ils assurent la gestion directe. Avec l'aide de bailleurs de fonds volontaires,
le Gouvemement va mettre en place un groupe de travail DGF/DGB/Services comptables
qui sera charge d'examiner le moyen d'organiser la remontke des informations
comptables sur les dkpenses financCes sur ressources exterieures. L a circulation de
l'information sur les dkpenses financkes sur ressources exterieures et l'intkgration de ces
depenses dans les comptes publics seront grandement facilitees par l'extension future a la
DGFdu systeme informatise de gestion financiere.

43.     Pour la gestion de la dette, les rCformes envisagkes concement            a la fois
l'apurement des anieres interieurs et le suivi de la dette extkrieure.



                                                                                          12

                                             82




a) En depit de la mise en oeuvre progressive d'un plan d'apurement, la situation de la
dette intkrieure doit Ctre mise A iour. A cet effet, une compilation des recommandations

FMI a travers AFRITAC Ouest, ce qui pennettra de mettre a jour un nouveau plan
de toutes les etudes dans ce domaine est d'ores et dkja entreprise avec le concours du

d'apurement de la dette intkrieure.

b) Malar6 les allkgements obtenus dans le cadre de l'initiative PPTE, l'endettement
extkrieur du pays reste un probleme critique qui doit faire l'obiet d'une surveillance
attentive. Un nouveau logiciel de suivi de la dette extkrieure vient d'Ctre install6 a la
Direction de la Dette Publique (DDP) et ilest prCvud'installer des postes de travail sur ce
logiciel au sein de la Direction de 1'Ordonnancement et a la TrCsorerie. Cependant, le
systkme reste incomplet dans la mesure oh les tirages sur emprunts ne sont pas suivis de
manikre automatiske par la DDP, mais seulement via des fiches transmises par la DGF.
Pour ameliorer l'echange de donnkes entre la DGF et la DDP, unaccord sera conclu entre
les deux Directions prevoyant la communication immediate a la DDP des demandes de
retraits de fonds et des decaissements effectifs. L e Gouvemement va egalement etudier la
possibilite d'etendre A la DGF l'applicatif de gestion de la dette.

44.     En ce qui concerne le renforcement            des contr8les internes et externes,
l'instrument indispensable de la transparence de la gestion est le renforcement du
contr6le financier. I1convient kgalement de poursuivre la reforme des contr6les extemes,
notamment celle de la Chambre des Comptes.

a) L e contr6le financier est appele a iouer un r61e determinant dans la mise en place du
nouveau circuit de la depense qui accompagnera la creation de la salle informatique et
permettra la delegation progressive de l'ordonnancement aux Ministkres techniques. L a
Direction du Contrble Financier va poursuivre son programme de formation des
contr6leurs et va initier la prkparation d'un manuel de procedures.

b) La Chambre des Comptes a ktk transformee en Cour des Comptes. L e Gouvernement
va soumettre a nouveau a 1'AssemblCe Nationale le projet de loi organique pour la mise
en Oeuvre de la rkforme.

c) Enfin. le Gouvemement va effectivement definir et mettre en Oeuvre la rkforme des
contr6les intemes et extemes prevue dans l'audit realisk en 2003 avec l'appui de 1'Union
Europkenne.

45.      Un programme de dCpenses publiques au service de la lutte contre la
pauvretC

L a lutte contre la pauvrete est l'un des buts principaux de la reforme de la gestion des
dkpenses publiques. A cette fin le Gouvemement mettra en Oeuvre trois types de mesures :
(i) restructurationduprogrammededkpensespubliques;(ii) poursuitedesrkformes
    la                                                             la
engagies pour developper et ameliorer les services sociaux de base ; et (iii)   la mise en




                                                                                         13

                                             83



place de mesures et activitks pour le suivi et l'evaluation du DSRP, en particulier pour
amkliorer la disponibilitk et l'analyse des informations statistiques

46. En matiire de restructuration des dt`pensespubliques, les mesures detaillees pour
l'amklioration de la preparation, de l'exkution et du contrble budgetaire ont deja et6
expliquke ci-dessus. En outre, ilfaut souligner que la Loi de Finances approuvke par
1'Assemblee Nationale sous-estimait certaines ressources et n'accordait pas une priorit6
adequate aux services sociaux de base. L e collectif budgetaire qui vient d'ktre approuvC
par 1'Assemblke affecte prbs de 75%          des ressources supplkmentaires aux secteurs
prioritaires, notamment l'kducation de base, la santC, le dCv,eloppement rural, la
construction et l'entretien des routes.

47.     De`veloppement des services sociaux et amdioration de leur qualite`.

a) Education : Dans le cadre des futurs CDMT du secteur, l e Gouvemement va rkkvaluer
les besoins de financement et la structure des depenses, notamment 1'Cquilibre entre les
depenses courantes et les dipenses d'investissement. I1 continuera sa politique de
recrutement d'enseignants contractuels, qui a permis de rtduire de faqon substantielle les
coats unitaires et affectera pres de 50% des depenses du secteur A l'enseignement de base.
Enfin, il evaluera l'impact des dkpenses d'education (dans le cadre notamment de
l'enquete en cours auprbs des menages) ; il renforcera la formation des enseignants et
utilisera la carte scolaire pour une meilleure repartition gkographique des ecoles.

b) Santk. La croissance demographique est l'un des facteurs qui reduit l'efficacite des
actions entreprises pour rkduire la pauvrete. L e Gouvemement a donc l'intention de
definir et d'adopter une stratkgie coherente et efficace en matikre de santC reproductive et
de population. Des enquetes recentes montrent que le declin des taux d'utilisation
s'explique a la fois par le coat des services et par des problbmes de qualite. L e
Gouvemement va tvaluer sa politique de recouvrement des coats et son impact sur les
pauvres et les zones rurales. Les conclusions et recommandations de la dite Ctude feront
l'objet d'une analyse approfondie et concertee avant toute traduction en mesures de
politiques sanitaires. L e Gouvemement fera en sorte que la rkgulation budgetaire
encourage la consommation effective des credits affect& aux medicaments et aux
vaccins. I1va terminer la mise au point de la carte sanitaire pour faciliter une repartition
plus favorable aux pauvres des infrastructures et des services. Enfin, ildkfinira et mettra
en Oeuvre des programmes visant a encourager le dkploiement de personnel competent en
milieu rural et poursuivra les experiences entreprises pour decentraliser la programmation
et l'exkution des dkpenses. Dans ce cadre, iladoptera en 2005 les mesures ci-apres : (i)
organisation de concours de recrutement des contractuels de la santC au niveau regional et
etablissement des contrats y afferents entre les intiresses et les Autorites locales a l'instar
des pratiques en cours en la matiere dans le secteur de l'kducation; (ii)creation et
fixation de nouveaux postes budgetakes au niveau des zones presentant des deficits de
personnel de santC en cas de recrutement a la Fonction Publique. Ces deux mesures seront
adoptkes par des textes appropries. En particulier, un dCcret a CtC adopt6 pour fixer les
nouveaux postes de contractuels dans les regions, ce qui devrait contribuer a une
meilleure offre de services en zones rurales. I1 a et6 aussi convenu qu'une Ctude sera



                                                                                             14

                                                 84



  rkaliske sur les incitations qui peuvent &re mises en Oeuvre pour encourager l e personnel
  de santk a rester en zones rurales (certaines de ces incitations pourraient avoir une
  implication budgktaire.)

  c) L e Programme Special du Prksident de la Rkpublique : L'audit du Programme
  demand6 par le Gouvemement suggbre qu'une meilleure integration du,Programme
  Special et des actions des Ministeres sectoriels est nkcessaire, en particulier pour les
  quatre ministeres du Dkveloppement Rural. I1 a donc Cte convenu de rkaliser une ktude
  pour apprkcier la mise en valeur au niveau local des investissements de gestion des eaux
  (entre autres les mini-barrages, les seuils d'kpandage et les puits) rkalises par l e
  Programme Spkcial, et les actions complkmentaires qui devraient Ctre prises pour
  maximiser l'impact sur les populations de ces investissements par les ministeres
  concemks.     L'etude visera aussi a examiner comment une skrie de programmes pour
  l'instant gkrks par le Programme Spkcial peuvent Ctre transferks aux ministeres. Plus
  genkralement, les plans d'action de la Stratkgie du Dkveloppement Rural seront rkalisks
  de telle sorte qu'ils integrent les activitks et projets duProgramme Special.

  d) DeDenses de lutte contre la pauvretk : La definition d'une liste unique des depenses de
  rkduction de la pauvretk (qui pourrait englober les depenses PPTE et les dkpenses
  prioritaires protkgees dans le cadre du plan de trksorerie), est actuellement en cours au
  niveau du Ministere de 1'Economie et des Finances. Cette liste permettra de suivre de
  maniere plus adkquate l'evolution des depenses publiques prioritaires pour la mise en
  Oeuvre du DSRP.

  48. Renforcement du dispositif de gestion des fonds PPTE. L'utilisation des fonds
  PPTE dans le cadre du Programme Special du President a permis d'accelkrer la
. construction d'infrastructures prioritaires dans les secteurs de l'kducation, de la sante et
  du developpement rural. I1 convient cependant de renforcer la coordination de ce
  programme avec les interventions des Ministeres techniques concemks et d'impliquer
  davantage les bknkficiaires dans la selection des projets. L e renforcement du dispositif de
  gestion du Programme Special pour une meilleure integration des ressources
  d'allegement de la dette dans les stratkgies sectorielles pour la reduction de la pauvretk
  comportera en particulier trois aspects : (i)une plus grande implication des ministeres
  sectoriels dans la prkparation des investissements sous la coordination du Comitk en
  charge du Programme Spkcial, et dans l'exkcution de ces investissements sous la
   supervision stricte de ce mCme Comitk ; (ii)la prise en compte par les ministeres
   sectoriels des montants des ressources PPTE qui seront affectees aux secteurs dont ils ont
   la charge ;et (iii)l'association des ministeres sectoriels aux operations d'engagement des
   depenses financkes sur ressources PPTE qui concement leurs champs de competence.
   Les comites national, rkgionaux et sous-rkgionaux de pilotage du Programme Spkcial
   continueront ajouer un r61e essentiel de supervision, conseil et suivi du Programme sous
   l'autorite du President de la Rkpublique. Par ailleurs, il sera nkcessaire d'evaluer les
   implications des investissements realisks par le Programme Spkcial sur les besoins en
   dkpenses courantes essentielles pour ameliorer la qualitk des services offerts par les
   ministkres concemks, et de continuer les efforts pour s'assurer que les regles de passation
   des marches soient respectkes et que les ouvrages rkalisks aient la qualitk voulue.

49.      Renforcement des mCcanismes de suivi et d'Cvaluation de la StratCPie de
RCduction de la PauvretC et analyse de I'impact sur les pauvres de rCformes
structurelles en cours et envisaekes

L a revision de la Strategie de Reduction de la Pauvrete (prkvue pour 2006) et l'evaluation
continue de l'efficacite des politiques et des programmes du Gouvemement necessitent :
(i)le renforcement des services statistiques; (ii)le lancement d'un certain nombre
d'enquetes sur la pauvretk ; (iii)la mise en place de systemes permettant de suivre
l'implantation geographique de la depense publique ; (iv) une nomenclature budgetaire
permettant d'identifier les depenses de pauvretk. I1 convient en outre d'evaluer l'impact
sur les pauvres de certaines rkformes structurelles en cours (privatisation, refonte de la
fiscalite).

50.     Statistiques. Afin de renforcer les services statistiques, ilest nkcessaire de rendre

principaux responsables et la mise au point d'un plan a moyen terme comportant
operationnel 1'Institut National de la Statistique par notamment la nomination de ses

notamment l'amelioration des donnkes de base de la comptabilitk nationale et
l'organisation periodique d'enquktes       auprks des menages. Dans ce cadre, le
Gouvemement a mis en Oeuvre les mesuresnominatives necessaires.

51.      EnquZtes spkcifiques. En 2005, le Gouvernement a lance 1'enquCte nationale

permettent a certaines familles d'echapper a la pauvrete. L'enquCte participative visera a
QUIBB et il completera cette enquCte par une analyse qualitative des facteurs qui

comprendre les facteurs qui aident les menages a Cmerger de la pauvretk et a arriver a une
evaluation qualitative des actions menkes depuis trois ans dans le cadre de la mise en
Oeuvre du DSRP (sachant que 1'enquCte QUIBB devrait foumir la base d'une evaluation
quantitative des mesures de mises en euvre de la SRP, dont l'evaluation de l'impact des
investissements finances par le Programme Special du President de la Rkpublique). En
outre, les resultats de 1'enquCte QUIBB seront renforces par les rksultats de 1'EnquCte
Nationale sur le Budget et la Consommation des Menages (ENBC) qui constitue une des
priorites du Gouvemement dans le cadre du suivi et de la connaissance de la pauvretk au
Niger.

52.      Implantation gkographique de la dkpense. L e Gouvemement va utiliser les
donnees existantes (recensement, carte scolaire, information sur la santC, SIGNER) pour
mettre au point (avec des appuis techniques extkrieurs), un systeme d'informations
permettant d'identifier l'implantation geographique des depenses publiques. Cet
instrument devrait faciliter une reorientation des programmes de depenses en faveur des
zones les plus defavoriskes.

53.      Code des dkpenses de pauvretk. L e Gouvemement va introduire un code
permettant de suivre les depenses de reduction de la pauvretk. Ce code permettra
notamment d'kvaluer la coherence entre les lois de finances et les objectifs de la Strategie
de Reductionde laPauvretk.




                                                                                           16

                                             86



54.    Evaluation de I'impact de rbformes structurelles. Dans le cadre de la rkvision de
la SRP, le Gouvemement analysera l'accbs a l'eau et a l'ClectricitC, la structure des tarifs
et son impact sur les populations les plus pauvres. Cette analyse portera aussi sur
1'Cvaluation    de 1'efficacitC   de la politique de         ((branchements sociaux D.  L e
Gouvemement Ctudiera Cgalement l'impact de la politique de recouvrement des coQts et
de la motivation et dkcentralisation du personnel dans le secteur de la s a n k Une Ctude
sur les mesures nkcessaires pour la mise en valeur des investissements PPTE pour le
dkveloppement rural sera aussi rCalisCe. Enfin, le Gouvemement examinera la possibilitk
d'enquetes de traqage des dCpenses publiques dans les secteurs prioritaires pour mieux
connaitre l'incidence de la dkpense publique sur la condition des pauvres.

55. Dans le cadre de la prkparation du CRDP (CrCdit de RCfonne des Dkpenses
Publiques) et en accord avec les services techniques de la Banque Mondiale, le
Gouvernement a dkjd mis en muvre (ou est en train de mettre en awvre) une sbie de
mesures. Enparticulier :

    9       En vue d'assurer des ressources adequates pour les secteurs prioritaires en
            2005, une loi de Finances r6visCe a Ct6 adoptee pour 2005. Cette loi inclut
            l'ensemble des ressources de l'allegement de la dette dans le cadre de
            l'initiative PPTE renforcCe et prevoit davantage de credits pour les secteurs
            prioritaires (dont l'education, la santC et le dkveloppement rural).

   iv)     Pour amkliorer l'accks aux soins de santC en zones reculkes et dans les
           rkgions, et pour prCparer la dkcentralisation des soins de santC, un projet de
           dkcret a ktk prCparC par le Gouvemement fixant les rbgles statutaires
           applicables aux nouveaux contractuels du secteur de la santk.       Ce projet de
           dkcret fixe les nouveaux postes dans les rkgions, et une copie a 6tC envoyCe a
           la Banque Mondiale.       L'adoption du dkcret par le Conseil des Ministres est
           prCvue dans les semaines A venir.


   V I     Pour amkliorer le systkme d'kvaluation et de suivi, la nouvelle enquete
           nationale (QUIBB 2005 ktendue) qui sera utiliske comme base d'information
           pour la rkvision de la SRP a Ctk lancke par 1'Institut National de la Statistique.
           En outre, le Directeur Gknkral de 1'INS sera nommk prochainement par le
            gouvemement.

    vi)     Pour amkliorer l'integration des ressources d'allbgement de la dette dans les
            stratkgies sectorielles pour la rkduction de la pauvrete, nous vous confirmons
            l'accord du Gouvemement de prockder a un renforcement du dispositif de
            gestion du Programme Special. Un Plan Preliminaire visant ce renforcement
            est annex6 A la presente lettre de politique de developpement.

56.   Les actions prkalables a mettre en Oeuvre avant la prochaine opkration de rkforme
des depenses publiques de la Banque Mondiale seront dkterminkes lors des missions
d'identification et d'evaluation de cette opkration.          Cependant, dans l e domaine
spkcifique de la gestion des depenses publiques pour lequel un plan d'action a ktk
approuve via le rapport PEMFAR, les mesures suivantes seront mises en oeuvre.

    i)      Pour assurer des niveaux d'allocations budgetaires adkquats aux secteurs
            prioritaires en 2006 : L e projet de L o i de Finances 2006 devant Stre soumis a
            1'Assemblke Nationale octroiera des ressources adequates aux secteurs
            prioritaires (dont les coats rkcurrents).     L'exposC des motifs de la L o i de
            Finances indiquera la cohkrence entre les propositions d'allocations
            budgktaires et les objectifs et prioritis de la SRP (voir la matrice PEMFAR,
            action 1)' entre autres pour l'Education, la Santk, le Dkveloppement Rural, les
            Transports et 1'Equipement. Pour les Ministkres ayant prkpare des CDMT, les
            allocations tiendront comptes de ces CDMT (voir la matrice PEMFAR, action
            3). En outre, une codification sera utiliske dans la loi des finances 2006 pour
            permette de mieux suivre les depenses reductrices de la pauvretk.

    ii) Pouramkliorerl'intkgrationdesressourcesd'allbgement deladettedansles
            stratkgies sectorielles pour la rkduction de la pauvretk, le renforcement du
            dispositif de gestion du Programme Spkcial aura kte mis en Oeuvre de faqon

           preparation des budget-programmes; en particulier pour le secteur du
           dkveloppement rural (voir la Matrice PEMFAR, action 5).

   iv)     Pour ameliorer l'exkcution du budget, le Ministbre de 1'Economie et des
           Finances preparera des tableaux trimestriels sur l'exkcution du plan de
           trksorerie avec une information detaillee sur les allocations reques par chaque
           ministere. Les ministeres de 1'Education de base et de la SantC Publique           .
           prepareront une revue de leurs dkpenses publiques respectives (voir la Matrice
           PEMFAR,action 32).


   V I     Afin d'ameliorer la fourniture des services de santk dans les zones rurales, une
           etude sera rtaliske sur le coat potentiel de formules d'incitation alternatives
           pouvant etre offertes aux personnels de santC dkcentralisks et unplan d'action
           pour la decentralisation dupersonnel de santC sera prepare.

   vi)     Afin d'ameliorer l'exkcution et le contrble budgetaires, le Gouvemement
           preparera un rapport sur l'utilisation des procedures exceptionnelles de
           depenses (PSOP). Ce rapport comprendra une stratkgie et des mesures
           spkcifiques de reduction de leur utilisation. En outre, le comitk charge de
           superviser l e programme de reformes des contrbles sera mis en place par le
           Gouvemement.

   vii)    Pour renforcer les capacites de gestion des dkpenses publiques, c o m e
           recommand6 dans le rapport PEMFAR, une etude sera mise en aeuvre en vue
           d'ameliorer la structure et le fonctionnement du Ministere de 1'Economie et
           des Finances. Cette etude proposera des recommandations entre autres dans
           les domaines suivants : a) la preparation de rapports trimestriels sur la dette
           exterieure, le processus et le calendrier d'apurement de la dette intkrieure ;b)
           l'identification des contrbles redondants qui pourraient etre evitks et simplifies
           et unplan d'action pour cette simplification ;c) l'identification des ministeres
           depensiers devant btneficier de la deconcentration de la phase administrative
           de la depense et un plan d'action a cette fin ; et d) une meilleure integration
            dans le budget et un meilleur suivi des financements sur ressources
           exterieures.

   viii)   Pour assurer la mise en aedvre du plan d'action du PEMFAR, le Conseil des
           Ministres adoptera chaque annCe un programme annuel qui dkterminera la
            sequence des actions, leur calendrier et les responsabilites spkcifiques des
            differentes entitis administratives concernkes.

1. Historique et contexte : Suite au point de decision atteint par le Niger en decembre
2000, le Gouvemement, de concert avec les partenaires au developpement, a decide, lors
de la      l e r eRevue du programme 2000-2003, effectuke en mai 2001, d'utiliser les
ressources degagkes 2i travers l'assistance intenmaire, pour financer le programme spkcial
du President de la Rkpublique du Niger, celui-ci etant consider6 comme une premibre
application de la strategic interimaire de reduction de la pauvrete. Dans ce cadre, les
modalites de gestion du programme ont tte dkfinies en accord avec les partenaires au
developpement : budgetisation, mise en place du Comite de suivi, gestion des fonds et
evaluation. L e programme a toujours observk les principes suivants : a) la participation
active des populations bkneficiaires 2i toutes les Ctapes du programme (identification,
execution, et mise en Oeuvre des ouvrages) ; b) la realisation des travaux a un excellent
rapport qualitUprix ;c) le suivi rapprochk des administrations locales et regionales ;et d)
l e maintien de l'implication active des plus hautes instances de 1'Etat. Cependant, aprbs
plusieurs annees de mise en Oeuvre, une evaluation independante a rkvele la necessitk de
renforcer davantage le dispositif de gestion du programme special.

2. Obiectif : Le renforcement du dispositif de gestion du Programme Spkcial comportera
en particulier trois aspects : (i)  une plus grande implication des ministkres sectoriels dans
la preparation des investissements sous la coordination du Comite en charge du
Programme Special, et dans l'exkcution de ces investissements sous la supervision stricte
de ce mCme Comite ; (ii)      la prise en compte par les ministbres sectoriels des montants des
ressources PPTE qui seront affectees aux secteurs dont ils ont la charge; et (iii)
l'association des ministbres sectoriels aux operations d'engagement des dCpenses
financees sur ressources PPTE qui concement leurs champs de competence. Les comites
national, regionaux et sous-rkgionaux de pilotage du Programme SpCcial continueront A
jouer un r61e essentiel de supervision, conseil et suivi du Programme sous l'autorite du
President de la RCpublique.Par ailleurs, ilsera necessaire d'evaluer les implications des
investissements rCalisks par le Programme Special sur les besoins en dtpenses courantes
essentielles pour ameliorer la qualite des services offerts par les ministbres concern&, et
de continuer les efforts pour s'assurer que les rbgles de passation des marches soient
respectees et que les ouvrages realises aient la qualite voulue.

3. Mecanisme pour le renforcement du dispositif de nestion du Promamme Special : Les
Ctapes futures du processus de renforcement du dispositif de gestion du Programme
Special seront les suivantes :

INTRODUCTION
 1.     Niger is a landlocked Sahelian country o f 1,267,000 square kilometers with a
population o f 10,790 million'.        Niger faces difficult challenges       for economic
development and improvements in the standard o f living due to large natural handicaps
related to the increasing aridity o f the climate, high population pressure (3.3%) with
inadequate resources, and high transportation costs for its imports and exports2. The
capital and the country also lack a railway infrastructure.

2.      Niger went through a series o f economic and socio-political shocks during the
80s and 90s, (collapse o f the uranium market, debt crisis, increasing informalization o f
the economy, armed rebellions, military coup d'etats, strikes, etc.), which contributed to
the expansion and the deepening o fpoverty.

3.      Since 1982, Niger's authorities have implemented several stabilization and
adjustment programs to address these problems. Results have been mixed due primarily
to an unfavorable socio-political atmosphere that has affected the implementation o f
structural reforms. Armed with political will, Authorities o f the Fifth Republic, elected
in 1999 after free and transparent elections, have implemented, in agreement with the
development partners, a triennial Program (from 2000-2003) with the support o f the
IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and several World Bank
supported adjustment credits.

4.      The implementation o f this reform program has considerably reduced intemal
and external imbalances o f the economy.

5.      Moreover, with the support o f the Bretton Woods Institutions and its other
partners, Niger has adopted and implemented a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) that
national institutions and the intemational community consider henceforth as the
reference framework for national macroeconomic and sector policies as well as for the
assistance o f Niger's development partners.

6.      In view of the results which have been achieved combined with the firm
determination o f the Authorities to deepen the reform process, the country's
development partners have agreed to grant Niger external debt relief within the
framework o f the Enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC). Niger
reached the HIPC completion point on April 12, 2004, and benefited from a generous
debt relief, freeing resources that were exclusively allocated to poverty reduction and to
the development o f the priority social sectors, as part o f activities financed in particular
bythe President's SpecialProgram.

7.     However, in spite o f progress, higher economic growth and poverty reduction will
require further reforms. Furthermore, Niger continues to face major external shocks,
especially a highly unstable rainfall pattern. In such a context, achieving sustainable


'  2001 general census of the populationand the habitat
   The nearest port is located over thousand kilometers from Niamey.


                                               2

development results will require more time, more human and material resources and
greater coordination among all parties involved. Other factors needed to reduce poverty
include: (i)greater commitment towards reforms not only by the elite but by the
population as a whole; (ii)   the need to regard reforms as a whole in order to ensure an
orderly and harmonized implementation; (iii)      continued support o f the partners in terms
o f substantial financial resources as well as technical assistance within the sectors with an
insufficient capacity.

8. After many years o f efforts and reforms, the challenges that Niger must tackle remain
huge. They include: (i)   accelerating economic growth to a level where it will significantly
alleviate poverty; (ii) creating jobs through a diversification policy, the establishment o f
an institutional and legal framework suitable for private sector development; (iii)
reducing poverty which has become an endemic phenomenon; and (iv) implementing
keys structural reforms to ensure sustained budgetary performances, including a more
efficient medium-term financial system to promote saving and investment as well as the
expansion o f a network o f micro finance institutions operating on a sound financial base.

9.      This letter o f development policy aims at applying the 2005-2007 Economic and
Financial Program to public expenditure management and poverty reduction. It is
primarily based on the Priority Action Plan resulting from the Public Expenditure
Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) exercise which extended
from November 2003 (main mission) to February 2005 (adoption o f the final report by
Government).

I.RecentTrendinNiger'sSocio-PoliticalandEconomicSituation

 10.    Over the last four years, there have been intense political and economic reforms
with very positive results, inspite o f problems caused either by an unstable regional and
international environment (such as the political crisis in CBte d'Ivoire and the rise in
petroleum price), or adverse climatic conditions in2004.

 11.    After a period o f political instability from 1996-1999, political and social stability
was restored and maintained after President Tandja came into office. There is a constant
dialogue between the Authorities, the political class and the social partners, wages are
paid regularly and the clearance o f previously accumulated arrears i s being pursued.
Actions o f the President's Special Program which directly benefit the poorest have also
contributed in maintaining a good social environment. In sum, the first mandate o f
President Mamadou Tandja has helped strengthen the country's democratic institutions,
as evidenced by the 2004 local, presidential and legislative elections, which were
organized according to methods judged as fully consistent with democratic principles by
national and international obrservers.

12.      The Government's economic policy made it possible to stimulate growth and
restore fiscal discipline after several years o f economic stagnation and budget deficit
financed by the accumulation o f internal and external arrears. Preliminary data available
indicate that the macroeconomic performance in 2004 were less satisfactory than
originally envisaged. The economic activity was less vibrant, in an environment
constrained by drought and locust plague in the Sahel region and higher world price o f
petroleum products. The growth rate was at 0.9% (against an initial forecast o f 4.l%),
mainly due to a strong fall inthe agricultural output which could not be compensated by
the good performance o f other sectors, including gold production launched in 2004.
Inflationwas at 3.7% inDecember 2004, representing an average annual decline o f 0.2%.
The current external deficit (excluding the current transfers) slightly improved to
approximately 7.3% (compared with 7.6% in 2003) because o f new gold exports and the
reduction in the payments o f interests on foreign debts, under the HPC initiative. Niger
contributed positively to the foreign reserves o f the Central Bank o f West African States
(BCEAO), through concessional funding and debt relief.

13.     Inthe area of public finance, the Government has implemented measures needed
to achieve the revised budgetary objectives inthe year 2004. Revenue estimates are o f the
order o f FCFA 171.8 billion as planned, equivalent to 10.5% o f the GDP, thanks to
sustained efforts towards strengthening the tax and customs administrations, which have
helped mitigate the negative impact o f repeated closures o f the border with Nigeria. At
the end o f October 2004, total spending had reached 80% o f the total expenditure
allocated for the whole year, and were maintained at 18.6 % o f GDP for 2004. Thus, the
primary budget balance and the overall budget balance (excluding grants, on a
commitment base) should not exceed the annual forecast. By taking into account the
equivalent reduction o f net domestic arrears to 1.1 % o f the GDP, the overall financing
requirement for state funding will increase to 8.8% o f the GDP, and would be almost
entireIy covered by external resources.



                                               4

 14.    The Government has continued to improve budget management. A medium-term
 expenditure framework (CDMT) for the health and education sectors was finalized
 during the second quarter of 2004 and used in the preparation o f the 2005 budget. In
 addition, the Government has begun the implementation o f measures identified by the
 public expenditure review, carried out within the PEMFAR framework (Public
 Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review) with assistance from the World Bank
 and the European Union.

 15.    The net monetary assets of the banking sector during the first half of 2004
 increased by 21% compared to the money supply in beginning o f the period, in
 connection with a deterioration o f the Government's net position. The latter however has
 considerably improved in the second semester; and credit to the economy was improved,
 increasing to almost 4% in2004.

 The financial healtho f the banks remained satisfactory overall.

 16.    In the area of structural reforms, the privatization of the electricity company
 (NIGELEC) and the petroleum distribution company (SONIDEP), as well as the
implementation o f the planned reform schedules in the financial sector could not be
completed. However, the Authorities launched a new invitation to tender in 2004,
resulting in the release o f 6.9 % o f SONIDEP's capital to petroleum distributors in the
private sector. With regards to NIGELEC's privatization, the potential investor, Nigerian
Electrical Power Authority (NEPA), continued to face serious financial difficulties.
Reforms relating to the CDN (Housing Bank), the CPCT (Community Lending Bank)
and the ONPE were not achieved during 2004, because o f delays in establishing the Unit
responsible for the management o f these reforms, despite technical and financial support
o f the World Bank.

 17.    With respect to social sectors, considerable efforts were undertaken to improve
population (in particular the poor and the most vulnerable groups) access to basic social
services.

18.     Remarkable results have been achieved in the education sector. Primary school
enrolment (less than 30% at the beginning o f the 90s) had already reached nearly 42% in
2001-2002. Ithas continued to increase duringthe last three years to reach 55% in2004.

19.     Along with primary school enrolment, girls' enrolment, an essential objective o f
the Poverty Reduction Strategy, has also increased (40% in 2004). Equally significant
results were recorded inthe healthsector. Thanks to the construction and rehabilitationo f
health centers and health posts, the share o f the population living within 5 km from a
health center has increased to 47.6% in 2000 and 49.8% in 2003. Although most health
indicators (such as maternal mortality rates) are still among the lowest in the world,
significant progress was made in vaccination and infant-juvenile mortality rate reduction
programs.

20.     The President's Special Program has played an important role inthe financing o f
rural development, social sectors and other priority activities for poverty reduction. I t has


                                            5

resulted in the creation o f wells, small dams and a great number o f small-scale
agricultural and irrigation projects, program financed schools, classrooms and health
centers. It has also financed the salaries o f contractual teachers, leading to an increase in
the number o f primary school teachers and greater enrollment o f children inschool.

21.      In spite of the magnitude of reforms undertaken and results achieved, the
Government i s aware that it is still very far from achieving the MillenniumDevelopment
Goals (MDGs) and the long term goal o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy. In a country
with a population growth rate exceeding 3%, the average economic growth rate o f 4 to
5% i s still insufficient to significantly reduce poverty in the current decade and facilitate
a progressive improvement o f household income. The agricultural sector (by far the main
employer o f the working population) remains very vulnerable to climate changes. The
increase in school enrolment must be accompanied by substantial effort to improve the
quality o f teaching. Progress achieved in improving the sanitation coverage must also be
followed by an improvement inthe quality o f services and significant increase inthe rate
o f utilization. The key policy objective o f the new Government formed by President
Tandja i s to pursue and accelerate reform programs started by the previous Government
from 2000-2004, inline with this letter o f development policy.

 11.Context:ThePublicFinancemanagementReforms

 22.      The public finance management reforms are one o f the major instruments o f the
 Government's socio-economic policy and Poverty Reduction Strategy. Indeed, in a
 country where Government revenue barely exceeds 10% o f GDP and where external aid
 i s substantial, but volatile, effective public spending i s essential to help the country
 progress towards the achievement o f its poverty reduction and socio-economic
 development objectives. Within this context, remarkable results were obtained, inbudget
 preparation and implementation as well inthe monitoring o f expenditure.

 23.      With respect to budget preparation, the main reforms include the adoption o f a
 new budget nomenclature, revised calendar and budget preparation methods, as well as
 the formulation o f a medium-term framework and multi-year budget programs for key
 Ministries. The adoption and the implementation o f a new budgetary nomenclature and
 charter o f accounts based on WAEMU directives facilitate a more transparent analysis o f
 expenditure programs and budgetary results based on international standards. Henceforth,
 the National Assembly will be presented with consolidated current and investment
 expenditure budgets, including donor-financed expenditures. The purpose o f the
budgetary reform calendar is to better involve the line ministries in the budget decisions
regarding their sectors. Lastly, the preparation o f sector CDMT and budgets programs
 (particularly in the social sectors) aims at encouraging the Ministries concerned to
optimize their expenditure proposals on the basis o f a strategic vision o f their priorities.

24.     With regard to budgetary implementation and monitoring and public expenditure
controls, key reforms have included the gradual introduction o f a computerized financial
management system, improved budgetary control and treasury planning, repayment o f
domestic arrears according to the settlement plan, preparation and adoption o f the Budget
Review Law (Loi de riglement), progressive strengthening o f financial control and
transformation o f the existing chamber o f accounts (Chambre des comptes) into an
autonomous General Auditor's Office (Cour des comptes).

25.     The computer-based management and financial information system i s very
promising.     At this stage o f implementation, it helps the Budget Directorate (DGB)
monitor expenditure commitments andpayments.

 26.    The main objective o f improving budget control and treasury planning is to
prevent the accumulation o f domestic arrears by ensuring that commitments and
payments are in line with available resources. Since 2004, the system has also ensured
that resources are allocated to fund priority activities, including expenditure o f sectors
essential for poverty reduction.

27.     In2003, delayed budget approval by the National Assembly led the Government
to resort to exceptional procedures, such as payments without prior commitment
(PSOPs), which bypass budget control procedures. In 2004, the use o f PSOPs has
considerably decreased.




                                              7

28.     A settlement plan for domestic arrears was prepared in 2000`. Government has
implemented the plan and has reduced the domestic public debt by over CFAF 70 billion
duringthe 2001 and 2004 period.

29.     In 2000, for the first time in fifteen years, a Budget Review Law (Loi de
rkglement) covering the entire budget for the fiscal year has been prepared, and
management accounts have been submitted to the General Auditor's Office. Since then,
the Ministry o f Economy and Finance has been taking steps to reduce delays in the
preparation o f the Budget Review Law. The 2002 Budget review Law has been adopted
by the NationalAssembly.

30.     The Financial Control Directorate implemented a training program targeting all
controllers to better prepare them for the new tasks ahead within the framework o f a
gradual delegation o f payment authority to the line Ministries. An amendment o f the
Constitution has transformed the Chamber o f Accounts into a General Auditor's Office,
whose independencewill be guaranteed by an Organic law still to be adopted.

31.     Moreover, the Ministry o f Economy and Finance has issued directives to
accelerate the payment o f delegated lines o f credit. Also, a committee has been appointed
to find adequate solutions to the problem o f the Treasury balances.

32.     The Govemment considers that the public finance management reform is o f
utmost importance for the future socio- economic development o f the country. It i s also a
long-term endeavor which will require the continuous efforts o f the authorities with
support from the international community. The pursuit o f this reform i s at the heart o f the
public expenditure reform program over the 2005-06 period, for which Niger has
solicited the financial assistance o f the World Bank.

 111.MainOrientationsofthe ReformsProgram

 33.    Niger remains confronted with major socio-economic constraints, evidenced by
 the prevalence o f precarious living conditions for the large majority o f its population. In
 line with its medium term poverty reduction objectives, the Government intends to
 implement policies and measures to gradually alleviate these constraints. In order to
 achieve such goals, there are plans to enhance public revenue mobilization and to focus
public expenditure on priority sectors such as infrastructures, health, education and rural
 development.

 34.    As defined in the PRSP, the private sector plays a key role in Niger's growth
 strategy for the agricultural, livestock, tourism, mining and services sectors. These
 sectors were identified as having a strong growth potential. In this context, the
 Government intends to enhance its food security program and to develop income
 generating activities through IDA-financed projects in extension services, agricultural
research and small-scale private irrigation projects. To revitalize tourism, the
administration's objective is to promote Niger as an attractive tourist destination. In line
with this objective, the Government will ensure the free flow o f people and goods at the
various border crossings and will help improve infrastructure and existing hotel facilities.
Planned initiatives include: (i) development o f two new tourist sites along the river Niger;
(ii) rehabilitation,and(iii)
    hotel                          promotion o f the African International Fashion Festival
(FIMA).At the same time, efforts are beingmade to diversify miningproduction beyond
uranium and gold, by intensifying prospecting and exploration activities for oil and other
mineral resources. The Government will seek to further involve the private sector in
stimulating key economic sectors and generating employment.

35.     Macroeconomic objectives of the program. The Macroeconomic objectives for
2005-07 are: i)to carry out an average real GDP growth rate o f at least 4 % per annum, in
order to increase the per capita income o f more than 1% per annum; ii)to maintain the
annual inflation rate below the WAEMU threshold o f 3%; and iii)to reduce the current
external trade deficit (excluding official transfers) from 7.3% o f GDP in2004 to 6.3 % in
2007.

36.     To achieve these objectives, the Government is determined to implement an
ambitious revenue mobilizationprogram and to judiciously manage its expenditure while
ensuring that social expenditure i s inline with the PRSP objectives.

37. Internal revenue mobilization measures include a tax reform and improvement in the
tax and customs administrations, with a view o f broadening the tax base and improving
the fiscal administrations. These measures should make it possible to gradually increase
the tax rate to approximately 12.1%o f GDP in2007, from an estimated level o f 10.5% in
2004.

38.     The Government intends to prioritize public expenditure in accordance with the
PRSP. To that effect it will implement recommendations o f the studies recently carried
out on financial management and public expenditure with technical support from IMF,
the World Bank and the European Union.


                                              9

39.      In 2003-2004, with the support of the international community, particularly the
World Bank and the European Union, and on the basis o f consultation with
representatives o f public and private sector, and civil society, the Government undertook
a critical analysis o f the management o f public expenditure, which led to the production
o f the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR)
and the adoption o f a priority action plan. The PEMFAR report is now regarded by
Government and its partners as the common ground for their policies and future
interventions in this important area. Using the PEMFAR framework, the Government
will give priority to measures that aim at: (i)improving the programming,
implementation and the monitoring o f the budget, (ii)    making public finance management
more transparent, at improving debt management, and (iii)reinforcing internal and
external controls.

40.      As regards budget preparation, in spite o f the reform methods and the preparation
calendar, line ministries still do not have sufficient time and resources to prepare budget
proposals appropriately reflecting the strategic priorities o f their sectors. The Government
will take the following steps to coordinate and deepen the participation o f these
Ministries in budget programming: (i)       improve the content o f the macroeconomic and
budget framework, (Zettre de cadrage); (ii)increase consultations with line ministries
before developing the budget policy letter; (iii)   encourage key ministries to better define
their priorities, in preparing sectoral C D M T and coherent and realistic budget programs;
and finally (iv) continue the integration o f recurrent and investment budgets, irrespective
o f the source o f financing.

     a) Improving contents o f the Zettre de cadrage. It is essential that the line ministries
         start as early as possible their review o f priorities o f their expenditure programs.
         To help the process, the content of the Zettre de cadrage produced by the Ministry
         of Economy and Finance would be improved at the start o f the budget preparation
         phase. The Zettre de cadrage should give more complete indications on the
         economic and financial perspectives o f the country, thus allowing the line
         ministries to prepare detailed budgetary proposals on the basis o f three scenarios.
         To this end, the Zettre de cadrage that forms the basis o f the Budgetary Circular
         (CircuZaire budge'taire) will use the results o f preliminary discussions with the
         spending ministries according to a process which will begin with the 2006 Budget
         preparation (budget law), beginning on a test basis in ministries (Education and
         Health). These ministries will produce three budget scenarios and these scenarios
         will be reflected inthe Zettre de cadrage.

     b) Consultation o f line ministries before the preparation o f the policy letter (Zettre-
        plafond). The Zettre-plafond determines the budget o f each ministry. Currently, it
         is prepared by the Ministry o f Economy and Finance without prior consultations
         with the line ministries. Henceforth, the Ministry o f Economy and Finance will
         work in closer consultation with the line ministries before the preparation o f the
         policy letter. To this end, it will ensure that its Budget Directorate meets with
         each Ministry. The Zettre-plafond will thus include observations o f the ministries,



                                              10

        insofar as these will have already presented priorities o f their expenditure
        programs on the basis o f realistic scenarios. Starting with the 2006 Finance law,
        the lettre-plafond will specify the amount o f HIPC resources to be allocated to
        each line ministry.

    c) Preparatiodupdating by key ministries o f detailed sector strategies and C D M T and
        related budget programs aimed at optimizing their expenditure programs. With
        more time available to prepare their proposals, the key ministries will be able to
        reflect their strategic vision in the design and justification o f their budget
        proposals. Combined with the gradual but continuous improvement o f their
        CDMT and budget programs, these measures will help align CDMThudgets
        programs with key orientations in the ministries' budgets. The line ministries
        (which are involved in the preparation o f the CDMTs) will need technical and
        financial support to accelerate the process, particularly on-the-job training on the
        CDMT, data collection and data processing equipment. To this end, the
        Government will request support fkom its development partners.

    d) Better coordinatiodintegration of current and investments expenditures in
       programs and budgets o f the line ministries. Even though the Budget law includes
        all the types o f expenditure, irrespective o f the source o f funding, the budget
       proposals o f the Ministries still reflect the structure o f the traditional budgets.
       Budgets o f the Ministries are not prepared by a single authority. They are carried
       out by two distinct directorates: the Administrative and Financial Affairs
       Divisions (DAAF), which deals with the current expenditure and the Research
       and Program Directorate (DEP), whose main function i s to program capital
       expenditures. In order to improve coordination in the preparation o f the budget,
       the DEP and the DAAF will be reinforced where they exist and established inthe
       line ministries where they do not exist. Moreover, all the line ministries will be
       encouraged to emphasize team work in developing budget proposals and
       adjudications.

41.    With regard to budget execution, the Government's main objectives will be to
reinforce budget regulation and treasury allocation planning, to reduce the use of the
exceptional procedures and to continue the extension o f the computerized system o f
financial management in line ministries, inother departments o f the Ministryo f Economy
and Finance and indecentralized entities.

   a) Budget regulation and treasury allocation planning. The budget regulation process
       and the cash management plan have two main goals: to avoid the creation o f new
       debt and to protect essential activities, particularly expenditures needed for
       sectors playing a key role in poverty reduction. In 2004, these two mechanisms
       made it possible to limit the creation o f debt and actually protected some priority
       activities. Nevertheless the system has been inefficient and experience suggests
       that there is a need for more active participation by line ministries in the design
       and implementation o f these mechanisms.




                                            11

Line ministries must be encouraged to start as early as possible the process of
identifying categories o f expenditure which deserve a special protection with the view
to achieve the strategic objectives o f the ministry, notably in the preparation o f their
C D M T and their budget-program. Consultations between the Ministry o f Economy
and Finance and the priority Ministries should be organized before submitting budget
regulation plans to the Council o f Ministers (to reflect the seasonal variations o f some
expenditures). Tighter monitoring in the execution o f the quarterly plans for budget
regulation and the weekly cash management allocation plan must then be put inplace,
to    verify consistency with priorities. Monitoring instruments include the
computerization o f the cash management system(on the basis o f the data produced by
the revenue and expenditure subsystems), and in addition, monthly distribution o f
reports to the line ministries on the forecasts and cash management plan. A single list
o f poverty reduction expenditures (which includes the HIPC expenditure and the
expenditure for the cash management plan), currently prepared by the Ministry o f
Economy and Finance, will contribute significantly in addressing appropriately these
issues. In the short term, starting with the 2005 budget execution, the Minister o f
Economy and Finance will issue a circular budget to set out a mechanism ensuring
appropriate involvement o f line Ministries inthe design, arbitration and monitoring o f
treasury planning. The circular which will be introduced by the end o f March 2005,
will request the line ministries to send quarterly and annual reports on the execution
o f treasury allocation plans to the Ministry o f Economy and Finance.

b) Exceptional procedures.        In 2003, delayed budget approval by the National
     Assembly led the Government to resort to exceptional procedures, such as
     payments without prior commitment (PSOPs), which bypass budget control
     procedures. In2004, the use o f PSOPs has considerably decreased.

The Government is committed to limiting the use o f PSOPs to only the exceptional
situations envisaged by law and to take appropriate corrective actions within the
required time frame.

c) Computerization. The extension o f the computerized system o f financial
     management is a priority. The two most important steps to implement, with
     support from the African Development Bank, are to supplement the Budget-
     Treasury connection (particularly the retum connection without which the Budget
     Directorate i s unable to monitor the effective payment o f budgetary allocations
     and initiate payments to the line ministries) through the installation and smooth
     operation o f computer centers accessible to the credit administrators and the
     financial controllers. Within the framework o f the decentralization process and a
     more effective handling o f allocations, it is also important to complete the
     computerization o f government finance offices and to initiate that o f the
     scheduling centers. Lastly, it i s essential that the system be gradually extended to
     all the departments o f the ministry o f Economy and Finance. Over the coming
     years,  such gradual approach will allow Government to complete the
     computerization process o f the expenditure subsystem. The Computer Department




                                           12

        o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance and pertinent directorates in other
        Ministries will formulate a detailed implementationplan.

42.     With regard to transparency in accounts management,the PEMFARreport has
identified several reforms which are essential for the improvement o f quality and
transparency o f public accounts.

    a) Most urgent is to complete the integration of the balance from a previous fiscal
        year in the Treasury allocation plan for a new fiscal Year. The committee created
        to this end started examining the problem o f auditing o f accounts of the previous
        years up to 1996. Government will ask this committee to work faster. The
        committee considers the appropriate handling o f accounts prior to 1996, a
        prerequisite for the introduction o f balances inthe current accounts.

   b) Another very important long-term action is the integration of expenditure
        financed by donors into the public accounts expenditure.The General Finance
        Directorate (DGF) which monitors these operations tries to make project
        execution reporting more systematic. To that effect it has introduced statements o f
        expenditure. However their computerization does not appear feasible at this stage.
        It is important to note however that it is not possible to complete this integration
        as long as the donors will not grant the Government within reasonable time
        frames and in adapted form information relating to the execution o f projects o f
        which they ensure direct monitoring. With the assistance o f voluntary donors, the
        Government will set up a DGFIDGBIServices accountants working group which
        will be in charge o f assessing the means o f organizing the feedback on
        expenditure financed with external resources. The circulation o f information on
        the expenditure financed with external resources and the integration o f this
        expenditure in the public accounts will be largely facilitated by the future
        extension o f the computerized system o f financial management to the DGF.

43. With respect to debt management, the Government intends to clear the domestic
debt arrears and to closely monitor the external debt.

   a) Inspite o f gradual implementation o f a settlement plan, the domestic debt situation
       must be updated. To this end, a compilation of recommendations o f all the on-
       going studies in this area with assistance from the IMF through AFRITAC West,
       will help prepare an updated settlement planfor the domestic debt.

   b) In spite o f the debt relief under the HIPC initiative, the countrv's external debt
       remains a critical problem which must be closely monitored. A new external debt
       monitoring software has recently been installed at the Debt Directorate (DDP) and
       work stations giving access to this software should be created within the Direction
       de I'ordonnuncement and the Treasury. However, the system remains incomplete,
       inthat withdrawals from loans are not automatically monitored by the DDP, and
       are still reported manually by the DGF. To improve the exchange of data between
       the DGF and the DDP, an agreement between two Directorates will ensure that



                                              13

         fund withdrawal requests and the actual withdrawals                   are immediately
         communicated to the DDP. The Government will also study the possibility o f
         extending the debt management software to DGF.

44.      Reinforcing internal and external controls i s              essential to improving
transparency. It i s also advisable to continue external controls reforms, particularly that o f
the Chamber o f Accounts.

    a) Financial Control will play a key role in the establishment o f a new expenditure
         subsystem once the new data processing center will have been created, and will
         allow the progressive devolution o f the commitment subsystem (ordonnancement)
         to line ministries. The Financial Control Directorate will continue the training o f
         its controllers and will initiate the preparation o f a manual o f procedures.

    b) The Chamber o f Accounts has been transformed into General Auditor's Office.
         The Government will submit the draft organic law to the National Assembly for
        reform implementation.

    c) Lastly, Government will define and implement the reform o f internal and external
        controls outlined in the audit carried out in 2003 with support from the European
        Union.

45. Public Expenditure Program to Support Poverty Reduction. The fight against
poverty is one o f the main goals o f the public expenditure management reform. To this
end the Government will implement three measures: (i) reorganization o f the public
                                                               the
expenditure program; (ii)    continuation o f the on-going reforms to develop and improve
the basic social services; and (iii)the installation o f measures and activities for the
monitoring and evaluation o f the PRSP, to improve the availability and analysis o f
statistical data.

46.     With respect to public expenditure restructuring, the detailed measures for
improving the preparation, execution and control o f the budget have been explained
above. In addition, it should be stressed that the Budget law 2005approved by the
National Assembly underestimated the resources and did not give adequate priority to
basic social services. The revised budget law approved by the National Assembly
allocated nearly 75% o f the additional resources to the priority areas, such as basic
education, health, rural development, the construction and maintenance o f roads.

47. Developmentof Social Services and Improvementof their Quality

    a) Education: Within the framework o f the future sector CDMT, the Government
        will re-assess the needs for funding and the structure o f expenditure, such as the
        balance between recurrent expenses and capital expenditures. It will continue its
        policy o f recruitment o f contractual teachers, which made it possible to
        substantially reduce the unit cost, and it will allocate nearly 50% o f the
        expenditure to the basic education sector. Lastly, it will evaluate the impact o f the



                                                14

   expenditure on education (notably, within the context o f the new on-going
   household survey); it will reinforce the training o f teachers and will use the school
   map for a better geographical distribution o f schools.

b) Health. Population growth is one o f the factors which reduce the effectiveness o f
   poverty reduction activities. The Government has thus the intention to define and
   adopt a coherent and effective strategy in reproductive health and population. In
   health, more generally, recent studies show that the decline in the service
   utilization ratio is due to the high cost o f services and low level o f quality. A
   Government's sponsored study will evaluate public policies with respect to cost
   recovery and their impact on the poor and rural areas. The conclusions and
   recommendations o f the study will be thoroughly reviewed and agreed upon
   before being translated into health policies. The Government will ensure that
   budget regulation encourages the effective use o f funds allocated for drugs and
   vaccines. It will complete the health map to ensure a pro-poor distribution o f
   infrastructure and services. Lastly, it will define and implement programs aimed
   at encouraging the deployment o f qualified personnel in rural areas and will
   continue to pilot a decentralized programming and execution o f health
   expenditures. It will adopt the following measures in 2005: (i)competitive
   recruitment o f health personnel at the regional level, and (ii)       creation o f new
   budgetary allocations for the areas that lack contractual health personnel in the
   event o f recruitment through the public service. These two measures will be
   adopted by suitable texts. To this end, a decree will be adopted to create the new
   positions for contractual health personnel in the regions, which should contribute
   to better service provision inrural areas. It was also agreed that a study would be
   carried out to determine incentives aiming at encouraging contractual health
   personnel to remain inrural areas (some o f these incentives could have budgetary
   implications).

c) The President's Special Prom-am. The audit o f the Program requested by the
   Government suggests that a better integration o f the Special program and the
   activities o f the sector Ministries i s necessary, particularly for the four ministries
   incharge of Rural Development. It was thus agreed that a studybe conducted to
   assess the use o f water management resources at the local level within the
   framework o f the social program (including small dams and wells), and the
   complementary actions which should be taken to maximize the impact on the
   beneficiary communities. The study will also aim at examining how a series o f
   programs under the President's Special Program can be transferred to the
   ministries. More generally, the action plans o f the Rural Development Strategy
   will be carried out so that they include the activities and projects o f the Special
   Program.

d) Expenditure inthe fight against poverty. A single list o f poverty-reduction related
   expenditures (which could include HIPC expenditure and the priority expenditure
   within the framework o f treasury plan), is currently being prepared by the




                                           15

        Ministry o f Economy and Finance. This list will ensure effective monitoring o f
        the use o f prioritypublic expenditure for the implementation o f the PRSP.

48.     Strengthening the management of HIPC resource. The use o f HIPC funds
within the framework o f the Special Program made it possible to accelerate construction
o f priority infrastructure in the areas o f education, health and rural development. It is
however advisable to reinforce the coordination o f this program with the interventions o f
the line ministries concemed and to involve the beneficiaries in the choice o f projects.
Reinforcement o f the management mechanism o f the Special Program for better
integration o f debt relief resources in the sector strategies for poverty reduction, will
comprise three main aspects: (i) greater involvement o f the sector ministries in the
                                     a
preparation o f investments under the coordination o f the Committee in charge o f the
Special program, and inthe execution o f these investments under the strict supervision o f
this same Committee; (ii) inclusion in the budget programs o f Ministries o f the
                              the
amounts o f HIPC resources allocated to the sectors o f which they are in charge; and (iii)
the involvement o f the sector ministries in the spending o f HIPC-financed resources in
their areas o f concern. The national, regional and sub-regional committees o f the Special
Program will continue to play an essential supervisory and advisory role under the
authority o f the President o f the Republic. In addition, it will be necessary to evaluate the
implications o f the investments carried out by the Special Program on the need for
recurrent expenditure to improve the quality o f services offered by the ministries
concerned, and to continue efforts to ensure that procurement rules are respected and that
the works carried out have the desired quality.

49.     Reinforcing the monitoring and evaluation of the poverty reduction
strategies and analyzingthe impact of current and future structural reforms on the
poor. The review o f the poverty reduction strategy and the continuing assessment o f the
effectiveness o f government policies and programs require: (i)       strengthening statistical
services; (ii)launching poverty surveys; (iii)implementing a system to monitor the
geographical distribution o f public expenditure; and (iv) establishing a budgetary
nomenclature allowing the identification o f poverty expenditures. Moreover, the impact
o f on-going structural reforms on the poor (privatization, fiscal reform) must be
evaluated.

50.     Statistics.Inorder to reinforce the statistical services, it is necessary to make the
National Statistical Office operational. This in turn requires appointing a management
team and developing a medium-term plan including the improvement o f national account
data-base and periodic household surveys. Within this framework, the Government has
implemented necessary personnel measures.

51.     Specific studies. In 2005, the Government launched a national survey (core
welfare indicators questionnaire (CWIQ) and it will be complemented by a qualitative
analysis o f factors which make it possible for certain families to escape poverty. The
participatory survey will aim at understanding the factors which help households to
emerge from poverty and providing a qualitative evaluation o f the actions carried out
over the last three years within the PRSP framework (taking this into consideration, the



                                              16

CWIQ survey should provide grounds for a quantitative evaluation o f the PRSP
implementation, including the evaluation o f the impact o f investments financed by the
President's Special Program). Moreover, the results o f the CWIQ survey will be
complemented by the results o f the National Budget and the Consumption Household
Survey (CHS), which constitutes one o f Government's priorities within the framework o f
the monitoring system and knowledge base on poverty inNiger.

52.     Geographical distribution of expenditure. The Government will use the
existing data (census, school map, information on health, SIGNER) to develop (with
extemal technical support), an information system able to identify the geographical
distribution o f public expenditure. This instrument should facilitate a reorientation o f
spending programs infavor o f the most deprived areas.

53.     Coding of poverty expenditures. The Govemment will introduce a code for
monitoring poverty reduction expenditure. This code will help inassessing the coherence
between the budget laws and the objectives o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy.

54.     Assessment of the impact of structural reforms. Within the framework o f the
PRSP review, Government will analyze access to water and electricity, the structure o f
tariffs and its impact on the poorer populations. This analysis will also assess the
effectiveness o f the policy o f "social connections". The Government will also study the
impact o f the health cost recovery policy and the motivation and decentralization o f
health personnel. A study on the necessary measures to enhance the value o f the
investments realized with HIPC resources for rural development will also be carried out.
Lastly, Government will examine the possibility of studying the disbursement o f public
expenditure in the priority areas to better appreciate the incidence o f public expenditure
on the livingconditions o fthe poor.

55.     As part o f the Public expenditure Reform Credit (PERC) preparation and in
agreement with the technical departments o f the World Bank, Government has already
implemented(or is implementing)several measures:

          i)     In order to ensure adequate levels of budgetary resources for priority
                 sectors outlined for 2005, a revised budget law was adopted for 2005.
                 The law includes all the resources o f debt relief received within the
                 framework o f the Enhanced HIPC initiative and allocated additional
                 resources for priority sectors (including education, health and rural
                 development).

         ii)     As regards the execution o f the budget, line ministries participated inthe
                 preparation o f the 2005 Cash Allocation Plan established on the basis o f
                 the 2005 revised budget law. A lettre circulaire was sent by the Ministry
                 o f Economy and Finance to all ministries to indicate the changes
                 implemented in the budget regulation process in order to ensure a better
                 participation o f line ministries in the quarterly preparation o f budgetary

                  operation (see the PEMFAR Matrix, action 10; a copy o f this lettre
                  circulaire has been sent to the World Bank).

          iii) ToreactivatetheworkoftheCommitteetoestablishopeningbalances,
                  the Committee in charge o f the preparation o f the opening balances for
                  1996 has met and has provided its report to the Ministry o f Economy
                  and Finance. This report includes recommendations as well as a calendar
                  for the finalization o f the 1996 opening balance and the use o f the
                  comptes de gestion and lois de rsglements for updating the opening
                  balances after 1996. The report o f the committee has been transmitted to
                  the World Bank (see PEMFARmatrix, action 17).

          iv)     To improve access to health care in remote areas, and to prepare the
                  decentralization o f health care, a decree has been prepared to set
                  statutory rules applicable to new contractual health personnel.     This
                  decree creates new stations in the regions, and a copy has been sent to
                  the World Bank. The adoption o f this decree by the Council o f ministers
                  is expected inthe coming weeks.

          v)      To improve the monitoring and evaluation system, the new national
                  survey (CWIQ 2005 extended) which will be used as the information
                  base for the revision o f the PRSP, was launched by the National
                  Statistical Office (NSO). Moreover, the government will soon appoint
                  the NSO's General Manager.

          vi)     To improve the integration o f debt relief resources in the sector
                  strategies for poverty reduction, we hereby confirm the Government's
                  agreement to strengthen the management mechanism o f the Special
                  Program. A Preliminary plan aimed at strengthening this management
                  mechanism is annexed to this letter of development policy.

56.    Preliminary actions to be implemented before the next public expenditure reform
credit o f the World Bank will be determined during the identification and evaluation
missions for this operation. However, in the specific area o f public expenditure
management for which an action plan was approved through the PEMFAR report, the
following steps will be taken:

          a. To ensure adequate levels o f budgetary allocation in the priority sectors in
              2006: The draft budget law for 2006 will allocate adequate resources to the
             priority sectors (including recurrent cost). The explanatory memorandum o f
             the budget law will indicate the coherence between proposals for budget
              allocation and PRSP objectives and priorities (see the PEMFAR matrix,
             action 1), inter-alia for Education, Health, Rural development, Transport and
             Equipment. For the Ministries which prepared a CDMT, allocations will
             take into account these CDMTs (see PEMFAR matrix, action 3). Moreover,




                                              18

     a coding system inthe 2006 budget law will help improve the monitoring o f
     poverty reduction expenditures.

  b. To improve the integration o f debt relief resources in the sector strategies
     for poverty reduction, the strengthening o f the management mechanism for
     the Special Program will have been implemented in a satisfactory way in
     accordance with the preliminary plan presented in the appendix.

  c.  To improve budget preparation, as done by the Ministries o f basic
     Education and Public health, the Government will pursue the preparation o f
     budget programs, especially for the rural development sector (see the
     PEMFARMatrix, action 5).

  d. To improve the execution o f the budget, the Ministry o f Economy and
     Finance will prepare quarterly reviews on the execution o f the cash
     management plan with detailed information on allocations received by each
     ministry. The Ministries o f basic Education and Public health will also
     prepare a review o f their respective public expenditure (see the PEMFAR
     Matrix, action 32).

  e. In order to improve the provision o f the health services in rural areas, a
     study will be conducted on the potential cost o f alternative incentive
     formulas which could be offered to decentralized health personnel and an
     actionplan for the decentralization o f health personnel will be prepared.

  f. Inorder to improvethe execution andcontrol ofthe budget, the Government
     will prepare a report on the use o f exceptional procedures o f expenditure
     (PSOP). This report will include a strategy and specific measures to ensure
     that they are less frequently used. Inaddition, the committee incharge o f the
     supervision o f the control reformprogram will be set up by the Government.

  g. To   build the capacities       for  public   expenditure   management,     as
    recommended inthe PEMFAR report, a study will be conducted to improve
    the structure and operation o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. This
    study will make recommendations ,among others in the following fields: a)
    preparation o f quarterly reports on the external debt, as well as the process
    and calendar o f settling domestic debt; b) identification o f redundant
    controls which could be avoided and simplified and an action plan for this
    simplification; c) identification o f the spending ministries which are
    supposed to benefit from the decongestion o f the administrative aspect o f
    the expenditure and an action plan to this end; and d) a better integration
    into the budget and better monitoring o f externally financed projects.

h.  To ensure the implementation o f the PEMFAR action plan, the Council o f
    ministers will each year adopt an annual program that will determine the

              order o f activities, their calendar and the specific duties o f the various
              administrative entities concemed.


IV.Monitoring ofthe program

57.    The Government will ensure the monitoring o f the program and the
implementation o f measures o f the structural reform matrix. To this end, two levels are
envisaged. On the technical level, a technical committee will be set up. Its members will
be appointed by decree of the Minister o f Economy and Finance. The Committee will be
made up of the team in charge o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance and the
representatives o f the Ministries involved inthe reforms. The Commissioner in charge o f
Economy at the Ministry o f Economy and Finance will chair this committee. At the
Government level, an inter-ministerial Committee will be set up by the Prime Minister
and made up o f Ministers in charge o f the reforms included in the credit as well as o f
representatives from the office o f the President. It will play an advisory role on solving
any issues noticed, based on periodic reports established by the Technical Committee.

     SpecialProgramandfor further integratingResourcesfrom Debt relief inthe
                         SectoralStrategiesfor PovertyReduction

1.Historv and context: Followingthe decision point reached byNiger inDecember 2000,
the Government, in collaboration with development partners decided at the time o f the
first Review o f the 2000-2003 Program, carried out in M a y 2001, to use the resources
released through the temporary assistance, to finance the President's special program
considered the first step toward the poverty reduction strategy. Within this framework,
the management methods o f the program were defined in agreement with the debt
partners including: budgeting, installation o f monitoring committee, management o f the
funds and evaluation. The program has always observed the following principles: a) the
active participation o f beneficiary communities at all levels o f the program
(identification, execution, and implementation); b) implementation o f investment with an
excellent value for money; c) closer monitoring o f the local, and regional authorities; and
d) the sustained involvement o f highranking state officials. However, after several years
o f implementation, an independent evaluation revealed the need to strengthen the
management mechanism o f the special program.

2. Obiective: Strengthening the management mechanism o f the Special Program will
comprise three aspects: (i)a greater involvement o f the sector ministries            in the
preparation o f the investments under the coordination o f the Steering Committee in
charge o f the Special Program, and inthe execution o f these investments under the strict
supervision o f this same Committee; (ii)  a taking into account by the line ministries o f the
amounts o f HIPC resources allocated to the sectors for which they are in charge; and (iii)
the association o f the sectoral ministries inthe commitment o f expenditure financed with
HIPC resources relating to their fields o f competence. The National, regional and sub-
regional committees o f the Special Program will continue to play an essential part inthe
supervision, advising and monitoringo f the program under the authority o f the President .
Inaddition, it will benecessaryto evaluate the implications ofthe investments carried out
by the Special program on the requirement o f recurrent spending to improve the quality
o f services offered by the ministries concerned, and to continue the efforts to ensure that
procurement rules are respected and that the works carried out have the desired level o f
quality.

3. Mechanism for strengthening the Special Program management mechanism: Future
stages o f the process o f strengthening the management mechanism o f the Special
Program will be as follows:

 lSt OnthebasisofnotificationofexpectedHIPCresources, proposalsforthe

consultation with the sector ministries concerned and within the general framework o f the
priorities o f the Budget Law.

3rd stage: Proposals for an allocation o f HIPC resources by the line Ministries on the
basis o f sectoral strategieswithin the normal framework o f annual budgetary arbitrations.

4thstage: Evaluation of the implementation of activities financed by HIPC resources in
the first half and at the end o f the year as from year 2006.

4. Roles of the monitoring committee: In addition to proposals for the inter-sectoral
distribution o f HIPC resources within the framework o f budget preparation, the steering
committee will monitor the implementation o f the program. The national, regional and
sub-regional pilot committees will continue to play their essential and important roles in
coordinating and supervising the Program under the authority o f the President. The
National Committee will also prepare an annual assessment o f the use o f HIPC resources
together with recommendations for the following years.

PartnershipinNiger's developmentstrategy

1.      Niger's poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), which was adopted in January
2002, presents a thorough poverty diagnosis and identifies key development challenges. The
government reconfirmed the main thrust o f the PRSP through a second progress report,
which was prepared ina consultative way involving all stakeholders and was validated by the
Government. Bank and Fund staf prepared a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN). The PRSP
outlines a sound strategy for poverty reduction centered around four strategic pillars: (i)   a
macroeconomic framework ensuring economic and financial stability while promoting
sustained and sustainable economic growth; (ii)      the development o f productive sectors,
especially inrural areas; (iii)
                              the development o f basic social services; and (iv) the promotion
of good governance and the strengthening o f human and institutional capacities. The
government has begunusing the PRSP to improve coordination o f development efforts inthe
country, including donor-supported activities. To that end, a donors' forum was held in
Niamey on June 7-8, 2003. At this forum, donors reaffirmed their endorsement o f the PRSP
as a strategic anchor for their assistance, and agreed on a progressive shift from project to
program financing, and the need for further coordination and harmonization o f policies and
procedures. Inthis regard, the signing o f a protocol relating to coordination among all donors
supporting the education sector i s a positive outcome and a great step forward. A revised
PRSP i s scheduled for preparation in2006. Inthe meantime, the Government i s committed to
prepare a third PRSP Progress Report in2005.

2.      The IMF i s in the lead in helping Niger maintain macroeconomic stability through a
new three year Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved by the
IMF Board in January 2005. The PRGF arrangement will address fiscal imbalances and
issues relevant to macroeconomic stability and economic growth. The PRGF arrangement's
structural conditionality has addressed areas related to budgetary and debt management,
petroleum pricing, utilization o f Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC
Initiative) resources, pensionreforms, andtransparency inpublic finances.

3.      The Bank leads the policy dialogue on structural reforms relevant to economic growth
and poverty reduction, including privatization and regulatory reforms, education, health and
rural development. The Bank and Fund share joint responsibility in supporting financial
sector and public expenditure reforms. The Bank and the Fund have also jointly assisted the
government in the preparation o f the PRSP and the first and second progress reports
assessing its implementation. They have also provided assistance to Niger for reaching the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
4.       Common objectives andjoint support for Niger's PRSP and HIPC Initiative processes
have increased collaboration between Fund and Bank in recent years. The Bank and Fund
teams are closely coordinating their policy advice to the authorities and work closely together
in the determination of structural conditionality. In general, the Bank leads the policy
dialogue on key structural aspects o fNiger's reform program while the Fundi s inthe lead on
policy dialogue on macroeconomic, particularly fiscal elements o f the reform (see Table 1).

Areas inwhich the Bank leads

5.        Privatization    and    regulatory     reform. Key       utility  sectors,   such   as
telecommunications and water supply have been liberalized and privatized, supported by a
Bank credit. However, the privatization o f the electricity utility (NIGELEC) has been
delayed mainly due to the difficulty in finding private companies ready to invest US$60-
100 million required for expansion and rehabilitation o f the power system. The privatization
of the whole sale petroleum product distribution company (SONIDEP) has failed in part
because o f difficulties in finding sound foreign private partners interested in investing in
Niger. With Bank's assistance, the authorities are revisiting their objectives and approach in
private provision o f infrastructure. The Fund i s also a key partner inthis policy dialogue and
has included elements o f the public enterprise reform agenda, such as the continuous
implementation o f a petroleum pricing system.

6.        Rural development. The Bank has provided support for developing and
implementing a comprehensive rural development strategy, which aims at mitigating
vulnerability and stimulating income generation, especially in rural areas. A rural
development strategy has beenrecently completed. Bank assistance inthis sector i s provided
through two ongoing (Private Irrigation and Agro-Pastoral Export Promotion) and one new
(Community Action Program) investment projects. Decreasing the dependence o f the vast
majority o f Niger's population on rain-fed subsistence agriculture i s a key objective o f this
strategy. Bank support in this area emphasizes the promotion o f small-scale irrigated
agriculture, livestock, farm and non-farm income-generating activities and cereal bank
construction. In addition, PERC would support measures to promote the rural development
sector inNiger.

7.        Social sector reforms. Improvement o f access for the poor to social services is one
of the strategic pillars in the PRSP. The Bank supports this objective through ongoing and
new lending operations, which combine project assistance with program support, as well as
analytical work, notably on population, gender, and poverty. There has also been close
collaboration between the Bank and the government in the design and implementation of
reforms in the education and health sectors, such as the introduction o f decentralized
recruitment o f teachers ("volunteer teachers") and health workers on a contractual basis. This
contractual recruitment program has helped address issues o f human resource shortages and
supply-side constraints while keeping payroll costs sustainable. PERC would support the
ongoing reforms in education sector. The Bank has also assisted the government in the
preparation o f a ten-year development plan inthe education sector (PDDE) that i s based on
the PRSP and includes a medium-termexpenditure framework for the basic education sector.
Ithas also provided assistance andplayed a key role inNiger's eligibility for participation in
the Education for All-Fast-Track       Initiative. In addition, a post primary education study i s
underway and it will be completed inMay 2005. Once the strategy on post primary education
 i s in place, it should be integrated with the PDDE. Inthe health sector, the Bank has worked
 with the government on the preparation o f the Strategic Orientations for Health Sector
 Development. The Government adopted a ten-year health policy strategy (2002-2011). Its
 main objectives are to further improve access to health services (from 47% in2000 to 80% in

                                               95


2011) and to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases, by promoting new approaches,
including preventive action. With a view to make this strategy more operational, the
Government has initiated the preparation o f a five-year development plan for the sector. The
Bank i s currently supporting the preparation o f a health SWAP which will include a
reproductive health component.

8.      Poverty monitoring. The Bank worked closely with the government inpreparing a
poverty profile that served as the basis for the PRSP poverty diagnosis. While this diagnosis
has been judged as thorough and comprehensive by the joint staff assessment (JSA), it i s
based on household survey data from 1993. Updating the existing database i s therefore an
important concern o f the government. A nationwide census has been completed recently, and
preparations for a new household survey are under way. A survey for Niamey was completed
in 2004. The Bank, together with other donors, is also advising the authorities on
strengthening institutional arrangements for the monitoring and the evaluation o f poverty in
the context o f the PRSP. In addition, the Bank i s preparing a Participatory Poverty
Assessment (PPA) and a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) o f revenue-enhancing
measures, as a contribution to the government's efforts to update and strengthen the
knowledge base on poverty and social development.

Areaswhere Bank andFundshare the lead

9.      Poverty reduction strategy. Together with other external development partners, the
Bank and Fund have jointly provided assistance to the government in the preparation o f the
PRSP. Since its completion, both institutions have jointly advised the authorities on the
refinement and implementation o f the strategy. The first and second progress reports on the
implementation o f the PRSP have been prepared with the assistance o f the Bank and the
Fund. Bank and Fund staff will provide technical assistance to the Nigerien authorities to
update the PRSP.

10.     Debt sustainability.The Bank and Fundhave supported the government's efforts to
reach the HIPC completion point in April 2004. The need to build technical and institutional
capacity for managing Niger's external debt has been stressed by the Fund and the Bank.
Several measures to strengthen the external debt unit were implemented as structural
benchmarks under the previous PRGF. Bank and Fundstaffs have also supported the external
evaluation o f the use o f HIPC resources under the President Special Program. PERC would
support measures to ensure full integration o f HIPC resources into sectoral programs.

 11.     Budgetary and public expenditure reforms. Strengthening public finances is a
prerequisite for success o f Niger's broader reform agenda. The Bank and Fundshare the lead
in this area. Both institutions have played key roles in helping the government reduce
 domestic and external arrears. While the Fund i s leading the dialogue on revenue-enhancing
measures, the Bank i s concentrating its efforts on budgetary reforms, inparticular inthe area
 of public expenditure. The Fund i s also making key contributions to improving budgetary
processes: a number o f important measures, such as preparation o f budget review laws and
 computerization o f budgetary expenditure, have been included as structural benchmarks in
the previous PRGF arrangement. The Bank has supported budgetary reforms through PEAC I
 and 11. Consolidating and deepening these reforms would be a critical objective o f PERC. In

                                               96


addition, the Bank intends to help strengthen Niger's fiduciary framework through the
implementation o f the recently completed Public Expenditure Management and Country
Financial Accountability       Assessment   (PEWCFAA)         and the     Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR).

12.      Financial sector reform. The Government launched a comprehensive financial
sector reform program in 2002. Supported by a World Bank project, the program covers the
regulatory and legal environment, the banking sector, micro-finance, postal financial services
and social security.' Some progress has already been realized. Two commercial banks, B C N
and BINCI and three insurance companies were restructured and recapitalized. Audits o f all
major micro-finance institutions have been completed. Restructuring plans for the post office
have been designed and staff reduction has started. Inthe next two to three years, measures
will be taken to improve the legal and judicial environment (modification of legislation for
the issuing o f land titles, improvement o f the legal framework for the taking o f guarantees,
training o f magistrates, etc.). The Housing Bank (CDN) will be either privatized or
liquidated; the Community Lending Bank (CPCT) will be restructured. Micro-finance
institutions will be restructured on the basis o f the results o f the audits, and the supervisory
unit at the Ministry of Finance will be strengthened. The post office will be split into two
entities, Niger Post, for pure mail transactions, and Fina Post, a financial services affiliate.
Finally, an actuarial audit was conducted o f the CNSS, the social security institution.

13.      Civil service reform and decentralization.The reform and modernization of the
civil service i s an important element o f Niger's PRSP, yet there has been little progress in
this area so far. The authorities are currently making an effort to put in place an integrated
civil service database. By allowing a more transparent and effective management o f the civil
service, this database should improve control over the wage bill. Controlling the wage bill i s
important for maintaining fiscal balance, as recognized by the previous PRGF arrangement,
which has set quantitative benchmarks for the wage bill. Planning for the implementation o f
the legal framework for political decentralization o f 1996 has recently gained momentum.
The first local elections took place on July 24, 2004. However, important concerns regarding
this reform remain, such as the lack o f capacity at the local level and the fiscal implications
o f decentralization. To help the government address some o f these concerns, the Community
Action Program will help build capacities in rural communities in planning, implementing,
and monitoring micro-development projects.

14.      Macroeconomic management. The main objectives o f Niger's macroeconomic
program, as stated in the PRSP, are to ensure economic and financial stability while
promoting sustainable and robust growth. The Fund i s supporting this program through its
PRGF framework by providing financial and technical assistance, as well as through
dialogue on macroeconomic policy reforms. The program has made satisfactory progress


     The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loanwas approved by the BoardinFebruary
     2004.

since approval o f the first PRGF arrangement in 2000 by achieving most o f its benchmarks
and overall positive fiscal performance. In the context o f the macroeconomic framework
underlying the PRSP, the Bank has provided technical assistance inbuilding capacity inthe
Ministry of Finance and Economy to monitor economic performance and macroeconomic
modeling.

15.    Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation is a key objective o fthe PRGF and i s supported by
a number of performance criteria and benchmarks. Increasing budgetary revenue in order to
progressively lower the government's reliance on external assistance i s particularly
important, given Niger's low level o f revenues, compared with regional partners in
WAEMU. In terms of expenditures, the Fund is mainly concerned with overall budget
envelopes, while the Bank focuses on inter and intrasectoral allocations, in particular in the
key sectors o f education, health, and rural development.

16.    Monetary policy. The Fund leads the policy dialogue on monetary policy, which i s
set by the regional monetary authorities (BCEAO). The PRGF arrangement includes
quantitative benchmarks for net bank credit to the government.

World Bank Group strategy

17.    The Bank's new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period 2003 to 2005 was
approved by the Bank Board in January 2003. Its main objective i s to support the
implementation and further refinement o f the PRSP. The strategic focus o f the CAS i s based
on the four pillars o f Niger's poverty reduction strategy. The CAS outlines a lending and
nonlending program that, in line with the Bank's comparative advantage, will selectively
provide assistance in areas relevant to these PRSP priorities. A CAS Progress report i s under
preparation.

18.    As o f January lSt,the World Bank lendingportfolio inNiger consisted o f nine
                            2005,
IDA operations, with a total commitment o f US$289.4 million. The CAS includes a base-
case IDA lending program o f US$238 million for FY 03 to FY 05. IDA has provided critical
financial and budgetary assistance to the Government. Interms o f gross disbursement, IDA
assistance has been important averaging about 1.5 percent o f GDP per year during the CAS
implementation period. IDA assistance has also helped reduce the volatility in ODA by
compensating short-term declines in assistance from other partners. IDA has also been
responsive to exogenous shocks. For instance, an Africa Emergency Locust Project (AELP)
aiming at fighting the locusts infestation inWest Africa will be delivered inFY05. All inall,
IDA financing may exceed the US$238 million of the CAS base case. The Bank's
nonlending program for the CAS period i s designed with a view to further assisting Niger in
refining its Poverty Reduction Strategy and building capacity for a gradual transition toward
programmatic lending.

  19.     The CAS outlines the Bank's Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) for the
  coming years. The AAA program will help the government refine the PRSP by designing
  policy responses to issues raised in the joint staff assessments o f the PRSP and PRSP
  progress report, such as poverty analysis, gender, population growth, and sources o f growth.
  The AAA program also aims at reinforcing public sector capacity in pursuit o f the PRSP's
  objectives and inpreparing Niger for the transition to consolidated programmatic lending. In
  support of these objectives, sector work on population, rural development, Public
  Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) and CPAR have
  been completed. Others are ongoing, including a Participatory Poverty Assessment (FY05)
  and a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) (FY 06).

  20.     The Bank i s committed to enhancing external partnerships in the framework o f the
  government's current efforts to mobilize and coordinate donor support for PRSP
  implementation. Besides the strong partnership with the Fund, the Bank i s collaborating with
  a number o f donors in different areas, including the European Union, the African
  Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and key
  bilateral donors involved indevelopment issues inNiger.
