for\n            Burkina Faso is designed to support the government's\n            poverty reduction strategy as set out in the June 2000\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The reform paper\n            focuses on improving basic service delivery. This\n            one-tranche operation would be the first of a planned series\n            of three PRSCs with a total amount of US$120 million\n            equivalent, prepared annually within a rolling, three-year\n            horizon. The credit provides financial support tp allow the\n            government to carry out its poverty reduction expenditure\n            program expeditiously and fully. By focusing on economy-wide\n            policy and institutional issues like broad public sector\n            reform, the PRSC is expected to help implement the poverty\n            reduction program in two ways. First, in the short run, the\n            credit helps maintain macroeconomic stability and creates\n            the conditions for accelerating growth by providing\n            quick-disbursing assistance in the context of slow growth\n            and lower-than-expected government revenues. Secondly, the\n            program associated with the credit helps poverty reduction\n            by improving the targeting and effectiveness of public\n            expenditures to the poor and actually channeling public\n            funds to more accountable local spending agencies. By\n            improving the availability and efficient use of public\n            resources for basic public services, and by stressing\n            delegation, accountability, and transparency in budget\n            management, the reform program should improve access to and\n            the quality of these services."}, "docdt": "2001-07-26T00:00:00Z"}
