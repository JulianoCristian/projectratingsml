FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the People's Republic of the Congo, for the equivalent of US$8.0
million to help finance a Second Education Project. The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.7 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report No. 804a-COB entitled "People's Republic of the Congo -
Economic Memorandum" was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 16,
1976. The following paragraphs reflect the findings and discussions with the
Government of economic missions which visited the country in March and October
1975, and February 1976. Annex I contains country data.
Structure and Resources
3.        With an area of 342,000 km2, about the size of Italy, the Congo
has a relatively small population of 1.3 million spread unevenly over its
territory. According to the 1974 census, about 38 percent of the inhabitants
live in urban areas with heavy concentration in the two major towns,
Brazzaville the capital (300,000), and Pointe Noire the main port on the
Atlantic (142,000), and in smaller centers all located close to the railroad
in the Southwest. Crop production contributes only 10-12 percent of GDP,
although agriculture is the mainstay of about half the population.
4.        Until recently, the Congo's economy was mainly influenced by its
historic importance as a seat of public administration, by its location
between the Atlantic Ocean and the landlocked interior of the continent, and
by the size of its forestry reserves. The fact that Brazzaville used to be
the capital of former French Equatorial Africa encouraged development of
Congo's relatively literate population, but imposed a burden on limited
public resources. The geographic location of the country made it a regional
center of commerce and transportation services for Chad, C.A.R., Cameroon
and Gabon. The Congo has extensive forests, which spurred development of the
timber industry. The country has some mineral resources and also has limited
fertile land mainly in the North and in the Niari Valley. A number of public
and private manufacturing enterprises were started in the 1960s, through
direct public investment and indirect incentive policies. All these various
characteristics of the Congolese economy have been reflected in the high
shares of GDP attributable to transport, trade and communications, public
administration and industry.
This document has a rutricted distriution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their oficial dutis. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorisation,



5.        A new and major feature of the Congolese economy was the start of
crude oil production from offshore reserves. These reserves, the full size
of which is still not known, are being developed through direct foreign in-
vestments, particularly French and Italian oil companies, since the early
1970s. Production started in December 1971 and reached a peak of 2.4 million
tons in 1974, to decline to 1.8 million tons in 1975. The 1976 output is
expected to be about that level.
6.        The People's Republic of the Congo is a socialist state, in which,
in fact, public and private activities exist side by side. Between 1969 and
1973 the Government took over a number of private enterprises. Progress has
been made in the settlement of disputes that arose from these nationaliza-
tions, and the 1974 and 1975 budgets included appropriations for this pur-
pose. Present policies aim at state participation in new investments of
foreign private enterprises. State participation in the equity of oil pro-
duction is at present 20 percent, with an agreed provision for increasing
this share at higher levels of output.
7.        The Congo belongs to the Franc zone, shares a Central Bank (BEAC)
with Gabon, Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic and is a member
of a customs and economic union (UDEAC). 1/ A fixed rate of 50 CFAF to the
French Franc is maintained, and the French Treasury guarantees fully unlim-
ited conversion of the CFA Franc into the French Franc. Credit creation by
the Central Bank is strictly governed by rules established by member coun-
tries and France.
Performance through 1973
8.        Official national accounts data are available for the years 1967
and 1970 only. They show that during this period overall economic growth
was about 8.1 percent per year in current prices and some 4 percent per
year in real terms. Population growth is estimated at 2.1 percent per
annum, so that per capita income increased only modestly. Later data on
physical output (timber, sugar, potash, cement, etc.) suggest a continua-
tion of these trends through 1972. Between 1972 and 1974, mainly owing to
the initiation of offshore oil production, real growth was estimated to be
about 10 percent per annum, but in 1975 through mid-1976, reflecting the
decline in petroleum as well as timber production, growth is estimated to
have been nil or even slightly negative.
9.        Prior to the end of 1973 when oil production became significant,
Congo's financial resources had always been pressed to the limit, as current
expenditure to achieve the Government's social aims absorbed most of current
1/   UDEAC has the same members as BEAC, except that Chad left UDEAC in
1969.

revenues. As a result, the bulk of development expenditures was financed
with foreign aid. The burgeoning system of state enterprises--many of which
have a low productivity--also imposed substantial claims i.n the form of fore-
gone tax revenues or transfers from the Government to finance capital expan-
sions as well as current operations. However, there was little scope for
raising government revenues above their average level of 20 percent of GDP.
Total expenditure rose faster than revenue, and overall deficits entailed
the use of Central Bank credi.t and prolonged delays in the settlement of
accounts payable to suppliers. As the prospects for oil brightened, for-
eign borrowing expanded; some public enterprises went directly to foreign
suppliers, while the Central Government borrowed abroad to launch an ambi-
tious program of public investment in economic and social Infrastructure.
Recent Developments and Short-Term Outlook
10.       The years 1974 and 1975 have seen a marked increase of about US$70
million average per year in the financial resources available to the Congolese
Government, reflecting the full impact of the rise in oil prices as well as
a renegotiation of tax agreements with oil-producing companies. With these
additional resources the Government reduced outstanding accounts payable, re-
constituted the financial position of several public enterprises, and made ade-
quate provision for debt service. Government current expenditures increased
somewhat less than the sharp Increase in revenues. Priority was given to
development-oriented current expenditures and completion of ongoing projects
in productive sectors and in education. However, current budget savings
covered only a small proportion of higher capital spending which was essen-
tially financed by additional domestic and foreign borrowing. Although gov-
ernment policy resulted in a substantial expansion of demand throughout the
economy, the balance of payments improved overall in 1974, and net foreign
exchange reserves Increased by US$21 million to the equivalent of about 1-1/2
months of imports.
11.       The current and capital budgets for 1975 were based on expecta-
tions of greater oil output, higher oiL revenues and another year of strong
economi.c activity. Instead, oil production fell by 25 percent because of
geological difficulties. Forecasts of growth in crude oil output had to be
revised downward at a time when European demand for timber, Congo's second
export, was slackening. Economic activity slowed down. By the end of the
year, an overall budget deficit of some US$70 million had to be financed
mostly by Central Bank credit to the maximum level permitted by the BEAC
rules (US$35 million), drawing on treasury deposi.ts, and an increase in pay-
ment arrears. Excess demand was reflected in increased imports, and despite
a rise in capital inflows, foreign exchange reserves were drawn down to a
level representing less than two weeks of imports. Finally, service obliga-
tions on Government borrowing which had been negotiated, in anticipation of
high future revenue growth, had mounted.
12.       At the end of 1975, the authorities recognized the seriousness
of the situation, and the Presi.dent appointed a new Government with a clear
mandate to redress the economic and financial situation. Soon afterwards



the Government implemented an austerity program. This program includes a
reduction of public investment as well as action to accelerate tax collec-
tion, limits central government employment and salaries, freezes personnel
expenditures and fringe benefits in deficit enterprises of the public sector,
and earmarks resources to the recently established "Caisse Congolaise d'Amor-
tissement," an agency in charge of public debt management.
13.       The last eight months therefore have been both for the economy
and for the economic policies of the country a period of adjustment to
reduced prospects for growth and to a concurrent slowdown in public revenue,
as compared to the prospects anticipated in 1973-1974, when oil production
expanded sharply and oil prices quadrupled. The results of the austerity
program set up eight months ago are beginning to be apparent. By the end of
June 1976, current expenditures were 15 percent lower than twelve months ago
and investment expenditures were 40 percent of the past year level, which
puts the level of overall expenditures at more than 25 percent below the
comparable level of the same period of last year.
14.       However, despite the tightening of public expenditures, the public
finance situation still presents problems since government receipts have been
adversely af'fected by the economic slowdown as well as the austerity program
itself. Oil and non-oil revenue have declined by about 20 percent. Thus,
the deficit of the Treasury has been considerably reduced but in the absence
of new borrowings at the Treasury level through June 1976, the cash position
of the Treasury was extremely tight, and delays were again taking place in
external debt servicing.
Longer Term Prospects
15.       The future growth of the Congolese economy will be determined by
five key factors: (a) the rate of crude oil development and production;
(b) the rapidity with which international demand for the country's raw mate-
rials--particularly timber--will pick up; (c) the relaxation of the trans-
portation constraint through realignment of the railway, a project which
alone will have a major impact on production and export of timber; (d) the
development of new skills required by the economy, and efficient use of human
resources; and (e) the effectiveness of the government in mobilizing resources
and allocating them to development. Compared to other countries, Congo is a
high-cost oil producer. Discoveries made between 1973 and 1975 are not con-
sidered commercially exploitable, and annual output from one new field going
into production mid-1977 is not likely to exceed 2.0 million tons. Since
output from the wells currently in production is about 1.8 million tons and
is expected to decline, production in excess of 2.5 million tons per year in
the 1980s will depend on new discoveries. At projected world prices, the
production which can reasonably be expected still represents net revenues
to the economy of some US$200 million per year. The longer term outlook
for tropical timber is favorable; Congo should have no difficulty marketing
all it can produce at profitable prices and through the realignment of the
CFCO railway the main transport bottleneck will be removed. Domestic and
foreign resource mobilization for investment will depend on the success of



the Government's stringent measures to contain public consumption and restore
public savings, and to maintain the confidence of foreign sources of funds.
In this respect, an important and urgent objective is to improve the produc-
tivity of public enterprises, a task the Government is now considering of the
highest priority.
16.       To finance the main part of its public investment program, Congo
has always relied on foreign financing, and it has indeed succeeded in attrac-
ting large amounts of capital from a growing number of donors. Disbursements
of official development aid, including grants and loans, mainly from France,
European Development Fund (FED), and centrally planned economies, averaged
about US$23 million (net) during 1970-1973. In 1974, disbursements on exist-
ing commitments, including borrowing from private sources for financing an
oil refinery, have increased to US$57 million which is an increase of 72
percent over the previous year. In 1975, the level of disbursements reached
about US$88 million. New loans (including those for ATC) of about US$175
million are being committed in 1976 from FED, ADB, France, CIDA, the Bank
Group, and other donors, and disbursements from these sources should already
begin by the end of the year.
External Debt
17.       Congo's outstanding public and publicly guaranteed debt, including
undisbursed is projected to amount to US$483 million at the beginning of
1976, of which US$325 million disbursed. The debt service ratio was 7.1
percent in 1974, and may be estimated at 13.1 percent for 1975. At the
end of that year Bank/IDA lending represented 10 percent of the debt out-
standing and disbursed and will go up to approximately 13.0 percent within
the next few years.
18.       As a consequence of the structure of the external debt, the period
1975-1977 is one of peak debt service, - particularly in relation to govern-
ment revenue, and the debt service is projected to decline afterwards. By
1980 or even somewhat earlier the Government should be able to achieve a
position in which the public sector could generate adequate domestic re-
sources after debt service to maintain its development expenditures at a
reduced but acceptable level. Congo is creditworthy for this loan. However
until the overall domestic financial situation has been strengthened, the
Government should limit new external commitments.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
19.       In view of its key role in the economies of Congo and neighboring
countries, the transport sector has received more than half of Bank Group
assistance to Congo. IDA and IBRD have helped finance investments in Congo's



dorsal transport network - the ATC system 1/, as well as in highways which
link the ATC network with Congo's major centers of economic activity. While
financing has been secured for ATC investments up to 1978, highway construc-
tion and maintenance will require further efforts. A second phase Highway
Maintenance Project, appraised in April 1976, would contribute to that end.
20.       Improving the quality of education and reorienting it to the man-
power requirements of the economy are the main preoccupations of the Govern-
ment in the education sector. Our first education project helped with teacher
training as well as vocational and technician training. Our second railway
project has a large training component for railway technicians and managers.
The proposed Second Education Project would help train forestry technicians,
as well as teachers for primary and technical schools. It would also help
improve educational planning and publications.
21.       The Bank Group assistance to mining and livestock helped the diver-
sification of the economy. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits as of October 31, 1976, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. This statement excludes a 1959 Bank loan of US$35
million to COMILOG, a mining company owned by French and US interests.
This loan helped finance a manganese mine, a cableway and a rail link to
the Chemin de Fer Congo Ocean (CFCO) and manganese port facilities in Pointe
Noire. While the mine and the cableway are located in Southern Gabon, the
railway and the port are on Congolese territory. The project is operating
successfully, and COMILOG prepaid the Bank loan in 19.72.
22.       A Three-Year Development Program was published in early 1975.    In
view of Congo's present tight fiscal situation, the authorities are in the
process of reviewing this Program. Pending this revision and subsequent
discussions with the authorities on Congo's future performance and external
assistance requirements, the Bank is concentrating on the abovementioned
second-phase Highway Maintenance Project.
PART III - EDUCATION IN CONGO
The Education System
23.       The Congolese system of general education follows the French
pattern, consisting of six years of primary school, a secondary program
divided into a four-year lower cycle and a three-year upper cycle, and a
tertiary level of university study. Responsibility for education and train-
ing is shared between the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education and
1/   Agence Transcongolaise des Communications; the 3,000 km road, river
and rail network which connects Central Africa with the ocean port of
Pointe Noire.



the Ministry of Higher Education. The latter ministry's jurisdiction in-
cludes all vocational schools, such as those for primary teacher, health
and agricultural training, as well as the University of Brazzaville. The
national pedagogical research institute (INRAP) is responsible for develop-
ing and testing reformed curricula, teaching methods and instructional mate-
rials at the primary and secondary levels.
Recent Developments and Constraints
24.       Enrollments at all levels have grown rapidly, responding both
to popular demand and to the Government's desire to increase the supply of
trained manpower. From 1968 to 1973, enrollment growth in general secondary
and technical education averaged 25 and 15 percent per annum respectively,
while university enrollments increased by 18 percent per year. Primary
enrollments have grown more slowly, at 6 percent per year, due to the nearly
100 percent enrollment rate of the primary school age group. Despite the
large number of children in school, the Congolese education system faces
a number of problems. These include:
(a) education and training programs that are insufficiently adapted
to the country's employment needs;
(b) difficult learning conditions due to inadequate facilities and
lack of books and trained teachers, especially in primary edu-
cation, reflected in low student performance and high repeater
rates; and
(c) weaknesses in education planning and administration.
25.       Employment Requirements and Output from the Education System.    Man-
power projections show that engineers, technicians, technical teachers and
skilled workers are likely to be in short supply over the next decade. The
projected shortage of technically trained persons is due both to the small
number of students enrolled in technical institutions and to the insufficient
quality of training at most technical schools. Many of the graduates have
received a training unrelated to industry's needs or have been trained under
such inadequate conditions that their skills are weak. Most technical train-
ing institutions suffer from serious overcrowding, chronic shortages of
equipment and materials, insufficient numbers of trained Congolese teachers
and heavy emphasis on theoretical training. The Bank Group's first educa-
tion project is helping to improve the technical/vocational training system.
However, a stronger planning mechanism is required within both ministries
of education to plan enrollment growth in relation to anticipated manpower
requirements, to develop more job-related training programs, to strengthen
liaison with industry and to coordinate between the two ministries.
26.       Internal efficiency and quality.   Rapid expansion of enrollments
has had a deleterious effect on learning conditions and the internal effi-
ciency of the education system. Nowhere is this more evident than in pri-
mary education, where the pupil/teacher ratio is 63:1 and the proportion



-8-
of trained teachers is only 57 percent of total staff. Pupil/teacher ratios
remain high through lower secondary school (at 55:1 in 1974). Overcrowded
classrooms, absence of books and other educational support materials, and
inadequate provision and utilization of practical work facilities, which
characterize every level of the system, all act to depress student perfor-
mance. More and better trained teachers and increased provision of equip-
ment and materials would help to improve student performance. However, the
Government already devotes 24 percent of the current budget to education
and cannot afford to permit recurrent education expenditure to grow as
rapidly as in the past (11.7 percent in real terms, 1964-1973, versus 6.3
percent for the Government's total current budget). Hence, increasing the
efficiency of the system will require a careful assessment of what quality-
improving measures can best raise progression rates and student performance
at the lowest cost.
27.       Access to Education Opportunities.   All education in Congo is
public and in principle compulsory up to 16 years of age. With such a
high proportion of the primary school-age population in school, educational
opportunity is more equitable in Congo than in many other African countries.
Equal opportunity extends in large measure to both sexes, at least at the
lower levels: girls constitute 46 percent of primary school enrollments
and 39 percent of enrollments in lower secondary school. There are, how-
ever, certain imbalances which the Government wishes to correct. One of
these is geographical disparity in the quality of educational opportunity:
the northern part of the country suffers from even more acute shortages
of teachers, books and supplies than do schools in the south. Another
imbalance in educational provision is the small proportion of the budget
allocated for books and materials. Schoolbooks are scarce; since most are
imported and expensive, they are beyond the financial reach of the majority
of parents. The Government is therefore examining ways of supplying cheaper
instructional materials to students through local book production.
The Government's Education Plans
28.       Pending the preparation of longer term development plans and
educational reforms, the planning unit of the Ministry of Primary and
Secondary Education has prepared a three-year education development pro-
gram, 1975-1977. The main objectives of the program are the following.
For primary education: reduction of the number of repeaters, improve-
ment of the teacher/pupil ratio as well as the average qualifications of
teachers, revision of curricula, and strengthened supervision of schools.
For secondary education: a modest increase in the intake, a more prac-
tically-oriented curriculum, expansion of boarding capacity, progressive
Africanization and upgrading of teachers and decentralization of school
facilities. The Government does not have a comparable program for tech-
nical and higher education although officials have identified the need for
long-range comprehensive planning. The proposed project would strengthen
the Government's education planning capacity, support qualitative improve-
ments in the education system and help reorient education and training to
manpower requirements.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
29.       The first Bank Group education project (Credit 237-COB of March
1971) provided US$3.5 million to assist the Government in increasing the
number of primary teachers and in improving the employment orientation
of secondary level education. It included provision for expansion of
science teaching in secondary schools and for the establishment of a
primary teachers college, a rural vocational training center and a tech-
nician training institute. Construction is running about 18 months behind
schedule due to initial delays in design work, frequent shortage of building
materials, and poor performance of some contractors which necessitated re-
award of some of the civil works contracts. The vocational training center
has been operating for about a year and the secondary school extensions are
almost completed. The remaining schools are to be completed by March 1977.
The project has encountered a cost overrun and a small supplementary IDA
credit to offset effects of currency realignment on Credit 237-COB will be
submitted to the Board in due course. The project is now well managed.
30.       The Government of Congo requested Bank assistance to prepare a
second education project based on identification work by Unesco. A Bank
mission appraised the project in March 1976. A report entitled "Appraisal
of a Second Education Project in Congo" No. 1217-COB dated November 22, 1976
is being distributed separately and a Loan and Project Summary is attached
to this report as Annex III. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held
in Washington from September 7 to 10, 1976 with a Congolese delegation led
by Ambassador Nicolas Mondjo, Congo's Permanent Representative to the United
Nations.
Project Description
31.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a) Construction or conversion of buildings, furniture and/or
equipment for:
(i) a 320-place primary teachers college at Owando, a regional
capital in Northern Congo, to train 170 primary teachers
annually;
(ii) an educational publications unit at the national pedago-
gical research institute, for managing the preparation,
printing and distribution of textbooks and school
materials;
(iii) a 120-place technical teacher training department at the
secondary teacher training institute for training 50
industrial and commercial teachers per year for the
secondary level;



- 10 -
(iv) a forestry school at Mossendjo to train 20-25 middle-level
forest technicians per year for the forest administration
and forest industries; and
(v)  the planning units of the two ministries of education, for
the preparation of educational development programs.
(b)  The provision of 33 man-years of technical assistance and 47 man-
years of fellowships for the above and architectural consultant
services for preparation of a possible future project.
(c)  Staffing, equipment and operating expenditures for project admin-
istration.
Implementation
32.       The project unit established under Credit 237-COB, responsible to
the two education ministries, would administer the proposed second project.
The unit is headed by a senior official of the Ministry of Higher Education
who serves as part-time director.   Full-time project unit staff would include
a coordinator, an educational adviser, an architect, an engineer during the
construction period, and support staff. The project architect would have
primary responsibility for the design, planning and supervision of the con-
struction of all project institutions. He would be assisted by- the project
engineer and supported by the Directorate of Construction., Town,Planning and
Housing. The architect has been appointed and design work for project is in
progress. The Government would take the necessary steps to establish the
forestry school, adopt its statutes and curricula and provide incentives for
staff recruitment and retention. An understanding has been reached with the
Government regarding the main features to be included in the decree creating
the forestry school. An interministerial planning committee would be created
to ensure coordination between the planning units of the two education ministries.
The planning units would prepare a long-term sector development plan as well as
short-term investment program. The Government would set up a production. and
distribution system for text books and school materials.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at CFAF 2.6 billion,
or US$11.4 million equivalent, excluding taxes and customs duties, with a
foreign exchange component of US$8.0 million equivalent, representing 70
percent of the total. The distribution of costs per category net of taxes,
including contingencies, is as follows: civil works, 45 percent; furniture
and equipment, 23 percent; architectural services, 2 percent; technical assis-
tance and fellowships, 27 percent; and project administration, 3 percent.
The estimated average unit cost of school building construction per square
meter of gross area is US$280. This unit cost is high due to the location
of the majority of civil works in more remote areas of the country where
construction costs average at least 80 percent higher than in the capital
of Brazzaville. The proposed Bank Loan of US$8.0 million would cover the
foreign exchange component and Government would finance the remaining costs.
The recurrent expenditure incurred by project institutions is expected to
constitute less than two percent of the Government's education budget and
should not create financing difficulties.



Procurement and Disbursements
34.       Contracts for building works (US$5.1 million), furniture (US$0.4
million) and equipment (US$2.2 million) would be awarded following international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The building
works are within the capacity of Congo's construction industry; contractors
would, however, be prequalified. To the extent practicable, contracts for
furniture and equipment (US$2.6 million) would be let in packages of at least
US$50,000. Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a
preferential margin of 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of competing imports or
the total applicable customs duties and import taxes, whichever is lower.
Small items of furniture and equipment which cannot be grouped in packages of
at least US$50,000 would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
35.       The funds from the Loan Account would be disbursed to finance 100
percent of the foreign cost of equipment and materials or 90 percent of cost
if procured locally; 70 percent of expenditures for furniture; 80 percent of
expenditures for architectural services, technical assistance and fellowships;
70 percent of expenditures for project administration; and 55 percent of ex-
penditures for civil works. US$1.5 million of the loan would be unallocated
to cover contingencies. Any funds remaining undisbursed at the completion of
the project would be cancelled.
Project Benefits
36.       The proposed project would assist in strengthening the Congo's edu-
cation system in the following essential areas: The project would support
qualitative improvements in learning opportunities, especially at the elemen-
tary level, by expanding and improving primary teacher training to decrease
the pupil/teacher ratio and the proportion of untrained teachers. The training
program would moreover provide pedagogical support to primary schools in the
more disadvantaged northern part of the country. Local preparation and
production of textbooks and other educational materials would also contribute
to qualitative improvements in education by increasing the suitability and
availability of books and materials. In the process, the capabilities of the
country's pedagogical research institute to develop and test reformed curricula
and instructional materials would be strengthened.
37.       The project would also help adapt the education system more
to employment needs by establishing programs to train secondary technical
teachers and middle-level forest technicians, thereby increasing the supply
of technicians where manpower shortages are projected to be most acute.
Finally, it would reinforce the Government's educational planning capabil-
ity so as to better program the future development of the education system.
There are no unusual risks associated with the project.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the People's Republic of the
Congo and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft reso-
lution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
39.       The special features described in paragraph 32 of this report are
reflected in Sections 3.07, 4.04 and 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement.
Agreement between ONLP and INRAP concerning prices of textbooks and educational
material as well as methods and periods of reimbursement for services rendered
would be a condition of disbursement with regard to the educational publications
unit.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Cr. No. 237 Education Project: US$3.5 million Credit of March 26, 1971;
Effective Date: July 30, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The project consists of (a) the construction, furnishing and equip-
ment of (i) a teacher training college at Loubomo; (ii) a technician training
institute at Pointe Noire; (iii) a vocational training center at Boko; and
(iv) extensions to two general secondary schools at Pointe Noire and
Brazzaville; and (b) the provision of 26 man-years of technical assistance.
Construction is about 18 months behind schedule due to: (a) initial
delays in appointing the consulting architects, in design work and in procure-
ment, (b) frequent shortages of building materials, and (c) the poor perform-
ance of some contractors which necessitated cancellation and re-award of some
of the civil works contracts. The project is now well managed and proceeding
satisfactorily. The Boko vocational training center has been operating 10
months, extensions to secondary schools are almost completed; the civil works
for remaining schools should be completed by March 1977. Cost overruns amount
to about US$1.3 million due largely to a decline in the exchange rate since
appraisal. About US$0.7 million of the cost overrun is being financed under
bilateral technical assistance.   The Government has asked the Bank Group to
finance part of the remaining gap.
Cr No. 435 Livestock Project: US$5.6 million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is designed to increase both the supply of beef and
trypanotolerant breeding cattle, and to provide training and applied
research. High mortality and lower-than-expected weaning rate related to
inadequate management, coupled with difficulty to procure breeding cattle,
have caused herd development to fall behind appraisal estimates. A new
Project Director i.s presently in charge. The mortality problem is now
under control and herd fertility is improving. The project is incurring
significant cost overruns but with beef prices about double the original
estimate it is possible to develop a viable ranch provided good management
standards are maintained.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 1228 Second Railway Project: US$38.0 million Loan of April 12,
1976; Effective Date: November 22, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project covers ATC investment plan for 1974-1980, comprising:
(a) CFCO Railway: realignment of 88 km and improvement of 18 km of the
Holle-Loubomo section, procurement and renewal of locomotives and rolling
stock; track renewal, installation of signalling systems, and expansion of
workshops; (b) River Services: procurement of mechanical handling equip-
ment and additional floating craft, expansion of Brazzaville workshops,
and deepening of river channels; (c) Port of Pointe Noire: provision of
an additional stacking area for timber handling, construction of new manga-
nese and general cargo berths, and dredging; and (d) ATC Headquarters: im-
provement of training facilities and programs. Execution of the main civil
works contract (CFCO Railway) is under way.

Procurement Arrangements:
Contracts for building works (US$5.1 million), furniture (US$0.4
million) and equipment (US$2.2 million) would be awarded following international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.    The building
works are within the capacity of Congo's construction industry; contractors
would, however, be prequalified. To the extent practicable, contracts for
furniture and equipment (US$ 2.6 million) would be let in packages of at least
US$50,000. Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a
preferential margin of 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of competing imports or
the total applicable customs duties and import taxes, whichever i.s lower.
Small items of furniture and equipment which cannot be grouped in packages of
at least US$50,000 would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Technical Assistance:
The loan would finance 33 man-years of technical assistance, at a
total cost of US$2.2 mi.llion.
