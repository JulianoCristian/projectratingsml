SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1349 COB)
PREFACE
A completion mission visited the People's Republic of the Congo in
November/December 1984 to compare the outcome of the Second Education Project
(Loan 1349-COB) with the objectives specified at appraisal and in the Loan
Agreement. The Loan of US$8.0 million was approved by the Board of Executive
Directors in Nay 1977. The Loan was formally closed on December 31, 1983,
although technical assistance continued until September 1984. The total
amount of the Loan was disbursed in 1984.
The Operations Evaluation Department decided not to audit the
project and sent the PCR to the Borrower and its agencies for comments in
October 1985.  Cooments received have been taken into account in finalizing
the PCR and are reproduced as Attachment I.

PROJECT COMPLITION REPORT
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1349-COB)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project arose from a joint Bank/UNESCO mission in April/May
1974 to determine educational priorities In agreement with the Government.
The project was appraised in March 1976 and approved in May 1977. Total
estimated costs were US$11.38 million of which the Loan was to meet US$8
million. Final project costs have amounted to US$11.34 million. Tht
Government's contribution was entirely covered by an OPEC loan of US$4
million, the baltnce of which was used to buy additional equipment.
Object. es
The project was designed to provide support for the education
development plan by: (a) improving the quality of teaching, especially at
the primary level, by improving the training of primary school teachers,
publishing teaching manuals, and strengthenlag tne capacity of the National
Institute for Curriculum Development (INRAP); (b) orienting the education
system towards the job market by improving curricula for training technical
teachers and forestry technicians; and (c) enhancing the education planning
services for more efficient programming (paras. 1.1, 1.2).
In order to attain these objectives, the project provided for the
construction and conversion of buildings, furniture and equipment for the
following: (i) a primary teacher training college (ENI); (ii) a unit for
educational publications at the National Institute for Curriculum Development
(INRAP); (iii) a program for training technical teachers; (iv) a National
Forestry School (ENEF); and (v) a planning unit. The project also provided
for (a) 33 man-years of technikal assistance and 47 man-years of
scholarships; and (b) staffing, equipment, and operating expenditures for
project administration (paras. 1.3, 1.4).
Implementation Experience
The loan account was formally closed at the end of December 1983,
24 months after the Closing Date foreseen at appraisal. The following
problems occurred:  (i) project administration--there was no accountant, no
accounting system, and no bookkeeping personnel, and there was little
coordination of the several project components; (ii) technical



- v -
assistance-only a small percentage of this objective was achieved because of
the large reduction in the number of specialists, and in the duration of the
contracts; (iii) implementation delays--of the education programs because of
the unsuitability and inadequacy of part of the equipment at ENSET and ENI;
and (iv) lack of recurrent funds--caused the incomplete use of equipment and
buildings, and Inadequately maintained equipment (paras. 2.5, 2.6, 3.6, 3.9,
3.12, 3.14-3.20, 4.14, 6.7 and 6.8).
Results
Despite the difficulties and problems outlined above the project
attained most of its objectives. Positive achievements and the benefits
which the project brought to the country include: the construction of all
the planned facilities; the development of primary school teacher training;
qualitative and quantitative improvement in training technical teachers;
studies and analysis of the education system; strengthening of the
publication and research facilities of INRAP; and acquiring of professional
skills through scholarships (paras. 5.8, 5.15, 5.22, 5.25, 5.34, 6.3 and
6.5).
Sustainability
The sustainability of project benefits needs to be assured by all
project institutions being provided with adequate operating budgets to allow
them to utilize and maintain the equipment and buildings which have been
provided under the project.
Findings and Lessons
The major lessons for the Bank emerg'ag from the experience of this
project include: (paras. 6.14-6.18)
-    the need to simplify project design; the project was too complex
for a weak government administration to undertake; some components
have not yet produced the benefits expected at appraisal;
-    the necessity of recruiting adequate administrative and management
personnel for the Project Implementation Unit, i.e. accountant,
bookkeeper, procurement specialist, etc. and ensuring that an
efficient record system is set up; the Bank should also verify
accounts and exert more control of accounts during supervision
missions;
-    supervision missions should be better spaced, and staffing of the
missions (e.g. disbursement officer, accountant) should bear a
relation to the difficulties encountered by the project so that
attempts to solve these problems can be undertaken while the
supervision mission is in the field; and



-vi-
equipment lists and physical facilities should be reviewed to
ascertain that equipment is appropriate to the level of technology
and field of training, and that physical facilities are designed
consistent with equipment use,
The major lessons emerging for the Government include: (paras. 6.19-6.26).
-    status of teachers at ENEF and ENSET should be-clarified;
-    curricula reform and/or other measures should be examined to allow
levels of industrial training courses at ENSET to match techniques
taught and practices in CETS;
-    a different legal status with some degree of financial autonomy
should be considered for INRAP to facilitate the marketing of
books;
-    the sequencing of construction and equipment deliveries should be
carefully planned and coordinated.



CHAPT1aR I
BACKGROUND AND CONTENT OF THE PROJECT
A.   Project Generation
1.1       World Bank assistance for a second Education Project was
requested following a joint mission by Unesco and the Bank in April/May
1974 to determine the educational priorities in agreement with the
Government of the Congo. Unesco was then invited to send a mission to the
Congo in May 1975 to identify and prepare a new project. Subsequently, a
Bank mission visited the Congo in September/October 1975 to complete and
finalize this preparation. The project was appraised in March 1976 by a
Bank mission, approved in May 1977 and became effective in October of the
same year. The estimated cost was US$11.38 million of which US$8 million
was to be funded by the Bank.
B.   Objectives
1.2       As stated at appraisal, the project would provide support in
those areas designated by the Government for its education development
plan. This aimed at:
(a) improving the quality of teaching, particularly at primary level
by:
(i) extending and improving teacher training in order to
increase the percentage of qualified teachers and to give
extra teaching support to primary schools in the north;
(ii) preparing and producing in the Congo teacher guides and
other teaching aids adapted to local requirements,
increasing the quantity distributed and, at the same time,
strengthening the INERAP so that it might develop and
experiment in curricula and new pedagogical tools;
(b) orienting the education system to manpower needs by instituting
curricula for training technical teachers and forestry
technicians, that segment of the workforce where needs are
greatest;
(c) strengthening the Government's educational planning services for
more efficient programing.
C.   Project Components
1.3       At appraisal the project included:
(a) the construction or conversion of buildings, furniture and/or
equipment for:
(i) a primary teacher training college (ENI) and boarding
facilities for 320 students at Owando;



- 2 -
(ii)  a unit for educational publications at the INRAP;
(iii) a suitable curriculum for training technical teachers at the
Technical Teacher Training Institute at Brazzaville with a
boarding capacity for 120 students;
(iv) a Nationel Forestry School (ENEF) at Mossendjo for 75
resident students and its annex at Ouesso, for training
20/25 forestry technicians each year;
(v) the Planning Unit (DGP) at the MEN;
(b) technical assistance consisting of 33 manyears of consultants and
47 manyears of scholarships to achieve the points described in
sub-paragraph (a) above, and architects' services to prepare a
possible future project;
(c) hiring staff, purchasing equipment and financing the recurrent
costs of project administration.
1.4       There was no major change in the project content outlined at
appraisal other than a considerable reduction in technical assistance
requested by the Government following a Unesco mission which considered
that Congolese technicians were sufficient in number and quality and that
bilateral aid would partly fund assistance (para 3.16).
CHAPTER II
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION
2.1       The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the Ministry of National
Education (MEN) had been established for the first project (237-COB) and
was given the responsibility of implementing the second project.
2.2       The personnel administering the project have been completely
changed between the first and second projects, but remained relatively
stable during the second project implementation, except for the post of
architect (Table 2.1). Additionally, the French Government Fund for Aid
and Cooperation (FAC) provided technical assistance (an architect and an
educational adviser) over the first four years of the project; these two
experts were later replaced by nationals.
2.3       Invitations to bid for civil works were sent out by the PIU and
the Central Division of Town Planning and Housing (DCUH) after preselecting
companies. Contracts were awarded to the lowest evaluated tenders for the
ENI and the ENEF but in the case of the INRAP and the ENSET, a disagreement
occurred between the Bank and the PIU. A further restricted invitation to
bid and a reassessment of the tenderers, and their offers, caused a delay
of about a year in constructing these two institutions.
2.4       The PIU with assistance from the DCUH supervised sites at
national and regional levels.



-3-
2.5       Insufficient initial focus on accounting and the lack of a
professional accountant were serious handicaps during thc whole of project
implementation (Chapter IV). Bookkeeping was generally limited to a
chronological recording of expenditure with a number of errors of
classification. The final report of the project also contained errors and
required revision of all summaries of costs and expenditures by year, by
component and category, using information supplied by the PIU and the Bank.
2.6       Project execution suffered from having no procurement specialist.
Lack of coordination between the PIlU and the directors of institutes
delayed the delivery of equipment and the arrival of the technical
assistance.
2.7       Purchase of additional equipment and the last construction work
are now being supervised by the three persons remaining in the PItJ.

CHAPTER III
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Duration of the Project
3.1       The loan agreement was signed on May 5, 1977 and became effective
on October 14, 1977. The Closing Date which was originally the
December 31, 1981 was postponed to December 31, 1983, although technical
assistance continued until September 1984.



-4 -
B.   Implementation of Physical Facilities
(i) Sites
3.2       Because the INRAP, the ENSET and the Mossendjo ENEF use existing
buildings, no new sites were required. The Owando ENI could not be built
on the site selected during appraisal and in 1977 a new site was selected
outside the town, requiring the revision of architectural studies and
postponement of the work.
(ii) Professional Services
3.3       Part of the studies were entrusted to the PIU architect and a
private design office was asked to prepare the bidding documents.
3.4       Building design is similar to that of the first project,
excepting that at Mossendjo Forestry School wood is used as the main
material for new buildings.
3.5       Building design is generally good, but the following should be
noted:
-    the overall design of the Owando ENI is very rigid and does not
distinctly separate the various functions;
-    as the layout of the INRAP premises was not adapted to needs,
extra partitioning work had to be carried out after site work had
been completed;
-    certain premises are not large enough and greater care should
have been taken when studying their location; for example, the
ENSET civil engineering workshop is too narrow and noisy. It was
transferred outside the building but its replacement by a
sheetmetal workshop has only increased the noise.
(iii) Construction
3.6       Construction financed by the project has been completed, apart
from some finishing work which remains to be done at the ENEF and the ENI.
Some unsatisfactory workmanship should be made good during the warranty
period.
3.7       Procurement.  There were no offers from foreign contractors to
the international invitations to bid and major local contractors did not
seem to be interested in work of which a considerable part (45%) was
Government-financed which meant delays in payment. Consequently, the work
was entrusted to small- and medium-size contractors and was inadequately
supervised; site delivery was delayed due to lack of transport. In the
case of the very distant site at Ouesso, the contract was cancelled and
given by mutual agreement to a local company but this considerably
increased delays by two years and costs by 197%.
3.8       Furthermore, the following technical problems were also
encountered:



-    although included in the architectural plans, the wastewater
evacuation system was not built at all institutions, which proved
disastrous for the sloping sites of Owando and Ouesso where there
is considerable erosion;
-    the Mossendjo ENEF generator was unable to supply all the
electricity needed and a second, bought with OPEC funds, is to be
delivered shortly;
-    the water supply to the ENEF is continually interrupted due to
having installed a faulty pump. The earth connection of the
first pump proved too weak when the pump was struck by
lightning, and the new pump financed by the project broke down
continually;
-    the security bars on the groundfloor windows are too widely
spaced so most of the glass slats were stolen. They Eave been
replaced by plywood slats which allow insufficient light to pass;
-    the project should have included boundary walls in order to
prevent the frequent thefts of equipment and materials.
(iv)  Furniture
3.9       The furniture, made entirely in the Congo, is simple, sturdy and
generally well suited to use. Lists and amounts were specified by the PIU
and were sufficient for most premises. The following observations can
nevertheless be made:
-    Owando ENI students arrived before the furniture; therefore,
provisional furniture had to be temporarily borrow'ed from another
building;
-    some of the furniture for the ENI workshops and boarding houses
was refused by the PIU as being sub-standard; a new delivery was
due in 1985 after settlement of the dispute. In the meantime,
the workshops were used as classrooms;
-    no shelving was provided for most warehouses and stores so that
storage of equipment, consumables, materials and provisions is
disordered and unhygienic.
(v) Equipment
3.10      The lists, amounts and their specifications were prepared by the
PIU with expatriate assistance an4, for the ENSET, were revised by a
consultant technical educator.
3.11      Procurement.  Equipment was procured by international bidding in
lots and in conformity with the norms laid down by the 3ank.



-6-
3.12      The following observations apply to this equipment:
-    despite the considerable amount of work by the Bank, preparation
of lists, deliveries and Installation of equipment were
insufficiently coordinated by the PIU, the receiving institutions
and the suppliers. This resulted in the theft of equipment and
materials immediately on delivery. Furthermore, as the directors
of the institutions concerned did not receive copies of the
orders, they were unable to check the deliveries;
-    the schedule of deliveries imposed on the suppliers should have
been more flexible to allow for delays in construction;
-    as it was envisaged that libraries would be UNDP-funded, the
project did not provide for purchasing books; the institutions'
libraries were completely empty apart from the ENEF which
received a few books from Unesco;
-    there is little justification for buying gas cookers for
Mossendjo, Ouesso and Ovando considering the very small operating
budgets and the difficulties of gas supply. Furthermore, the
wood-burning cookers delivered to Owando and Mossendjo cannot be
used due to problems over the installation of chimneys. Added to
this, the cold stores have not been used because there is no fuel
for the electric generators, so the purchase of heavy equipment
for the kitchens has so far been useless.
3.13      Specific problems of equipping each institution are as follows:
-    the INRAP's equipment, consumables and stock of papers were
delivered before on-site work had finished and this led to theft
and/or deterioration due to storing under unsuitable conditions.
Book production was held up by a camera breaking down which is
still unrepaired. Most of the 23 vehicles supplied were in
general use at the INRAP so that several of them were already out
of service or past repair before they could deliver the teaching
manuals, the production of which had not yet begun;
-    the outboard motorboat, also provided by the project for
distributing the books, sank before it was operational and has
only recently been replaced;
-    equipment for the ENSET was considerably reduced by the PIU to
keep to the planned budget; the metrology, mechanical engineering
and language laboratories were left without equipment for some
time. (This shortfall, which was accentuated by an increase in
enrollment, was eventually remedied under OPEC financing.) In
addition, part of the equipment is too sophisticated for training
teachers for a CET level;
-    the Ouesso branch of the ENEF, at 1,200 km from Mossendjo, could
not be used due to operating difficulties inherent to its
distance from the ENEF school at Mossendjo.



-7-
C.   Technical Assistance
3.14      Technical assistance allocated under the project for the five
components included 396 manmonths of expert services and 564 manmonths of
scholarships.
3.15      This program was entrusted entirely to Unesco in May 1978 and was
carried out under three successive but greatly modified contracts
(Annexes 5 and 6):
-    the number of scholarships was reduced by 30% and their duration
by 21%;
-    the distribution of scholarships by institution was modified in
favor of the DGP (+107%) and at the expense of the ENEF (-55%);
-    the number of experts was reduced from 15 to 6 and the total
duration of contracts by -63%.
3.16      A considerable reduction in expert assistance resulted from
negotiations between Unesco and the Government in October 1980. The
reduction was explained by the following:
-    bilateral aid would partly provide assistance;
-    those Congolese who had benefited from scholarships under the
project would be assigned certain posts;
-    the increased cost of technical assistance would cut down the
number of posts foreseen at appraisal.
3.17      The Bank eventually, although reluctantly, agreed to a package
featuring a reduction in the number of experts, combined with an increased
number of scholarships.
3.18      Technical assistance experienced a further considerable delay
because it took six months to prepare a third Unesco contract. A further
year elapsed between contract signature and recruitment of the first
expert, at which point the Government considered terminating its contract
with Unesco in 1982. The experts' contracts were then extended beyond the
closure of the project on the Bank's recommendations.
3.19      In general, all project components suffered both by this delay
and from the reduction of the length of assistance, as the experts arrived
too late to help prepare lists, to receive and install the equipment, or
prepare curricula. Furthermore, the length of their contract was
insufficient to allow them to complete the training of local counterparts.
The Government found that TA provided under the project had not been
satisfactory.
3.20      As for scholarships, the overall situation was unsatisfactory:
out of thirty-three scholarship holders, five holders did not return to the
Congo and eight others were assigned to different jobs (Annex 6).



-8-
D.   Project Implementation
3.21      Regarding the compliance with loan covenants, results are varied
and often only partially completed. Among those covenants not complied
with are the classification and updating of information on the project and
adequate bookkeeping (Annex 2).
E.   Bank Supervision
3.22      Thirteen supervision missions took place between February 1978
and November 1983, i.e. one visit every six months. They were regularly
distributed over the period 1978-1981. However, no mission visited the
Congo between post-appraisal (May/.June 1976) and the first supervision
mission (February 1978). A greater number of missions would have been
desirable at the beginning of the project to accelerate starting work, and
when civil works had ended and equipment was being delivered and installed
(there was only one visit in 1982). The average duration of supervision
missions was one week and an architect was included in all but five cases.
3.23      In the corresponding reports, major problems were identified and
described, pertinent recommendations were made and transmitted officially
to the Congolese authorities. Although this improved the situation and
accelerated administrative procedures (such as managing the ENI, more
equipment, etc.), other recommendations (such as project management,
accountancy, and recruitment of experts, etc.), although periodically
repeated in the reports, were ignored.
3.24      The Bank would probably have been able to help the PIU more
efficiently if it had:
(a) scheduled more supervision missions during the early stages of
project start-up;
(b) included management and disbursement specialists among the
mission members who could have explained the procedures to be
followed to the project administrative staff; and
(c) insisted more firmly on the staffing needs of the PIU and in
particular, the hiring of an accountant, a qualified coordinator
and a procurement specialist.

CHAPTER IV
PROJECT C;OSTS AND FINANCING
A.   Appraisal Estimates
4.1       The total estimated cost at appraisal was US$11.38 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$7.96 million, or 70% of the total.
B.   Calculation of Actual Costs
4.2       The actual costs of the project for the technical assistance
component were calculated from information gathered by the mission at the
Bank, the PIU and Unesco. The accounts rarely tallied for the following
reasons:
-    The PIU has never had an accountant and consequently no
accounting system (Chapter II);
-    PIU reqaests for reimbursement were categorized wrongly and the
Bank did not check them. The mission revised the expenses by
category and these results are different from those in the
monthly statements. These changes of category led to changes in
the financing percentages;
-    considerable variations in the dollar exchange rate during
implementation showed up because the time lapse between requests
for reimbursement and reimbursement itself was normally two
months.
4.3       Calculations of costs are therefore based on expenditure by
category corrected according to the books recording requests for
reimbursement (the method commonly used for this exercise). The
Government's contribution was then calculated as a percentage, using Bank
figures before correcting any errors, of the total cost by category
according to information supplied by the PIU (Annexes 7-9).
C.   Project Cost
4.4       The actual cost is slightly less (-0.4%) than that estimated in
dollars, and considerably more (+29.5%) in FCFA.

4.6       Although the total expenditure in US dollars did not greatly
change, there are considerable variations due to delays by category and
component, notably for the INRAP (+67%), the ENSET (+45%) and equipment
(+25%). The cost reduction for technical assistance was only 32% despite a
considerable reduction in the services provided (-63% for experts and -212
for scholarships). This is basically because two-thirds of expenditure
under this category was paid at the end of the project (1981/82), when the
impact of inflation was much stronger than anticipated.



D.   Sources of Finanzing
4.7       Although errors in categorizing expenditure changed percentage
details, particularly for furniture, the total repartition of cost was more
or less as it was at appraisal (Annexes 10 and 11).

4.8       The Government's contribution was entirely covered by an OPEC
loan of US$4 million.
4.9       A sum of 250 million FCFA (US$1.08 million) was allocated to the
project from the Congo's investment budget in 1978. In 1980 a further 75
million FCFA (US$0.4 million) was allocated to compensate for the drop in
the dollar exchange rate. However, no disbursements were made under these
allocations, and the balance of the OPEC loan (US$0.66 million) is now
being used for more equipment and to complete civil works. This
expenditure, occurring after project closure, is not included in the tables
above.
4.10      The balance of about US$0.06 million of the funds paid in advance
to Unesco could be used for more scholarships or paid back to the PIU to
purchase more equipment.
E.   Comparative Unit Costs
4.11      Construction costs were considerably more than appraisal
estimates for the TNRAP, the ENSET and the ENEF annex, because of slow site
work. Only the ENI, which was completed earlier, costs less than foreseen
(Annex 14).
4.12      Equipment for the INRAP, the ENSET and the ENEF cost more than
appraisal estimates (+152X in the case of the ENSET) for those reasons



- 12 -
outlined above, and also because requirements were dnderestimated
(Annex 14).
F.   Project Implementation and Disbursement Schedule
4.13      The comparative disbursement schedule shows that all project
components were delayed, especially technical assistance, for three to four
years (Annex 13). These delays affected the time schedule of disbursements
because of a slow start at the beginning and an acceleration in 1981/1982
(Annex 12).
G.   Operational Costs
4.14      The overall recurrent budgets of the project institutions are
insufficient. A shortage of consumables, teaching aids and generator fuel
prevents the institutions from operating normally. (Annex 15)
4.15      There are practically no maintenance budgets; some vehicles and
equipment are broken and unrepaired because there is no money. At the ENI,
a sum of 28 million FCFA has been spent on those buildings which had
deteriorated in three years of use. A simple annual maintenance program
would certainly have cost less. (Annex 15)
H.   Technical Assistance Cost
4.16      The cost of technical assistance was US$2,155,000, as shown in
Annex 16.

5.1       A comparison of capacity with the number of enrollments in
1984/85 and graduates in 1983/84 of the three institutions (the ENI, ENEF
and ENSET) attests to their quantirative efficiency.
B.   Primary Teacher Training College (ENI)
5.2       The Owando ENI helped to overcome the increasing shortage of
teachers: 268 teachers were trained in four years of operation with an
average number of 106 graduates per intake (Annexes 17 and 21).
5.3       Considering that the capacity of the two ENIs (Owando and
Loubomo) is only 280 graduates per year, the number of newly qualified
teachers cannot keep up with t"ose lost elsewhere to the profession.
5.4       The repetition rate in basic education, which is now 26%
(1979/80) as opposed to 30% (1974/75), has not as yet diminished enough to
have a noticeable impact on internal efficiency.

5.5       The average pupil:teacher ratio remains at 55:1 but with
considerable variations (from 25:1 to 100:1). In primary education the
ratio has not decreased as expected because annual enrollments have
continued to grow at a steady 4% in 1974/1982, instead of 2.1% as expected
under the project. Projections through 1993, based on enrollments in
1983/84 and on an enrollment growth rate of 3%, suggest that the
pupil:teacher ratio will remain at 55:1 (Annexes 17 and 16'.
5.6       A change from a ratio of 55:1 to 43:1 (optimum) means an increase
in teachers of 28%. In 1993/94, 3,000 more teachers will be needed than
the 10,828 anticipated for a constant pupil:teacher ratio of 55:1.
5.7       Those extra teachers required are still trained outside the
teacher training colleges in courses such as:
(a)  the teaching baccalaureate in special sections of three colleges
(Brazzaville, Pointe Noire and Makoua);
(b) teacher training courses for baccalaureate holders at the
Brazzaville ENI leading to an end-of-studies teaching certificate
(CFEEN).
In (b) above, the number of enrollments equals the anticipated annual
deficit; teachers trained here in 1984/85 were in fact 70% of the total
trained in the same year.
5.8       The objective at appraisal for 1985 of 80% of teachers qualified,
was exceeded by 1981/82 (93%) if we include those teachers trained on the
above-mentioned courses.
5.9       "Large numbers of teachers leaving for better paid employment" 1/
and the attraction of politics are the principal causes of attrition in
primary school teachers.
5.10      The "qualitative" impact of graduates from the Owando ENI cannot
be measured. At its first graduation in 1983/84 it produced 12% of the
global figures (30% for the two ENIs) and is expected to drop to 9% (25%
for both ENIs), according to the calculations in Annex 17.
5.11      Although included in the program, practical activities are not
performed at the new ENI (Annex 20).
5.12      The withdrawal of technical assistance for the ENI has held up
the reform of the People's School which recommends productive work at
primary level.

5.13      The administration of the ENI has been replaced twice at the
request of the DESP (DGES), chiefly on the grounds of efficiency but also
to strengthen discipline.
5.14      Measures have been taken to enforce the minimum school enrollment
age of six, thereby reducing class size in the lower classes.
C.   Educational Publications Department
5.15      The project provided for the creation of an Educational
Publications Department within the INRAP. The buildings were completed,
the equipment and materials delivered and book production started in 1984,
four years later than scheduled. To date, INRAP has produced only two
books, one in the "French" section and one in the "English" section. Their
list price is at present 500 FCPA for 64 pages of A2 format to which should
be added a further 25% at sale.
5.16      As proposed at appraisal, different functions leading to the
distribution of school books throughout the country are shared among the
following organizations:
-    the INRAP for preparation and publishing;
-    the National Printing Office for printing (the paper, supplies
and some equipment being financed by the project);
-    the National Office of Public Libraries (ONLP) for distribution
and sale.
5.17      Publishing has got off to a slow start, so the Congo has had to
Import most of its textbooks (95-99X in 1984).
5.18      In keeping with the recommendations at appraisal, an agreement
was drawn up between the INRAP and the ONLP for the purchase, distribution
and sale of books.
5.19      The lengthy delay is partly due to the complexity of this
component, the number of decision-making centers, lack of coordination and
breakdown of sophisticated equipment, such as the camera which interrupts
the chain of production. Furthermore, equipment delivered before the end
of construction work was damaged by bad weather and paper rapidly
deteriorated when stored under bad conditions aad with no air conditioning.
5.20      The project financed 58 manmonths of expert assistance and 12
scholarships (147 manmonths) at the INRAP. Additional scholarships may
nevertheless be necessary for a modeller and a photo-engraver.
D.   Higher Technical Teacher Training Institute (ENSET)
5.21      The number of students and teachers engaged in technical training
during the 1978/79 school year was considerably higher than forecasted at
appraisal in 1976. The increase was 87% in technical colleges and 70% in
the technical high schools (lycees), i.e. an average increase of 80% in
five years (Annex 24).



- 15 -
5.22      The result is a considerable growth in teacher requirements and
facilities (Annex 23). The increased enrollment in CETs between 1978/79
and 1984/85 and the initial training or replacement of unqualified teachers
would have meant an increase of 86 new teachers per annum for a
student:teacher ratio of 15:1. However, despite 50 students per year
graduating from the ENSET, the deficit has grown (Annexes 23 and 25).
5.23      The gradual takeover by national teackers in technical high
schools was held up for those reasons given above and because training for
this level had not originally been foreseen.
5.24      The ENSET training program lasts for three years after the
baccalaureate, and its last year is devoted to teacher training and
teaching practice. It appears that the authorities want a longer cycle
(five years) to train teachers for upper secondary schools. This would
necessitate new infrastructures, equipment and teaching staff which were
not envisaged by the project.
5.25      The overall results of the ENSET are encouraging.  For example,
109 teachers were trained between 1978/79 and 1980/81, of whom 19% were for
CETs, 81% for technical high schools and of these, 63% were destined for
commercial streams and 37% for industrial. The mission has the following
comments to make:
-    it is difficult to find the necessary staff without using
technical assistance (six teachers) and part-time teachers;
-    equipment is unsuitable both for the level and the subjects
needing to be developed in CETs but is more suitable for the
training of higher level technicians;
-    the technical streams are often not geared to the needs for
qualified workers. For example, there is no equipment for sheet
metalwork, welding, engineering metrology, automobile
engineering, electrical installations, pneumatics, hydraulics,
automation and regulation systems, instrumentation, maintenance,
carpentry and cabinet making, etc.
E.   National Forestry School (ENEF)
5.26      The buildings and equipment specified for the ENEF at appraisal
are in place. However, only the Mossendjo buildings are being used at
present as the Ouesso extension designated for practical work in the forest
zone in the North of the Congo is unutilized due to inadequate transport.
The purchase of two cross-country trucks in 1984 should have allowed
courses to start in 1985.
5.27      The ENEF has been supplemented with such facilities as
electricity, water, garages, housing, laboratory, dormitories, etc., which
improve the students' and teachers' living conditions and snould facilitate
recruitment despite the distance and isolation of the school.
5.28      Teaching programs have been revised by a Unesco specialist in
collaboration with the Ministries of Education and of Rural Economy. The



- 16-
percentage of technical and practical courses has visibly increased and
attained 62% in 1984/85 (Annexes 27 and 28), leading to more relevant
training of forestry technicians.
5.29      At present there is no distinct training for forestry technicians
or wood technologists. Even in the third year, these specializations are
covered through a general curriculum.
F.   Planning
5.30      The project was designed to improve educational planning by
reinforcing the planning abilities of the Ministries of Primary and
Secondary Education (MEPS) and of Higher Education (MECSA). To this end,
the project envisaged establishing an inter-ministerial committee
responsible for coordinating planning. The merger of these two ministries
into a Ministry of National Education (MEN) in 1977 made this redundant.
5.31      It was planned to provide five experts, a consultant, the finance
for 14 scholarships and the necessary equipment to help run the DGP.
5.32      In the 1977 negotiations between the Government, Unesco and the
Bank, this particular technical assistance was reduced to three expert
posts of not less than 72 manmonths, to complement those posts financed by
the UNDP.
5.33      However, direct negotiations between Unesco and the Government
during 1980 finally cut down technical assistance to two expert posts (42
manmonths) which had already been carried out between 1978 and 1980
(paras 3.15 and 3.16).
5.34      Despite this reduction, the experts prepared some studies and
were able to carry out research in collaboration with UNDP experts to
define educational targets, particularly for the first and second levels of
basic education, technical and agricultural education. This definition of
objectives permitted modifying and clarifying curricula.
5.35      The scholarships allotted to the DGP were reduced by three but
their total duration was that specified at appraisal (168 manmonths)
despite the 50% reduction proposed during negotiations between Unesco and
the Government in 1980.
5.36      The personnel and facilities necessary to implement the reform
are now ready (statistics, documentation, programs, drawings, student
cards, data processing, etc.), and the work of tailoring manpower to
priority training courses could start shortly.
5.37      A third project that was to be based on DGP studies has not yet
been identified. Only a sector study with project proposals was carried
out by Unesco during September 1981.
5.38      In July 1984, the dividing of MEN into the Ministry of Primary
Education and the Elimination of Illiteracy (MEFA) and the Ministry of
Secondary and Higher Education (MESS) meant a redistribution of
responsibilities and duties, especially for the DGP.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1       The project closed on December 31, 1983, two years late.  The
sums disbursed under the Bank loan and the total project expenditure
remained below appraisal estimates (in US dollars). Additional equipment
was bought with the balance that remained from the OPEC loan.
6.2       Most of the Loan Covenants, apart from bookkeeping, project
coordination, expert recruitment und employment of some of the fellowship
holders were complied with partially or completely.
6.3       The project helped the Government attain its training objectives
in new sectors, especially in agricultural and technical education.
Furthermore, the teaching capacities for technical educators were
increased. The Government is aware that this is only a first step and that
what has been provided requires constant attention, continuous revision
during operations and a tight budgetary control.
A.   Observations and Lessons Learned
6.4       Project implementation.  The five project components covering
completely different sectors of education were kept separate from each
other. This, however, was not the main reason behind the coordination
difficulties which could have been avoided with a stronger PIU.
6.5       The physical components of the project were finished by the end
of 1982 and all iDstitutions are now operational apart from the forestry
extension at Ouesso, scheduled to start up in 1986. The unsuitability or
lack of some workshop, laboratory, audiovisual and printing equipment,
should be noted. Furthermore, practical teaching and the ability to use
the equipment are not facilitated because of the problnms encountered in
maintaining and repairing sophisticated apparatus and the erratic supplies
of both water and electricity.
6.6       The aims specified at appraisal for education have mostly been
actained. Practical work has not yet started at the Owando ENI or the ENEF
extension. There is also a lack of data on students and teachers by level
and by speciality and an absence of program revision and follow-up of
students.
6.7       The following difficulties were encountered in management and
administration: no adequate bookkeeping, insufficient communication and
coordination between the PIU and the institutions, and lack of recurrent
budgets for operating the institutions.
6.8       The effect of technical assistance was considerably diluted by
the reductions in number and duration of experts' contracts and by the
delay in recruitment.
6.9       Operation of project institutions. The number of teachers trained
by the ENI in 1983 amounts to only 12% of requirements and they are still
insufficiently qualified (Annexes 17 and 19).



- 18 -
6.10      Increased book publication depends on the INRAP being granted
legal status. This status, if granted, will allow it financial autonomy,
facilitating the marketing of books in collaboration with the ONLP.
6.11      Students are less attracted to industrial courses at the ENSET,
which alters the statistical profile of student cohorts; relatively higher
numbers are trained in non-industrial subjects and risk not finding jobs in
their professional life (Annexes 24-26).
6.12      The quantity of forestry technicians trained matches manpower
forecasts; those technicians who succeed in their studies find jobs either
in administration (the MER) or in private enterprise.
6.13      The Planning Directorate has produced many studies on education
but it seems that the results have not yet been exploited by the MEN.
B.   Recommendations
Observations on the project lead to the following recommendations:
1 *  FOR THE BANK
6.14      Management of Future Projects.  The Bank should insist in future
projects that an accountant and a procurement specialist be recruited to
project entities from the start or that a consultant provide periodic
assistance to ameliorate the administrative and management capacities of
the PIU.  It should also exert more control on the books during supervision
missions and verify those accounts that are submitted to it.
6.15      The qualifications of specialists (e.g. disbursement specialist,
accountant), the spacing and size of supervision missions should bear a
relation to the difficulties encountered by the project and they should
concentrate on solving problems on the spot rather than sending out
unheeded directives.
6.16      Lquipment and Supplies.  The Bank should ascertain more
thoroughly that equipment lists bear a relation to the level of technology,
the field of training, and the actual amount.
6.17      As libraries are essential to teaching establishments, it is
necessary to include the purchase of suitable books, documentation and
furnishings in projects to avoid situations like the ENI, the ENSET and the
ENEF where the libraries are empty because UNDP could not follow up on its
plans.
6.18      Physical Facilities.  When approving construction drawings, the
Bank should verify that equipment lists have been prepared which are
consistent with construction design so that there is no need later on for
demolition, costly adjustments and extra work.



-19 -
2.   FOR THE GOVERNMENT
6.19      Assessment of Training.  The MEN should set up a system for an
annual evaluation of institutions, so that data collected on enrollments
and projects by level and type of education could serve to adjust
recruitment and training to the actual needs of the country. This may help
overcome the current situation where the number of primary and technical
teachers trained are absolutely insufficient (Annex 23). The studies and
analyses made by the DGP should serve to calculate needs once updated.
6.20      Teachers.  The lack of stability of the teaching body at the ENEF
and the number of part-time posts at the ENSET cause difficulties within
these institutions. The status of teachers should be urgently clarified
and the advantages of each institution highlighted.
6.21      Recurrent Costs. All institutions need an operating budget which
allows them to utilize the equipment and buildings provided by the project.
This budget must provide for the maintenance and repair of buildings and
equipment, the purchase of spare parts and materials, and pay for any
electricity, oil and gas needed to operate most equipment.
6.22      Curricula.  The levels of industrial training courses at the
ENSET should match those techniques taught and practiced in CETs.
Additional premises and equipment are needed for this purpose.
6.23      Before the Ouesso extension comes into use, the ENEF should
delineate the content and duration of its courses in collaboration with the
Regional Administration of the Ministry of Rivers and Forests and local
companies. When these courses begin, the time-tables and curricula now in
use at Mossendjo will have to be revised.
6.24      The INRAP.  The Government should propose a new legal status for
the INRAP which would allow it a certain degree of financial autonomy. An
immediate solution should be found for repairing the broken camera which
holds up publication of the teaching manuals.
6.25      Surplus Funds.  The Government should use those surplus sums paid
out by Unesco on additional scholarships which would be useful to the
project and especially for the INRAP. The remainder of the OPEC loan could
be used to buy additional equipment or to repair broken equipment.
6.26      Procurement.  The appropriate sequencing of construction and
delivery of equipment should be carefully planned and coordinated.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
(Loan 1349-COB)
With regard to the spirit of the subject report, we share some of the
views expressed therein, but we regret the provocative attitude of the report
which does not contribute much to the objectives laid down in the loan
agreement. We have found it apropriate to refer to that agreement in a number
of cases to avoid a wearisome exposition which will not clarify the facts of
the matter.
As much as we admired the Aujame report on the first project (because
we were there), so we deplore the present report.
Basically, we feel that a completion report should contain
comprehensive and objective judgments making it possible to bring out or
summarize the strong and weak points of the actions undertaken with a view to
further study and the successful implementation of a future project.
It is not because the Project Office lacked an accountant that the
project was delayed. The reference documents, for both the first and the
second projects (Report 1217-COB; Loan Agreement 1349-COB), are silent on this
matter. The staff of the Project Office was augmented by only one engineer
who rendered substantial and valued services. Contrary to what the completion
report says, the Project Office experienced an unprecedented turnover of
staff. Those who remained received only on-the-job training and learned their
predecessor's lessons and work methods well.
While bookkeeping was limited to a chronological recording of
operations, the reason is that we found only this method, which we inherited
in 1971 from qualified specialists who are now working in highly regarded
institutions. Nonetheless, we tried to improve the system (see our activity
reports Nos. 1-13) without being asked. Unfortunately, we were obliged to
abandon this improved method pursuant to the instructions we received during
supervision missions 4 and 5. We were limited to filling out the well-known
cost record sheet which we are still trying to understand today, having
received neither training nor information on how to prepare it. We also
believe that chronological bookkeeping is not the reason why we could provide
the information in our final report; whatever may be said, the World Bank has
no model accounting system that would enable project offices to carry out this
task acceptably.
Moreover, the functions of each staff member of the Project Office
are stated clearly in the project documents (loan agreement, orders and Report
1217-COB). At no time did we depart from that system.

The errors in classification are not the fault of the Project Office,
but rather of the Payments Division. We have available for inspection
documents which I must say only confirm this situation. Mistakes were made
particularly in connection with locally manufactured furniture and a payment
pertaining to technical assistance.
Needless to say, without anyone telling us we regret the errors in
our first final report, sent - it is true - a little hastily. However, we
confirm and reiterate the figures and findings contained in our second draft,
which I am enclosing with this document. Nevertheless, the Project Office
remains the source of all documentation.
In the matter of project coordination our comments are presented in
Chapter I, paragraph 2.5.
CHAPTER I
C. Proiect Administration
2.2      Contrary to what is stated, the project staff has had a high
turnover. The situation is explained sufficiently on pages 66 and 68 of our
final report.
2.4      Supervision of sites was performed solely by the Project Office.
2.5      The problem of the accountant and the lack of a procurement
specialist; are due to an oversight in the negotiations for the two projects.
But it was not their absence that hindered the progress of the project until
its completion. We should like to point out that the entire responsibility
for implementation was ultimately placed on three individuals who were present
at all times (the Director, Engineer, and Educational Adviser to the Office of
the Education Project). We humbly feel that we have fulfilled our mission in
the management, implementation and coordination of the project.
The project, which began in 1976, was continually mouified at higher
levels.
CHAPTER III
E. EquiDment
3.10     The lists, specifications and amounts were prepared by a World Bank
mission. They were merely put in proper form by the Project Office.
3.12     If the Project Office had not coordinated the installation of
equipment, the completion mission would not have found a place to work in the
Project Office.
3.13     At the Owando ENI, it was the furniture delivered by PAC in the
second lot that was refused, and not the laboratory and shop equipment
delivered by Societe Pierron.

ATTACHMENT I
(page 4 of 14)
The INRAP boat has been replaced and is berthed in Brazzaville.
No reduction in equipment for ENSET was ordered. When the bids were
opened we found that the suppliers had not tendered for the mechanical
metrology laboratory and that the bids submitted for the other equipment
exceeded the forecasts. We waited for an appropriate time to correct this
major deficiency, which we did with the complementary OPEC loan. The language
laboratory was furnished in accordance with the descriptive statement by the
Makadi company.
We would like to point out that INRAP has the same problem (operating
supplies).
For the Ouesso branch of ENEF, three vehicles and the barge have been
purchased to solve the transportation problem. It is not the lack of
transportation facilities that has kept this module from being used; the
problem lies elsewhere (operation).
C. Technical Assistance
3.14-19 In our opinion, this is the crucial aspect of the project and has not
been addressed sufficiently. If UNESCO had made the needed personnel
available to the project in 1978, the completion report would have read
differently.
We discussed this in our final report, pages 57-63*and page 67* last
paragraph. Our views have not changed and will not change.
CHAPTER IV
The accounting system of the present Project Office is not different
from that of the Project Office for 237-COB L. The data provided by this
system were the source of the specific information given to the member of the
completion mission.
With regard to the requests for reimbursement issued by the Office of
Education Projects, here again it is necessary to clarify the matter since the
payments were made in Washington. It is risky to calculate the portion
financed by the Government from percentages based on disbursements when we
know that some payments were made without any information whatever being
provided to the Office of Education Projects. We still do not understand the
calculations made by the Payments Division for the furniture.
We fully agreed with the project completion report to the effect that
future Offices of Education Projects should be provided with an accountant
since neither the Director nor his colleagues have training in this difficult
area.
In fourteen years of implementation of the two projects, we know of
only one visit by a member of the Payments Division, in 1978.

We wish that the completion report had said something about the
UNESCO accounting system. Two years after the end of the project we find
UNESCO still continuing to administer funds that belong to the Congolese
State.
CHAPTER V
The problems mentioned in this chapter have been discussed at length
with members of the supervision missions.
CHAPTER VI
Annex 0
Mr. J.A. Malonga is not Coordinator of the Project Office but
Educational Adviser, as was Mr. Bordier who, by the way, trained him.
Mr. N. Gomat is not Engineer of the Project Office, but a specialist
in construction seconded to the project by the Congolese Government.
We find that the members of the completion mission did not make
specific contacts with the Payments Division. As at UNESCO, the meetings were
quite lim4ted (two persons, one of whom had seen the project in the field).
Annex 5: Technical Assistance and Fellowships
The chronology as presented in the completion report obscures certain
facts that should be brought out.
The signing of the second UNESCO/Congo Contract 700 PRC ll could not
have taken place before the letter from the Minister of National Education.
CONCLUSION
The Office of the Education Project has not changed its work methods
for the coordination and administration of Project 1349-COB. They are the
same as those used by our predecessors. Certainly there were some
deficiencies during the implementation of the project, especially in relations
between the present occupants of DFPET/ENSET. We find this normal, and it has
neither impeded nor prevented the completion of the project as defined in the
loan agreement.
In our humble opinion, the immediate and long-term tasks entrusted to
the officials of the Project Office, as stipulated in the loan agreement or in
Law No. , have been carried out -- it should be stressed by four persons,
without any feeling of satisfaction on their part.

(page 6 of 14)
In future projects the People's Republic of the Congo should avoid
rigid, binding contracts that may inpinge on its sovereignty. For ten years
we have asked ourselves who was running the project, since orders or
directives came to by the Project Office from everywhere except the Minister
of National Education.
OPEC granted us a loan as large as that from the World Bank, and we
have nothing but praise for the procedures and attitude of that agency's
representatives.
Also in the future our country should have a voice in deciding on
those who are tc be sent here as experts, supervisors or high-level
specialists.
In the matter of technical assistance, experience has amply
demonstrated that it is better to deal with friendly countries in the context
of bilateral cooperation than to call on agencies that often lack the
personnel needed to assist the requesting countries quickly.
The People's Republic of the Congo did not request the assistance of
UNESCO at the outset. We were advised to call upon that agency and we believe
that our advisers were sincere.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
The project has received assistance from six experts:
(a)      This expert was:
- to conduct a survey of teaching and training institutions and draw up
an inventory of available resources;
- to analyze the present system of education and training -- structure,
efficiency, relationship to the requirements for labor, and financial
constraints -- and to propose various courses of action to provide
for the education and training made necessary by the increase in the
labor force;
- to evaluate existing education and training programs in order to
determine the extent to which they correspond to the objectives
sought, and to propose any changes that may be necessary;
- to take part in the preparation of a national plan for development of
the education and training system;
- to give advice aimed at effective links between education and
training institutions and employers, and to draw up directives to
establish the legal and administrative context wherein their mutual
roles are determined;
- to assist in determining requirements for capital and operating
expenditures for all of the proposed plans.
(b)      This expert was to perform the same functions as the expert in (a);
he also had the mission of reviewing basic data for the preparation of a
medium- and long-term plan and operations.
Unfortunately, these two experts visited only Brazzaville, even
though all logistical facilities were placed at their disposal. We are still
waiting for their report and for concrete proposals that will enable the
Department of Education to implement thi reform.
Summing up, then, the contribution of these two experts has been
sero. We have been the victims of an "intellectual swindle."

As a general comment, we deplore the exceedingly late arrival of the
technical assistance and the small number of experts. Three specialists were
needed for reasonable periods at ENSET, four at ENEP, five in the Planning
Office and two at INRAP. But there was only one at ENSET for 18 months, one
at ENEF for 18 months, two at the Planning Office for 24 months each and two
at INRAP for 24 months. As a result, difficulties in some technical fields
hampered the project.
Moreover, while the experts now on boaLd are performing
satisfactorily, both in their work procedures and in their personal
relationships, we cannot say much in favor of experts in positions (a)
and (b) whose major report we are still awaiting so that we can set up the
Ecole du Peuple.

CONCLUSIONS
Our comments will focus on the main factors that hindered the
successful implementation of the project that has just been completed.
A.       Invitations to Tender
l.       Civil engineering
Everything was normal for the Owando ENI and ENEF. The differences
with IBRD have concerned DFPET and INRAP.
Two foreign companies decided to send letters of protest to IBRD
concerning the procedure for opening bids. The Division is aware of the
problem and the implementation of these two components was nearly two years
late.
It was necessary to give explanations and, particularly, convincing
arguments to the Division. Unfortunately, this required laborious
negotiations. We appreciate the understanding shown by officials of the
Division who concurred in our views rather than those of the foreign companies;
in fact, the IBRD guidelines were scrupulously observed, as were the provisions
of Decree 59/61 of March 9, 1959.
The delay in starting with ENSET and INRAP resulted in elimination of
the residence planned for the Director of ENSET.
2.       Furniture and equipment
The invitations to bid were issued a little early, pursuant to
instructions. It was necessary to wait for the civil engineering works to be
well advanced. The Project Office became a depot for suppliers who complied
with delivery periods.
We were very sorry to find that these invitations to bid did not gain
the international acceptance that we expected. We had to be content with the
"black sheep," with all the consequences that we are now experiencing (partial
deliveries, furniture of mediocre quality, etc.).
We are still receiving bids from foreign suppliers. What this means
is that we should have waited to take delivery of the buildings before issuing
the invitations to bid; or lengthen the bidding periods. The competition
would have been interesting and would have benefited the project greatly.
B.       Supervision
We always welcomed supervision missions, because they gave us an
opportunity to take stock and correct the errors found, and to start afresh in
the right direction.

While the supervision missions of the Educational Advisor and the
Project Architect have been of substantial help to us, we were disappointed
that an official of the Disbursement Division visited the project only once
during its implementation. At that level many problems could have been
avoided concerning payments in proper categories, reconciliation of figures,
punctual submission of accounting documents, etc.
In future, several visits by a member of the Payments Division during
the execution of the project would be highly desirable.
C.       Disbursements
We found that some payments were issued directly by the Payments
Division during the execution of the project without any request from us,
especially in connection with technical assistance and fellowships, which we
found difficult to control. Furthermore, the notation "furniture" in the IBRD
recapitulati-tn tells us nothing at all, like the itcms of consultant services,
furniture. We have no precise information on the use of the item
"nonallocated," which certainly would have enabled us to take an analytical
approach to all data.
In the case of the Congolese counterpart (OPEC loan) we encountered
the same problems as in the implementation of Project 237/COB. With the
Office of the Director of Development Financing, it is and always has been
difficult to obtain precise information. We "sailed in the fog" with them to
the point that the figures are provided subject to all reservations.
D.       Structures
By struct.tres we understand the services, installations and other
resources required for the efficient operation of the project.
Project Office
Loan Agreement 1349/COB stipulated (Article III, Section 3.02 a, b,
c) that the Project Office was to be staffed at all times with qualified and
experienced support personnel and was to have the services, facilities and
other resources necessary for its efficient operation.
In the event, the Project Office had an unprecedented turnover of
personnel. Apart from the Director and the Educational Advisor who remain,
there was sometimes no Coordinator, Architect or Project Engineer.
After the retirement of the Coordinator from the establishment of
the Office, a replacement was appointed, however his tenure was brief (six
months). He departed without leaving an address.
The Architect of the Project Office also left for a better position
abroad. He worked in the project for about ten months.

The Engineer of the Project Office carried out his contract fully
and we value his services highly. This young expatriate specialist devoted
himself unstintingly to the total success of the project.
In summary, we suffered from the continuous parade of project
architects, and this turnover had an impact on the structures established.
Buildings
The overall results in this category are good. The problem of
maintenance persists. The Project Office does not have the capability to
manage these buildings; its role is that of adviser and we have not hesitated
to perform it at any time.
All schedules were met, but we were harmed by the turnover of
architects in the Project Office: each came in with his own ideas and the
additional work or changes only worsened the financial situation of this
component.
The buildings at Owando, like those at Loubomo should not be
remodeled. We encountered serious problems -- either a lack of sufficiently
prepared initial studies, or a need to take emergency or relief measures in
order to proceed.
Furniture
The quality of th*. furniture supplied for the project is quite
mediocre, especially at Owando. Again, everything was ordered hastily
(premature opening of institutions, difficult routing of furniture, improper
handling, etc.). As in the previous project, the Project Office is not
satisfied with the local suppliers.
In future, an international invitation to bid with a very long period
for submission should attract more conscientious suppliers.
Equipment
Overall, the equipment delivered is good. We were surprised on
opening the bids to see the very high prices offered. As a result, not all of
the DFPET shops could be equipped properly. We were obliged -- using the
unexpended balance of the OPEC loan -- to do all we could to alleviate this
vexing problem.
The initial appraisal of the project was made with a rather short
projection period. Price increases and contingencies should easily reach the
25% figure.

Technical Assistance and Scholarships
We would say that within the context of a socio-economic development
project, if some officials at UNESCO headquarters do not change their working
methods, nothing concrete will come from that agency.
Fellowships
Unlike the first education project, the second had the benefit of a
substantial number of training and study fellowships for each component of the
project. Planning, 14 fellowships; ENEF, 6; DFPET, 8; INRAP, 12.
These fellowships earmarked for components were sufficient and made
it possible to proceed normally.
However, the implementation of the fellowships under UNESCO was
difficult from the standpoint of placement because of the list of countries
that would accept the awardees. The selection had to be extended to several
francophone countries, some in Africa.
Of the 33 fellowship students that we sent to France, three are still.
there and perhaps will not return.
30 awardees have returned to the Congo to stay; of that number, 12
have left their original organizations for others where salaries are better.
These losses to the Ministry of National Education are grievous.
We therefore feel that these fellowships, whose recipients should
have dynamized their organizations, did not benefit the project because of the
exodus to other institutions (except in DFPET, where all fellowship students
returned to their posts).
