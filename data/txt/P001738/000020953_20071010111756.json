Several\n            lessons of both a substantive and procedural nature have\n            emerged from this review: (1) Meeting the challenge of\n            pro-poor agricultural growth requires addressing a number of\n            institutional constraints that farmers in Mali face in\n            relation to rural finance, land titling, and the provision\n            of public services such as wholesale market facilities; (2)\n            Ambitious and unrealistic development objectives and project\n            design complicate implementation and supervision; (3)\n            Effective stakeholder representation in decision making and\n            in validating results is important to the success of\n            public-private partnerships; (4) Overestimating the\n            readiness of the Borrower to implement a project leads to\n            unavoidable implementation delays and costly changes in\n            project design; and (5) For projects supporting private\n            sector development, implementing agencies need to have a\n            results-oriented culture and should sub-contract the\n            management and implementation of certain activities to\n            private service providers, including NGOs."}, "docdt": "2007-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
