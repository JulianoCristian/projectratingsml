The specific medium-term\n            objective is to increase technical and managerial services\n            delivery to small-scale irrigation producers. Furthermore,\n            the project will, through training, strengthen: (a)\n            financial institution expertise in appraising investment\n            projects in irrigation; and (b) technical performance of\n            individual consultants and firms. The project's seven\n            components are: (1) support to the implementing agency,\n            aimed at building institutional and technical capacity; (2)\n            technical and managerial services and training, aimed at\n            improving capacity of small-scale irrigation producers,\n            private sector entities, and financial institutions; (3)\n            legal services and technical studies to formalize land\n            tenure arrangements, and create legally registered producer\n            groups; (4) testing of irrigation equipment; (5) capacity\n            building aimed at strengthening producer organizations and\n            individual private irrigators; (6) environmental monitoring\n            and mitigation of water-borne diseases and soil degradation;\n            and (7) socio-economic surveys and studies aimed at\n            monitoring incentives and development impact."}, "docdt": "1997-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
