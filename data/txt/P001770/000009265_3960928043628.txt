MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
FOR THE BEIRA TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Mozambique for SDR 31 million (US$40.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a project for
rehabilitation of the Beira Transport Corridor. The project would be
parallel financed by the Governments of Canada for US$17.0 million
equivalent, Japan for US$8.0 million equivalent, Spain for US$3.5 million
equivalent and Portugal for US$1.0 million equivalent.
2.       Background and Strategy.  In 1987, the Government of Mozambique
(GOM) launched an Economic Rehabilitation Program (ERP) aimed at reversing
the declining trend of the economy, restoring productive capacity,
increasing employment opportunities and developing skilled manpower capable
of running the major sectors of the economy. In parallel with the ERP is a
major program of investment in the rehabilitation of essential economic
infrastructure, particularly in the transport ana urban sectors, as a means
of restoring economic growth and generating foreign exchange earnings. The
primary thrust of GOM's strategy in the transport sector consists of
rehabilitating Mozambique's three main transit corridors (Nacala in the
north, Beira in the center and Maputo in the south) which, prior to
independence, were major foreign exchange earners and the least cost routes
to the sea for neighboring landlocked countries. Moreover, they allowed
cheap transportation of agricultural production to the main consumption
centers in Mozambique.
3.       The Beira Corridor is the most advanced of the corridor
rehabilitation projects. It stretches 300 km from the Zimbabwe border to
the port of Beira and comprises, in addition to the port and railway line
operated by CFM(C) - the central region of Mozambique Railways and Ports -
a road and a pipeline. The Beira Corridor lost most of its traffic after
independence, in 1975, because of very poor rail/port service mainly caused
by rund6wn infrastructure, lack of motive power, severe shortage of trained
personnel, a poorly motivated work force and attacks by armed bandits.
4.       The Beira Corridor Authority (BCA) was created by GOM in 1985 to
oversee and promote the rehabilitation of the Beira Corridor. It now has
the assistance of a full-time 10 member Nordic advisory team. BCA prepared
a 10-year development plan amounting to some US$660 million which was
reviewed by IDA in 1987 (W.B. Report No. 6698). IDA recommended phasing
the rehabilitation and endorsed a first phase development plan of about
US$234 million (1986 prices, now estimated at US$345 million including
contingencies), which was economically viable and generally accepted by BCA
and the donors. The plan, which is already underway, includes major port
rehabilitation (financed by the EEC), new container and oil terminals
(Nordic countries), track and motive power rehabilitation (Canada, USA,



Austria), and manpower development and training with expatriate technical
assistance while locals are being trained. These investments are being
successfully implemented by BCA and are on schedule for completion of the
first phase in 1991. Preliminary improvements in service have already
resulted in increased traffic, to the extent that for the first time in
many years, CFM(C) covered its operating costs in 1988. An important
element of GOM's strategy in the sector is the separation of the three main
corridors, currently part of the Ministry of Transport's (MOT) Port and
Railway Administration 'DNPCF), into an autonomous parastatal to be run on
a profitable commercial basis when these corridors become fully operational
in the 1990's.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project forns an
integral part of IDA's program to support the ERPt namely, the continuation
of a long term effort for institutional development, the improvement of
efficiency and capacity of the sector, the development of skilled personnel
and the restoration of Mozambique's foreign exchange earning ability. IDA's
role in the project has been to assist in ensuring the viability of the
whole investment program through (a) analysis of the costs and benefits of
each component and of the overall program; (b) acting as a catalyst for
other donors, as in the case of locomotives; and (c) as a lender of last
resort in the capacity building program to complement assistance provided
by other donors. IDA's involvement in the project will help to ensure that
program expenditures are kept within economically feasible limits and that
the program is financially viable. It will also assist donor coordination
and support the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference (SADCC)
strategy of making its member countries less dependent on higher cost
transport routes through the Republic of South Africa (RSA) for their
overseas trade.
6.       Proiect Objectives.  The primary objective of the project is to
contribute to the upgrading of the Beira Transport Corridor and
institutional development of CFM(C) in order to restore its financial
viability and its cost efficient transit functions, which are vital to
Zimbabwe and Malawi for least cost access to the sea and constitute an
important source of foreign exchange and employment for Mozambique.
7.       Prolect Description.  The overall Beira Transport Corridor Program
comprises the rehabilitation of all of the elements that make-up the
transport corridor linking Zimbabwe with the Indian Ocean at the port of
Beira, including deepening of the access channel, rehabilitation of the
port and of the railway and road to the border town of Machipanda with
capacity building technical assistance and training for the institutions
responsible for corridor operations. The proposed IDA assisted project
includes: (i) technical assistance to run port and railway operations in
the Beira Corridor during the 1989-95 period; (ii) manpower development and
training for all leve's of staff in the port and railways; (iii)
rehabilitation and acquisition of motive power for main line and shunting
operations; and (iv) technical assistance for the implementation of a
railway/port cost accounting system and a management information system.
The total cost of the program is US$345 million, of which the cost of the
proposed project is estimated at US$73.8 million. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and the categories of disbursement are shown in Schedule B. A

timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Mozambique are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
SAR No.7709 -MOZ, dated July 18, 1989 is being distributed separately.
8.       Agreements Reached.  During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government of MozamAbique (GOM) and BCA, on the following items,
(i) the terms and duration of contracts for the key management pos which
are crucial to the succes..ful operation of CFM(C); (ii) an action pian and
timetable to design and implement an incentive sI'eme for CFM(C)'s workers
not later than December 1990; (iii) an action plan and tinetable to
implement the recommendations of the MIS study; (iv) operational targets
for port and railway; (v) guidelines for utilization of locomotives by
CFM(C); (vi) criteria for future investment proposals and the current
composition and phasing of the investment program in the Beira Transport
Corridor; (vii) selective adjustment of raillrort tariffs in CFM(C) as
improved services become operational, the first phase of adjustments to
take place not later than December 1991 to enable CFM(C) to achieve a
working ratio of 75% in FY1992; (viii) promulgation of the necessary
administrative and legislative measures establishing a legally and
financially autonomous entity (CFM,EE) to succeed DNPCF and transforming
the CFM South, Central and North systems into separate sub-entities with
independent costing, financial, accounting and management units by December
31, 1989; (ix) DNPCF (and its proposed successor CPM,EE) to adopt policies
that will lead to financial viability, including a working ratio of 75% in
FY1995, the financial target in each of the subsequent years to be
determined in agreement with IDA in the light of progress on the Nacala and
Maputo Transport Corridors; (x) finalization of a transit agreement with
Zimbabwe, by June 1990, for the Beira Transport Corridor; and (xii)
proposals to IDA, by December 31, 1990, to formulate feasible ways to
increase private sector participation in port and railway related
activities such as warehousing and container freight stations. Conditions
of Effectiveness are: (i) a signed legal agreement specifying the mutual
obligations of all agencies involved in implementation of the IDA assisted
project components; (ii) a signed subsidiary loan agreement between the
borrower and DNPCF;
*         9.       Benefits.  The project is expected to reduce transport costs and
increase efficiency, allowing Beira to compete with Durban (RSA) and
provide Zimbabwe with a cheaper transport alternative to the sea. It will
earn vital foreign exchange for Mozambique and provide productive
employment. The economic rate of return of the overall corridor program is
conservatively estimated at 14% while that of the IDA assisted project,
including technical assistance, and locomotives, is estimated at 35%.
10.      Risks.  The main risks are: (i) delays in project implementation
and consequent inability to provida acceptable levels of service may affect
financial and economic viability; and (ii) the security issue: in spite of
the presence of forces guarding the Corridor, possible disruptions may
occur. Risk (i) is addressed above (in paragraph 8 (i) and (ii).
