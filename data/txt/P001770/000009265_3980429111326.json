    Project for Mozambique are: overall outcome of the project\n            is rated satisfactory, performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower was also rated as satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned are: 1) ownership is an important element that\n            contributes significantly to effective project\n            implementation and to the achievement of its objectives.\n            With the project under effective control of Beira Corridor\n            Authority (BCA), it could monitor its implementation\n            effectively, despite a complex multi-donor and multi-purpose\n            environment; 2) to be effective; a restructuring process\n            should focus on the entire organization of a corporation,\n            even when different units are geographically separated.\n            Trying to reform Caminhos de Ferro de Mocambique (Centro)\n            (CFM(C)), a part of CFM, while keeping the rest of the\n            organization with the same old heavy structure and system,\n            was a major constraint in implementing the project; 3) in\n            order to secure commercial viability and long-term financial\n            sustainability of ports and railways, future projects need\n            to consider involvement of private sector through all\n            possible means including long-term concessions. Complex\n            bureaucratic structures and systems, rigid rules and\n            procedures, and continuing government interference make it\n            almost impossible for fundamental reforms to be achieved\n            within the framework of public ownership and management; and\n            4) a project design must be flexible enough to adjust to\n            changes in the business environment and lessen the risk of\n            non-materialization of assumptions. In particular, the\n            underlying assumptions must be continuously and critically\n            reviewed in order to ensure a realistic basis for project\n            dimensioning. The design of the project was too risky to\n            achieve its objectives since it focused mostly on the\n            traffic forecasts that did not occur. The investment level\n            could have been reduced or, at least, considerable part of\n            it could have been phased over a longer period and made\n            contingent upon increase in traffic."}, "docdt": "1998-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
