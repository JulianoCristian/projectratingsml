for ranch development, for the improvement of livestock\n            movement and marketing facilities, for range water survey\n            and development, and improved technical services. Funds for\n            ranch development would be invested by ranching enterprises\n            operating on 2 million acres. The investments would finance\n            stock watering facilities, dipping/spraying facilities,\n            stock handling facilities, firebreaks, improved bulls,\n            fencing, machinery and equipment. Four types of ranches are\n            included in the project, these of which represent new\n            organizations for the traditional production sector. All\n            four types would receive long term development loans as well\n            as short term credits to meet working capital requirements.\n            In view of the lack of experience in Kenya and elsewhere in\n            Africa with this type of development, and because of the\n            uncertainty regarding pastoral society responses, a pilot\n            approach would be used at this stage."}, "docdt": "1968-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
