INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE CORINTO PORT AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA
FOR A PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a' pro-
posed loan to the Corinto Port Authority with the guarantee of the
Republic of Nicaragua for the equivalent of $11.0 million to help
finance a port project.  The loan would have a term of 24 years, in-
cluding four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Nicaragua" was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1971.
An economic mission visited Nicaragua in July 1972, and a regular econo-
mic report was scheduled for distribution to the Executive Directors in
February 1973. In view of the recent earthquake we now propose to send
a small mission to Managua in the next few weeks to evaluate the medium-
term impact of the earthquake on the economy. Its report is expected to
*be ready for distribution in March 1973.  The regular economic report
would be prepared later in the year when more accurate information will be
available on the impact of Managua's destruction.  A country data sheet
is attached as Annex I.
3.        The destruction of Nicaragua's capital city, Managua, by an
earthquake on December 23, involved great human suffering and loss of
life, as well as the destruction of a large part of the city's infra-
structure, its service industry and some 10 percent of the country's
industrial plant. Indications are, however, that the countrys' agri-
culture and transport facilities are virtually unaffected. The disas-
ter that has befallen Nicaragua, will, of course, overshadow the economy
in the immediate future, with repercussions on the level and structure
of Government expenditures, import requirements, savings, etc. However,
with suitable assistance frori abroad - first for relief, which is al-
ready underway, and later for reconstruction - the productive capacity
of the economy should be restored relatively soon, and its long term
potential remains unimpaired. The evaluation of Nicaragua's economic
prospects in the following paragraphs was made before the earthquake
and is, consequently, out of date as far as the very short term outlook.
is concerned.  However, it remains essentially valid with regard to the
medium and long'term prospects of the economy,
4.        Nicaragua's real per capita income increased considerably in the
post-war period to a level of $430 in 1970 and prior to the earthquake was
just above the margin for IDA eligibility.  GDP at 1958 market prices increased
at an average annual rate of about 6.4 percent in the period 1946-71 and population



-2-
grew at 2.9 percent per year over the same period. The main determinant
of growth was production for export, particularly of cotton and coffee.
In common with many other developing economies, Nicaragua experiences
sharp swings in economic activity because of vagaries of the weather and
drastic changes in world prices for primary product exports. However,
this characteristic is gradually changing with the recent development of
new exports, such as simple manufactured goods and meat. Spurred by the
rapid growth of domestic incomes, the establishment of the Central Ameri-
can Common Market (CACM) and the Government's industrial incentives policy,
manufacturing increased its share in GDP from 12 percent in l950-52 to 21
percent in i969-71. Preliminary estimates show real GDP growth of' about
5 percent in 1972.
'5.       A reasonable investment effort was another important factor
contributing to the high growth rates over the last two decades. Gross
domestic investment increased from about 12 percent of GDP in the early
fifties to a peak of 21 percent in the mid-sixties and now stands at
about 18 percent of GDP, which is roughly comparable to average invest-
ment levels elsewhere in Central America. National savings financed a
substantial share of investment,but 'as a proportion of GDP declined over
the last two decades; hence external capital, mainly public and pub-
licly-guaranteed medium- and long-term loans, has become important,
accounting for about one-third of the financing of investment in recent
years.
6.        In spite of the rapid growth and'the marked shift in the com-
position of output, transformation of the structure of the economy is
still at an early stage. This is reflected in the low productivity of
a large share of the labor force engaged in subsistence agriculture and
petty services, and by the continuing vulnerability of the economy to
events in the cotton sector. The core of the subsistence sector con-
sists of 50,000 farms of up to 7 hectares in size, covering roughly 3.5
percent of the farm area and supporting about one-third of the rural
population. A comparatively small number of farmers have benefitted
from a special'credit program (Credito Rural) operated by Banco Nacional
de Nicaragua (BNN), a publicly owned commercial bank.   The Government
is exploring other ways to broaden the'scope of the financial and tech-
nical assistance to small and medium farmers.
7.        The benefits of Nicaragua's substantial economic growth have
been unevenly distributed. Control of the economy remains in the hands
of a limited number of people. The largest 1.5 percent of farms - equiva-
lent, probably, to an even smaller percentage of farmers - occupies about
40 percent of total farmland. In recent years, the Government started a
few programs aimed at improving rural living conditions. Foremost among
these are a USAID-financed rural electrification program through coopera-
tives sponsored by the National Power Company (ENALUF), various land-
titling and settlement schemes of the Agrarian Institute of Nicaragua (IAN)
and the construction of rural primary schools and health centers with
assistance from USAID. So far, the impact of these projects has been
small but they are clearly steps in the right direction.



-3-
8.        The public sector made a useful contribution to the diversifi-
cation of the economy. In the early 1950s the Government, with assist-
ande from an IBRD economic mission, devised a comprehensive program of
policies and projects aimed at diversifying and strengthening an economy
which had just emerged from about 30 years of near-stagnation. An in-
crease in resources and a more active credit role of BNN, the establish-
ment of the National Development Institute (INFONAC), the decision to
join the CACM coupled with an aggressive industrial incentives policy,
and construction of roads, electric power and port facilities stimulated
private investment and output. The Government's development effort also
led to the creation of various new public institutions, such as ENALUF
in 1953, the Corinto Port Authority (CPA) in 1956, and IAN in 1963. While
ENALUF and CPA achieved high standards, the BNN, INFONAC and the price
support agency (INCEI) have encountered financial problems because of
weak program preparation and project appraisal. A National Planning Of-
fice, which was established last year, still has to be adequately staffed
for the difficult job of judging sectoral proposals in the context of
national priorities and available resources.
9.        The creation of new public agencies, especially state enter-
prises such as the electric power company, resulted in considerable ex-
pansion of the public sector's share in domestic production. The fiscal
performance of the Central Government, however, was characterized by a
low level of tax revenues (9 percent of GDP in 1971), comparatively fast
growth of current expenditures, and resulting periodic shortages of sav-
ings.  Fiscal difficulties in 1970 were overcome by introduction of a
general sales tax, which resulted in a substantial increase in public
revenues and savings. A major tax reform being considered for introduc-
tion in 1973-74 could raise the elasticity of the revenue system signi-
ficantly while reducing administrative costs.
10.       Nicaragua has ample resources to sustain a long-term growth
rate of 5-6 percent in real terms. The outlook for growth and the bal-
ance of payments in 1973 is not too encouraging not only because of the
earthquake but also owing to substantial damage to the 1972-73 cotton
crop caused by a protracted drought. However, in later years the average
growth rate is expected to increase primarily because of good world market
prospects for cotton, coffee, and meat, Nicaragua's major exports. The
favorable long-term growth and balance of payments outlook support Nicaragua's
basic creditworthiness for substantial additional borrowing.
External Financing
11.       Apart from the Bank, external financing is provided principally
by USAID, the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB) and the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). USAID has made loans for highways,.
agriculture, industry, rural electrification, housing, education and health.
IDB is financing water and sewerage, higher education, agriculture and
transport. CABEI is financing projects with a regional impact, principally



in transport and industry and power interconnection. The pa§t lending of
these agencies is summarized below.   IDB lending is likely to continue tio
support the sectors which it financed in the past, although somewhat more
emphasis will be placed on transport, education, power and telecommuniea-
tiohs. AID will focus primarily on project preparation in healthj eduxca=
tion' and agriculture; new commitments for project implementation will de-
pend on the level of AID's funding by the U.S. Government. CABE&Is financ-
ing will follow closely the pattern of the past, with lending concentrated
in the'transport and industrial sectors.

i2.       Loans from these agericies are usually on sboter' financiai terms
than Bank loans. AID loans are for a term of 4O years w'ith ifiterest of 2

to financing from the Fuiid for Spe6ial Operati6os tb Nicaragua.  IDB plarin
to extend all of its loans to Nic&ragua from the Fund, which now carries
2 percent iziterest rates and terms up to 40 yrears with i year~s of gace.
The terms of CABEI loans - which often provide 100 percent fihancing of
local expenditures - vary in accordance with CABEI's sources of financing,
but generally contain a substantial concessionary element. USAID, which
heid roughly one-third of the debt repayable in foreign currency at the
end of 1971, is Nicaragua's largest external 'creditor.  Liabilities to
the Bank Group represented less than one-fifth of debt repayable in for-
eign curirency.
PART II,- BANK GROUP OPERATIONS. IN NICARAGUA
13.       Annex II contains a siummry 't^atemeit of Bank iokans, IDA credits
and IFC investmhents as of De;ember. 31; 1972, and notes on the executior
of on-going projects.



-5-
14.       Nicaragua has to date received 17 Bank loans and one IDA
credit, totalling $93.8 million, net of cancellations. Eight loans,
totalling $66.3 million, have been made for power; three loans, total-
ling $10.3 million, for transportation; one loan, amounting to $4.0
million, for education; four loans, totalling $3.3 million, for agri-
culture; and a credit and a loan, amounting to $9.9 million, for water
supply.  The last operation, a loan for power, was signed in June 1972.
15.       As of December 31, 1972, a total of about $33.9 million re-
mained to be disbursed on three loans; one loan for education (Loan
532-NI), one for water supply (Loan 808-NI) and one for power (Loan
840-NI). Loan 840-NI, signed on June 28, 1972, has not yet become ef-
fective due to delays caused by joint financing partners (see Annex I).
All other projects have been completed satisfactorily.
16.       IFC has made one investment in Nicaragua, in 1967, in a new
cotton and synthetic fiber textile company (FABRITEX), consisting of a
$1 million loan (fully disbursed) and an equity participation of about
$1.1 million equivalent. MAarketing problems partly connected with the
difficulties in the operation of the Common Market resulted in a lower
level of sales than forecast and large inventories,,with a resulting
shortage of working capital. Rescheduling of principal payments to IFC
was recently approved by the Board, and other long-term lenders are also
considering similar action.
17.       In the past, the Bank assisted Nicaragua in those areas where
it has special expertise and where finance on softer terms from other
development agencies was unavailable. Thus, the Bank lent for economic
infrastructure such as power, ports and roads and, to a lesser extent,
for agriculture and social sectors such as water supply and education.
Bank lending was interrupted in 1969-71 because of fiscal and balance
of payments problems but was resumed in 1972 as the country's develop-
ment effort had materially improved. Assuming a continued Nicaraguan
effort to mobilize additional public savings we have entered on a sub-
stantial acceleration of project preparation work. If these efforts
are complemented on the Nicaraguan side, we should be in a position to
substantially increase our lending, thus assisting the Nicaraguan au-
thorities to obtain capital on longer terms and thereby extending the
average maturity of debt.
18.       The Bank is considering several operations in support of the
Government's strategy of placing emphasis on diversifying production and
developing Nicaragua's natural resources. Two FAO missions, which vis-
ited Nicaragua in February, 1972, helped to identify projects for pos-
sible Bank assistance in livestock and crop production. As a result, a
Bank mission is scheduled to appraise an agricultural credit shortly.
A UNDP/UN mission is conducting ground water investigations which may
result in Bank financing of tubewell development for irrigation in a
second agricultural credit loan in the mid-1970's. With respect to
industry, the Bank is considering channelling financing to Nicaragua
and the other Central American countries through CABEI. The Bank also
plans to continue assisting the development of physical and social in-
frastructure in Nicaragua. The Government is currently completing
preparation of a second education project for Bank financing, which was



-6-
identified with assistance from UNESOD in January 1972. In view of the
recent earthquake preparations are underway for an early IDA credit to
assist the disaster stricken country in the reconstruction effort. We
are also examining the situation of the power, water supply and educa-
tion sectors to determine whether some reorientation of existing loans
is called for in the light of the new situation. The Nicaraguan Gov-
ernment has examined its investment priorities and has reconfirmed its
desire to proceed with the Corinto Port Project.
PART III - THE PORT SECTOR
19.       Seaborne trade, especially with the United States, Europe and
Japan, has been central to the economic growth of Nicaragua as the prin-
cipal means of transporting the country's main agricultural exports.
Nicaragua's economic activity and transportation network - the main high-
ways, a railroad, and an international airport - are cohcentrated in the
region along the Pacific Coast between Managua, the capital city, and
Corinto, the country's only port with deepwater berthing facilities.
20.       Corinto has a fine, naturally protected, deepwater anchorage.
Vessels up to 27 feet draft (about 10,000 to 12,000 dead weight tons)
have access to the harbor under favorable sea and weather conditions.
Traffic through the port - mainly exports of cotton, coffee and sugar
and imports of -wheat, fertilizers and manufactured goods - is expected
to increase from about 660,000 tons in 1972 to about 1,000,000 tons in
1976. Under Bank Loan No. 143-NI of May 22, 1956 two modern reinforced
concrete berths were built, along with two transit sheds and paved open
storage areas. The project was carried out satisfactorily and, together
with institutional improvements, helped to make Corinto an excellent port,
efficiently run. The existing facilities also include a berth with a
conveyor system for loading bananas, and pipeline facilities for oil and
chemicals. An old timber-deck pier 160m long is obsolete and structurally
dangerous. Land access to the port is provided by both road and rail,
which are now threatened with destruction by erosion from the sea.
21.       In addition to Corinto, there are two other ports on the Pacific
Coast: Puerto Somoza, which handled 85,oo0 tons of dry cargo by lighter-
age and 670,000 tons of petroleum products through an off-shore buoy in
1970, and San Juan del Sur, which handled 41,000 tons by lighterage in
1970. Development of deepwater alongside berths at Puerto Somoza is not
feasible. San Juan del Sur has a natural harbor, but is more remote from
the main area of economic activity.
22.       Three ports on the east coast (Puerto Cabezas, Puerto Isabel
and El Bluff) handled a total cargo of 103,000 tons in 1971. Except for
a road-waterway link to El Bluff, the east coast ports have no transport
connections with Nicaragua's main center of economic activity. The Gov-
ernment is considering various alternatives to open up the eastern re-
gions, including a highway to Puerto Cabezas from the Pacific area, an
intra-coastal waterway from Puerto Cabezas to El Bluff, and improvement
of the harbor at El Bluff.
23.       In 1969-70 the Bank conducted a study on the Central American
ports which identified the high priority investments needed in the sea-
ports of the region. The study report recommended expansion of the port



of Corinto. The report also included a preliminary analysis of the poten-
tial for container traffic in the region. The proposed project would make
Corinto a regional container port.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Second Corinto Port Project"
(No. 13a-NI, dated January 5, 1973) is being distributed separately.
The main features of the project are summarized in Annex III. In 1967
a Bank grant to CPA helped to finance a study of the feasibility of ex-
panding the port of Corinto. A project was appraised in 1970, but not
presented to the Board pending the implementation of fiscal reforms by
the Government of Nicaragua. After Bank lending was resumed in 1972,
the Government renewed its request for assistance in expanding the port.
Feasibility studies were prepared by Fredric R. Harris (USA and Nether-
lands); Cisneros y Conrado (Nicaragua) and Santos & Heilemann (Nicaragua),
partly on the basis of previous studies prepared by Livset (United King-
dom and France) and the Bank's Central American Ports Study. The proposed
project was appraised in the field in July 1972, and negotiations were
held in Washington in December 1972. The Government was represented by
Messrs. Guillermo Sevilla Sacasa, Ambassador to Washington qnd Gustavo
Escoto Goenaga, Minister Counselor for Economic Affairs of the Embassy.
The Corinto Port Authority was represented by Messrs. Cristobal Rugama,
Minister of Development and Public Works, and President of the Board of
Directors; Tommy Thompson, General Manager; and Ricardo Sanchez, Secre-
tary of the Board of Directors.
25.       The. proposed project is designed to satisfy present and pro-
jected traffic demands of the port up to about 1985. The project con-
sists of the construction of a new 240 meter wharf to replace the exist-
ing timber-deck pier; the construction of service and administration
buildings, storage areas and utilities; installation of container han-
dling equipment; channel dredging and navigational aids; works to pro-
tect the road and rail access from sea erosion; and staff training in
maintenance of sea defense works and management and maintenance of con-
tainer handling equipment. The proposed loan would be made to the Cor-
into Port Authority, with the guarantee of the Republic of Nicaragua,
whose Ministry of Public Works has the administrative and financial
responsibility for the coastal protection works. CPA would act as agent
of the Ministry of Public Works in carrying out the coastal protection
works.
26.       CPA has adequate technical and administrative capacity to
carry out the project. Engineering design and supervision of construc-
tion of the project would be carried out by the consultants Fredric R.
Harris - Cisneros y Conrado - Santos y Heilemann. Upon completion, CPA
would be responsible for maintenance of the port works and facilities.
The Government would be responsible for maintenance of the coastal de-
fense works. The physical conditions for execution of the project, the
arrangements for its financing, and its economic justification are not
expected to be affected by the recent earthquake in any significant way.
Cost and Financing
27.       The estimated cost of the proposed project is $14.16 million.
The proposed loan of $11.0 million would finance the estimated foreign



-8-
exchange cost of the project. The project accounts for some 81 percent
of CPA's $17.h million 1972-76 capital expenditure program. About 34
percent ($5.9 million) of the funds required for this program are expected
to be generated internally by CPA. The proposed Bank loan would finance
63 percent and the Government would contribute the balance ($0.5 million)
to finance the local currency cost of the coastal protection works.
28.       CPA's financial position is sound and is expected to remain so.
CPA's internal cash generation has provided ample funds to cover its rela-
tively low debt service requirements, to accumulate substantial reserves,
and to maintain adequate levels of working capital. CPA has agreed to
maintain the present average level of tariffs until completion cf the proj.
ect, and to earn a rate of return of not less than 7 percent on net fixed
assets during the term of the loan, except for the years 1976 to 1978,
when it will earn a rate of return of not less than 5 percent.   The excep-
tion is made because of the sharp increase in the book value of net fixed
assets with the commissioning of new facilities.   These rates are adequate
to assure CPA's financial viability and to provide the Government with a
reasonable return on its equity investment in CPA. No increase in the
average tariff is expected to be necessary to comply with the proposed
rate covenant.
29.       CPA's debt service ratio is projected to be satisfactory, im-
proving from 2.0 in 1977, when amortization of the proposed loan would
begin, to 2.2 in 1978 and 2.6 in 1979. CPA has agreed not to undertake
any debt maturing in more than one year without the Bank's prior approval,
unless CPA's net revenues cover the maximum debt service requirements at
least 1.75 times.
Procurement
30.       Goods and services financed by the Bank would be procured
through international competitive bidding. No suppliers in Nicaragua
or other Central American Common Market countries are expected to bid
for the supply of equipment; accordingly, the Government has not re-
quested, and no provision has been made for, domestic or regional pre-
ferences in the evaluation of bids. Contracts with the engineering
consultants ($0.6 million) have already been signed.
Disbursement
31.       The loan would be disbursed during FY73-76 in the following
proportions:
(a) 77 percent of the total cost of civil works related to
port works, representing the estimated foreign exchange
cost component;
(b) 82 percent of the total cost of civil works related to
coastal protection works, representing the estimated
foreign exchange cost component;
(c) 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of container-handling
equipment;



-9-
(d) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultants'
services; and
(e) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of staff training.
It is proposed that the loan finance retroactively up to $250,000 in re-
spect of expenditures for engineering consultants' services that have been
incurred between November 1, 1971 and the date of signing, and expendi-
tures for civil works for coastal protection incurred between January 1,
1973 and the date of signing.
Economic Justification
32.       The project is technically sound and economically justified.
The economic rate of return on the conventional port works is estimated
at 14 percent and that on the container-related facilities at 19 percent.
The coastal works are justified as the least-cost means of preserving
essential land access to the port.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.       As indicated in the report to the Executive Directors on the
Eighth Power Loan (P-1087, dated June 12, 1972) a number of constitutional
changes are now underway in Nicaragua. In August 1971 Congress dissolved
itself and granted legislative powers to the President. In February 1972
a Constituent Assembly was elected, which in April appointed a three-man
Junta (including a member of the opposition). This Junta has acted as the
executive power since May 1, 1972. Presidential and congressional elec-
tions are scheduled for September 1974, and the new President and Congress
are to take office in December 1974. I am satisfied that the Government
has authority to guarantee borrowing from the Bank by the Corinto Port
Authority in present circumstances.
34.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Corinto Port
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Reso-
lution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal
pattern for loans for port projects.
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS INf EXECUTIONI'
Loan No.
532     Education Project:  US$4j million of April 19,, 1968. Closing
Date:  June 30, 1973
This project had a very slow start because of management
problems, arising from lack of expertise in the project
unit, and financial problems. Adequate budget allocations
have now been made, and the project unit is being strengthened.
Although disbursements are now picking up, the closing date
will have to be postponed by about twelve months.
808     Second Water S      Projects  US$6.9 million of March 7, 1972.
Closing Date: September .30,, 1975.
This loan became effective in April; the project is progressing
satisactorily.
840     Eigth Power Project:  US$24 million of June 28, 1972.  Closing
Date: March 31, 1977
The terminal date for the effectiveness of this loan has been
postponed from the original date of October 2, 1972 to January
31, 1973. The postponement was to provide additional time
for Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau to complete the formalities
required before the signing of its loan to the Central American
Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), which is financing
this project jointly with the Bank. The signing of the CABEI
loan is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the

ties and 19 percent on the container-re-
lated facilities. Coastal defense works are
justified as the least-cost solution for
preserving essential land access to the port.
APPRAISAL REPORT:             13a-NI, dated January 5, 1973.
