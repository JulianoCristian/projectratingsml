         diseases. The project consists of three components. First,\n            strengthening of National Surveillance System will finance:\n            a) improvement of the data management telecommunications\n            system; b) rehabilitation, extension, and equipment of the\n            laboratory work; c) rehabilitation and expansion of cold\n            storage facilities; d) rehabilitation and expansion of\n            environmental surveillance facilities; e) training of\n            municipal, state, and central FNS (National Health\n            Foundation) staff; and f) studies and research in\n            epidemiological surveillance. Second, strengthening of\n            disease control in selected areas will support: 1) disease\n            control in Amazon Region; and 2) indigenous health. A\n            significant participation of nongovernmental organizations\n            is expected. Third, project administration will finance the\n            administrative and operating costs of the Project\n            Coordinating Unit."}, "docdt": "1998-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
