The\n            lessons learned indicate that the choice of loan instrument\n            allowed flexibility with a long-term institutional\n            development project in the context of an evolving\n            decentralization process. Trigger indicators to move from\n            one phase to another should be carefully selected and\n            evaluated, considering institutional capacity and technical\n            needs. In this project, while the selection of ambitious\n            trigger indicators is laudable, it required two extensions\n            to fully achieve the indicators and delayed passage to the\n            second phase. Health sector projects in the context of\n            decentralization require a better integration of Bank\n            financing mechanisms with country financing mechanisms. In\n            the case of public health surveillance and disease control,\n            the strengthening of sub-national (state) and local\n            (municipal) public health structures is fundamental to a\n            successful system. The use of convenios and subprojects\n            governed by Bank rules was very dysfunctional. The VIGISUS I\n            subprojects involved decentralized execution and the amount\n            of support required for states and municipalities to carry\n            out procurement and other processes was underestimated.\n            Public health surveillance is a public good and an element\n            of the Ministry of Health's stewardship function.\n            Public health surveillance and disease control involves\n            sophisticated technical issues."}, "docdt": "2004-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
