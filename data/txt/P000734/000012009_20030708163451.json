{"cdata!": "Project ratings convey satisfactory\n            outcomes, likely sustainability, and substantial\n            institutional development impacts. One vital lesson in\n            project preparation is the importance of indicators: there\n            were no specific outcome indicators established during\n            preparation, and appraisal to monitor the progress of\n            implementation. However, for the Gewane-Mille road, which\n            was included after the Project was revised in 1998, selected\n            indicators were identified and a base line established.\n            Another lesson drawn from the Project, convey that support\n            should be searched from all government entities, to\n            facilitate contract implementation, hence minimizing\n            bureaucratic procedures, such as delays in customs\n            clearance, granting of licenses for explosives and radio\n            communication equipment, etc. Also important was the need to\n            develop the capacity of domestic contractors, perhaps, most\n            important is the recognition of the complexity of\n            internationally agreed principles of tendering, questions of\n            law in the formulation of contracts, the options for the\n            settlement of disputes in direct negotiation to avoid\n            litigation, and the tendency towards the use of arbitration.\n            This lesson contributed to making special provisions for the\n            appointment of dispute resolution experts on all new\n            contracts thereafter. Subsequent projects, have incorporated\n            arrangements to support capacity in administering\n            international contracts, and the domestic construction\n            industry. The strengthening of such capacity in this area,\n            has contributed to the reduction on contract processing\n            time. However, since one of the factors that contributed to\n            the delay in implementation was the border conflict, greater\n            attention may be needed to the analysis of political risks\n            in multinational projects. Of important consideration should\n            be the border conflict with Eritrea, where the duty of the\n            Government should be to allocate increased funding for\n            maintenance, for reducing vehicle operating costs, and\n            travel time, possibly through resources to complete the\n            project as conceived, as part of post-conflict resolution."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
