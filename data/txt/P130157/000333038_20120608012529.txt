﻿GUARANTEE AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
MONTENEGRO
FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICY BASED GUARANTEE
Borrower              Montenegro
Implementing Agency   The Ministry of Finance (MoF) of Montenegro will be responsible
for overall implementation of the proposed operation. The Central
Bank of Montenegro (CBCG) is closely involved in the work on
most prior actions.
Financing Data        IBRD Policy-Based Guarantee
The guarantee will cover EUR60 million (equivalent to US$79.2
million using the April 30th exchange rate and the WB rounding
rule) of the EUR [100] million principal of a commercial loan to
Montenegro with [five to seven]-year maturity. Repayments will
be amortizing, with the final EUR60 million payable at scheduled
maturity.
Operation Type        Policy Based Guarantee
Main Policy Areas     The proposed guarantee supports a comprehensive program of
measures to strengthen the banking sector, with a view to
addressing vulnerabilities of the Montenegrin banking sector and
increase the resilience of the sector to possible future shocks. The
proposed specific reforms to strengthen the banking sector are in
the following areas: (i) systemic risk monitoring and the crisis
management framework; (ii) banking sector vulnerabilities; (iii)
restructuring of Prva Banka; (iv) the depositor protection scheme;
and (v) the regulatory framework for banks. These reforms are an
integral part of Montenegro's EU accession strategy insofar as they
aim to bring the supervisory and regulatory framework for the
banking sector closer to EU best practices.
Key Outcome           The expected outcomes of this operation are: (i) enhanced
Indicators            macroprudential oversight and the legal authority of the CBCG and
MoF to rapidly and transparently resolve any future crisis
situations, (ii) enhanced stability and soundness of the banking
system; (iii) Prva Banka operating under sound and safe financial
conditions and a market-based financing structure; (iv) confidence
in the banking sector is restored and total bank deposits steadily
increasing to their pre-crisis levels; and (v) supervision of the
banking system is conducted consistent with Basel Core Principles
and based on best practice international accounting standards and
iv


﻿regulatory reporting.
The expected results indicators are:
* Enhanced macroprudential oversight and crisis management
framework in line with international good practice as appraised
by next Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSAP) update
(baseline: 2007 FSAP appraisal; next FSAP update expected in
2013-2014);
* Improved quality of banks' loan portfolios (baseline: system's
non-performing loan (NPL) ratio at 19.7 percent by September
2011; target: NPLs below 12 percent by end-2012);
* Well-capitalized banks (target: average CAR of banking system
to remain above 15 percent);
* Prva Banka has a market based financing structure, and operates
in sound and safe financial condition while meeting all prudential
norms (baseline: EUR18.2 million of Government deposits by
end-December 2011; target: EURO by end-June 2012);
* Increased confidence in the banking sector leading to positive
annual growth in bank deposits over 2012-2013 to gradually
reach the pre-crisis (September 2008) level of deposits (the total
decline in deposits from September 2008 to March 2011 reached
-19.3 percent);
* Effective supervision of banking system consistent with Basel
Core Principles (no materially non-compliant ratings on BCP
assessment in next FSAP update);
* All banks produce financial statements based on international
accounting standards (IFRS) as of 2014;
* Adequate liquidity in the banking sector (target: liquidity ratio in
compliance with the CBCG norms).
Program               The overarching objective of the operation is to strengthen the
Development           banking sector, which is a critical pre-condition for sustainable
Objective(s) and      economic recovery and balanced private sector-led growth.
Contribution to CAS   The reform program supported by this operation falls under Pillar I
of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), namely, to support EU
integration through strengthening institutions and competitiveness
in line with EU accession requirements. The proposed operation
contributes to this strategic priority by supporting reforms in the
legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework for the banking sector
that are in line with international good practices and EU standards.
v


﻿Risks and Risk        The proposed Financial Sector Policy-Based Guarantee (FSPBG) is
Mitigation            a high risk operation. The key risks are as follows:
1.     Economic risk is substantial, given Montenegro's small
size and external vulnerability and, importantly, a highly uncertain
and volatile external environment. Both external and public debt
levels remain elevated, and the heavy dependence on external
financing has made the economy vulnerable. Growth recovery
coupled with the ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts moderated
the imbalances. However, another global turmoil may reverse
these trends. This could jeopardize the achievement of planned
medium-term macroeconomic and social outcomes. The ongoing
deleveraging of the financial sector makes growth vulnerable to a
slowdown in capital inflows. Finally, given the small size of the
country, even a small shock may have a sizeable impact on the
economy.   The Government's substantial fiscal consolidation,
building of fiscal reserves, and deepening structural reforms as
well as the mobilized financing for its 2012 program provide
important mitigation framework. Given the quarterly profile of the
Government's financing needs, which are concentrated in the first
half of 2012, the timing of the proposed FSPBG in the first half of
2012 is important as it will help mitigate the external risks and
financing pressures.
2.      The risk offinancial instability is high given the banking
sector risk exposures and the possibility of adverse external
shocks. Deposits have still not recovered to pre-crisis levels and
are being significantly reallocated across banks. Nonperforming
loans in the system have peaked in August 2011 and then declined
as banks sold their bad loans to asset management companies.
However, stock of bad debt in the real economy remains a
challenge. Several systemically important banks remain fragile.
Of special concern is Prva Banka, which remains vulnerable and
lacks the support from a strong foreign parent bank or strategic
investor. At the same time, this bank has been reduced in size in
an orderly fashion from the third largest to a medium-size bank in
the system. This risk is directly mitigated by the policy reforms
supported by the operation including strengthening systemic risk
monitoring and the crisis management framework; continued
efforts to bring problem banks to sound financial conditions under
appropriate supervisory arrangements; completing the restructuring
of Prva Banka; further strengthening the deposit insurance scheme;
and aligning the regulatory framework in the banking sector with
EU best practice.
3.      Governance risk. Montenegro has a solid track record of
institutional, structural and social reforms and key indicators show
vi


﻿gradual improvements in recent years. Nevertheless, a slowdown
in the progress on governance improvements could undermine
Montenegro's path toward EU accession and thus threaten its
efforts to achieve long term macroeconomic and financial sector
stability. The EU and domestic observers have raised concerns in
the past about the lack of transparency, judiciary, and possible
influence exercised by organized crime. With encouragement
from the EU and other international observers (including the
Bank), the Montenegrin authorities have been making a concerted
effort to strengthen government effectiveness in these areas and
correct this perception. Specifically, the legislative changes and
more robust monitoring, and inspection and supervision efforts
supported by this operation are expected to strengthen the
regulator's standing and improve governance standards in the
financial sector.
4.     Implementation risk. Implementation of the program is
dependent on consistent collaboration amongst authorities,
especially between the MoF and the CBCG. These two economic
agencies have strong economic teams and routinely communicate,
discuss, and coordinate fiscal and financial sector policies. With
the new legislative framework now in place, the CBCG will need
to use its improved mandate to enforce prudential norms,
encourage higher capital and liquidity buffers, and take appropriate
supervisory measures for banks of special concern. To mitigate
implementation risks, the Bank has promoted an inclusive,
consultative approach in designing the program. Through a series
of technical consultations involving both the CBCG and MoF, the
team has sought to foster a mutual understanding and agreement on
the content of the reforms. Judging by the recent progress with the
reform program, it appears that regulator's actions are fully
coordinated with, and supported by the Government, without
jeopardizing the CBCG's operational independence. There is also
a risk that the implementation of politically sensitive and
technically complex reforms in the financial sector may stall or
even backtrack following the approval of this FSPBG. To mitigate
this risk, the prior actions for the proposed operation entail tangible
steps that would be hard to reverse.  Finally, adding to the
implementation risk, Montenegro is vulnerable to natural (e.g.,
earthquakes, floods) and climatic risks as evidenced by the
ongoing, extraordinarily cold winter, which resulted in the state of
emergency in February 2012, which could affect economic activity
and spending priorities.

﻿INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICY
BASED GUARANTEE
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.      This document describes a proposed EUR60 million (US$79.2 million
equivalent) Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee (FSPBG) to Montenegro in
support of a comprehensive banking sector reform program. The objective of the
operation is to support the authorities' efforts to strengthen the banking system and
increase its resilience to possible future shocks by continuing to undertake sectoral policy
reforms and system restructuring. The specific objectives of the Government's reform
program are to: (i) strengthen systemic risk monitoring and the crisis management
framework, (ii) address banking sector vulnerabilities, (iii) complete the restructuring of
Prva Banka, (iv) enhance depositors' confidence, and (v) further improve the regulatory
framework for the banking system. The program supported by the FSPBG has been
implemented primarily by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Central Bank of
Montenegro (CBCG).
2.      The objectives of the FSPBG are consistent with the key priorities laid out
in the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The FYI1-FY14 CPS for
Montenegro, endorsed by the Board in January 2011, envisages a series of two
programmatic financial sector development policy loans (DPLs). The first operation was
approved in September 2011, and the second DPL has been converted into a stand-alone
financial sector PBG. The proposed FSPBG falls under the first of the two main CPS
priority areas, as one of its key outcomes is expected to be "a stronger banking system
governed by a modern regulatory framework and central institutions, which is more
resilient to future shocks."
3.      The FSPBG is proposed considering the country's strong track record in
institutional, structural, and social policy reforms, an adequate track record on
macroeconomic management, and a satisfactory external financing plan. Since
independence in 2006, Montenegro has implemented a range of institutional and
structural reforms required of an aspiring European Union (EU) member country.
Recognizing the important progress with structural reforms so far, Montenegro became a
candidate country and on October 12, 2011, the European Commission (EC)
recommended the opening of formal membership negotiations for Montenegro. Further,
Montenegro was granted membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
December 2011 and in May 2012, it became 154th member of WTO, and the country is
expected to open the first chapters in membership negotiations with the EU in June 2012.
During the 2007-2008 period, the Government and the Central Bank implemented
macroprudential policy measures to limit the credit boom and Montenegro ran fiscal
surpluses and repaid some expensive debt. But, in the presence of increasing government
1


﻿revenues, it also raised previously compressed capital expenditures on basic
infrastructure and allowed some increases in public consumption, which added to
overheating pressures. Given Montenegro's full euroization and thus the absence of a
monetary policy instrument, the country was unable to fully contain the impact of large
inflows and build-up of risk exposure during the 2007-2008 global boom. In response to
the global crisis, since 2009, the Government has been pursuing a program of fiscal
consolidation and financial sector reforms. Facing the spillovers of the global financial
crisis, the authorities responded with extraordinary measures and managed to contain the
financial turmoil in the banking sector, including stabilization of the systemically
important Prva Banka that had a central role in the excessive credit growth during the
pre-crisis period. This Government's program merited the first Bank-supported Financial
Sector Development Policy Loan (FSDPL1) that was approved in September 2011 and
successfully disbursed in February 2012.
4.      Amidst the Eurozone turmoil and in volatile financial markets, the
proposed FSPBG will enable Montenegro to raise the desired volume of funding
under acceptable terms, and thus cover the financing gap for 2012:1
* The Guarantee approach is most beneficial for countries like Montenegro that
find themselves with this level of impaired access to market funding, particularly
during periods of market turbulence. The PBG of EUR60 million will facilitate
Government efforts to raise EUR80-100 million in funding that can help cover the
financing gap. At the beginning of 2012, yields on Montenegro's outstanding bonds,
which have three and four years remaining maturities, stood at about 10.5 percent.
These have since fallen somewhat, to just under 9 percent, representing some
marginal improvement in risk perception.    Yet, these assets are infrequently
exchanged, and caution should be taken in interpreting yields on illiquid bonds.
Moreover, for a bond issue of the size and tenor of the proposed operation, the
estimated cost to Montenegro would still be 9.5-10.0 percent in current markets,
provided that the "risk on" phase currently underway continues. The Guarantee and
the guaranteed debt's structure will provide the security required by lenders to extend
credit to Montenegro in the desired volume and under acceptable terms, in still
volatile markets. The overall transaction will concentrate the full guarantee coverage
on a final balloon payment at maturity, and allow unsecured borrowed amounts to be
amortized in preceding years.
* The FSPBG will be used to leverage significant private sector resources, with
only 60 percent of principal risk covered, or roughly 50 percent of the cash flow
risk for investors, in a transaction targeting EUR100 million. Hence, there is a
significant "crowding-in" of the private sector envisaged, even more than observed in
the Serbia and Macedonia transactions undertaken last year - where 85 percent and
65 percent, respectively, of cash flow risks were covered by the IBRD guarantee. A
transaction targeting EUR80 million would have leverage similar to levels achieved
in Macedonia's borrowing. Although Montenegro can obtain a competitively priced
In line with the IBRD's policy on PBGs, the proposed operation: i) provides incremental market access;
ii) leverages the Bank's capital better than a DPL; and iii) improves Montenegro's borrowing terms
considerably.

﻿loan (DPL) from the World Bank in the amount of US$20 million (approximately
EUR15 million), unsecured market borrowing may not materialize under any
acceptable terms in the current volatile market environment. Additionally, through a
PBG, IBRD capital may be recycled much more quickly than would occur in the case
of a DPL, with longer maturity. By tying up IBRD capital for only five years,
resources are made available sooner for other development initiatives in Montenegro.
* The FSPBG-supported bank loan would likely cost Montenegro around 5-6
percent, generating a savings of as much as 4 percent per annum over the life of
the loan. The IBRD Guarantee approach strikes the best balance between tradeoffs
of tenor, size and participation by the private sector. For a bond issue of the size and
tenor of the proposed operation, the estimated cost to Montenegro would be roughly
9.5-10.0 percent in current markets. Market soundings for the PBG-supported bank
loan suggest that the cost to Montenegro, including the guarantee fee, would be in the
order of 5-6 percent, a saving of roughly 4 percent per annum over the life of the
loan. This operation compares favorably with the savings achieved in the Serbia and
Macedonia operations, which were of the same magnitude, but had a higher
percentage of their cash flows guaranteed. Although the pricing specifics for
Montenegro have improved slightly in recent weeks, the future is still very uncertain
and pursuing an unsecured transaction, such as a plain vanilla bond issue, would be
not only costly but also risky from an execution perspective. This operation,
therefore, supports refinancing risk management of the authorities, by providing
access to source of financing that is to some extent insulated from market volatility.
II.   COUNTRY CONTEXT
A.        Pre-Crisis Developments and the Crisis Impact
5.      Montenegro's development over the past 10 years had three distinct phases.
The first phase was the period from the introduction of the euro in 2002 to independence
in 2006, which was characterized by gradually improving macroeconomic environment,
solid macroeconomic management and reforms. The second phase was the period of an
unsustainable, short-lived boom in 2007 and 2008, which ended abruptly following the
collapse of the Lehman brothers in September 2008. During this phase, the conduct of
macroeconomic policy was mixed: macro-prudential policy measures could have been
taken sooner and more aggressively to contain domestic credit boom and risk exposure.
In addition, the Government should have contained demands for increases in public
consumption to avoid adding to the overheating pressures being experienced by the
Montenegrin economy. The failure to do so, together with the expansion of the public
investment program to address large and long-standing underinvestment in infrastructure,
increased total government expenditures by over 9 percentage points of GDP during
2008. The third phase began in 2010 when the Government, in response to the crisis,
adopted a sounder macroeconomic policy posture and took fiscal and financial sector
measures to stabilize the economy, to restructure and strengthen the supervision of the
banking system, and to limit the social impact of the crisis.
3


﻿6.      During the first phase, following the adoption of the euro as legal tender in
2002, Montenegro's inflation and interest rates fell and reforms accelerated. By late
2006, Montenegro's economy found itself increasingly flushed by a large inflow of
external capital, which financed an economic, real estate, and credit boom. Foreign firms
and individuals (many from Russia, the United Kingdom and other countries in Western
Europe) acquired significant local assets, mainly land, housing, and other real estate.
7.      During the second phase, large capital inflows fueled a local credit boom,
and government spending increased, adding to the overheating pressures. The
general government was running surpluses of about 4 percent of GDP on average in both
2006 and 2007. But with a large revenue windfall, spending went up from 42 percent of
GDP in 2006 to over 50 percent of GDP in 2008, mainly driven by a surge in capital
expenditure, partly catching up from years of underinvestment in basic infrastructure.
Current expenditures increased as well, especially wages and current transfers. During
this boom period, Montenegro had one of the highest economic growth rates (9 percent)
and per capita foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe, and the gross fixed investment-
to-GDP ratio averaged 37 percent over the same period. The overheating resulted in the
widening of the current account deficit, albeit financed to a significant degree by large
FDI inflows.
8.      In the third phase, as the real estate and credit bubble burst, domestic
credit flow and liquidity suddenly stopped and the Montenegrin economy went into
recession in 2009. Growth plummeted, from almost 7 percent in 2008 to -5.7 percent in
2009, one of the sharpest growth declines among European and Central Asian economies.
External demand (in particular for aluminum and steel) dropped, while liquidity problems
in the financial and corporate sectors escalated. Total employment declined by almost 7
percent from the second half of 2009 to end-2010, despite a gradual moderation of wages
and shortened working hours. Unemployment increased to 16.5 percent in 2010.2 As a
result, the absolute poverty rate doubled to close to 7 percent in 2010.
9.      In response, the Government implemented emergency financial, fiscal and
social measures to stem the impact on the economy while continuing EU-accession
related structural reforms. An announcement of a bank deposit guarantee in October
2008 stopped the run on deposits. The Central Bank responded with a menu of measures
aimed at easing the liquidity crisis while strengthening inspection and supervision. On
the fiscal front, the Government implemented cuts in nominal wages and increased
spending on active labor market programs targeting the youth and new job entrants. It
also began preparing the ground for a significant further tightening of the budget in the
considerably changed external environment.
10.     With a sharp drop in economic activity, domestic demand and imports, a
significant external adjustment took place from 2009 onwards. The current account
deficit declined by half between 2008 and 2010, but remained high at about 25 percent of
GDP in 2010. But this should be seen in the context of the small size of Montenegro's

affiliated companies, which cut the work force by half from the pre-crisis level of more than 4,000 workers.

﻿economy and the fact that during 2006-2010, net FDI financed on average 70 percent of
the current account deficit. Since Montenegro's economy is significantly foreign owned
and euroized, the external current account deficit corrected for the net FDI flows is a
better measure of the external account position and financing pressures. This measure
shows more moderate, though still high deficit levels in the order of 10-12 percent of
GDP (except in 2008, Figure 2). Access to capital was retained through foreign banks'
increased financial support to their Montenegrin subsidiaries, which contributed to the
rise in private external debt to about 60 percent of GDP, while total external debt (public
and private) rose to close to 102 percent of GDP in 2010.

B.         Recent Economic Developments
11.      Gradual economic recovery and external adjustment ensued in 2010-2011.
In this period, growth averaged about 2.5 percent per year (Table 1). The 2011 growth
was broad-based, supported by improving terms of trade and a good tourist season.
However, the sluggish recovery of credit and labor markets continues to constrain the
economic recovery.3 The rise in global commodity prices and excise taxes, as well as the
recovery of domestic demand led to a moderate rise in inflation from 0.5 percent in 2010
to 3.1 percent in 2011. With growth and import recovery, the external adjustment
continued in 2011. The current account deficit (CAD) declined to below 20 percent of
GDP in 2011. This was mostly due to a surge in exports of goods (led by aluminum and
electricity) and services. Imports recovered moderately by 11 percent over the same
period. The FDI-to-CAD ratio still stood at 61 percent. Despite difficult external
conditions, the Government was able to issue first Eurobonds to cover the financing
needs.4
Reflecting the process of deleveraging taking place in Montenegro, inter-enterprise arrears reached 11.3
percent of GDP in December 2011 and the private sector has accumulated tax arrears in the amount of
about 6 percent of GDP.
4 A five-year, E200-million Eurobond was issued in September 2010 at a rate of 7.875 percent, was
followed by another E180-million Eurobond in April 2011 at 7.375 percent after receiving a positive
outlook on the reconfirmed credit rating by Moody's (at Ba3).

12.       The Government started fiscal consolidation in 2010-11. On the fiscal side,
the Government pursued a strong adjustment, mostly on the expenditure side: by 2011,
the Government had cut total public expenditures by about 8 percentage points of GDP
from its peak in 2009 (Table 1) . A freeze in public sector wages, staffing rationalization,
and expenditure restraint in operations and maintenance costs, and the capital budget
helped reduce spending so that the government deficit is estimated at about at 3.6 percent
of GDP in 2011. This was achieved despite the declining revenue-to-GDP ratio and a
rise in tax arrears, the bankruptcy of the steel mill that triggered a call on government
guarantee equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP, and increases in military pensioners as part
of the adjustment in the context of the Government's efforts towards NATO membership.
Total public debt in 2011 reached 56.9 percent of GDP, including guarantees. External
private debt declined, dropping by 20 percentage points of GDP from 2008, reflecting
significant deleveraging.
13.       In   parallel,   the    Government       intensified   its   efforts   to   promote
competitiveness, recognizing the criticality of structural reforms and investment
climate. This included improvements in: (i) the Doing Business 2012 indicators, which

﻿ranked Montenegro as 56th from among 183 rated countries, second most favorable rating
in the Western Balkans after FYR Macedonia; (ii) labor market regulations, through the
passage of the new Labor Law; (iii) restructuring and privatization of non-strategic state-
owned companies, (iv) simplifying business and tax registration under the one-stop-shop
concept; (v) reducing complexity and time to obtain construction permits; (vi) adopting
new bankruptcy and enforcement laws; and (vii) reducing non-tax fees and the time
necessary for connection to electricity grids. In 2012, the Government is deepening these
reforms by introducing a Regulatory Impact Assessment, finalizing the regulatory
guillotine work, and further simplifying business licensing.
14.     Social sector reforms, in which Montenegro is among the more advanced
countries in the ECA region, continued. After previous increases in the retirement age,
the latest amendments to the Pension Insurance Act in 2011 resulted in automatic annual
increases in the retirement age from 60 (women) and 65 (men) to 67 for both men and
women by 2040. The authorities introduced amendments to the Labor Law to reduce
dismissal costs and simplify hiring. The Parliament has also adopted: (i) the amendments
to the Law on Social Security to introduce a voluntary insurance premium to cover 20
percent of the basic health package, which would otherwise be subject to copayments,
and (ii) the amendments to the Law on Child Care, which limit the maternity leave
benefits at the average wage. The aim of these measures is to ensure fiscal sustainability
and limit work disincentives since the labor force participation and employment rates (at
60 and 56 percent, respectively) are low in Montenegro. Notably, owing to past technical
assistance, including from the World Bank, Montenegro has one of the best targeted and
fiscally affordable social assistance systems in Europe and Central Asia.
C.        Banking Sector
Pre-Crisis Development
15.     Montenegro's banking system had experienced a particularly strong credit
boom prior to 2008 financed by parent bank lending. Total credit grew by 145
percent annually on average in 2006 and 2007, increasing from 39 percent of GDP to 84
percent of GDP, and was concentrated particularly in the real estate sector.6 The high
credit growth was coupled with lax credit underwriting standards that led to a large
accumulation of credit risk in banks' loan portfolios; much of this credit increase was
financed by parent bank lending, resulting in high liquidity risk exposures. Funding from
parent banks increased significantly from 8 percent of total liabilities in 2006 to 21
percent in 2008. And as a result, the loan-to-deposit ratio (LTD) ratio increased from 79
percent in 2006 to 150 percent in June 2009.
16.     The CBCG as a prudential supervisor implemented several regulatory
measures to curb the credit boom. In 2006 and 2007, the CBCG widened the deposit
base subject to reserve requirements to include savings deposits, and differentiated the
reserve requirement rate for demand (19 percent) and savings (5 percent) deposits. The
6 A large portion of the increase in real estate development financing was driven by the surge in tourism
and development of the tourism sector.
8


﻿main restrictions imposed by means of regulatory measures concerned quantitative
limitations to credit growth of the largest banks, which were introduced in 2007. The aim
was to both slow down credit growth and improve the maturity structure of banks'
deposit financing. Further, a new Banking Law was adopted and further implemented in
early 2008. The aim was to increase banks' capitalization, and to improve the quality of
supervision. Credit growth slowed down in 2008 in response to the prudential measures,
however, banks became concerned about their deteriorating liquidity position as the
global financial crisis unfolded at the same time.
17.     But in the absence of monetary policy instruments, more could have been
done through macroprudential policy. Given Montenegro's full euroization, monetary
policy was not available as a tool to curb the increasing risk associated with fast credit
growth. Although macroprudential policy instruments were not widely used by policy
makers at that time, some successful examples in the region existed (e.g. Poland and
Croatia). Therefore, at least from an ex-post perspective, more could have been done
using macroprudential policy tools to manage the capital inflows to the banking sector
and the accumulating risk exposures.
Crisis Impact
18.     The rapid expansion came to a halt and Montenegro experienced a severe
credit crunch with the onset of the global crisis in late 2008. Total bank assets that
stood at 111 percent of GDP by end-2007 have been contracting since 2008 (Table 2).
The credit crunch reached its peak in 2009 with a 14 percent decline year on year, due to
banks' rising asset quality problems and a decline in demand for loans from a corporate
sector affected by the weakening economy. The availability of parent bank credit
declined and Montenegro's banks were forced to adjust their liquidity risk exposures.
Borrowings from parent banks as a share of total liabilities dropped from 20 percent (21
percent of GDP) in 2008 to 13 percent (11 percent of GDP) in 2011. Consequently, the
system's LTD decreased from 150 percent in June 2009 to 108 percent by December
2011. Further, as banks have focused on cleaning up their balance sheets in 2010 and
2011, credit continued to decline throughout 2010 and 2011 (Table 2).

19.     The weak condition of banks shattered depositors' confidence, and
increasing non-performing loans (NPLs) made banks draw down on capital buffers.
A massive withdrawal of deposits undermined the banking system's liquidity in late
9


﻿2008. Between September 2008 and 2011, the banking sector lost more than 21 percent
of its total deposits. The system's liquid assets to short term liabilities ratio reached a
low of 21 percent in 2008.7 As a consequence of rapidly increasing NPLs8, nine out of
11 banks had to be recapitalized by their shareholders, as bank profitability turned
strongly negative (ROE at -10 percent) at the same time, reaching its low of -27.1 percent
in 2010 (Table 3).
20.      Parent banks supported their Montenegrin subsidiaries with necessary
liquidity support and substantial capital injections. This helped partially offset
declining domestic deposits and capital erosion. Importantly, the parent banks provided
about EUR230 million in new capital from end-2008 to March 2011. The bank liquidity
situation was also helped by large cash inflows from partial privatization of electricity
production and distribution.

21.      An emergency anti-crisis Law on Measures for Protection of the Banking
System (MPBS) was implemented in October 2008 as a policy response to the crisis
situation. The provisions of the MPBS Law were generally consistent with crisis
responses seen in other countries, giving the Government the authority to: (i) fully
guarantee the deposits of all individuals and legal persons; (ii) facilitate credit guarantees
for interbank loans; (iii) provide emergency liquidity support to a bank for a period of up
to one year; (iv) upon a bank's request, make a prepayment of state borrowings from that
bank (including loans carrying a government guarantee); and (v) provide funds for a
bank's recapitalization, to protect the banking system's stability. The Law also allowed
7 The minimum liquidity ratio (liquid assets to due liabilities) required by the regulation is one. The ratio is
calculated as an average over all working days in a ten-day period. Liquid assets include cash and near
cash. Due liabilities include: loan payables; interest and fee payables; due time deposits; 30 percent of
demand deposits; 10 percent of liabilities for granted but not-performed irrevocable loan liabilities (credit
lines); other due liabilities.
8 The rapid rise in NPLs during 2010 was driven by several factors, including: (i) the contraction in total
loans as banks ceased lending; (ii) large banks (particularly CKB and Hypo) "cleaning" their loan
portfolios in 2010 in anticipation of spinning off large volumes of NPLs to their foreign parents, and (iii)
Prva Banka's delayed recognition of its NPLs.
10


﻿the CBCG to: (i) approve the use of required reserves; and (ii) use up to 50 percent of its
capital for granting short-term loans to banks.9 The MPBS served its intended purpose
and expired at the end of 2009. Furthermore, a number of banks benefited from state
guarantees given by the MoF for credit lines provided by the European Investment Bank
(EIB) and KfW totaling EUR122 million to support lending to small and medium
enterprises (SMEs).
22.     Prva Banka - the largest domestically owned bank - experienced the most
significant outflow of deposits and was the only bank to receive emergency support
from the State. A controlling interest in Prva Banka was acquired in 2006 by a group of
local investors related to the then Prime Minister. Subsequently, the bank's assets grew
explosively (by 1,600 percent from 2006 to end-2008) to make it the country's second
largest bank and the only domestically owned bank of systemic importance. Following a
massive outflow of deposits, the bank started to experience severe liquidity problems at
the end of 2008 that threatened to undermine confidence in the entire banking system.
23.     Faced with chronic asset-liability mismatches and the rapid withdrawal of
deposits, Prva Banka ceased to function as a normal commercial bank as of the fall
of 2008, when the CBCG       imposed a freeze on new     lending activities.  The
management of the bank was replaced in late 2008, at the same time as Prva received a
EUR44 million emergency loan from the Government of Montenegro (GoM). The loan
was repaid in 2009, but underlying asset quality problems remained, with a negative
impact on the bank's capital position. The bank also continued to rely heavily on
deposits from the Central Government and other majority state-owned entities. The
authorities have been implementing a comprehensive restructuring strategy for Prva
Banka (see Section III and Section V), including a staged withdrawal of Government
deposits and recapitalization of the bank.
Recent Developments
24.     Banks are completing their recapitalization efforts and focusing on
decreasing their liquidity risk exposures by trying to raise more local deposits. Due
to the low collections from loans, many banks faced liquidity pressures and have thus
been striving to reduce their liquidity risk exposures by raising more local deposits. In
the first three quarters of 2011, deposits showed some signs of recovery increasing
around 6 percent and mirroring slow improvements in the overall economy with a
slowdown towards the year end (Figure 4). As a result of previous recapitalization
efforts, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the system stood at 16.5 percent as of
December 2011, above the prudential minimum requirement of 10 percent.
9 CBCG was proactive in introducing a number of temporary changes in prudential regulations to respond
to the special challenges presented by the global financial crisis, such as lowering reserve requirements to
ease liquidity pressures on banks and revising loan loss provisioning rules to facilitate loan restructuring.

25.    Mid-size banks that were conservative during the credit boom lead the new
lending activity, supported by direct booking of loans with parent banks. Banks
have tightened credit standards in light of the uncertainty from the on-going economic
slowdown in the Eurozone and the still high NPL levels in the system. Banks with low
NPLs continue increasing their lending while those with high NPLs have reorganized
internally to work out NPLs with clients and resume stronger lending activity in the
short-term. By December 2011, aggregate annual credit growth was still negative, but
very heterogeneous across individual banks, ranging between -17 percent and 20 percent.
Especially healthier, midsize banks have been growing their loan portfolios. The NPL
situation that hinders lending at some banks is complicated by the stock of bad debt and
payment arrears in the real economy, and overall bottlenecks in the insolvency and debt
restructuring legal frameworks.10 The limited amount of new lending to the economy is
concentrated in consumer lending and SMEs (including self-employed) as banks try to
diversify their loan portfolios away from large enterprises (Figure 3). There are also
indications of an increase in cross-border claims on the Montenegrin non-banking sector
(at 33 percent year-on-year by September 2011), suggesting that domestic clients access
directly parent bank financing.
26.      As of end-2011, the priorities for Montenegro's banking sector are
continued strengthening of banks' capitalization and liquidity positions, and
resolution of the NPL stock in the economy. Although banking system profitability is
bouncing back to positive territory in Q1 2012, the financial soundness indicators suggest
that the banking sector is still to find a decisive recovery trend.  Thus, restoring
soundness across the system remains a priority in order to fully resume new lending to
creditworthy enterprises and projects. In this regard, through the recently strengthened
legal framework, the CBCG is adequately empowered to foster financial stability, and the
authorities have been developing contingency plans in the view of the Eurozone crisis to
be able to cope with any future external shocks.
10 The Montenegrin authorities have recently requested assistance from the World Bank to diagnose the
situation and implement reforms that would aid the workouts of current bad debts and prevent their
excessive build-up in the future.

﻿D. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability
The Government's macroeconomic and fiscal program
27.      Real GDP is projected to slow down to 0.5 percent in 2012, but recover to
3-3.5 percent over the medium term, supported by FDI in energy, tourism and
construction (Table 4 and Table 5)." The growth outlook for 2012 has been revised
downwards from what was envisioned at the time the original 2012 budget was approved
and reflects the deteriorating external environment facing countries that are closely
integrated to Western Europe. On April 25, 2012, the Government approved an amended
budget to reflect these developments and introduced additional revenue and expenditure
measures. The Parliament approved the amended budget on May 24, 2012. This section
reflects the revised macroeconomic framework of the amended budget. Over the medium
term, growth is expected to become more diversified, driven by moderate domestic
demand growth as disposable income rises and investments recover. Investment levels
are expected to stabilize at about 21 percent of GDP. With the continued strengthening
of the financial sector and gradual firming of economic activity and incomes, national
savings are projected to gradually rise to an average of about 8.7 percent of GDP in 2014-
2015, reducing somewhat reliance on foreign savings. However, growth recovery will
only gradually translate into labor market improvements. The inflation projection is set
at 2.5 percent on average throughout 2012-2015 (Table 4).12
" Since last year, the turmoil in the Middle East and Greece has resulted in some diversion of tourist flows
to other summer tourist destinations, including Montenegro. Several potential investments are at various
stages of discussion, including: (i) a highway connecting the coastline areas to the Corridor X; (ii) hydro-
power plants with an undersea energy cable to Italy; and (iii) leasing of several largely undeveloped
beaches for the construction and management of high-end tourist facilities. In addition, the privatization of
the Port Bar is expected to proceed after the restructuring of the company; the restructuring process is being
supported by an EBRD loan (EUR 66 million).
12 The Government's amended macroeconomic framework, described in this document, reflects the recently
revised outlook for growth in 2012-15 and the fiscal measures developed in the budget amendment
approved by Parliament in May 2012. Reflecting the Government's recognition of a deteriorating external
environment, growth is estimated at 0.5 percent in 2012, significantly below the assumptions in the original
budget; the medium term growth is projected to gradually increase towards 3.5 percent by 2015. Also,
fiscal outturns record called guarantees in 2011 and 2012 for the steel mill and aluminum company when
they were issued (EUR42.2 million to the aluminum company in 2009 and EUR108.3 mill to the steel and
the aluminum company in 2010); 2009 and 2010 is when much of the aggregate demand impact of these
guarantees took place. The alternative measure of the overall fiscal balance in the tables of this document
records these guarantees at the time they were called. The repayment of the called guarantees is treated as
public debt repayment from 2011 onwards (following the original repayment schedule) and interest
payments are also recorded as they take place. As noted in the IMF's recent Article IV, the fiscal position
tightened in 2011 by 0.7 percent of GDP if called guarantees are excluded; the demand boost of these
guarantees took place in earlier years (see Montenegro Article IV Consultation, May 2012). In addition,
cyclical developments contributed as much as 1.6 percent of GDP to the 2011 fiscal deficit. It is also worth
noting that the Government's fiscal accounts adjust cash spending by the rise in net payment arrears using
data provided by the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance while the alternative measure of the
overall fiscal balance includes estimates of local government arrears; the latter also contributes to the
difference between the two reported measures of the overall fiscal balance.

28.       Recent developments with the aluminum             company have also resulted in
unexpected budgetary outlays and fiscal risks moving forward. First, in February
2012, the Government converted the EUR22 million guarantee to Deutsche Bank on a
loan to the aluminum company into public debt. The loan was repaid in full and raised
Government's current debt service by about 0.67 percent of GDP).                   Second, the
aluminum company, currently majority owned by the Russian CEAC group, had
accumulated payment arrears to the electricity company in the amount of EUR28 million
and tax arrears of about EUR[20] million, which triggered the Parliamentary request to
the Government to launch the cancellation of the privatization contract. The resolution of
the contractual terms and future ownership is pending. Third, another potential liability
for the budget could arise from the Government's ongoing negotiations with the
Hungarian OTP and Russian VTB on rescheduling of the other two guaranteed loans in
the amount of EUR42.2 million and EUR60 million, respectively, to the company. While
the current loan schedule spreads repayments over a three to five-year period, these
pressures together add up to an additional EUR102 million (3 percent of 2012 GDP)
public debt service.
29.       As a result of these developments, the Government has intensified its fiscal
consolidation efforts to contain the overall fiscal deficit (Table 5). On the revenue
side, the Government in January 2012 increased key excises and the property tax rate,
stepped up revenue collection efforts and took steps to expand the tax base, including by
reducing exemptions. However, given the weaker growth and revenue outcomes in the
14


﻿early months of the year, the 2012 budget amendment adopted by the Government in
April 2012 and approved by the Parliament on May 24, 2012 raised further excises on
alcohol and other products; increased tax on privileged pensions; introduced levies on
mobile telephony SIM cards, smoking public place areas, meters measuring electricity,
and cable TVs; and additional measures to improve tax compliance. These new measures
are expected to generate about 0.6 percent of GDP in additional revenues during 2012.
On the expenditure side, a conservative indexation mechanism for wages and pensions
has already been adopted and is backed by a formal agreement with the unions on a
further reduction of public sector wages and employment. These measures are expected
to reduce wage billl3 and transfers to the social insurance funds but, reflecting the
government's careful budget planning, have not been included in the 2012 budget
amendment. The budget also includes rationalization of some subsidies (state aid) and
social transfers (e.g., labor market programs) and maintenance of critical capital
expenditures. The issuance of new government guarantees is limited to EUR1O million
(about 0.3 percent of GDP), signaling a shift to a much more restrictive policy towards
guarantees. In addition, on the expenditure side, the budget amendment features further
cuts in current expenditures by 0.34 percent of GDP and delays in some non-essential
capital expenditures that will result in savings of about 0.14 percent of GDP in 2012.
Importantly, the primary deficit will also be cut-relative to the 2011 outturn-by 1.9
percentage points to 0.2 percent of GDP. As a result of the downward revision of growth
and revenues, the budgetary impact of the recent developments with the aluminum
company, and the revised fiscal consolidation package, the fiscal deficit in 2012 is
projected to be 2.3 percent of GDP, somewhat higher than the original fiscal deficit of 1.2
percent projected for 2012 but 1.3 percentage points lower than the outturn for 2011.
30.     In parallel to the revised 2012 budget, the Government has adopted
additional measures that are likely to generate additional savings. For example, the
government (i) adopted a law on a 7-percent cut in wages of top government officials,
diplomats and judiciary; (ii) reduced per diems allowances for official travel by 20
percent; (iii) reduced privileged pensions for sportsmen, and launched a review and
revision of disability pensions; (iv) abolished governing boards' allowances in health,
social, cultural and educational state institutions; and (v) ordered a reduction in salaries of
management at SOEs.
31.     Over the medium term, the amended fiscal framework aims to deepen
fiscal consolidation, move towards fiscal surpluses, and reverse the debt dynamics,
setting the public debt of Montenegro on a downward trajectory (Table 4 and Table
5). The Government's objective is to stem further growth in public debt which, along
with guarantees, reached 57 percent of GDP in 2011. The medium-term strategy is built
on a plan to reduce general government spending by additional 4.5 percentage points of
GDP, down to about 38.1 percent of GDP, by 2015 (from close to 53 percent of GDP in
" With 12.8 percent of GDP spent on wages, Montenegro stands out as an outlier compared to larger
regional economies such as Serbia or Croatia (at 10.5 percent), but is on par with many small states facing
higher fixed cost of basic functions of the state. Montenegro's wage bill is similar to Slovenia (12.7
percent) and below Bosnia and Herzegovina (13.1 percent of GDP). Importantly, the centralized wage bill
calculation and payment system led to the upward adjustment of the wage bill by roughly 2 percent of GDP
on the account of health sector workers' wages, which is not necessarily reflected in regional peers data.
15


﻿2009)-a reduction in total public expenditures-to-GDP ratio by 13 percentage points
over a five year period 2009-13. The Government's long-term objective is to reach the
expenditure ratio of about 30-35 percent of GDP. The Government has either prepared or
implemented significant measures to further restrain spending and improve its efficiency
over the medium term (see Box 1). The most important of these relate to the control of
pension increases and moderation of wage bill in line with formal agreements with the
labor unions.

32.       Beyond fiscal consolidation, the Montenegrin Government plans to continue
strengthening competitiveness of its economy and prepare the ground for more
robust     long-term       growth.        This   strategy     includes: (i)      creating    fiscal buffers      and
protecting macroeconomic stability; (ii) continuing restructuring of the financial and real
sector; (iii) accelerating structural reforms in social, labor, and education sectors as well
as public administration to ensure sustainability of public finances; and (iv) strengthening
the enabling environment for private sector growth.

﻿Box 1: The Government's medium-term fiscal reform measures
*   The pension system reform, in line with good international practice, resulted in the
increase in the retirement age from 55/60 to 67 for men and women, following automatic
adjustments with the transition period of 20 years. The pension indexation was changed
to a more conservative 75 percent of CPI and 25 percent of the average wage, a more
conservative mechanism than the so-called Swiss formula (50-50).
*   The public administration reform through staff downsizing implemented a "two-for-
one" principle, i.e., one employed for two staff leaving the public sector or three retiring;
the central payroll calculation and a wage freeze;
*   The state aid reform, whereby subsidized electricity to metal industries will cease by
end-2012;
*   The rationalization of social security costs and transfers through capping total health
and social benefit expenditures, consolidating insurance funds under the Single Treasury
Account, and imposing central oversight of the use of budget funds;
*   Centralized authorization/management of public procurement and the Single
Treasury Account commitment module to prevent further accumulation of arrears;
*   Moderation of capital spending and their protection to 3.5 percent of GDP throughout
the period;
*   Drafted amendments to the organic budget act to formally introduce the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework and the fiscal rule in 2012; and
*   Stepped up efforts in tax collection and gradual increases in property tax and excise
duties (also required as a part of the EU accession program).
External financing requirements
33.      The resulting fiscal consolidation and the ongoing deleveraging process are
expected to reduce external financing needs over the medium term. The large stock
of private sector foreign debt (around 60 percent of total) and corresponding obligations
maturing over the medium term suggest significant external vulnerabilities. However, as
noted above, private external debt is being reduced significantly through the ongoing
process of deleveraging. About 70 percent of the private sector debt is concentrated in a
few sectors, such as the financial sector, metals and processing, and construction and real
estate.  This debt is also owed by a small number of large private, wholly or
predominantly foreign owned banks and enterprises, often to their parent affiliates.14
During 2012-2015, the external financing requirements will amount to about 26 percent
of GDP, gradually declining as the economy recovers. Public debt refinancing needs
amount around 7 percent of GDP in 2012, of which half is due to domestic creditors.
With the proposed FSPBG and the regular disbursement profile, the IBRD might cover
around 4.8 percent of GDP of overall gross financing needs. Over the 2012-2015 period,
debt service to the IBRD will be around 7.4 percent of total debt service (Table 6).
14 The highly concentrated private external debt suggests that large parts of the private sector are not
heavily indebted.

34.       External imbalances are projected            to  continue   moderating     over the
medium term. The current account deficit is expected to decline to 17.8 percent of GDP
by 2015, led by growth in exports of goods, transport and, especially, tourism services,
and a moderate rise in imports (at 4 percent). With FDI projected conservatively at 14
percent of GDP over the 2012-2015 period (much lower than in the pre-crisis period),
such a deficit would be financeable and within the country's debt-stabilizing level. FDI,
driven by the already launched privatizations in energy and tourism, would cover three
fourths of the current account deficit, reducing financing pressures.
Debt sustainability analysis'5
35.       Montenegro's total external debt is projected to decline to 91 percent of
GDP by 2016, after reaching a peak of 103 percent of GDP in 2009. However, the
projection remains highly sensitive to changes in macroeconomic assumptions.                  In
particular, assuming a moderate export recovery, the debt-to-export ratio will decline to
about 230 percent by 2016 (from its peak in 2010 of 286 percent). Debt service as a
15 The debt sustainability analysis, both for external and public debt, is based on the 2012 and medium-term
growth assumptions described earlier and incorporate the expected effect of the amended budget approved
by Parliament in May 2012, including the government's plan to continue with its fiscal consolidation
efforts over the medium- and long-term.
18


﻿share of exports is expected to decline to around 33 percent by 2016 from 43 percent in
2012. The sensitivity analysis suggests that the combined shock of an implicit interest
rate of 4.3 percent, real growth at zero percent throughout the observed period (as
opposed to 2.4 percent in the baseline), and a non-interest current account deficit at 7
percent (as opposed to 10 percent) would widen the external debt by 12 percentage points
of GDP compared to the baseline.
36.      Public debt with guarantees is estimated to decline to 45 percent of GDP by
2016, reflecting the conversion of guarantees to the aluminum company into public
debt and a 1.1 percentage point spending reduction per year. The Government also
intends to build over the medium term some fiscal reserves as a cushion against future
unforeseen shocks. The sensitivity analysis, however, shows that under the growth shock
scenario of real growth at zero percent throughout the observed period (as opposed to 2.4
percent in the baseline) and no policy response, public debt would widen by almost 17
percentage points of GDP compared to the baseline. Thus there are significant risks to
debt sustainability, suggesting the criticality of implementation of the government's
medium term fiscal consolidation plans.

increase of nominal interest rate throughout the projection period. The baseline scenario follows the
Government's amended budget scenario, which assumes 0.5 percent growth in 2012 and the pick-up
thereafter.

Risks and the Government's contingency fiscal plans
37.      Policy and external risks to the implementation of the Government's
program remain substantial. First, there is a risk that social tensions and political
pressures weaken the fiscal consolidation efforts. So far, however, the Government has
shown resolve in pursuing the proposed fiscal strategy and reached a key agreement with
19


﻿the unions regarding wage and pension adjustments; it is also preparing the introduction
of an explicit fiscal rule in 2013 to institutionalize fiscal discipline over the long term.
Second, the heavy reliance on tourism revenues, FDI, and exports to the neighboring
Western Balkans countries makes the country vulnerable to the recession in the EU.
Third, deleveraging and low capital inflows may put further pressures on the private
sector and households, worsening the payment discipline. Fourth, as explained above,
the Government could be forced to take over additional public debt as a result of
triggered guarantees (as happened in February 2012), which this medium-term fiscal
framework already accounts for. Fifth, Montenegro is also vulnerable to natural (e.g.,
earthquakes, floods) and climatic risks. To the extent these risks materialize further
policy efforts would be required. The Government is keenly aware of these risks and is
committed to implementing substantial contingency measures, as laid out below and, in
more detail, in its Letter of Development Policy (to be added). Given these risks and
increasing uncertainties in the Eurozone, and in addition to the May 2012 revisions to the
budget, the Government is considering an increase in the standard Value-Added tax rate
(currently the lowest in the region at 17 percent) if this were to be needed; the
consideration being given by the government to possible increases in VAT rates is part of
the public discourse in Montenegro, thus serving to signal the government's commitment
to consolidation efforts. These measures are likely to be activated later in the year if a
further deterioration in economic conditions materializes.
38.     The macroeconomic policy framework on which the budget amendment is
based and the Government's ongoing efforts, although subject to substantial risks
described above, are considered adequate for the purposes of the proposed
operation. The set of macroeconomic policies proposed in the Government's program, if
implemented within the outlined scenario, should enable gradual recovery of
Montenegro's economy beyond 2011 along with steady improvements in the fiscal
position and declines in the public and overall external debt. Furthermore, the declining
public sector deficit throughout the observed period would reduce financing risks.
E. Eligibility for Policy-Based Guarantee
Criterion A: The country should have a strong track record of performance, and its
structural, social and macroeconomic policy package should be satisfactory.
39.     Montenegro has established a track record of policies to achieve
macroeconomic stability, despite significant challenges brought about by
exceptional external capital inflows and the global crisis in 2008-2009.
Macroeconomic stability was established following the adoption of the euro in 2002:
inflation and interest rates fell to single digits and the re-monetization of the economy
continued at a healthy rate until Montenegro's independence in 2006.   In 2007,
exceptionally large external capital inflows triggered a credit and real estate boom.
During the 2007-2008 period, the Government and the Central Bank implemented
financial and macroprudential policy measures to lean against the private sector savings-
investment imbalances and correct the credit boom. Although in the right direction, these
measures fell short of the desired outcomes. The Government ran fiscal surpluses, repaid
some expensive debt, and raised previously compressed capital expenditures on basic
20


﻿infrastructure but temporary increases in public consumption added to the overheating
pressures. Despite this, when facing the negative spillovers of the global financial crisis
in late 2008 and 2009, the Government maintained stability and avoided a generalized
banking crisis using a combination of confidence enhancing and liquidity supporting
measures. Moreover, since 2010, the Government continued strengthening the fiscal and
financial sector positions, despite the difficult external environment.
40.     Further, the Government has remained committed to fiscal prudence in the
context of the fully euroized economy (see Section II.D). Since the peak reached in
government spending during 2009, government expenditures have been reduced by 8
percentage points of GDP; the fiscal deficit was reduced from 6.7 percent of GDP in
2009 to 3.6 percent in 2011. In addition, the Government is committed to pursuing
longer term fiscal consolidation leading to the restoration of fiscal surpluses and building
of fiscal buffers as well as introducing formal fiscal rules, limiting the size of deficits and
public debt in the future. An independent central bank (which does not issue domestic
currency) regulates, and supervises the banking system and manages the macro economy
with price stability and financial sector stability objectives. The capacity in key agencies
to analyze, plan and implement policies has been continuously improving, in particular as
the country continues to strengthen its institutions along with the EU acquis
harmonization process.
41.     The Government has been pursuing a program of financial sector reform.
Facing the spillovers of the global financial crisis, the authorities responded with
significant measures and managed to contain the financial turmoil in the banking sector,
including stabilization of the systemically important Prva Banka that had had a central
role in the excessive credit growth during the pre-crisis period. This Government
program merited the first World Bank-supported Financial Sector Development Policy
Loan (FSDPL1) that was approved in September 2011 and successfully disbursed in
February 2012.
Business climate and restructuring
42.     Restructuring of public enterprises helped transform   the ownership
structure in the economy and boost private sector investments. The privatization
process gained momentum after 2001, and so far, more than 85 percent of state-owned
capital has been privatized. Foreign owners now dominate in many sectors of the
economy, including  banking, metals, and   tourism.   This process supported
entrepreneurial behavior, concomitantly reducing state subsidies.  A  number of
uncompetitive enterprises were closed, however, structural unemployment rose as a
result. Nonetheless, public support for further privatization has weakened over time
owing to the perceptions of inadequate transparency, accountability, and corruption.
43.     The improving business climate helped attract investment and stimulate
competition. As a result, Montenegro's Doing Business Rank improved from 64th to 56th
between 2006 and 2011. Further, a Council for Foreign Direct Investments chaired by
the Prime Minister was established to monitor and guide further reforms.   A
comprehensive business-enabling regulatory reform started in 2009 and, by 2011, some
21


﻿690 regulations and 320 administrative proceedings have been reviewed. Gains are
particularly evident in the reduced time and costs required to start a business, but also in
improved taxes and contributions' collection. Property and creditors' rights are being
strengthened. Reforms of the land registry and cadastre have advanced increasing the
territorial coverage by more than 11 percent since 2008. Further improvements in
property registration are expected after the adoption of the spatial planning documents
that is underway. The court system is better organized and new laws, including those on
Administrative Procedures and Enforcement, strengthened the enforcement of court
judgments.
44.     Financial sector reforms implemented since 2002 played a crucial role in
providing competitive and stable financing to the private sector. A new regulatory
regime, following sound international practice, was put in place in 2002. As a result,
unviable state-owned banks were closed and Western European banking groups entered
the banking sector.16  Due to increased competition, the banking sector deepened
significantly. Improved financial sector regulation and enforcement facilitated the
privatization and consolidation of the insurance sector. In parallel, the 2002 mass
voucher privatization supported capital market development.
45.     Labor market reforms have continued, improving labor market flexibility.
The 2008 labor regulation reform made the Montenegrin labor market one of the more
flexible labor markets in Europe, as measured by the EPL Index (Employment Protection
by Legislation Index), the value of which improved from 4.1 to 1.7 between 2003-2008
(the OECD average being 2.0). The flexibility of the labor market was further increased
by the enacted Amendments to the Labor Law in 2011.
Human resources
46.     The authorities have commenced a broad reform program to improve
education and social outcomes.  Since 2005, primary and secondary Vocational
Education and Training reforms modernized the curricula and improved access to
education services. Public funding of education was increased in constant terms by an
estimated 63 percent over 2005-2009. In 2008, the primary and secondary enrollment
rates reached 98.2 and 87.6 percent. Over 2005-2010, two new private universities were
established, and the number of students enrolled in higher education increased by 64.3
percent.
47.     A well-targeted social assistance program, albeit still with low coverage,
has been put in place. The Family Material Support (FMS/MOP) for low income
households is well targeted. The health system has broadly adequate resources and is
gradually improving health outcomes.
16 Only two banks have majority domestic ownership. These are Prva Banka and Invest Banka Montenegro.
22


﻿Public sector reforms
48.     A series of tax and public expenditure reforms beginning in 2001, including
the introduction of VAT in 2003, established a modern statutory tax system that
helped strengthen revenue collection.
49.     Public expenditure and debt management reforms have advanced notably
since 2007. The amended Budget Law established medium-term budget planning and
integration of state funds into a single treasury account, and enabled internal control of
spending by administrative units and an internal audit function. Further, the adopted Law
on Public Internal Financial Control Development in 2008 improved financial
management and control. The first external audit was prepared for the 2005 budget,
following the establishment of the State Audit Institution.  The Law on Public
Procurement as of 2007, amended 2011, introduced a centralized approval process for
procurement plans to streamline public expenditures and improved governance.
50.     Montenegro has achieved substantial improvements in key international
indicators on governance as well as political and economic performance, and is a
strong performer among South Eastern Europe (SEE) countries. However, the prior
actions for EU membership negotiations define further rule-of-law reforms as priorities.

Criterion B: The country should have a sustainable external financing plan.
51.     The country's total external debt is high but its financing structure is
relatively robust, and debt is decreasing with the ongoing private and public sector
adjustment. Gross external debt (public and private) at end-2011 was around 100.7
percent of GDP and is expected to gradually decline to 91 percent of GDP by 2016.
Government and government-guaranteed external debt account for almost 40 percent of
GDP. Non-government external debt accounts for about 56 percent of GDP; however,
only 8 percent of GDP is short-term debt. Net external debt reached 73 percent of GDP
at end-20 11, where its predominant financing by FDI and the decent foreign reserves
coverage moderate substantially any related risks. The exposure to volatile capital flows
is small and short-term debt is largely associated with green-field and other FDI which
further diminishes its reversibility. Debt servicing indicators are generally adequate.
52.     External financing requirements will remain moderate from 2012 onwards.
The current account deficit is predicted to decline to 17 percent of GDP (from 20 percent
in 2011) and the FDI pipeline for 2012 even under conservative projections remains
23


﻿sufficiently strong. The ratio of debt service to exports of goods and services will decline
to below 32 percent by 2014 from around 42 percent in 2011. The repayment of
Eurobonds in 2015 and 2016 will increase Government's financing needs, but these are
expected to be rolled over at maturity with contained refinancing risk.
53.     The ongoing fiscal consolidation will keep    financing requirements
manageable. The Government financing needs (deficit and debt repayment) will decline
from 10.6 percent of GDP in 2011 to 7 percent of GDP in 2015. The debt issuance
supported by the proposed FSPBG will cover around 31 percent of Government financing
needs in 2012. A sizeable portfolio of projects with bilateral and multilateral creditors
(including IBRD, EBRD, EIB, Council of Europe Development Bank, and KfW) will
also bring foreign financing, as will the increasing absorption of EU pre-accession funds.
Criterion C: The country should have a coherent borrowing strategy, which will enable
it to become a borrower in its own name without a guarantee in the medium term.
54.     The public debt management operations and        debt portfolio risk
management follow a medium-term debt management strategy. The medium-term
strategies provide guidelines for managing risks, setting the operational framework for
debt and cash management, and the management of guarantees. The 2005-2007 strategy
was focused on diverting public debt financing from (at that time) more expensive
domestic to less expensive foreign financing; the 2008-2010 strategy focused mostly on
pre-payment of public debt liabilities deriving from restitution, foreign frozen savings
and foreign loans.  The current strategy for the 2011-2013 period focuses on extending
maturities and fixing interest rates. To date, the average maturity of General Government
debt is 9.4 years, while the interest rate on 70 percent of debt is fixed. Approximately 89
percent of external debt, and all domestic debt, is denominated in euro.
55.     About half of Montenegrin public debt has been contracted on concessional
terms. Approximately 44.2 percent of total public external debt from IFIs comprising
mostly rescheduled debt from the former Yugoslavia. Additional 12.4 percent of total
external debt is in the form of "soft" bilateral loans. Domestic debt predominantly relates
to arrears incurred during the former Yugoslav era (44 percent), which are in the form of
non-interest bearing instruments.18 Commercial debt of the GoM includes short term
securities (up to 18 months) and borrowings from domestic banks with an average life of
five years.
56.     The authorities have so far issued 10.7 percent of GDP in guarantees (as of
end-2011) and shown reasonably good capacity for management of contingent
liabilities. Guarantees have mostly been issued for the loans granted by IFIs to state-
owned companies and credit guarantees to domestic banks in support of credit flow to the
economy during the crisis period. Exceptionally during 2009-2010, the GoM issued
guarantees for commercial bank loans to two companies of systemic importance for the

﻿economy, in exchange for equity stakes.19 With the 2012 budget, the Government has
significantly tightened the policy of guarantees to the critical infrastructure projects. In
addition, the authorities showed interest in further strengthening of their capacity for
contingent liabilities management, and the WB team has a dialog with the authorities on
possible TA arrangement for FY13.
57.      The GoM     has commenced a broader transition to market-based debt
financing and accessed international markets independently on two occasions.
Montenegro issued EUR200 million five-year Euro bond in 2010 and EUR180 million
five-year Euro bond in 2011. The bonds are currently very thinly traded in secondary
markets. Concurrently, the GoM has tapped the domestic market, mostly through selling
T-bills (largely bought by banks), and less through commercial loans (2.2 percent of the
total General Government debt), aiming to prevent a crowding-out effect.
F. IBRD Guarantee and the Debt Instrument
58.      In line with the IBRD's policy on PBGs, the proposed operation would: (a)
provide incremental market access; (b) leverage the Bank's capital better than a DPL; and
(c) improve Montenegro's borrowing terms considerably.
(a) Provide Incremental Market Access
59.      Montenegro aims to gain access to markets during challenging times and
believes that the PBG will facilitate their funding. Specifically, the Government intends
to utilize an IBRD guarantee of EUR60 million to raise a EUR80-100 million loan and
thus cover its financing gap in 2012. An alternative Eurobond issue of a similar amount
would be prohibitively expensive at prevailing market rates (Figure 7)20. In addition, the
markets remain volatile and, despite some improvement in the trend in recent weeks, they
can turn for the worse in the near future.21
19 As of February 2012, the Government has converted a EUR22 million guarantee to Deutschebank on a
loan to the Aluminum company (0.6 percent of GDP) into public debt, which was repaid at once and raised
the principal and interest in the 2012 budget by about 0.7 percent of GDP.
20 A short term bridge loan from commercial banks would generally be even more expensive than a bond
issue.
21 Although in mid-April, 2012, Montenegro was able to borrow EUR150 million from Credit Suisse, this
transaction was privately placed and was not cleanly priced. The deal was partially collateralized by gold
and structured into transferable notes. Without the underlying collateral, which was re-priced and recycled
from a previous financing that the Government had arranged with CS, the latter bank believes that the
margin would have closed at closer to 800 basis points or higher, and well above the 650 basis points
margin that was agreed with Credit Swiss for their facility. This structured loan does not constitute a
benchmark for access to future financing for Montenegro.

60.     The experiences of FYR Macedonia and Serbia with using the IBRD PBGs
are encouraging. Most recently, in a virtually closed market environment, FYR
Macedonia issued debt at competitive rates (Table 8).

61.    The Guarantee approach is most beneficial for countries like Montenegro
that find themselves with very impaired access to market funding, particularly
during periods of high market volatility. Montenegro has opted for a PBG in order to
make optimal use of membership in the IBRD, at a critical juncture. Montenegro is
extremely reluctant to borrow independently at the very high yields demanded by
markets, as doing so would be very costly, and it would set an undesirably high
benchmark for the credit, which may constrain the Government's ability to borrow
efficiently in the near future. Moreover, investors may charge disproportionately more in
terms of yield if the Government is observed attempting to borrow under unsustainable
terms. Montenegro also believes that the PBG approach has far less transaction risk than
an attempt at unsecured borrowing, which could easily fail, should these volatile markets
take a turn for the worse.
(b) Leveraae the Bank's Capital Better than a DPL
62.    The PBG will be used to leverage significant private sector resources, with
only 60 percent of principal risk covered, or roughly 50 percent of the cash flow risk
for investors, in a transaction targeting EURIO million. In this sense, there is a
significant "crowding-in" of the private sector envisaged, even more than observed in the
26


﻿Serbia and Macedonia transactions undertaken last year - where 85 percent and 65
percent respectively of cash flows were covered by the PBG. A transaction targeting
EUR80 million would have leverage similar to levels achieved in Macedonia's
borrowing.
63.   The proposed FSPBG would leverage Bank's capital better than a DPL and
help Montenegro increase the amount borrowed. A single transaction involving both
guaranteed and unguaranteed lending will allow Montenegro to raise the needed amount
of EUR80-100 million. The alternative of two transactions involving a World Bank loan
and a separate unsecured market borrowing poses high risk in current market conditions.
Although Montenegro can obtain competitively priced loan (DPL) from the World Bank
in the amount of US$20 million (approximately EUR15 million), unsecured market
borrowing may not materialize under any acceptable terms in these volatile markets.
Additionally, through a PBG, IBRD capital may be recycled more quickly than would
occur in the case of a DPL with longer maturity. By tying up IBRD capital for only five
years, resources will be made available sooner for other development initiatives in
Montenegro.
64.     The IBRD Guarantee and the structure of the guaranteed debt instrument
will provide the security necessary for lenders to extend credit to Montenegro in the
desired volume and under acceptable terms. The overall transaction will concentrate
the full guarantee coverage on a final balloon payment at maturity, and allow unsecured
borrowed amounts to be amortized in preceding years. For a five year borrowing of
EUR100 million, approximately EUR60 million will be paid at maturity, with full
guarantee provided by the FSPBG, while the remaining EUR40 million in principal will
22
be evenly distributed over preceding years.  At current yields, the structure described
above, involving up to EUR100 million for five years, may imply a borrowing spread of
350-450 basis points, according to preliminary estimates.
(c) Improve Montenearo's Borrowinq Terms Considerably
65.   The IBRD Guarantee approach strikes the best balance between tradeoffs of
tenor, size and participation by the private sector. The targeted volume is set at the
limit of what markets will efficiently bear in current circumstances. The maturity sought
is set directly in response to financial sector's feedback about limits of liquidity available
for Montenegro and is longer than existing Montenegro Eurobonds in the Government's
debt portfolio. This type of leveraged approach is only feasible in the loan markets, as
Emerging Markets bond investors do not sufficiently value partially guaranteed
structures, an even less so for very small, non-benchmark-size, issues. Market sounding
suggests that, in a transaction involving the IBRD guarantee, the credit risk of the
Borrower would be priced more aggressively due to: (i) a more competitive bidding
process, (ii) minimal to zero capital charges applied to the AAA (PBG) component, (iii)
the transaction cost efficiency of a single borrowing, (iv) more favorable maturity limits
on a combined transaction, and (v) a likely "halo effect", where unsecured borrowed
22 Scenarios involving smaller (EUR80 million) or larger (EUR120 million) amounts of total borrowing,
and those with longer maturity (seven years) would be structured in the same fashion.
27


﻿amounts are also credit-enhanced by guaranteed amounts in a single transaction. A
summary of the Guarantee instrument, along with its indicative terms and conditions, is
provided in Annex 5.
66.   The PBG-supported bank loan would cost Montenegro 5-6 percent,
generating a savings of up to 4 percent per annum over the life of the loan.
Conditions in credit markets globally have improved somewhat in recent months and
banks and investors are moving carefully toward a "risk on" strategy in both equity and
debt markets. In Europe, there is reduced risk perception in the Eurozone periphery, at
least relative to a few months ago. At the beginning of the year, yields on Montenegro's
outstanding bonds, which have three and four year remaining maturities, were around
10.5 percent (Figure 7). These have now fallen slightly to just under 9 percent, which
reflects some modest improvement in risk perception. However, these assets are
infrequently exchanged, and caution should be taken in interpreting yields on illiquid
bonds. For a bond issue of the size and tenor of the proposed operation, the estimated
cost to Montenegro would be 9.5-10.0 percent in current markets. Market soundings for
the PBG-supported bank loan suggest that the cost to Montenegro, including the
guarantee fee, would be in the order of 5-6 percent, which could generate a savings of
over 4 percent per annum over the life of the loan.
67.   The Montenegro FSPBG compares favorably with the Macedonia and Serbia
operations and supports Montenegro's refinancing risk management in volatile
markets. This operation compares favorably with the savings achieved in the Serbia and
Macedonia operations, which had a higher percentage of their cash flows guaranteed.
Because Montenegro may be perceived as a weaker credit by the market, the credit
support may have a "larger bang for the buck". Although the market's pricing of
Montenegro has improved in recent weeks, it is not at all clear what the future will hold.
This operation, therefore, supports refinancing risk management by the authorities, by
reducing execution risk and providing access to source of financing that is largely
insulated from market volatility.
III. THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM PROGRAM
A. Overall Reform Program
68.     The goals of Montenegro's reform program     are to strengthen its EU
integration, improve economic performance, and increase the living standards of its
citizens. The Government's program focuses on reforms needed to improve the business
environment, increase human and physical capital, and meet EU accession priorities, in
particular those related to the rule of law and the fight against corruption. The
Government Economic and Fiscal Program for 2012-2015 and the harmonized Pre-
Accession Economic Program 2011-14 outline consolidation efforts to ensure the
medium-term sustainability of public finances supported by structural reforms to address
competitiveness and financial sector stability as core priorities. Reforms in the fiscal area
focus on reducing public spending, curtailing public debt growth, and implementing
further reforms in health, social benefits and public administration areas. In the financial
28


﻿sector, the authorities aim to step up supervisory efforts, and further strengthen the
regulatory framework for banks and harmonize it with international practices and EU
directives. This will make the sector and regulatory bodies better prepared for any future
shocks.
B.     Financial Sector Reforms
69.      Confidence in the banking sector was maintained through an emergency
anti-crisis Law on Measures for Protection of the Banking System and support
extended by parent banks to their Montenegrin subsidiaries.23 The provisions of the
MPBS Law were generally consistent with crisis responses seen in other countries, giving
the Government the authority to: (i) fully guarantee the deposits of all individuals and
legal persons; (ii) facilitate credit guarantees for interbank loans; (iii) provide emergency
liquidity support to a bank for a period of up to one year; (iv) upon a bank's request,
make a prepayment of state borrowings from that bank (including loans carrying a
government guarantee); and (v) provide funds for a bank's recapitalization to protect the
banking system's stability. The Law also allows the CBCG to: (i) approve the use of
required reserves; and (ii) use up to 50 percent of its capital for granting short-term loans
to banks.24 The MPBS served its intended purpose and expired at the end of 2009.
70.      In parallel, under the FSDPL1, the authorities implemented legislative and
institutional reforms to: (a) enhance depositor confidence; (b) strengthen the banking
sector liquidity framework; (c) address vulnerabilities in the banking sector; (d) improve
the regulatory framework; and (e) conduct problem bank restructuring. These reforms
supported Montenegro's EU accession strategy as they aim to bring the supervisory and
regulatory framework for the banking sector closer to EU practices.
71.      The reform program started under FSDPL1 has been continued by the
authorities through policy reforms implemented under the FSPBG. Due to the on-
going Eurozone crisis, the authorities focused on systemic risk monitoring, crisis
preparedness and strengthening banks financial soundness, but also on leveling the play
field in the banking sector to allow for sound and fair competition in the provision of
financial services. The reforms include: (i) strengthening systemic risk monitoring and
the crisis management framework, (ii) addressing banking sector vulnerabilities, (iii)
completing restructuring of Prva Banka, (iv) enhancing the depositor protection scheme,
and (v) further improving the regulatory framework for banks. These reforms support
Montenegro's progress towards aligning its legal and policy frameworks with good
international practice and its strategy for harmonization and convergence towards the EU.
23 Only one domestic bank (Prva Banka) received an emergency loan from the state, which was repaid
within 12 months. A number of banks benefited from state guarantees given by the MoF for credit lines
provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and KfW totaling EUR 122 million to support lending to
small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
24 CBCG was proactive in introducing a number of temporary changes in prudential regulations to respond
to the special challenges presented by the global financial crisis, such as lowering reserve requirements to
ease liquidity pressures on banks and revising loan loss provisioning rules to facilitate loan restructuring.
29


﻿Strengthening Systemic Risk Monitoring and the Crisis Management Framework
72.     A new law on the Central Bank of Montenegro (CB Law) was enacted in
mid-2010 that provides the CBCG with expanded powers to act as the lender of last
resort. Under the new CB Law, emergency liquidity loans can be made to solvent banks
for 90 days against collateral, extendable to a maximum of 180 days when necessary to
preserve the stability of the financial system. The new Law also provides legal protection
to the CBCG and its staff from prosecution for acts taken during the performance of their
duties. The new CB Law has been widely recognized for its role in bringing Montenegro
closer to the EU's sound practices for central bank governance and operations.25
73.     The Financial Stability Council (FSC) established by the Financial Stability
Council Law of 2010 (FSCL) has become operational. So far the FSC has held eight
meetings (the FSCL requires the FSC to meet at least quarterly). Members of the FSC
include the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the CBCG, and the heads of the
Insurance Supervision Agency and Securities and Exchange Commission. The Research
and Statistics Department acts defacto as the secretariat of the FSC.
74.     The FSC has been behind the strengthening of systemic risk monitoring
and the crisis management framework. The FSC has been meeting regularly to
monitor systemic risk, in line with the developed systemic risk assessment methodology,
and considering adequate macroprudential policy response. The FSC put in place a new
crisis management framework by developing crisis contingency plans at the level of the
three financial sector supervisors, MoF and the FSC. In addition, the FSC prepared a lex
spec ialis (draft Financial Stability Law), which the FSC adopted during its March 12,
2012 meeting. If enacted, the lex specialis would grant the authorities, upon declaration
of a financial crisis by the FSC, additional powers to intervene in the financial system by
providing liquidity and capital support. Implementing regulations and procedures will
also need to be prepared by the CBCG, MoF, Insurance Supervision Agency and
Securities and Exchange Commission to operationalize the emergency powers already
provided by the FSL and additional powers to be provided by the proposed lex specialis.
Addressing Banking Sector Vulnerabilities
75.     The CBCG has employed a range of supervisory techniques to identify
vulnerabilities in the banking sector and required bank management and owners to
undertake prompt corrective actions as necessary.    The supervisory framework
combines full scope on-site examinations, targeted on-site examinations, off-site
monitoring, and quarterly stress testing for credit, liquidity, and market risks. The
CAMELS rating system is in place and is updated for all systemically important banks at
least quarterly. With technical assistance provided by the World Bank, the CBCG has
also now introduced an improved credit assessment and risk rating methodology. The
25 The new law generally upholds the operational independence of the Central Bank with one caveat. The
new CB Law included a provision, which terminated the mandates of the CBCG Council, including the
CBCG Governor, and required the appointment of a new Council. As communicated by the WB and the
IMF to the authorities, this move could be perceived as an infringement upon the independence of central
bank.
30


﻿CBCG conducts periodic on-site examinations of banks, with all of the five largest banks
(Montenegro Commercial Bank (OTP), Hypo Alpe Adria Bank (HAAB), and NLB
Montegrobanka (NLB), Pordgoricka (Societe General), and Erste) and a number of
smaller banks subjected to full-scope examinations in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Supervisory
Action Plans (SAPs) were prepared for banks of special concern, approved by CBCG
management, and periodically updated. In the context of SAP implementation, the
CBCG maintains an ongoing dialogue with management and shareholders of the banks to
address specific weaknesses, including requiring capital increases to offset both shortfalls
identified during the inspection process and projected capital needs identified by stress
tests.
76.     The CBCG continues to implement the SAPs approved for 2012 for all
systemic banks, and Prva Banka.     The banks of systemic importance include
Montenegro Commercial Bank (OTP), Hypo Alpe Adria Bank (HAAB), and NLB
Montegrobanka (NLB), Pordgoricka (Societe General), and Erste. Prva Banka is no
longer classified by the CBCG as a systemic bank (due to its reduced size in relation to
the banking system), but remains of special concern due to the potential fiscal and
reputational risks it presents. All of the systemic banks have been the subject of annual
on-site inspections by end-2011, are monitored by off-site supervision department and
their capital adequacy assessed by regular stress tests. The World Bank will continue to
provide technical assistance and participate in the review of the draft on-site supervision
report for Prva Banka. The respective SAPs have been updated and approved with the
CBCG's planned 2012 supervisory activities by end-February 2012.
Completing Restructuring of Prva Banka
77.     As the only bank with severe liquidity and asset quality problems, Prva
Banka represents the most critical challenge faced by the authorities. Suffering from
chronic asset-liability mismatches and rapid withdrawal of deposits, Prva Banka ceased
to function as a normal commercial bank in the fall of 2008, when the CBCG imposed a
freeze on new lending activities and subsequently installed a special representative at the
bank with the right to attend all management and board meetings. The management of
the bank was replaced in late 2008, and Prva received a EUR44 million emergency loan
from the GoM, which was subsequently repaid. Strong restructuring efforts by the new
management have resulted in a dramatic downsizing of the bank. Its assets were cut
almost in half over the past two years, and the bank dropped from second to sixth largest
in Montenegro between 2008 and September 2011. By early 2011, the CBCG assessed
that Prva's condition had stabilized with adequate liquidity, and allowed the bank to
resume limited lending activities, in order to attract new deposits and begin increasing
operating income.
78.     Notwithstanding the recent stabilization of Prva Banka, the authorities
recognize that it remains a significant fiscal risk due to its reliance on state-related
31


﻿26
deposits, and a potential threat to the banking system stability.  The bank continues
to rely heavily on deposits from the Central Government and majority state-owned
enterprises, primarily EPCG (the second largest shareholder of Prva Banka). Reported
NPLs and past due loans have fallen, a new management team and strengthened risk
management procedures have been put in place, and the bank has reoriented its strategy
to focus on SME and retail lending. Total lending had decreased as of end-June 2011,
and deposits and liquid assets overall have declined, posing potential liquidity risk in
27
view of Prva Banka's still unsatisfactory liability structure.  In the 2011 SAP for Prva
Banka, the CBCG required Prva Banka to comply with the 12 percent minimum CAR
and the minimum liquidity ratio. The CBCG conducted an on-site inspection of Prva
Banka in October 2011. The results of the on-site examination reveal that the CAR of
Prva Banka stood at 11.4 percent by end-December, 2011, and the bank was required, by
a CBCG order, to come up with, and implement, a strategy to meet the 12 percent CAR
by end-March 2012. Prva has met the 12 percent CAR requirement through further
balance sheet shrinkage and recapitalization.
79.     In parallel, the MoF has been proceeding with a gradual withdrawal of
central government deposits from Prva Banka based on a schedule agreed under the
FSDPL1. A time-bound schedule was agreed between the MoF and Prva Banka to
withdraw, in monthly tranches of EURI.5 million, all remaining Government deposits
from Prva Banka by end-June 2012. The MoF consulted the withdrawal schedule with
the CBCG to ensure that the withdrawals would not destabilize the bank's liquidity
position. The MoF is current on its withdrawal obligations as of end-January 2012. The
Bank team is notified by the MoF on the completion of the withdrawals monthly, and will
collect evidence on the amount of the completed withdrawals by end-March 2012 for the
FSPBG appraisal. Furthermore, the GoM issued guidelines to all majority state-owned
enterprises, municipalities and other state-sponsored institutions to use clearly defined
eligibility criteria for procurement of financial services from commercial banks.28 The
guidelines should ensure that no bank, including Prva Banka, receives disproportionate
business concerning state-related financial services. According to the MoF, the impact of
the guidelines is being felt more widely in the banking system (one example being a
significant reduction in municipality deposits in Prva Banka).
Enhancing the Depositor Protection Scheme
80.     A new Deposit Protection Law was enacted in mid-2010 to replace the
blanket deposit guarantee, which was a temporary measure in the emergency anti-
crisis Law on Measures for Protection of the Banking System. The law: (i) gradually
26 Although non-systemic by CBCG classification, accounting for less than 10 percent of the system's
deposits, Prva Banka can be seen as systemically important based on e.g. its large branch network and
presence in the regions, and involvement in payment systems.
27 Following its partial privatization in the fall of 2009, EPCG is under a management contract with the
private strategic investor (Italy's A2A utility company), which also has a representative on Prva's Board of
Directors.
28 Specifically, the document instructs to use bank solvency and profitability as criteria for placement of
deposits, in addition to deposit interest rates. These guidelines also set a limit for the maximum share of
deposits that should be kept with a single bank.
32


﻿increases the ceiling for deposit insurance coverage in line with regional norms and EU
directives; (ii) shortens the timeframe allowed for insured deposit payouts; and (iii)
provides a legal instrument to mobilize external funding sources that would enhance the
Deposit Protection Fund's (DPF) financial capacity to make large deposit insurance
payouts. The latter change allowed, later in 2010, approval of a stand-by credit line from
EBRD for the DPF (with a sovereign guarantee), which can be drawn upon in the event
that the DPF's own funds are not sufficient to deal with a large insured deposit payout.
The DPF's financial resources amounted to up to EUR28 million at end-September 2011,
and with the extra emergency buffer of EUR30 million provided by the EBRD stand-by
credit line, DPF has EUR58 million available for guaranteed deposits' payouts.
81.      The Deposit Protection Fund adopted several pieces of implementing
regulation under the Deposit Protection Law to improve its operation. In order to
improve the function of informing depositors about an upcoming increase of the coverage
from EUR20,000 to EUR35,000, the DPF recently adopted a by-law on providing
information to depositors.   Its implementation through regular communication to
depositors should start in Q1 2012. In addition, the DPF adopted a regulation on payouts
of guaranteed deposits to increase the transparency and efficiency of the process. This
regulation, governing the general payout process including selection of the payout agent
bank, was drafted and approved by the DPF Management Board. At the same time, an
internal regulation that governs activities and processes within the DPF during the payout
process, including a clear assignment of responsibilities, has been adopted by the DPF
board.
Enhancing the Regulatory Framework for Banks
82.      The authorities have taken steps to harmonize the regulatory framework
for banks with relevant EU Directives and with prevailing practices in EU member
states. The CBCG now has the full range of instruments and authority for effective
supervision and, in particular, for dealing with problem banks. In mid-2010, amendments
to the Law on Banks were enacted, which enhance the CBCG's enforcement powers,
improve corporate governance in banks, and strengthen the interim administration
process for problem banks.29 Amendments to the Bank Bankruptcy and Liquidation Law
were also enacted to ensure that insolvent banks can be promptly resolved using least cost
solutions. As confirmed in a recent report by the EC30, the new set of laws has brought
Montenegro substantially closer to compliance with EU countries' regulatory frameworks
for bank supervision and resolution.
29 More specifically, the deficiencies that were addressed in the amendments to the Law on Banks included,
inter alia: (i) harmonizing fit and proper requirements with the EC directive; (ii) clarifying the definition of
related parties in line with international good practices; (iii) strengthening the CBCG's enforcement powers
by increasing the types of enforcement actions available to the CBCG; (iv) limiting the powers of the courts
to suspend or revoke CBCG decisions; and (v) establishing legal protection for the CBCG as a supervisory
authority and its personnel.
30 European Commission Opinion on Montenegro's application for membership of the European Union,
November 2010, and the Montenegro 2011 Progress Report acknowledged further improvements to the
legislative framework for banks.
33


﻿83.     The CBCG made further progress in bringing its banking regulations
closer to the EU and international good practice. The newly developed law and
regulations concern: (i) implementation of the Basel II Standardized Approach, (ii)
implementation of IFRS for banks, and (iii) enacting the Law on Financial Collateral.
a. The CBCG has prepared and issued a majority of the regulations required to
implement the Basel II standardized approach: (i) Capital Adequacy Decision,
Official Gazette 38/11, July 1, 2011 on capital adequacy; (ii) Decision
Supplementing the Decision on Temporary Measures for Credit Risk Management in
Banks, Official Gazette 2/12, December 29, 2011 on credit risk management; (iii)
General Guidelines for Granting Approval to Use Ratings Assigned by External
Institutions, CBCG Internal Regulation, November 14, 2011 on the use of credit
rating agency ratings; (iv) Decision on Public Disclosure of Information and Data by
Banks, Official Gazette 2/12, December 29, 2011 on banks transparency and
information disclosure under Pillar 3 of Basel II; and (v) Decision on the manner of
calculating bank exposures (regulation on large exposures), Official Gazette 15/12.
b. The CBCG continues to work towards implementation of IFRS by banks on
January 1, 2013.   The CBCG is preparing a regulation requiring banks to
implement IFRS 39 as of January 1, 2013. The MoF and CBCG have established a
working group to assess the tax implications of the IFRS introduction. In addition,
the CBCG has developed and adopted an IFRS capacity building plan for bank
supervisors.
c. The Law on Financial Collateral. The CBCG drafted the Law on Financial
Collateral based on EC Directive 47 to improve access to and handling of financial
collateral by financial institutions. The affected entities include a broad range of
financial institutions that are subject to prudential supervision. The main objective is
to achieve easier access to collateral, including introduction of collateral agreements
in an electronic form, disposition with the collateral for the purpose of secondary
pledging, and its execution. This shall in turn improve the capacity of the subject
financial institutions in management of liquidity risk. The Law was approved by the
Government on March 29, 2012 and will be subsequently adopted by the Parliament.
IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
A.       Link to the Country Partnership Strategy
84.     The objectives of the FSPBG are consistent with key priorities and
expected outcomes supported under the current Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS). The FY 1-FY14 CPS for Montenegro, endorsed by the Board in January 2011,
envisaged a series of two programmatic financial sector DPLs. The second DPL in that
proposed series has been converted into this self-standing financial sector PBG, which,
inter alia, supports the same goals and reform program foreseen under the financial sector
DPL program. These operations constitute over half the CPS lending envelope and fall
under the first of the two main priority areas, namely, "support EU accession through
34


﻿strengthening institutions and competitiveness." The CPS clearly states that one of its
key outcomes is expected to be "a stronger banking system governed by a modern
regulatory framework and central institutions, which is more resilient to future shocks."
B.       Collaboration with the IMF and other Donors
85.     There is no IMF-supported program in Montenegro, but this operation has
been prepared in consultation with the IMF. The two institutions have been working
together on improving the legal and regulatory environment for the banking sector, in line
with the joint recommendations recorded in the most recent Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) Update Report (FY07). Specifically, the Bank and the IMF have jointly
reviewed and provided technical assistance to the authorities on the legal amendments to
the draft Law on Banks and the Bank Bankruptcy and Liquidation Law; e.g. the IMF has
taken the lead on reviewing the draft Law on the Central Bank, and the Bank has done the
same concerning the Law on Deposit Protection Fund. Both institutions are also
coordinating their policy advice on crisis preparedness and contingency planning.
86.     The Bank is coordinating its policy program under this FSPBG with the
European Commission, Montenegro's most important current and future economic
and political partner. The structural and regulatory reforms supported by this operation
are essential for achieving the goals set by the Stabilization and Association Agreement,
to ensure the gradual convergence of Montenegro's economy with the EU. The ongoing
large twinning project financed by the EU and implemented by the Central Bank of
Bulgaria provides extensive TA to the CBCG to further strengthen its supervision
capacity. In addition, throughout 2011 the CBCG has participated in preparation, dry
runs and the final run of the home-host crisis simulation exercise organized jointly by the
Bank and the ECB in Frankfurt in November 2011.
87.     The Bank has also maintained a robust dialogue with other donors active in
Montenegro, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and leverage support for the
GoM's reforms. In the context of a joint International Financial Institutions initiative,
the EBRD has been very pro-active in providing additional debt and equity support to the
Montenegrin banking sector since the start of the crisis; e.g. the EBRD approved a
EUR30 million stand-by loan to the DPF. Germany's KfW has also provided several
lines of credit to commercial banks and a TA program for the DPF.
C.       Relationship to Other Bank Operations
88.     The FSPBG    continues the reform  program  started under FSDPL1,
approved by the Bank's Board in 2011. Not only does the FSPBG have similar
development objectives, as the FSDPL program, but several of its prior actions,
concerning implementing regulations, derive directly from the primary legislation
developed and enacted under FSDPL1. In addition, the FSPBG builds on two earlier
operations that supported the development of Montenegro's financial and enterprise
sector. The series of Structural Adjustment Credits (SAC 1 approved in 2002 and SAC 2
approved in 2004) supported key structural reforms to enhance fiscal sustainability and
35


﻿promote private-sector led growth. The SACs supported reforms in a number of areas
including the business environment, financial sector and public administration. The
financial sector component sought to resolve non-performing assets carved out of the
banking sector, and complete the privatization of large banks.
D.       Analytical Underpinnings
89.     The design of this operation is based on considerable analytical and TA
work.   The FSAP Update (FY07) assessed overall financial system stability and
vulnerabilities. Some of the main policy issues identified in the FSAP Update have been
addressed in this operation (FSDPL1 and FSPBG), including improvements in the
regulatory environment for the banking system, strengthening the liquidity management
framework, and improving the crisis management framework. An FY09 Early Warning
Toolkit grant funded by FIRST helped develop and test new methodologies for on-site
bank examinations and stress-testing models for credit risk. The Bank subsequently
advised the CBCG on conducting in-depth on-site examinations and stress-testing of
systemic banks, which served as an analytical foundation for developing bank-specific
supervisory action plans (including for Prva Banka).
90.     The Bank was also closely involved in assisting the Montenegrin authorities
in designing the least-cost restructuring strategies for problem banks. Other related
recent analytical work includes an FY07 Report on Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) analyzing Montenegro's financial and auditing standards, and an FY10 grant
from FIRST to support the development and adoption of a Country Strategy and Action
Plan to enhance the quality of corporate sector financial reporting to comply with EU
standards.
91.     Most recently the operation's design was supported by, and derives from,
Bank, ECB and IMF TA on crisis preparedness and Bank TA on capacity building
for auditors. The CBCG's participation in the home-host crisis simulation exercise
organized by the Bank and the ECB underscored the needed focus on systemic risk
assessment and crisis preparedness in the view of the possible spillovers of adverse
shocks from the EU and the region. The operation was also informed by the IMF TA on
contingency planning emphasizing the need for extraordinary powers for the Financial
Stability Council to resolve possible future crisis situations under a transparent legal
framework. The Bank through its Vienna-based Centre for Financial Reporting has been
providing TA to build capacity of the auditors especially in the view of the future
introduction of IFRS for banks and corporates.
92.     The authorities requested that the World Bank prepare a structured TA
activity on NPL workouts, as high NPL levels remain a major challenge for
Montenegro's financial sector and the economy. The proposed activity will assist the
authorities in developing a Montenegro-specific debt restructuring strategy to reduce the
level of NPLs within the financial sector and aid in the resumption of the flow of credit to
the real sector. The design of a comprehensive debt restructuring strategy will have two
phases: (i) a comprehensive diagnostic to better understand the key issues, and (ii)
technical assistance to implement the recommendations contained in the diagnostic.
36


﻿Developing and implementing a strategy to reduce NPLs requires close coordination and
cooperation among several institutions, and the engagement strategy will be to foster this
required level of collaboration.
E.        Lessons Learned
93.     The proposed operation has incorporated lessons from      the Bank's
experience in 2008-2009 crisis, as well as in previous economic and financial crises.
A recent comprehensive review of the Bank's responses to financial crises31 underscored
the following lessons:
*    Early response. The Bank fielded a mission within a few weeks from receiving
the request for budget support. Addressing early on the systemic vulnerabilities in the
banking sector helped contain the crisis and minimize fiscal costs.
*    Need for focus. During crises, operations should focus on selected key areas
for good outcomes. The proposed operation thus focused on key areas of addressing
vulnerabilities in the banking sector and its resilience to possible future shocks.
*    Government ownership. The FSDPL1 and this FSPBG were prepared in direct
collaboration with the top leadership of the MoF and the CBCG, the Government's
key agencies.
*    Communication strategy. The staff of the Country Management Unit and the
World Bank Field Office in Podgorica played a critical role in this regard. The Bank
also kept civil society and the general public informed of its position on critical issues
through interviews to national media and press releases.
*    Coordination among development partners. Coordination is critical for better
results. This operation incorporates this lesson by consulting and working closely
with the IMF, EC, and EBRD.
V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
A.        Objective and Rationale
94.     The objective of the proposed operation is to support the authorities'
reform program for strengthening the banking sector and maintaining financial
stability, which is a critical pre-condition for sustained economic recovery and
balanced private sector-led growth. The operation supports strengthening of the
systemic risk monitoring and crisis preparedness frameworks, the banking sector
soundness and transparency, and depositors and market confidence, thus increasing
Montenegro's financial sector resilience to possible future adverse shocks. More
specifically, this operation's support derives from reforms in the following areas: (i)
systemic risk monitoring and crisis preparedness; (ii) resolution of problem banks; (iii)
restructuring of Prva Banka; (iv) depositor protection; and (v) the regulatory framework
for banks.

37


﻿95.     The negative impact of the global financial crisis and the possible spillover
of the consequent Eurozone crisis on Montenegro's economy provide a strong
rationale for this operation. The FSPBG is designed to provide a coherent policy
response to address systemic risks in the banking sector and improve its soundness. It
also lays the foundation for healthy future growth by advancing the regulatory reform
agenda in the financial sector including increased transparency and competitiveness. The
prior actions proposed under this operation are listed in Box 2. The overall structure of
the proposed Program is shown in the attached Policy Matrix (Annex 1).
96.     The FSPBG program continues the reform agenda started under FSDPL1,
with greater emphasis on systemic risk monitoring and crisis preparedness. The
FSPBG program reprioritized the FSDPL1 policy areas in the view of possible spillovers
from the Eurozone crisis to put more emphasis on building the crisis management
capacity in Montenegro at the level of the FSC. Some triggers were dropped and others
added to reflect the most recent reform priorities and efforts of the Government. The
continuation of the reform program from FSPDL1 to FSPBG is illustrated in Annex 2.
97.     The design of the Government's reform program and this operation has
benefited from consultations with relevant stakeholders (as required by OP 8.60).
The authorities have pro-actively communicated with the public on the objectives of the
program. The MoF and the CBCG representatives made frequent appearances on TV and
in printed media, regularly issued press releases (published on MoF and CBCG websites
in both Montenegrin and English), and organized roundtables to explain the measures
taken by the authorities to boost market confidence and restore healthy financial
intermediation. The changes in legislation and regulation were extensively discussed
with industry stakeholders. The Bank team has also consulted widely with stakeholders,
including banking sector representatives, academic experts, and representatives of the key
development, and political and economic partners including the European Commission.
38


﻿Box 2: Prior Actions for PBG
The following constitute prior actions for presentation of the Loan to the Bank's Board of
Directors:
FSC has:
(i) carried out periodic systemic risk monitoring and taken appropriate macroprudential
decisions as evidenced by written minutes of meetings and the assessment methodology used;
(ii) adopted the national contingency plan including a draft lex specialis [the draft Financial
Stability Law] granting extraordinary powers to CBCG and the Government to provide
emergency liquidity and capital, if necessary, on declaration by the FSC of a financial crisis.
The CBCG has:
(i) updated and approved supervisory action plans (SAPs) for 2012 for banks of special concern,
based on completed on-site examinations, off-site monitoring and stress-test results as of
December 2011, and made satisfactory progress in such SAPs implementation.
The Borrower and the CBCG have presented evidence showing that:
(i) Prva Banka has made satisfactory progress in the implementation of all actions required by
the 2012 SAP, maintains a CAR above 12 percent pursuant to the order issued by CBCG, and
complies with all other regulatory requirements; and
(ii) the Borrower has withdrawn central government deposits from Prva Banka in accordance
with the agreed withdrawal schedule between the MoF and Prva Banka to ensure Prva Banka 's
future financing on market terms.
The Borrower has enacted:
(i) Regulation on Informing Depositors and Potential Depositors about Deposit Protection
Scheme (Official Gazette 16/12, March 19th 2012), to bring public communication protocols vis-
a-vis insured depositors in line with EU Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes 94/19/EC and
2009/19/EC.;
(ii) Decision on Detailed Conditions, Manner and Procedure of the Guaranteed Deposit Payout
(Official Gazette 16/12, March 19th 2012), to improve the efficiency and transparency of
guaranteed deposit payouts.
The CBCG has, in order to implement the Standardized Basel II Approach, adopted the
following regulations:
(i) Capital Adequacy Decision, Official Gazette 38/11, July 1, 2011 on capital adequacy;
(ii) Decision on the manner of calculating banks' exposures, Official Gazette 15/12, March 5,
2012on large exposures; and,
(iii) Decision on Public Disclosure of Information and Data by Banks, Official Gazette 2/12,
December 29, 2011 on banks transparency and information disclosure under Pillar 3 of Basel II.
The CBCG has adopted the decision on Minimum Standards for Credit Risk Management in
Banks, Official Gazette 22/12, April 12, 2012, implementing IFRS 39 for the banking system as
of January 1, 2013.
The Government has, by its decision dated March 29, 2012, approved the Law on Financial
Collateral, and thus improved the legislative framework for financial collateral and facilitated
enhanced liquidity management at financial institutions.
39


﻿B.         Operation Description and Policy Areas
98.      A sound macroeconomic framework needs to be in place for this budget
support operation. As described in more detail in Section III.B, the macroeconomic
policy mix has, on the whole, been adequate and appropriate for addressing the spillovers
from the global economic and financial crisis (also see Annex 4 for the Fund Assessment
Letter - to be added after the IMF Board Discussion of the 2012 Article IV Report).
Strengthening Systemic Risk Monitoring and the Crisis Management Framework
99.      Under this operation, the FSC has developed a methodology to assess
systemic risk, regularly monitored systemic risk and taken needed macroprudential
actions. Namely, the Financial Stability Council, including the CBCG, the MoF and
other financial sector supervisors, has developed a methodology for systemic risk
assessment described in the methodology paper submitted to the Bank. The FSC has
monitored systemic risk on a regular basis in line with the methodology, and taken
macroprudential policy actions to foster financial stability as confirmed through the
minutes of its meetings.
Status: Completed.
100.     Further, a national contingency plan including the lex specialis (Financial
Stability Law) was prepared and adopted by the FSC to strengthen the FSC's
powers to manage any future crisis situations effectively and transparently. Namely,
the FSC has developed a lex specialis (Financial Stability Law). Upon declaration of a
financial crisis by the FSC, this draft Law32 would be immediately submitted to the
Parliament for enactment. The Law would then grant extraordinary powers to the CBCG
and the Government to provide emergency liquidity and recapitalize systemic banks, if
needed, thus improving Montenegro's capacity to rapidly resolve any future banking
crisis situations.
Status: Completed.
Addressing Banking Sector Vulnerabilities
101.     Under this operation, the CBCG        has conducted on-site and off-site
examinations of problem banks, and implemented the updated Supervisory Action
Plans (SAPs) to restore banking sector soundness. Based on the methodology agreed
with the WB, the CBCG has completed onsite examinations, off-site monitoring reports
32 This approach is based on the successful model of the emergency anti-crisis Law on Measures for
Protection of the Banking System enacted by the Parliament in October 2008, which followed similar
procedure. The Bank team concurs with the authorities that passing the draft Law for approval to the
Parliament in current market conditions, when depositors' and market confidence is very fragile, is
undesirable. This is because the public can misinterpret this step, and a run on banks can occur. However
in the medium term, once the global financial crisis has abated, the Bank team is to stay engaged with the
authorities to consider a more permanent solution in the form of an adopted Financial Stability Law.
Effectiveness of this adopted Law would then be triggered by FSC's declaration of a financial crisis. This
is to further address moral hazard problems and introduce greater transparency to resolution of systemically
important financial institutions and any future crisis situations.
40


﻿and stress-testing of systemic banks (CKB, NLB Montenegro Banka, Hypo Alpe Adria
Banka, Erste Bank and Podgoricka Banka) as of December 2011 to determine the current
and projected level of capital adequacy. Further, the CBCG has approved and enforced
implementation of the 2012 SAPs for systemic banks. The SAPs recorded identified
weaknesses and risks, and included specific targets and deadlines for addressing any non-
compliance with regulations, with the focus on current and projected capital needs. All
systemically important banks have SAPs in effect and are currently in compliance with
key requirements of those plans updated as of end-February 2012.
Status: Completed.
Completing Restructuring of Prva Banka
102.    Under this operation, the CBCG     has enforced that Prva Banka
implemented actions required by its SAP and the CBCG Order to ensure its
financial soundness. Following the completion of a full-scope on-site examination in
November 2011, using terms of reference developed jointly with the World Bank, the
CBCG updated the time-bounded SAP for Prva Banka. The bank is required by a CBCG
order to reach and maintain the minimum solvency ratio of 12 percent as of end-March
2012 throughout 2012. The CBCG has been enforcing that Prva Banka implements all
corrective actions required by the SAP based on its latest on-site examination and off-site
supervision reports, maintains its CAR above 12 percent and complies with all other
regulatory requirements, most notably those on liquidity.
Status: Completed.
103.    In parallel, the MoF made progress with the gradual withdrawal of central
government deposits from Prva Banka (to be completed by end-June 2012) to
ensure Prva Banka's market-based financing. The MoF adopted a schedule for
complete withdrawal of central government deposits of EUR28 million (end-2010 figure)
from Prva Banka by June 2012, in equal-sized monthly tranches. In order not to
endanger the bank's liquidity position, the schedule for further withdrawals of central
government deposits has been calibrated in consultation with the CBCG. Under this
schedule the MoF has completed the withdrawal of 65 percent of the initial deposits
(about EUR18.2 million) from Prva Banka by end-December 2011, 90 percent by May
29, 2012, and is expected to withdraw 100 percent by June 2012.
Status: Completed.
Enhancing Depositor Protection Scheme
104.    Under this operation, the Deposit Protection Fund (DPF) has issued
implementing regulation to improve transparency and awareness of the Deposit
Protection Scheme, and the guaranteed deposits payout procedures. Namely, the
enacted Law on the Protection of Deposits has been implemented by the DPF as
evidenced by adoption of the regulation on informing depositors on DI scheme in line
with the relevant EU directive. Further, the DPF has adopted and tested the regulation on
guaranteed deposit payout procedure to increase transparency and efficiency of deposit
payouts including shortening the timeframe for the payout to converge to the EU best
41


﻿practice.
Status: Completed.
Further Improving the Regulatory Framework for Banks
105.    Under this operation, the CBCG has issued several regulations to bring
banks' credit risk management, capitalization, and regulatory reporting closer to
EU and international best practice. Namely, the CBCG has implemented the
Standardized Basel II Approach and adopted supporting regulations on (a) capital
adequacy; (b) large exposures; and, (c) bank information disclosure. These regulations
are expected to significantly improve banks' capitalization against unexpected losses, and
increase the quality of regulatory reporting while decreasing its burden on banks.
Status: Completed.
106.     Further, the CBCG has adopted a decision to implement International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 39 for banks to increase transparency of the
financial conditions of banks and improve their market discipline. Namely, the
CBCG has adopted decisions on implementing IFRS 39 governing the accounting of
impaired losses and creating corresponding provisions as of January 1, 2013. The
transition to IFRS should make Montenegro's banks more transparent to the markets and
potential investors, subject the banks to greater market discipline, and enable greater
comparability of the Montenegro's banking system financial condition to other,
especially EU, countries.
Status: Completed.
107.    Moreover, the Law on Financial Collateral has been adopted to facilitate
better access to financial collateral and thus improve liquidity management at
subject financial institutions, most notably banks. The CBCG has developed the Law
on Financial Collateral based on EC Directive 47 to improve access to and handling of
financial collateral by financial institutions, and the Law has been adopted by the
Government.33 The affected entities include a broad range of financial institutions that
are subject to prudential supervision. The main objective is to achieve easier access to
collateral, including introduction of collateral agreements in an electronic form,
disposition with the collateral for the purpose of secondary pledging, and its execution.
This shall in turn improve the capacity of the subject financial institutions to manage their
liquidity and thus potentially diminish liquidity risk in the financial sector.
Status: Completed.
" The transposition of EC Directive 47 is part of the process of harmonizing Montenegro's legal
framework with that of the EU, as Montenegro obtained its EU candidate status in 2011 and is preparing
for EU accession negotiations. The transposition of the EC Directive 47 typically occurs at a later stage of
the harmonization process. However the authorities prioritized the transposition of this Directive in order
to aid the financial institutions, most notably banks, in their liquidity management efforts. The fact that the
Financial Collateral Law is a transposition of an EC Directive ensures that the principles of the Directive
will be maintained as the Directives set the floor (the minimum requirements) in the harmonization process.
42


﻿C.        Expected Results of the Operation
108.    The progress on the FSDPL1 expected results to date is uneven, but overall
positive against the Eurozone crisis, as the banking sector and the economy have not
seen a strong recovery take place in recent months. Depositor confidence has
increased and the annual deposit growth reached 2 percent by November 2011 (target
rate: positive growth). However, annual credit growth still remains in the negative
territory reaching -13 percent by November 2011, far from the targeted positive growth.
All banks meet the prudential liquidity ratio prescribed by the CBCG with most banks
showing significant additional buffers. The NPL ratio, though dropping from the
baseline of 23 percent in March 2011 to 15.5 percent by December 2011, remains well
above the targeted 8 percent due to slow NPL workouts and still negative credit growth.
The banking system capitalization has improved notably since the baseline of 11.7
percent as of June 2009, standing at 16.5 percent by December 2011. It is the Bank
team's assessment that the CBCG supervision has stepped up its efforts in enforcing
prudential norms required from banks with more decisive and timely supervisory actions.
109.    The main targeted outcome of the FSPBG is to support broad-based
economic recovery through provision of financial services by a sound and
transparent banking system operating under regulation and supervision aligned
with best EU practice. Specifically, the measures supported under this FSPBG should
contribute to: (i) enhanced macroprudential oversight and the legal authority of the
CBCG and MoF to rapidly and transparently resolve any future crisis situations, (ii)
enhanced stability and soundness of the banking system; (iii) Prva Banka operating under
sound and safe financial condition and a market-based financing structure; (iv) restored
confidence in the banking sector with total bank deposits steadily approaching their pre-
crisis levels; and (v) effective supervision of the banking system consistent with Basel
Core Principles and based on best practice international accounting standards and
regulatory reporting. Measurable expected results indicators for each area are presented
in the Policy Matrix (Annex 1).
43


﻿VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
A.         Poverty and Social Impacts
110.     The reforms proposed under this operation are expected to have overall
positive poverty and social impacts. Although growth has resumed and economic
conditions have improved in 2011, this has not yet translated into significant employment
growth or poverty reduction (see Box 3 for more details). This operation is intended to
support a more solid financial foundation for sustainable recovery by (i) increasing
stability and confidence in the banking sector, (ii) encouraging increased lending activity,
and (iii) enhancing CBCG's ability to step up with emergency liquidity assistance. The
restoration of credit growth should support new investments and economic activity, with
positive impacts on job creation and employment rates (especially in the context of
reforms in 2008-09 to improve labor market flexibility), which will in turn increase
incomes, including incomes of the poor and near-poor. It is difficult to quantify these
expected impacts because of the complex and uncertain links from investor confidence to
employment creation to income distribution, especially against a counterfactual of
continued instability in Montenegro's financial sector.
Box 3: Recent poverty trends and social protection
Montenegro's economic growth helped reduce poverty significantly through 2008, but this trend
was interrupted by the crisis. MONSTAT and the World Bank estimate that the share of the population
living below the absolute poverty line decreased from 11.2 percent in 2005 to 4.9 percent in 2008, and
then rose to 6.8 percent in 2009 and decreased marginally to 6.6 percent in 2010 (Table 9). The poverty
gap showed a similar decline from 2005 to 2008, followed by an increase in 2009, and a slight decline in
2010. Rural areas and northern Montenegro remain poorer than the national average, but rural/urban and
regional differences in poverty rates narrowed substantially in 2010. Notably, those living slightly above
the poverty line fared poorly in 2010. If the poverty line were 25 percent higher, the poverty headcount
rate would have increased by three percentage points in 2010, from 14.2 to 17.4 percent.

Note: Currency amounts are expressed in current Euros.
The existing social protection programs mitigate some of the negative impacts of the crisis on
poverty. Unemployment insurance was the first line of government social response in 2009, with
unemployment benefit coverage increasing in line with job losses among eligible workers. For the
poorest households, the means-tested last resort social assistance program (FMS/MOP) also expanded its
coverage in response to the crisis. The FMS/MOP is well-targeted, with 84 percent of program benefits
going to the poorest quintile, and benefit levels are relatively generous, among the highest in ECA. The
main limitation of FMS/MOP with respect to crisis mitigation is its low coverage rate: in 2009 only 16
percent of the poorest quintile and 23 percent of all poor received FMS/MOP benefits.
44


﻿Ill.    Potential poverty and social impacts associated with risks to the operation. As
noted in paragraph 37, there are substantial policy and external risks to the
implementation of the Government's program. Quantifying the expected poverty or
social impacts of these endogenous and exogenous factors that would impede program
implementation is even more tenuous than quantifying the impacts of the program. With
regard to the risk of a worsening fiscal situation, the Government has identified
increasing the standard VAT rate (currently 17 percent) as a means of stabilizing
revenues. The special VAT rate of 7 percent for basic consumption items such as food,
medicines, textbooks, and public transportation, would remain unchanged, offering a
significant measure of protection to low income households and those on fixed incomes
such as pensioners.
B. Environmental Aspects
112.    Specific actions under the proposed FSPBG are not expected to have any
negative effect on the environment. The specific country policies supported by the
FSPBG are not likely to cause effects on the country's environment and natural
resources. The legal and regulatory changes implemented in the context of the FSPBG
do not allow the banking sector to circumvent environmental regulations governing
investments, nor modify the existing environmental regulatory framework in any way.
C. Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation
113.    The MoF will be responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed
operation. The MoF is the main policy counterpart for the Bank team. The CBCG and,
to a lesser extent, the DPF play an important role in the implementation of the banking
sector reforms.
114.    The implementation of the policy actions set forth in the policy matrix
(Annex 1) has required technical discussions amongst the Bank and the
implementing institutions. The Bank and the Montenegrin authorities have collaborated
closely in the preparation of this operation. The Bank has provided policy advice and
technical assistance to the authorities on all proposed policies, including the design of
macroeconomic framework, drafting of new financial sector legislation and regulation,
the methodology for enhanced bank supervision, and problem bank restructuring.
115.    Specific expected  results indicators will be used to monitor the
implementation of the operation. The Bank, in collaboration with the Montenegrin
authorities, will monitor, inter alia, the following: (i) evolution of bank NPLs and
provisioning levels; (ii) bank capital adequacy levels; (iii) bank regulatory liquidity
ratios; (iv) progress with the restructuring of Prva Banka and systemic problem banks, (v)
evolution of deposits and of non-deposit funding sources; and (vi) evolution of credit
growth. These indicators will be employed to evaluate the impact of the policy changes
supported by the proposed operation.
45


﻿D. Fiduciary Aspects
116.    The guarantee would involve no immediate transfer of funds from the
Bank, but sufficient funds would need to be provisioned from the Bank assets to
meet a call on the guarantee if required. When called under conditions provided for
under the Agreement, the payment from the Bank will be made as a single payment to the
lenders or agent of the lenders. The indemnity agreement between Montenegro and the
World Bank provides that the former will repay the latter on demand or as the Bank
otherwise directs, if the guarantee is called.
117.    Overall fiduciary risk for the Public Financial Management (PFM) system
in Montenegro is considered to be substantial. Such rating is based on the findings
and conclusions of various diagnostic of the Montenegrin public financial management
system. Although the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment
(PEFA) 2009 noted efforts in various areas such as budgeting, reporting, internal control,
and internal auditing, further improvements are assessed to be needed.
118.    Procurement:34 Montenegro PEFA      dated July 2009 stated that "Positive
improvements in procurement have been reported, in particular with regard to the legal
framework and the organizational structure of the system; however, there are concerns
about the institutional capacity of the contracting authorities, the robustness of the data
provided by the contracting authorities and the private sector's full confidence in the
remedy process." The Performance Indicators Summary (19. Competition, value for
money and controls in procurement) states "Procurement is generally good - more than
89 percent of contracts above the low-value threshold are awarded on the basis of open
competition". In 2011 a New Public Procurement Law was adopted and has become
effective in January of 2012. Its implementation must be observed to objectively
measure its impact on Montenegro's public procurement.
119.    Accounting data is assessed to be accurate, however the quality of financial
statements should be improved in terms of the standards applied and level of details
presented. Timeliness of submission of financial statements is good with statements
being consistently produced by end-July. The information on national budget is publicly
available, with basic data on revenues and executions published on a monthly basis on
the MoF website. However, financial reporting could be considerably improved by
producing budget revenue and execution reports in sufficient detail so as to enable a
detailed comparison of budget outturn with the original budget, and producing annual
financial statements in accordance with consistently applied and recognized public sector
accounting standards.
34 Public procurement environment in Montenegro was rated a high risk country by the Country
Procurement Assessment Review of June 2002. Afterwards, the Public Procurement Law was adopted and
published in the Official Gazette of Montenegro in July 2006, which strived to implement relevant EC
Directives. A wide range of efforts to improve Governance by GoM was undertaken: Adoption of Stability
Pact Anti-Competition Initiative Compact and Action Plan; strengthening legal framework through the
adoption of the Public Procurement Act (2001), adoption of criminal code (2004), of Law on Money
Laundering (2004), of Law on Conflict of Interest (2005), which requires high-ranking state officials to
report their assets before taking office.
46


﻿120.    Capacity of the Internal Audit needs further strengthening. Due to the
small number of internal auditors, it is understood that the internal audit manual and
Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) standards are not applied in their entirety in every
audit including the application of systems-based audits. Whilst the MoF's Internal Audit
Unit performs audits of expenditures in the ordinary course of its work, it has not audited
revenues since 2004. All internal audit units, as a matter of course always issue a report
after every internal audit assignment, finalize such reports only after discussion and
agreement with the audited entity and distribute the finalized report to the management of
the audited entity.  All the internal audit units were of the view  that most
recommendations and findings are acted upon by the management of the audited entity.
Nevertheless, since the number of repeated audits is rather low, this was confirmed in
practice only in sporadic cases.
121.    External scrutiny and audit have improved, but require further
strengthening. With the available limited resources in terms of financing and number of
qualified staff, the State Audit Institution (SAI) performs as well as could reasonably be
expected but it does require further strengthening. Due to time and resource constraints,
audit plans are prepared in order to have all public entities audited at least once in three
years. According to the SAI, in any one year it audits entities that account for around 70
percent of consolidated public expenditures. Procedurally, external scrutiny is good in
that the Parliamentary Committee on Economy, Finance and Budget receives and is
substantially afforded the opportunity to scrutinize the annual budget law as well as
external audit reports. However, the committee appears very under-staffed and thus
unable to perform its role in as detailed a manner as it would like or could reasonably be
expected of it.
122.    The current capacity constraints in the public financial management will
not have direct implications on the development policy lending due to the nature of
the development policy lending. There are a number of reform strategies adopted in
Montenegro and currently under implementation. Some of the more recent are: Strategy
of Public Internal Financial Control (2007), Public Internal Financial Control Law
(2008), and Strategy of Management of Public Debt (2008). Other planned PFM reforms
relate to planning of the budget, improvement of functional analysis and structure of the
budget, as well as of the capital budgeting.
E. Disbursement Arrangements
123.    Disbursement: Upon notification by the Bank of the effectiveness of the
Guaranteed Loan Agreement among the lenders, the Bank and Montenegro and the
effectiveness of the Indemnity Agreement between the Bank and Montenegro, the
Borrower may request withdrawal of the loan proceeds from the Private Lenders within a
defined drawdown period. The front-end fees and the annualized guarantee fee are
expected to be paid out of the proceeds of the IBRD Guaranteed Loan.
124.    Guarantee Fees: Consistent with the current Bank policy, there is a front-end
fee of 25 basis points on the face value of the guarantee exposure and a guarantee fee of
47


﻿50 basis points per annum (equivalent to the contractual spread for loans) on the present
value of Bank's exposure from the transaction. The guarantee fee will also be collected
upfront, on a present value basis, to strengthen the transaction terms for all parties.
125.    Callability of the Guarantee: As the borrower, Montenegro has the obligation
to ensure timely repayment to the lenders. Details of the callability of the Guarantee will
be defined at a later stage once the instrument is more precisely defined. Following
payment by the Bank under its guarantee, the Bank would have sole discretion to decide
whether to demand immediate repayment from Montenegro or to extend terms for
repayment over time, and in the latter case, would have sole discretion as to the terms to
be extended.
F. Risks and Risk Mitigation
126.    The proposed FSPBG is a high-risk operation. The key risks are as follows:
*     Economic risk
*     Financial risk
*     Governance risk
*     Implementation risk.
Economic risk
127.    Both external and public debt levels remain elevated. Strong growth coupled
with fiscal consolidation efforts moderated the imbalances. However, another period of
intensified global turmoil may quickly reverse these trends. A global slowdown driven
by concerns over fiscal imbalances and the financial sector weaknesses in developed
economies, especially in the Eurozone, could undermine the growth prospects of
Montenegro. Slower than expected growth in the EU, Montenegro's key trading partner,
could dampen Montenegro's economic recovery, in turn placing further strain on the
Government's fiscal stance, negatively affecting corporate sector performance and,
consequently, hurting the financial sector. Furthermore, the country's euroization, high
level of external debt and large debt service requirements over the medium term render
the Montenegrin financial sector vulnerable to a slowdown in capital inflows and call for
more prudent fiscal policy. Montenegro, being a net oil and food importer, may see a
deterioration of its already high external imbalances with limited policy options for
import-substitution. Finally, given the small size of the country, even a small shock could
have a sizeable impact on the economy.
128.    The Government's substantial fiscal consolidation, build up of fiscal
reserves and deepening of structural reforms, together with the financing already
mobilized for its 2012 program, provide an important mitigation framework. Yet
given the scale of uncertainty in the external environment, the operation will remain high
risk under any scenario. Given the quarterly profile of the government's financing needs,
which are concentrated in the first half of 2012, the timing of the proposed FSPBG in the
first half of 2012 will also help mitigate the external risks and financing pressures.
48


﻿Financial risk
129.    Existing risk exposures in the banking sector in combination with adverse
external shocks could result in financial instability. A strong 2011 tourist season,
foreign investment inflow, and the return of positive economic growth, together with
bank recapitalization, should help adjust credit risk exposures and tight liquidity in the
banking sector and thus reduce its vulnerabilities. However, the banking sector still
remains fragile despite a significant clean-up of banks balance sheets. Deposits have still
not recovered to pre-crisis levels and are being significantly reallocated across banks.
Nonperforming loans in the system have dropped due to the sale of large portions of bad
loans by major banks to sister bad asset management companies and off-shore investment
funds. Nevertheless, the amount of non-performing loans in the economy has not
changed much and the NPL stock resolution remains a challenge. Several systemically
important banks remain fragile. Of special concern is Prva Banka, which remains
vulnerable and lacks the support from a strong parent bank or strategic investor (enjoyed
by the systemic banks).
130.    This risk is directly mitigated by the policy reforms supported by the
operation. The PBG includes actions that aim to strengthen systemic risk monitoring
and the crisis management framework; continue efforts to bring problem banks to sound
financial conditions under appropriate supervisory arrangements; complete restructuring
of Prva Banka towards sound financial conditions and market-based financing; further
strengthen functioning of the deposit insurance scheme; and align the regulatory
framework in the banking sector with EU best practice, including through more
appropriate bank capitalization against unexpected losses and enhanced regulatory
reporting framework. In addition, the structured TA on NPL workouts recently requested
by the authorities from the World Bank is expected to help address the issue of high
NPLs and contribute to their coordinated workouts and debt restructuring. These
reforms, if properly implemented, should enable the authorities to stabilize the banking
system in the short-term and strengthen its functioning going forward.
Governance risk
131.    A  lack of progress on governance improvements could undermine
Montenegro's path toward EU accession and thus threaten its efforts to achieve long
term macroeconomic and financial sector stability. The EU and domestic observers
have raised concerns in the past about the lack of transparency, and possible influence
exercised by organized crime. With encouragement from the EU and other international
observers (including the Bank), the Montenegrin authorities are making a concerted effort
to correct this perception (see Box 4 for more detail). Specifically, the legislative
changes and the more robust supervision effort supported under this operation are
expected to strengthen the regulator's standing and improve governance standards in the
financial sector. For instance, as a result of more stringent application of fit and proper
criteria, the top management of three systemically important banks has been replaced
following the start of the crisis.
49


﻿Box 4. Montenegro's Recent Progress in Governance Reform
In recent years Montenegro has made substantial gains in key international indicators
measuring governance and political and economic performance, and is a strong performer
relative to its SEE neighbors. Montenegro has advanced significantly between 2006 and 2009
on all six of the composite Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs) published by the World
Bank Institute (WBI). Notable gains were achieved on political stability, regulatory quality,
rule of law, and government effectiveness.  Montenegro's ranking in Transparency
International's Corruption Perception Index rose from 85th in 2008 to 69th in 2010, and
Freedom House upgraded its rating of Montenegro to Free in 2010 from Partially Free in
2007. Montenegro's formal regulatory framework and implementation practices are fully in
line with the expectation for a country at its income level.
The prior actions for EU membership negotiations define the current rule-of-law reform a
priority. The EU stated that membership negotiations could commence once the country had
achieved the necessary degree of compliance with, in particular, the Copenhagen political
criteria "requiring the stability of institutions guaranteeing notably the rule of law", pointing
inter alia to public-administration and judiciary-sector reforms aimed at enhancing
professionalization, and fostering de-politicization. The authorities have taken on this
challenge. Immediately following the EU's awarding of candidate status, the Government
underwent a process of rejuvenation (including the transfer of premiership to the pragmatic
and reform-minded former Finance Minister), with a view to strengthening public institutions
in those critical areas impacting the country's EU integration perspective. A critical subset of
rule-of-law challenges is congruent with structural reforms required to strengthen
Montenegro's relative attractiveness as a destination for direct investment-areas in which the
Bank has already provided considerable support, and proposes to continue to do so under the
current CPS. The Bank's Analytical and Advisory Assistance/Economic Sector Work
provides overarching policy advice on challenges related to public administration, fiscal
policy priorities, public financial management and procurement, statistics, and financial
reporting.
Implementation risk
132.    Implementation of the program is dependent on consistent collaboration
amongst authorities, especially between the MoF and the CBCG. With the new
legislative framework now in place, the CBCG will need to use its improved mandate to
enforce prudential norms, encourage higher capital and liquidity buffers, and take
appropriate supervisory measures for banks of special concern.
133.    To mitigate the implementation risk, the Bank has promoted an inclusive,
consultative approach in designing the program. Through a series of technical
consultations involving both the CBCG and MoF, the team has sought to foster a mutual
understanding and agreement on the content of the reforms, especially on the legal
reforms that are necessary to harmonize Montenegrin legislation with EU financial sector
legislation. The formed Financial Stability Council should provide a permanent forum
for consultation and information sharing between the CBCG, MoF and other financial
sector stakeholders. Judging by the recent progress with the reform program, it appears
that regulators' actions are fully coordinated with, and supported by the Government,
without jeopardizing their operational independence.
50


﻿134.    There is also a risk that the implementation of politically sensitive and
technically complex reforms in the financial sector may stall or even backtrack
following the approval of this FSPBG. To mitigate this risk, the prior actions for the
proposed operation entail tangible steps that would be hard to reverse. Most importantly,
this involves enactment of regulations rather than their draft preparation, implementation
of supervision action plans by banks as opposed to approval of SAPs by the CBCG, and
completion of restructuring of Prva Banka instead of significant progress with the
restructuring. Furthermore, this operation will be followed up by a Public Expenditure
DPL which could provide additional leverage for continued commitment to the FSPBG
reform program, including in the context of its component concerning adequate policy
mix for ensuring macro-financial stability.

﻿ANNEX 3. OVERVIEW OF THE BANKING SECTOR

comprises 11 banks, nine of which are majority-foreign-owned, and accounting for about 89
percent of banking sector assets (Table 10).

2.     The level of banking system concentration is relatively high. At end 2011, the three
largest banks accounted for 60 percent of total assets and 60 percent of deposits. In particular,
the largest bank accounted for 25 percent of assets and 30 percent of deposits (Table 11).

3.     From 2005 to 2007, the Montenegrin banking system          expanded very rapidly, but
growth came to a halt since late 2008 due to the impact of the financial crisis. The rapid
growth was driven by the entry of foreign banks, along with increased domestic demand. Total
35 The structure of the largest banks in the Montenegrin banking system changed in the period 2008-2011. The three
largest banks include Montenegro Commercial Bank (CKB), Hypo Alpe Adria Bank (HAAB), and NLB
Montegrobanka (NLB). Prva Banka is no longer classified by the CBCG as a systemic bank due to its reduced size
in relation to the banking system.

﻿assets increased by more than 100 percent on average in 2006 and 2007, from 67 percent of GDP
to 111 percent of GDP. Asset growth slowed down substantially since 2008 due to the impact of
the 2008-09 crisis, with assets growing only by 11 percent in 2008 (both due to credit controls
applied by the CBCG and the impact of the crisis), and with consistent negative growth rates
since then (Table 10).

4.     The expansion of the banking system was underpinned by the exceptionally high
credit growth, one of the highest in ECA countries, but a severe credit crunch followed
since 2009. Total credit grew by 145 percent on average in 2006 and 2007. In early 2008, credit
growth started to slow down due to the impact of the crisis as well as in response to a series of
restrictive measures taken by the CBCG to limit the credit boom (credit growth ceilings and
increased minimum solvency requirements). Credit activity started to decline in the last quarter
of 2008 as banks became concerned about their deteriorating liquidity situation and ability of
their parent banks to provide financing. This declining lending trend has continued in 2009,
2010 and 2011, mainly due to banks' rising asset quality problems and a decline in demand for
loans from the corporate sector affected by the weakened economy. Most recent data for 2011
shows a negative credit growth of 11 percent year-on-year.

﻿5.    The loan-to-deposit ratio has been slowly adjusting to more sustainable levels but
remains high for regional standards. The high credit growth was largely financed by external
borrowings from foreign banks, resulting in one of the highest loan-to-deposit ratios in the
region, and exposing the banking sector to substantial liquidity shocks. Financing from parent
banks is one of the main sources of financing for banks, as the banking sector is largely foreign-
owned (90 percent of system's assets as of end 2011). Funding from parent banks (borrowings
from parent banks as a share of total non-equity liabilities) increased from 8 percent in 2006 to
14 percent in 2007, 21 percent in 2008, and has since then decreased to 20 percent in 2009, 17
percent in 2010, and 11 percent in 2011. The high loan-to-deposit ratio exposed the banking
sector to substantial liquidity shocks. The LTD increased from 107 percent in 2007, to 140
percent in 2008 and has decreased since then returning to 108 in December 2011.

6.    Deposits also increased rapidly in the years prior to the 2008 financial crisis, during
which massive deposit withdrawals undermined banks' liquidity. Deposits increased by an
average of 107 percent in 2006 and 2007, from 50 percent of GDP to 78 percent of GDP.
Significant deposit withdrawals occurred throughout the banking system starting in late
September 2008. As public nervousness increased with the advent of the global financial crisis,
over Q4 2008, deposits declined by 18 percent. The anti-crisis measures implemented by the
authorities helped to slow deposit withdrawals, although they did not stop the outflow
completely. Between September 2008 and June 2009 there was a loss of about 25 percent of
total deposits (about a 33 percent decline of both household and enterprise deposits). In the
second half of 2009, deposits showed some signs of recovery. However, a loss of deposits
continued in 2010, as deposits declined by 2 percent (13 percent increase from households and
17 percent decline from enterprises) at end-2010. During 2011, deposits increased by 2 percent
year-on-year. Overall, between September 2008 and December 2011, the banking sector lost
more than 22 percent of total deposits in the system. The withdrawal of deposits was large and
persistent, and deposits have not recovered yet to pre-crisis levels.

7.     The withdrawal of deposits, particularly in the largest two banks by size of deposits
- CKB and Prva Banka - led to a temporary liquidity crisis in the system. CKB and Prva
Banka lost more than EUR486 million of deposits (more than a third of deposits respectively)
from September 2008 to June 2009, accounting for 86 percent of total deposit outflow in the
system (CKB accounted for 55 percent of total deposit outflow and Prva Banka for 31 percent of
total outflow). The deposit outflow caused deterioration in liquidity, with the liquidity ratio of
liquid assets to short term liabilities declining from 32 percent at end-2007 to 21 percent at end-
2008. This liquidity ratio was particularly low at Prva Banka at end 2008 with liquid assets to
short term liabilities at 7 percent (compared to 21 percent system wide) and liquid assets to total
assets at 5.8 percent (compared to 11 percent system wide). Since then, system wide liquidity
has improved with a liquidity ratio of 26 percent at end-2009, due to the CBCG measures to
improve liquidity in the system by lowering the reserve requirement rate, as well as due to large
inflows as a result of privatization of EPCG. In 2010 and 2011, the liquidity ratio improved
further to 33 percent in both years.

﻿8.     The banking system entered the crisis with relatively adequate prudential ratios, but
preexisting vulnerabilities were accentuated by the crisis. The banking system reported
adequate capitalization as of end Q2-2008, with a capital adequacy ratio of 27 percent (above the
regulatory minimum of 10 percent). NPLs had already been rising from 3.2 percent in 2007 to
3.9 percent at end Q2-2008, but still remained at low levels. The banking system was also
relatively liquid with the liquidity ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities at about 27
percent at end-Q2 2009. However, funding liquidity risks were high, especially since banks
were heavily reliant on foreign financing.

9.     The main vulnerability facing the banking sector prior to the crisis was liquidity
risk, due to the high concentration of deposits in the top banks and banks' reliance on
external borrowings. At end-2008, the top three banks (CKB, Prva, and Hypo Alpe Adria) held
63 percent of total deposits, with the potential to undermine stability in case of a massive deposit
withdrawal. In addition, financing from parent banks constituted 76 percent of total borrowings
at end-2008, exposing the banking sector to liquidity shocks in case parent banks were unable to
sustain financing to their subsidiaries.
10.   In addition to the liquidity stress, the asset quality in the banking system has
deteriorated rapidly since the onset the crisis on the back of accumulated risk exposures
during the boom. The weakened economy, especially with the declining performance of the
construction sector and the real estate market, contributed to a high rise in NPLs. NPLs as a
share of total loans increased from 7.2 percent at end-2008 to 13.6 percent at end-2009, to 21
percent at end-2010. Total NPLs have decreased slightly to 15.5 in 2011. At the same time, past
due loans (loans overdue by more than 30 days) increased from 11.5 percent at end-2008 to 23
percent at end-2009, to 24 percent at end-20 10, and further to 19 percent at end-20 11. The rapid
rise in NPLs during 2010 was driven in part by Prva Banka's delay in recognizing the extent of
60


﻿its NPLs (which did not occur until after an onsite inspection in December 2010), in part due to
the contraction in total loans as banks ceased lending (and thus increased NPLs as a proportion
of total loans), and also in part due to other large banks (particularly CKB and Hypo), which
"cleansed" their loan portfolios in 2010 in anticipation of spinning off large volumes of NPLs to
their foreign parents in the first half of 2011, a process which is now underway. Given estimated
GDP growth of two percent in 2011 (after an estimated 1.1 percent growth in 2010), the ending
of the cleansing process, and the spin-off of NPLs now underway, NPLs declined to 15.5 percent
by end-20 11, but stronger recovery in bank lending is yet to resume.
11.   Provisions coverage of NPLs has been on a declining trend. Provisioning as a share of
total loans increased from four percent at end-2008 to 6.3 percent at end-2009 and to 6.4 percent
as of end-2010. In 2011, provisions decreased to 5 percent of total loans. Provision coverage of
NPLs has been on a declining trend from 56 percent in 2008 to 47 percent in 2009, 31 percent in
2010, and to 33 percent by the end of 2011. This is partly due to a relaxation in asset
classification and provisioning requirements for banks that the CBCG has undertaken since June
2009. In addition, net NPLs account for a very high share of banks' capital, at 67 percent by
end-201 1.

12.   Due to the deteriorating asset quality, the system's capital adequacy was negatively
affected. The banking system's capital adequacy declined from 15 percent in 2008 to 13 percent
in 2009, increased to 15.9 percent in 2010, and stood at 16.5 at end-December 2011. Parent
foreign banks were able to provide additional capital in the amount of EUR230 million from Q4
2008 to March 2011 - to their local subsidiaries to offset the losses caused by the crisis. Prva
Banka is posing the highest risk since, unlike other systemically important banks, it could not
rely on support from a foreign parent.
13.   In response to rising NPLs, banks have been restructuring credit. In 2009, total
restructured loans amounted to EUR205 million (about 9 percent of the loan portfolio) and as of
end-2011 to EUR277 million (over 14 percent of the loan portfolio). Loan restructuring
consisted mainly of prolonging repayment of the principal or the interest. On December 23,
2009, the CBCG adopted a temporary regulation allowing creditors to negotiate restructuring
61


﻿with debtors that have loans of above 180 days overdue loans, a change from the previous
requirement of restructuring loans of up to 90 days overdue.

14.   The crisis had a rapid and dramatic impact on bank profitability, which still
remains negative due to high provisioning requirements on the back of high NPLs. The
banking sector has incurred heavy losses since December 2008. The ROA decreased from -0.6
percent in 2008 to -0.7 percent at end-2009, to -2.8 percent at end-2010, and improved slightly at
-1 percent at end-September 2011. The ROE declined from -6.9 percent in 2008 to -7.8 percent
at end 2009, and declined dramatically in 2010 reaching -28 percent at end-20 10, and stood at -1
percent at the end of 2011. The banking sector incurred losses throughout 2010 with EUR82
million in losses at end-2010. However, in 2011 the rate of losses declined as banks incurred
EUR3 million in losses for the year.

﻿ANNEX 4. FUND RELATION NOTE
International
Monetary Fund
IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article
IV Consultation with Montenegro
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 12/51
May 16, 2012
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote
transparency of the IMP's views and analysis of economic developments and
policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are
issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with
member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of
post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries
with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive
Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the
Executive Board in a particular case.
On May 11, 2012, the Executive Board of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation
with Montenegro.1
Background
Three years after the sudden end of Montenegro's boom,
there has been considerable progress toward recovery.
Strong growth in tourism supported real GDP growth of 212
percent In 2011, bringing output nearly back to its pre-
crisis level in 2008. The recovery Is at risk of stalling,
however, with the projected downturn in the euro area
likely to weigh on growth in 2012. The debt overhang
continues to linger, moreover, with domestic liquidity
shortages a growing constraint. High-frequency economic
Indicators depict a weakening of activity in late 2011 and
early 2012.
In addition, the policy buffers that have supported growth
in recent years have been largely depleted. Public debt has
risen sharply since 2007, Increasing from 28 to 47 percent
of GDP at the end of 2011, as fiscal surpluses quickly
turned into large deficits following the collapse of the
boom.
Fiscal Imbalances have proved difficult to rein in, reflecting
a large fall in revenue after the collapse of the boom, rising
pension expenditures, and costs stemming from public
support for struggling enterprises. However, and
notwithstanding an increase In the headline deficit, there
was some progress toward fiscal consolidation in 2011.
Although the headline deficit rose to 6.3 percent of GDP,
this partly reflected payment of called loan guarantees that
had been extended In 2009-10 but did not have an impact
on demand In 2011. Adjusting for these payments, the
fiscal stance tightened by 0.7 percent of GDP. The
authorities aim for further consolidation this year and over
the medium term, and are In the process of Identifying
64


﻿needed measures to achieve this adjustment.
After three years of rapid bank deleveraging, there are
indications that conditions are stabilizing. The gradual
return of deposits to the banking system continued in
2011, and banks took steps to off-load problem loans and
re-align their lending with their domestic deposit base.
However, the system remains burdened by high non-
performing loans-notwithstanding their recent sharp
decline-and is lagging in provisioning. New bank lending
remains limited, reflecting the existing debt overhang and
the significant uncertainty over the economic outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities' efforts to
stabilize the economy, and welcomed the progress made
since the financial crisis. With the recovery now at risk of
stalling, Directors called for intensified efforts to address
large fiscal and external imbalances, further enhance
financial sector stability, and improve competitiveness.
Directors recognized the sizable public expenditure
adjustment over the past few years, but underscored the
need for further high-quality deficit reducing measures to
put public debt on a declining trajectory. While fiscal
consolidation will need to rely on both revenue and
expenditure measures, the more sizable adjustment should
come from further spending cuts. Directors saw the 2012
supplementary budget, adopted by the cabinet, as a step in
the right direction. Going forward, Directors recommended
further reducing personnel and entitlement spending. They
underscored the importance of ending fiscal and quasi-
fiscal support to the metals sector and assessing its
viability. Directors stressed that revenue measures should
focus on improving tax administration, but saw some scope
to raise tax rates that are below regional levels. Some
Directors cautioned that tax rate increases should be
considered only after tax administration is strengthened,
given their potential Impact on competitiveness.
Directors commended the authorities' efforts to stabilize
the financial sector, and to improve the framework for crisis
preparedness and banking resolution. Given remaining
vulnerabilities, they stressed the need to further strengthen
supervision and regulation, including the macroprudential
framework. They underlined the need to enforce capital
requirements and improve asset quality, while monitoring
liquidity closely and maintaining high prudential buffers.
Directors welcomed progress in advancing structural
reforms, and called on the authorities to accelerate efforts
to enhance competitiveness and attract foreign investment.
In particular, they underscored the need to further improve
the business environment and increase labor market
flexibility. Directors also saw merit in reforms to ensure
that social protection schemes target the neediest and do
not impede labor market participation.

shortcomings in economic statistics which hamper policy
design and evaluation.

Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President
The World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C., 20433
25 May 2012
Dear Mr. Zoellick:
1.    We are writing to request, on behalf of the Government of Montenegro and the Central
Bank of Montenegro, a Financial Sector Policy-Based Guarantee Facility (FSPBG) of EUR 60
million equivalent to support our economic reform program. This Letter of Development Policy
sets out the key actions that the Government is committed to undertake over the near to medium
term to maintain macroeconomic stability and further strengthen the financial sector in
Montenegro,
2.    Since 2002, and following the adoption of the euro as the legal tender, Montenegro's
inflation and interest rates declined and reforms accelerated. We have implemented a series of
fiscal and social reforms aimed at modernizing the functions of the state, increasing the
efficiency of public expenditures and improving targeting of social spending, as documented in
the World Bank's recent public expenditure reviews. After independence, by late 2006,
Montenegro's economy found itself increasingly flushed with large inflows of external capital,
which financed an economic, real estate, and credit boom. Foreign firms and individuals
acquired significant local assets, mainly land, housing, and other real estate.
3.    Over 2006-2007, we ran fiscal surpluses of about 4 percent of GDP on average. But with
the large revenue windfall, spending went up from 42 percent of GDP in 2006 to over 50 percent
of GDP in 2008, mainly due to the surge in capital expenditure, partly compensating for
preceding years of underinvestment in basic infrastructure. Current expenditures increased as
67


﻿well, especially wages and current transfers. During this boom period, Montenegro had one of
the highest economic growth rates (9 percent) and per capita foreign direct investment (FDI per
capita C1600) in Europe, and the gross fixed investment-to-GDP ratio averaged 37 percent over
the same period. The overheating resulted in widening of the current account deficit, albeit
financed to a significant degree by large FDI inflows.
4.    Growth plummeted, from almost 7 percent in 2008 to -5.7 percent in 2009, one of the
sharpest growth declines among European and Central Asian economies. External demand (in
particular for aluminum and steel) dropped, while liquidity problems in the financial and
corporate sectors escalated.
5.    In response, we implemented emergency financial, fiscal and social measures to stem the
impact on the economy while continuing EU-accession related structural reforms.  An
announcement of a bank deposit guarantee in October 2008 stopped the run on deposits. The
Central Bank responded with a menu of measures aimed at easing the liquidity crisis while
strengthening inspection and supervision. On the fiscal front, we implemented cuts in nominal
wages and increased spending on active labor market programs targeting the youth and new job
entrants. Despite short-term pressures, we also advanced structural pension reform, inter alia, by
adopting automatic annual adjustments to the mandatory retirement age, following good
international practice. We also began preparing the ground for a significant further tightening of
the budget in the considerably changed external environment. By 2011, we had cut total public
expenditures by about 8 percentage points of GDP from its peak in 2009, through a freeze in
public sector wages, staffing rationalization, and further expenditure restraint in operations and
maintenance costs, and the capital budget. Fiscal deficit declined below 4 percent of GDP by
2011, despite the declining revenue-to-GDP ratio, rise in tax arrears, and increases in military
pensioners as part of the adjustment in the context of Montenegro's efforts towards NATO
membership, as well as an increase in the total number of pensioners (almost three times more
pensioners in 2010 and 2011 compared to the average from 2000 to 2009). The social
contributions and pensions have increased by 64 million (2% of GDP) in the last two years, and
has been on the expenditure side the key reason for not reaching the balanced budget in 2013.
6.    With a sharp drop in economic activity, domestic demand and imports, a significant
external adjustment took place from 2009 onwards. The current account deficit declined by
more than a half between 2008 and 2011 (from 51% of GDP to 19% of GDP). This deficit
corrected for the net FDI flows declined to more moderate, though still high, levels of the order
of 10-12 percent of GDP. Access to capital was retained through foreign banks' sustained
financial support to Montenegrin subsidiaries, which contributed to the rise in private external
debt to about 60 percent of GDP, while total external debt (public and private) hovered around
100 percent of GDP in 2011.
Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
7.    After the economy grew by an average of 2.5 percent over the 2010-11 period,
Montenegrin economy recovered at one of the fastest rates since the drop in 2009,real GDP is
projected to slow to 0.5 percent in 2012. The growth outlook for 2012 implies a downward
revision from what was envisioned when the original 2012 budget was approved and reflects the
68


﻿deteriorating external environment in the Eurozone. Over the medium term, growth is expected
to recover to 3-3.5 percent, become more diversified, and supported by FDI in energy, tourism
and construction.
8.    In line with the expected deterioration in growth during 2012, we are intensifying our
fiscal consolidation efforts. On the revenue side, we had already increased key excises and the
property tax rate, stepped up collection and taken steps to expand the tax base, including by
reducing exemptions. However, given the weaker growth and revenue outcomes in the early
months of the year, the revised 2012 budget amendment adopted in April 2012 raises further
excises on alcohol and other products, increases tax on privileged pensions; introduces levies on
mobile telephony SIM cards, smoking public place areas, electricity meters, and cable TVs; and
implements additional measures to improve compliance. These new measures are expected to
generate about 0.6 percent of GDP in additional revenues. On the expenditure side, a
conservative indexation mechanism for wages and pensions has already been adopted and is
backed by a formal agreement with the unions; this is expected to reduce the government wage
bill and transfers to the social insurance funds. The budget aims at rationalizing some subsidies
(state aid) and social transfers (e.g., labor market programs, maternity benefits) while
maintaining critical capital expenditures. Government guarantees are limited to EURIO million
(about 0.3 percent of GDP), signaling a shift to a much more restrictive policy towards
guarantees. In addition, on the expenditure side, the 2012 budget amendment further cuts current
expenditures by [0.34] percent of GDP and delays some non-essential capital expenditures,
which will result in saving of about [0.14] percent of GDP. As a result, the primary deficit will
be cut-relative to the 2011 outturn-by [1.56] percentage points to [0.63] percent of GDP and
the overall deficit will be reduced by about 1.3 percentage points to 2.34 percent of GDP.
9,    The revised budget also takes into account budgetary implications of recent
developments with the aluminum company. As a result of those fiscal pressures and the
downward revision of growth and revenues, the fiscal deficit of the Central Government in 2012
will be revised from 1.25 percent to 2.55 percent of GDP in the amended budget. While the
current loan schedule spreads repayments over a three to five-year period, these pressures
together add up to an additional EURl55 million (5 percent of 2011 GDP) public debt service.
10.   In parallel to the 2012 Budget Law amendment, we have also adopted additional
measures that are likely to generate further savings: (i) a law on a 7-percent cut in wages of top
government officials, diplomats and judiciary; (ii) reduced per diems allowances for official
travel by 20 percent; (iii) reduced privileged pensions for sportsmen, and launched a review and
revision of disability pensions; (iv) abolished governing boards' allowances in health, social,
cultural and educational state institutions; and (v) ordered a reduction in salaries of management
at SOEs.
It.   Over the medium term, under the amended fiscal framework we aim to deepen fiscal
consolidation, move towards fiscat surpluses and reverse the debt dynamics, setting the public
debt of Montenegro on a downward trajectory. The Government's objective is to stem further
growth in public debt which, along with guarantees, reached 59.6 percent of GDP in 2011. The
medium-term strategy is built on a plan to reduce general government spending by additional 4.5
percentage points of GDP, down to about 38 percent of GDP, by 2015 (from over 50 percent of
69


﻿GDP in 2009). The long-term objective is to reach the public debt ratio of about 30-35 percent
of GDP.
12.   The Government has either prepared or implemented significant measures to further
restrain spending and-importantly-improve its efficiency over the medium term:
*  The pension system reform, in line with good international practice, resulted in the increase
in the retirement age from 55/60 to 67 for men and women, following automatic
adjustments with the transition period of 20 years. The pension indexation was changed to
a more conservative 75 percent of CPI and 25 percent of the average wage, a more
conservative mechanism than the so-called Swiss formula (50-50).
* The public administration reform through staff downsizing implemented a "two-for-one"
principle, i.e., one employed for two staff leaving the public sector or three retiring; the
central payroll calculation and a wage freeze;
* The state aid reform, whereby subsidized electricity to metal industries will cease by end-
2012;
*  The rationalization of social security costs and transfers through capping total health and
social benefit expenditures, consolidating insurance funds under the Single Treasury
Account, and imposing central oversight of the use of budget funds;
*  Centralized authorization/management of public procurement and the Single Treasury
Account commitment module to prevent further accumulation of arrears;
*  Moderation of capital spending and their protection to priority projects at about 3.5 percent
of GDP throughout the period;
*  Drafted amendments to the organic budget act to formally introduce the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework and the fiscal rule in 2012; and
*  Stepped up efforts in tax collection and gradual increases in property tax and excise duties
(also required as a part of the EU accession program).
13.   Beyond fiscal consolidation, we plan to continue strengthening competitiveness of our
economy and prepare the ground for more robust long-term growth. This strategy includes: (i)
creating fiscal buffers and protecting macroeconomic stability; (ii) continuing restructuring of
the financial and real sector; (iii) accelerating structural reforms in social, labor, and education
sectors as well as public administration to ensure sustainability of public finances; and (iv)
strengthening the enabling environment for private sector growth.
14.   We are keenly aware of the risks to our economy and fiscal stance and are committed to
implementing substantial contingency measures, Given these risks and increasing uncertainties
in the Eurozone, and in addition to the April 2012 revisions to the budget, we are considering an
increase in the standard Value-Added tax rate (currently at 17 percent), if this were to be needed.
These measures could be activated in case of a further deterioration in economic conditions later
in the year.

﻿Strengthening the Financial Sector
15,   In the area of financial sector development, we will continue our program to strengthen
regulation and supervision of banks consistent with sound international (and specifically, EU)
practice, including Basel 11 compliance. We will continue to ensure that all banks, and especially
the systemically important ones, are adequately capitalized; we are committed to improving the
resolution framework for failing banks to minimize the potential costs of bank failure to
depositors and the State budget and of disruption in the banking sector; we will further
strengthen the ability of the Deposit Protection Fund to conduct payouts of insured deposits at
failed banks in a timeframe consistent with EU directives; we will continue strengthening the
liquidity management framework by enhancing the powers of the CBCG to carry out lender of
last resort functions in line with international good practices; we are committed to promote the
restructuring of problem systemic banks through timely implementation of supervisory action
plans; and, we will complete implementation of our program to level the competitive playing
field by withdrawing central government deposits from all banks and ensuring that public
institutions purchase financial services and place their deposits using a transparent, competitive,
and risk-adjusted procurement framework.
16.   Since the beginning of the global financial crisis we have put in place a comprehensive
crisis management framework. We have continued the reform program started under the
FSDPLI focused on systemic risk monitoring, crisis preparedness and strengthening banks
financial soundness, and also including leveling the playing field in the banking sector to allow
for prudent and fair competition in the provision of financial services. By April 2012, we have
implemented, with technical support from the World Bank and the EC central bank twinning
program, a comprehensive package of reforms to strengthen systemic risk monitoring and the
crisis management framework, address existing banking sector vulnerabilities, complete
restructuring of Prva Banka, enhance depositor protection, and further improve the regulatory
framework for banks. These reforms, described below, support Montenegro's progress towards
aligning its legal and policy frameworks with good international practice and the EU.
17.   First, a new law on the Central Bank of Montenegro (CB Law) was enacted in mid-2010
that provides the CBCG with expanded powers to act as the lender of last resort. The Financial
Stability Council (FSC) established by the Financial Stability Law of 2010 (FSL) has become
operational and meets regularly, which has greatly strengthened systemic risk monitoring.
Further, the FSC has put in place a new crisis management framework by developing crisis
contingency plans at the level of the three financial sector regulators and the FSC, including
adoption of a national contingency plan. In addition, the FSC has adopted a draft lex specialis
(Financial Stability Law) which would be submitted to Parliament immediately upon declaration
of a financial crisis by the FSC, and, once enacted, would grant the authorities additional powers
to intervene in the financial system by providing liquidity and capital support.
18.   Second, we have employed a range of supervisory techniques to identify vulnerabilities
in the banking sector and required bank management and owners to undertake prompt corrective
actions as necessary. The supervisory framework combines full scope on-site examinations,
targeted on-site examinations, off-site monitoring, and quarterly stress testing for credit,
liquidity, and market risks. By April 2012, updated supervisory Action Plans (SAPs) for banks of
special concern and systemic importance were approved by CBCG management and
71


﻿implemented, and we have developed an intensive plan of on-site supervision activities for 2012.
We maintain an ongoing dialogue with bank management and shareholders to address specific
weaknesses, including capital and liquidity shortfalls identified during on-site inspections and
off-site stress tests.
19.   Third, as a result of the October 2011 on-site examination, we have developed a SAP for
Prva Banka which has been issued with an Order to maintain at least 12 percent capital adequacy
ratio throughout 2012 and required to eliminate all irregularities described in the on-site
examination report and SAP. At the same time, Prva Banka must meet all other regulatory
requirements. In parallel, the MoF has been proceeding with a gradual withdrawal of central
government deposits from Prva Banka based on a schedule agreed under the FSDPLI, and all
remaining Government deposits will be withdrawn by end-June 2012. Furthermore, we have
issued guidelines to all majority state-owned enterprises, municipalities and other state-
sponsored institutions to use clearly defined eligibility criteria for procurement of financial
services from commercial banks. The guidelines should ensure that no bank receives a
disproportionate share of state-related financial services business.
20.   Fourth, we enacted a new Deposit Protection Law in mid-2010, now implemented by the
Deposit Protection Fund which has adopted several regulations to improve its functions. In order
to improve the function of informing depositors about increase of the coverage from EUR 20,000
to EUR 35,000, the DPF has adopted a by-law on providing information to depositors through
regular communications as of QI 2012. Further, the DPF adopted a regulation on payouts of
guaranteed deposits to increase the transparency and efficiency of the process, including the
selection of the payout agent bank. In addition, the DPF has adopted an internal regulation that
governs its activities and processes during the payout process, including a clear assignment of
responsibilities.
21.   We have taken steps to harmonize the regulatory framework for banks with relevant EU
Directives and with prevailing practices in EU member states. Thanks to reforms implemented
under the FSDPL1, the CBCG now has the full range of instruments and authorities for effective
supervision and, in particular, for dealing with problem banks. By April 2012, we made further
progress in bringing the regulatory framework into alignment with EU and international good
practice by adopting new regulations to implement the Basel II Standardized Approach,
requiring implementation of IFRS for banks, and by the Government adoption of the Law on
Financial Collateral, which is expected to be enacted by the Parliament in the first half of 2012.
The adopted Basel II implementing regulations include CBCG Decisions on capital adequacy,
credit risk management, large exposures, approvals to use credit rating agency ratings, and bank
transparency and information disclosure under Pillar 3 of Basel II. The Government has adopted
a draft Law on Financial Collateral based on EC Directive 47 to improve access to, and handling
of, financial collateral by financial institutions, and it is expected that the Parliament will enact
the Law by end-Q2 2012, and we commit to use our best efforts to secure such enactment. We
continue to work towards implementation of IFRS by banks, and have established a working
group to assess the tax implications of IFRS introduction. As the first step in this process, the
CBCG has issued a regulation requiring banks to implement IFRS 39 as of January 1, 2013. In
addition, the CBCG has adopted an JAS capacity building plan for bank supervisors. We are
committed to issuing all necessary regulation in the course of 2012 to implement the full IFRS
for banks as of January 1, 2013.
72


﻿22.   In the next 18 months, we intend to build on the above-described reforms to further
strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for the banking system and complete work on
leveling the competitive playing field for banks. This reform program will have five major
components (described in more detail below): (i) full implementation of the 2010 CBCG Law
including issuance of required regulations and decisions; (ii) continued updates and
implementation of the supervisory action plans for systemic banks and banks of special concern
to ensure that all of these institutions are capitalized at levels consistent with their risk profiles;
(iii) improvements to the transparency and quality of bank financial reporting as a result of the
full implementation of IFRS by banks; (iv) further strengthening of the DPF's capacity to
execute cost-efficient and timely payouts of insured deposits of failed banks; and, (v) completing
the reforms started in early 2011 to level the competitive playing field for financial services
provided to central Government and other State entities.
23.   By end-2012 the CBCG will complete adoption and implementation of regulations and
decisions required to put into practice the provisions of the 2010 CBCG Law, including
regulations required to implement the CBCG's expanded lender of last resort powers. In
parallel, the FSC will adopt all bylaws and regulations required to formalize the Committee's
operations and consultative functions and harmonize these functions with the CBCG's bylaws
and regulations.
24.   The CBCG completed the issuance of regulations and bylaws required by the
amendments to the Banking Law by end-March 2012, and will fully implement them by 31
December 2012. In parallel, the clean-up of the banking system, started in 2009, was completed
by end-March 2012 at which point all banks were fully compliant with the terms of their SAPs,
and as a result fully compliant with all CBCG regulations. All systemic banks will have their
SAPs updated regularly on the basis of onsite inspections and offsite monitoring. Prva Banka in
particular has achieved and is required to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 12 percent,
and two further on-site inspections of the bank will be carried out in 2012 to ensure that the bank
remains in compliance with its minimum capital adequacy ratio of 12 percent and other
regulatory norms. These on-site inspections will be reinforced by monthly offsite analysis of the
bank's progress, regular meetings with management, and monthly off-site monitoring of its
condition,
25.   In order to improve the transparency of bank financial reporting and the ability of bank
supervisors to detect emerging risks, and to better align Montenegro with financial reporting
practices in most EU countries, the CBCG and MoF intend to transition financial and tax
reporting requirements to comply with IFRS as of January 1, 2013. To this end, by December
31, 2012, the CBCG will have issued all regulations and decisions required for IFRS
implementation. Issuance of these regulations (the first of which, on implementation of IFRS 39
has already been issued by the CBCG) is being supported by a CBCG-MoF joint working group
which is assessing potential tax revenue and tax reporting impacts arising from the transition;
and, by the CBCG's IAS capacity-building program for its supervisors, which was adopted in
February 2012.
26.   While the legal powers and credibility of the DPF have been considerably strengthened
by the new Deposit Protection Law and putting in place an EBRD's back-up credit line, the DPF
still lacks institutional and analytical capacity for assessment of individual banking risks and full
73


﻿implementation of its responsibilities, in compliance with Core Principles for Effective Deposit
Insurance. To address this weakness, the DPF will: (i) complete issuance of regulations and
bylaws required to implement the provisions of the DPF Law and EU Directive on Deposit
Guarantee, (ii) strengthen its analytical function; (iii) complete implementation of a capacity
building program designed to put in place the IT and other systems required to give the DPF
rapid insured deposit payout capabilities, and complete training of DPF staff to ensure they are
able to carry out their new responsibilities. In addition, DPF will strive to further amend
necessary regulation which will allow more efficient usage of deposit insurance funds through
purchase and assumption transactions, based on least-cost test.
27.   By mid-2012 the process of leveling the competitive playing field for financial services
provided to state related institutions will be completed. This process has two main components:
(i) the withdrawal of Central Government deposits from commercial banks, including Prva
Banka (which remained in compliance with the schedule for withdrawal of deposits as of March
31, 2012); and, (ii) enforcing compliance by all other State institutions (including, inter alia,
municipalities, State pension and other funds, and state owned enterprises) with the MoF's
guidance issued in early 2011.
28.   In conclusion, we would like to reiterate the commitment of the Government and the
Central Bank of Montenegro to these reforms, which will help strengthen the fiscal and financial
sector foundations for long-term economic prosperity. We trust that this request of the World
Bank support for their implementation will receive your favorable consideration.

﻿ANNEX 6. IBRD GUARANTEE
A.     Guarantee Instrument
1.     The details of the terms and conditions of the IBRD Guarantee and the guaranteed
loan to Montenegro are still being discussed and defined in close consultation with the
Government and global banks. The indicative terms and conditions of the potential IBRD
Guarantee of a loan to Montenegro are provided below.
2.     Borrower and Guarantee Amount: The Borrower is Montenegro and the operation is a
Policy-Based Guarantee from the IBRD in the amount of EUR60 million, the equivalent of
US$79.2 million.
3.     Structure of the instrument: The FSPBG will partially guarantee a loan from an
international commercial bank or banks. The guarantee will cover EUR60 million of the
EUR90-100 million principal of the loan. The obligation will have a five- to seven-year
maturity. At the moment the Borrower and the markets are contemplating a structure with IBRD
guaranteeing a final balloon repayment of EUR60 million principal at maturity with
unguaranteed principal amortized over the term of the loan.
4.     Interest rate: The authorities are expected to opt for a fixed interest rate loan, to be
based on the five- to seven-year euro swap rate plus a spread. The lenders will also charge an
arrangement fee to be negotiated with the Borrower.
5.     The procurement process will follow national legislation. The procedure for selecting
the loan is expected to be relatively simple and would involve the issuance of a Request for
Proposals by the Ministry of Finance to a number of market participants. According to the
national legislation, once the winning bid is selected, a negotiation of the loan terms would
follow, without a need for parliamentary approval of the lenders or of the Guaranteed Loan
Agreement. The Indemnity Agreement between the Bank and Montenegro would also not
require parliamentary approval. The Bank will work closely with the authorities to minimize
risks during the process. Furthermore, the Guaranteed Loan Agreement to be signed will have
provisions that cover Sanctionable Practices at all stages of the proposed operation. Under these
provisions, IBRD is allowed to withhold payment if evidence arises at any time between the date
of the Guaranteed Loan Agreement and the final maturity date of the guaranteed loan that the
lender has engaged in a Sanctionable Practice in connection with the Guaranteed Loan
Agreement.36
6.     Disbursement: Upon notification by the Bank of the effectiveness of the Guaranteed
Loan Agreement among the lenders, the Bank and Montenegro, and of the effectiveness of the
36 The procurement process for the commercial loan is ready to be launched. The GoM will tender the transaction to
selected global banks by May 25, and the winner will be selected by June 26. The MoF will solicit bids for the
commercial loan from up to a dozen banks that operate in the region and which have demonstrated potential interest
in supporting the Government. All bids are conditional upon the World Bank issuing a guarantee for the principal
repayment. The GoM will formally announce the winner in late June after a careful review of the offers. Once the
World Bank guarantee has been approved by the Board of the World Bank, the loan agreement will be signed with
the lender(s).
75


﻿Indemnity Agreement between the Bank and Montenegro, the Borrower may request withdrawal
of the loan proceeds from the lenders within a defined drawdown period. As a condition to
effectiveness, Montenegro would also provide IBRD with a legal opinion on the Indemnity
Agreement. The front-end fees and the annualized guarantee fee are expected to be paid out of
the proceeds of the IBRD Guaranteed Loan.
7.    Guarantee Fees: Consistent with the current Bank policy, there is a front-end fee of 25
basis points on the face value of the guarantee exposure (EUR60 million) and a guarantee fee of
50 basis points per annum (equivalent to the contractual spread for loans) on the present value of
Bank's exposure from the transaction. The guarantee fee will also be collected upfront, on a
present value basis, to strengthen the transaction terms for all parties.
8.    Callability of the Guarantee: As the borrower, Montenegro would have the obligation
to ensure timely repayment to the lenders. In accordance with Bank policy on PBGs, the
guarantee would be non-accelerable. Following payment by the Bank under its guarantee, the
Bank would have the sole discretion to decide whether to demand immediate repayment from
Montenegro or to extend terms for repayment over time, and in the latter case, would have the
sole discretion as to the terms to be extended.
B.    Outline of Indicative Terms and Conditions of Potential World Bank Guarantee of
Loan to Montenegro
This term sheet contains a summary of indicative terms and conditions of a potential IBRD
Policy-Based Guarantee (the IBRD Guarantee) for a private-sector loan to the Republic of
Montenegro.
This term sheet does not constitute an offer from IBRD to provide an IBRD Guarantee. The
provision of the Guarantee is subject, inter alia, to satisfactory appraisal by IBRD of the related
Program, review and acceptance of the financing structure and transaction documentation, and
the approval of the Management and the Board ofDirectors oflBRD in their sole discretion.

Purpose:                  The proposed Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee (FSPBG)
supports Montenegro's comprehensive program of measures to
strengthen the banking sector, with the view to address
vulnerabilities of the Montenegrin banking sector and increase
the resilience of the sector to possible future shocks. The FSPBG
is a stand-alone operation building on the First Financial Sector
Programmatic Development Policy Loan (FSDPL1) disbursed
during the fiscal year 2011.
76

Governing Law:            [England].
Negative Pledge:          The terms of the IBRD    Guaranteed Loan and the IBRD
Guarantee will restrict the ability of the Borrower and IBRD, as
the case may be, to create certain liens on their property or assets
without equally and ratably securing the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
or the IBRD Guarantee, respectively.
Status of the IBRD        The obligations of IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee will
Guarantee:                constitute direct, unsecured obligations of IBRD ranking pari
passu, without any preference among themselves, with all its
other obligations that are unsecured and unsubordinated.
Status of the IBRD        The IBRD Guaranteed Loan will constitute direct, general,
Guaranteed Loan:          unconditional,  unsecured  and   unsubordinated  external

﻿Guaranteed Loan at scheduled maturity and will agree to pay on
demand from the Lender  as provided in the IBRD Guaranteed
Loan Agreement the amount of the principal which is due and
payable by the Borrower, provided that the maximum aggregate
amount of principal for which IBRD shall have liability shall not
in any circumstances exceed the amount of the IBRD Guarantee
as described above (see Guarantee Support).
Demand Notice for         No later than 10 business days after the scheduled maturity date,
Payment under the IBRD    the Lender will notify IBRD of any amount of principal that has
Guarantee:                fallen due and payable and remains unpaid after the scheduled
maturity date. Such notice shall also constitute a demand on
IBRD for payment.
IBRD shall have 30 days from and inclusive of its receipt of such
demand notice to make payment in respect thereof.
The obligations of IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee constitute a
guarantee of payment and not of collection. Any demand notice
must be received by IBRD within ten (10) business days of the
date any amount of principal referenced in such demand notice
becomes due and payable under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
Agreement.
Reduction of Demand:      If after the Lender has made a demand on IBRD for payment
under the IBRD Guarantee but before IBRD has made payment of
the amount so demanded, the Borrower pays the Lender (or the
Lender recovers otherwise than from IBRD) any sum which is
applied to the satisfaction of the whole or any part of the such
principal amount, the Lender shall promptly notify IBRD of such
fact and IBRD's liability under the IBRD Guarantee in respect of
such demand shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion
of principal so paid by the Borrower (or so recovered by the
Lender) and so applied.

the rights, powers and remedies conferred upon the Lender with
respect to IBRD by the IBRD Guarantee or by applicable law or
regulation shall be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected by:
(i) any insolvency, moratorium or reorganization of debts of or
relating to the Borrower; (ii) any of the obligations of the
Borrower under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement being or
becoming illegal, invalid, unenforceable, void, voidable or
ineffective in any respect; (iii) any time or other indulgence being
granted to the Borrower in respect of its obligations under the
IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement or (iv) any other act, event or
omission (other than the failure of the Lender to make a demand
under the IBRD Guarantee) which might otherwise operate to

﻿discharge, impair or otherwise affect any of the obligations of
IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee or any of the rights, powers or
remedies conferred on the Lender by the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
Agreement or be applicable law or regulation.
No Amendment without      The IBRD Guarantee shall terminate and any written demand
IBRD Consent:            from the Lender pursuant to the IBRD Guarantee shall be void if
any amendment is made to the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
Agreement, or any waiver or consent is given in writing with
respect thereto, without IBRD's prior written consent.
IBRD Obligations          IBRD's obligations under the IBRD Guarantee shall be binding
Binding:                  upon IBRD and inure to the benefit of the Lender and shall be
enforceable only by the Lender, provided that the obligations of
IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee shall not be treated as a separate
obligation of IBRD independent from the principal amount
guaranteed, and the benefit of such obligations may only be
transferred by a Lender in accordance with the provisions below,
as more fully described in the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement.
Except as IBRD may otherwise agree, any assignment of the
IBRD Guaranteed Loan may be made only to an assignee
established as a bank or financial institution duly licensed to carry
out banking or financial business in its country of domicile. Such
assignee may be a partly or wholly government-owned institution,
but cannot be an export credit agency, multilateral institution or
state entity. Such assignee must not have been declared ineligible
to be awarded an IBRD- or IDA-financed contract in accordance
with World Bank Sanctions Procedures and must not be an entity
included on the consolidated list of individuals and entities
maintained by the United Nations Security Council Committee
established pursuant to United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1267.
The assigning Lender shall provide IBRD with advance notice of
potential assignments as provided in the IBRD Guaranteed Loan
Agreement.
Subrogation:              Upon payment by IBRD of amounts under the IBRD Guarantee,
IBRD shall, to the extent it has not been reimbursed by the
Borrower under the Indemnity Agreement (as discussed below),
be immediately entitled to recover from the Borrower the amount
so paid by IBRD in respect of principal and for this purpose
IBRD shall be immediately subrogated to the rights of the Lender
to the extent of the amount in respect of principal so received by
such Lender, regardless of whether such Lender has been fully
prepaid or repaid by the Borrower, and the Lender shall forthwith
79


﻿assign or transfer to IBRD, without representation, warranty or
recourse, all of such Lender's claims, interests, rights and security
which it then has against the Borrower under the IBRD
Guaranteed Loan Agreement in respect of principal so received.
Withholding of Payment:  If at any time between the effective date of the IBRD Guaranteed
Loan Agreement and the maturity date of the IBRD Guaranteed
Loan (i) there is substantial evidence that the Lender has, in
connection with the IBRD Guaranteed Loan, engaged in
fraudulent, corrupt, coercive or collusive practices or (ii) the
Lender has been declared ineligible to be awarded a contract
financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development or the International Development Association in
accordance with the World Bank Sanctions Procedures, then
IBRD shall be entitled to withhold payment of all amounts
otherwise payable under the IBRD Guarantee by IBRD on
account of such Lender.
Role of IBRD:             The Lender will acknowledge and agree that IBRD will be acting
under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement solely in its
capacity as guarantor of the principal of the IBRD Guaranteed
Loan as provided therein and in no other capacity. IBRD shall
incur no liability under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement
nor have any other duties or responsibilities, except to the extent
expressly specified in the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement or
in any document delivered by IBRD under or pursuant to that
agreement.
Cross-Default Restriction: IBRD  may require a cross-default provision in the IBRD
Guaranteed Loan Agreement, including a restriction on the ability
of the Lender to accelerate the IBRD Guaranteed Loan upon a
default by the Borrower under any World Bank loans such that the
IBRD Guaranteed Loan may only be accelerated in the event of a
material default on World Bank loans.
IBRD Guarantee-Related Fees:
IBRD Guarantee Fees:      IBRD charges a guarantee fee of 0.5 percent per annum on the
present value of IBRD's exposure under the IBRD Guarantee,
payable up front in advance by the Borrower. IBRD may
terminate the IBRD Guarantee if the IBRD Guarantee Fee is not
paid by either of the Borrower or the Lender on or before the
fourteenth (14th) business day following the date of a notice
provided by IBRD to the Lender.
IBRD Front-end Fees:      IBRD charges a front-end fee of 0.25 percent of its maximum
80


﻿exposure (in this case, an amount of EUR 60 million) for Policy-
Based Guarantees. This fee is payable by the Borrower.
Stand-by Fees:             None.
Conditions Precedent to the IBRD Guarantee:
Conditions Precedent:      Usual and customary conditions for financing of this type
including the following:

precedent based on previous IBRD Development Policy
Loan to Montenegro;
b) Provision of relevant legal opinions satisfactory to IBRD;
c) Evidence of payment in full of the Front-end Fee and the

IBRD Documentation:
IBRD Guaranteed Loan        The terms and conditions of the IBRD Guarantee would be
Agreement:                  contained in the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement among
IBRD, the Borrower and the Lender.
IBRD will represent and warrant to the Lender that (in addition
to  standard  representations  about  due  authorization,
enforceability and power to execute) its obligations pursuant to
the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement rank pari passu with all
other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of IBRD.
The Lender will represent and warrant that it has not engaged in
and are not engaging in fraudulent, corrupt, coercive or
collusive practices, and will covenant, inter alia, to apply all
amounts received by it under the IBRD Guarantee towards
payment of the principal amounts covered by the IBRD
Guarantee which were the subject of the demand notice.
Indemnity Agreement:        The Borrower would enter into a separate Indemnity Agreement
with IBRD. Under the Indemnity Agreement, the Borrower
would undertake to indemnify IBRD on demand, or as IBRD
may otherwise determine, for any payment made by IBRD
under the terms of the Guarantee. The Indemnity Agreement
will follow the legal regime, and include dispute settlement
provisions, which are customary in agreements between
81


﻿member countries and IBRD.
Any obligation by the Borrower to reimburse IBRD for
payments made under the IBRD Guarantee will rank pari passu
with all other external indebtedness of the Borrower, including
external indebtedness of the Borrower to IBRD.
The Indemnity Agreement will also contain provisions on the
deposit and use of proceeds of the IBRD Guaranteed Loan. The
Borrower shall agree to deposit the proceeds of the IBRD
Guaranteed Loan in an account acceptable to IBRD, with
appropriate tracking of amounts deposited therein in the
Borrower's budget management system. The Borrower will
make withdrawals from such account for use in support of its
development policy program, and will agree not to use such
withdrawals to finance any excluded expenditures, which shall
include, inter alia, goods included in groups or subgroups of the
United Nations Standard International Trade Classification,
Revision 3, military goods, environmentally hazardous goods,
certain payments prohibited by a decision of the United Nations
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the
United Nations, or expenditures with respect to which IBRD
determines that corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive
practices were engaged in by representatives of the Borrower.
If any such withdrawals are used for excluded expenditures, the
Borrower shall deposit an equivalent amount in the account or
prepay the Lender an equivalent amount.
In the event that the Borrower fails to make any payment to or
to indemnify IBRD under the Indemnity Agreement or
otherwise defaults on its obligations under the Indemnity
Agreement, IBRD shall be entitled, in addition to any other
rights and remedies it may have, to suspend or cancel in whole
or in part the Borrower's right to make withdrawals under any
loan or guarantee between IBRD and the Borrower or under any
development credit agreement or financing agreement between
IBRD and the Borrower, or to declare the outstanding principal
and interest of any such credit or loan due and payable
immediately.
