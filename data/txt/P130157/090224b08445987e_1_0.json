Some of the lessons learned include: (i)\n            Policy-Based Guarantees (PBGs) can potentially be a useful\n            instrument for supporting countries facing large external\n            financing needs; (ii) PBGs implemented in a context of\n            challenging macro-fiscal situation and large financing needs\n            need to incorporate a consistent macro-economic framework\n            with necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation;\n            (iii) the choice of a PBG as an instrument should be based\n            on robust macro and fiscal projections indicating that\n            financing framework is sustainable and macro risks are\n            mitigated; and (iv) comparing the aggregate interest rate of\n            PBG-supported debt instruments with counterfactual market\n            rates may not be enough for assessing the extent of\n            reduction in the borrowing costs associated with the transaction."}, "docdt": "2016-06-21T02:04:00Z"}
