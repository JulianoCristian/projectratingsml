  I.      Country Context

       Economic growth resumed in Montenegro in 2010, continued throughout 2011 at the estimated
       2.5 percent. It is, however, expected to slow down to 0.5 percent in 2012, mainly due to adverse
       external developments. The on-going global economic and financial turmoil and the remaining
       vulnerabilities in Montenegro’s banking system thus undermine firm continuation of economic
       recovery. The adjustment of external imbalances has continued, the current account deficit is
       mostly financed by FDIs, and fiscal consolidation efforts have progressed despite tax arrears.

 II.      Sectoral and Institutional Context

       Weakening of the economy and the banks financial condition due to the 2008-2009 crisis
       spillover reduced depositor confidence and the savings potential of over-indebted households
       and enterprises. Although bank deposits have not yet recovered to pre-2008 levels, they resumed
       their growth throughout 2011 to early 2012. Bank asset quality has deteriorated since 2008, and
       although bank NPLs have shown some recovery recently, as banks sold some bad loans, the high
       NPL stock remains a challenge. In 2012, the priorities for Montenegro’s banking sector are
       further improvements in capitalization of banks and their liquidity positions, and resolution of
       the NPL stock in the economy.

III.      Project Development Objectives
       The objective of the proposed operation is to support the authorities’ reform program for
       strengthening the banking sector and maintaining financial stability, which is a critical pre-
       condition for sustained economic recovery and balanced private sector-led growth.

IV.       Project Description

       The proposed Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) supports the strengthening of systemic risk
       monitoring and crisis preparedness, the banking sector soundness and transparency, and
       depositors and market confidence, thus increasing Montenegro’s financial sector resilience to
       possible future adverse shocks. More specifically, this operation’s support derives from reforms
       in the following areas: (i) systemic risk monitoring and crisis preparedness; (ii) resolution of
       problem banks; (iii) restructuring of Prva Banka; (iv) the depositor protection scheme; and (v)
       the regulatory framework for banks.

VI.       Implementation

       The MoF will be responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed operation. The
       reforms proposed under this operation are expected to have overall positive poverty and social
       impacts. The implementation of the policy actions has required technical discussions amongst
       the Bank and the implementing institutions. Specific expected results indicators will be used to
       monitor the implementation of the operation. The guarantee would involve no immediate transfer
       of funds from the Bank, but sufficient funds would need to be provisioned from the Bank assets
       to meet a call on the guarantee if required.

VII.      Safeguard Policies (including public consultation)

       Specific actions under the proposed PBG are not expected to have any negative effect on the
       environment. The specific country policies supported by the PBG are not likely to cause effects
       on the country’s environment and natural resources. The legal and regulatory changes
       implemented in the context of the PBG do not allow the banking sector to circumvent
       environmental regulations governing investments, nor modify the existing environmental
       regulatory framework in any way.
