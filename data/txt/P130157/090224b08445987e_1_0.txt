      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20–25 percent of
the Bank’s lending operations through fieldwork. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, and Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to
which the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s
objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency
is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of
capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Montenegro financial
sector policy-based guarantee implemented in 2012–2013. The Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) prepared the report. It is based on interviews, documents, and data collected
during a mission to Montenegro in November 2015, during which government officials,
external development partners, and business groups, academics, nongovernmental
organizations, civil society groups, and other stakeholders were consulted. The evaluation
also draws on in-depth interviews of World Bank and International Monetary Fund staff,
including current and former members of the Montenegro country teams in Washington,
D.C., and Podgorica; and on published and internal documents from the two institutions.
The cooperation and assistance of all stakeholders and government officials are gratefully
acknowledged as is the support of the World Bank office in Podgorica.

Following standard Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) procedures, a copy of the draft
report will be circulated in parallel to the relevant government officials and agencies for
their review and feedback. Comments were received and are attached as Appendix D.

Summary
This Program Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) evaluates the financial sector
policy-based guarantee (FSPBG) to Montenegro in the amount of €60 million
implemented in 2012–2013. It supported a commercial loan in the amount of €100
million. The FSPBG was prepared by converting the second operation of the
programmatic series of financial sector development policy loan (FSDPL) in the amount
of USD$20 million into a guarantee instrument to respond to the large external financing
needs of Montenegro.

PPAR reviews the performance of this operation based on both IEG and Operations
Policy and Country Services (OPCS) guidelines. The report makes use of program level
evidence and draws broader lessons on the use of policy-based guarantees in the Bank.

The FSPBG had one objective: strengthening the banking system. The objective was
substantially relevant to World Bank (henceforth “the Bank”) and Government strategies
and to country conditions both at the time of entry and closing. Design of the program,
however, had shortcomings and was assessed as modest because of the lack of
operational focus on the program’s macroeconomic framework as well as risks and
shortcomings in assessing Montenegro’s eligibility for a policy-based guarantee (PBG).

The achievement of the objective was modest. The banking system largely recovered
from the crisis. Market confidence was restored, and total deposits surpassed the pre-
crisis level, while more banks entered Montenegro’s market following the operation. The
reform program, however, remains incomplete. Gaps exist in crisis management, while
banking supervision is not fully in compliance with the Basel Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision. The decline in nonperforming loans was slower than
expected, and further reform efforts are required to improve transparency. Withdrawal of
public sector deposits in Prva Banka to ensure market-based funding was reversed in
2014 and 2015. The bank continued to hold a large amount of public sector deposits at
the time of the evaluation. This evaluation highlights that many important outcomes that
were achieved in the banking system of Montenegro were attributable to the strong
reform actions supported by the predecessor program—FSDPL, underscoring the
relatively low value added of the FSPBG.

The overall outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory.1 The operation’s objective was
substantially relevant, but the design was modest. The outcome rating reflects IEG’s
assessment about the inadequacy of the PBG as an engagement modality, lack of Bank’s
focus on macroeconomic framework and risks, an incomplete banking system reform
agenda.

The risk to development outcomes is rated significant because of the limited decline in
nonperforming loans in the banking system, incomplete reform agenda in reporting and
quality of asset review, and the overall macro and fiscal risks. The Bank’s performance is
rated moderately unsatisfactory, reflecting weaknesses in quality at entry related largely

1The outcome rating is assessed on a six-point scale: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, and Unsatisfactory (IEG and OPCS guideline).

to the choice of the instrument. Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory
because of continued funding of Prva Banka through deposits of public agencies and
fiscal policy choices that heightened the risks to economic stability.

Among the key lessons are:

      PBGs can potentially be a useful instrument for supporting countries facing large
       external financing needs.
      PBGs implemented in a context of challenging macro-fiscal situation and large
       financing needs need to incorporate a consistent macro-economic framework with
       necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation.
      The choice of a PBG as an instrument should be based on robust macro and fiscal
       projections indicating that financing framework is sustainable and macro risks are
       mitigated. Montenegro’s case indicates that eligibility for a PBG cannot be
       decided based on general announcements by the government that lack details. The
       case highlights once again the criticality of Bank-Fund cooperation.
      Comparing the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported debt instruments with
       counterfactual market rates may not be enough for assessing the extent of
       reduction in the borrowing costs associated with the transaction. Estimating the
       change in sovereign risk perceptions, although a challenging task, may give more
       accurate assessment of the impact of the program.

1. Background and Context
1.1     Montenegro is a small economy in the Western Balkans with a population of 700,000,
and per capita income of around USD$7,100 in nominal terms in 2013. It experienced one of
the most severe boom and bust cycles in late 2000s that left its banking system extremely
fragile and in a need of restructuring. The economy contracted by about 6 percent in 2009
following rapid growth in high single digits fueled by external capital inflows and domestic
credit. Notwithstanding a brief recession in 2012 within in the Eurozone, the economy has
been recovering since 2010.

1.2     The Montenegrin banking system, which is dominated by foreign-controlled banks,
witnessed massive deposit withdrawals and rapid deterioration in asset quality in 2008–2009
that led to a severe shortage of capital. Prva Banka, the largest domestic bank and the second
largest bank in the system at the time, was hit hardest and given emergency support. The
situation improved in 2010–2011 through management of nonperforming loans (NPLs),
restructuring of Prva Banka, and capital injections from foreign banks to their Montenegrin
subsidiaries. Reforms were supported by the World Bank through technical assistance and a
financial sector development policy operation (DPO)—the Programmatic series of financial
sector development policy loan (FSDPL), which was launched in 2011.

1.3      The program under review was prepared against the background of renewed
economic and fiscal tensions in early 2012. Authorities were facing a large financing gap
from the second round of recession in the context of large debt repayments. Borrowing space
had been substantially narrowed by expansionary policies in 2008–2011 and large contingent
liabilities resulting from state guaranties provided to the metal industries, some of which
were called. The government introduced a package of revenue and expenditure measures for
fiscal consolidation and announced new and ambitious fiscal and debt targets. However, they
were not sufficient to secure a program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) because
of the lack of specific, medium-term spending and revenue measures. Areas of particular
concern included large public sector wages, entitlement spending programs especially
pensions, and low revenues from the value added tax (VAT) largely from the low tax rate.

1.4     Montenegro resorted to commercial loans from international banks to cover the
financing gap estimated for 2012 at 9–10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). A loan
negotiated with Credit Suisse in April 2012 in an equivalent of 5 percent of GDP was
partially supported by gold collateral but had a high interest rate—6.5 percent premium over
the Euribor’s 12-months rate). To respond to Montenegro's large financing requirement, the
Bank converted the second operation of FSDPL under preparation with an envisaged amount
of €20 million into a €60 million policy-based guarantee (PBG). In doing so, the Bank used
the policy actions implemented as triggers for the second FSDPL and focused on systemic
risks monitoring, crisis preparedness, restructuring of Prva Banka, and strengthening of bank
supervision as prior actions for the operation. The PBG allowed the government to mobilize
€100 million, or 3 percent of GDP, in budget financing with a lower interest rate of Euribor
12 months plus 3.5 percent. This was the third PBG prepared in the region, following similar
operations in both the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia in 2011.

1.5     The World Bank’s self-evaluation of the PBG through the Implementation
Completion and Results Report assigned a “satisfactory” outcome rating to the operation
resulting from substantial achievements in banking sector reforms. This PPAR is one in a
series of four project-level evaluations covering PBGs implemented in the Western Balkans
in 2011–2013 to assess the extent and sustainability of results and derive lessons about the
instrument’s use.

2. Objectives
2.1     The program document states that the overarching goal of the program was to
strengthen the banking sector, a critical precondition for sustainable economic recovery and
balanced private sector-led growth.2 IEG is using this stated objective for the purpose of its
evaluation.

3. Relevance of Objectives—Substantial3
3.1      The stated objective was relevant to country context and the World Bank's strategic
priorities outlined in the country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2011–2014 (World Bank
2010). The CPS had a specific outcome on “a stronger banking system governed by a modern
regulatory framework and central institutions, which is more resilient to future shock” under
the pillar of “Support EU accession through strengthening institutions and competitiveness.”
The objective came from the discontinued FSDPL and was strongly relevant to the context.
Montenegro's boom and bust cycle left its banking sector exposed to major risks. Banks
experienced massive deposit withdrawal and rapid deterioration in their assets quality during
2008–2009, resulting in a severe shortage of capital. Prva Banka, the largest domestic bank,
was hit hardest and given emergency support. The situation improved in 2010–2011 through
management of nonperforming loans (NPL), restructuring of Prva Banka, and capital
injections from foreign banks to their Montenegrin subsidiaries. At program preparation in
the first half of 2012, the reforms to strengthen the banking system were still underway,
while systemic risks were still present because of a volatile external environment and bad
asset quality of the banks.

3.2     The areas targeted by the operation, including monitoring systemic risks,
restructuring the Prva Bank, addressing NPL, and strengthening deposit protection and the
regulatory framework were relevant given the challenges facing the country. This objective
remained relevant during the program’s implementation and aftermath periods based on the
importance of a well-functioning banking system for economic growth and the need to
reduce contingency liability risks for the state from possible destabilization in the financial
sector.

Modest, and Negligible.
                                               3


4. Relevance of Design—Modest
4.1     The relevance of design is assessed as modest based on IEG's assessment of the
instrument choice, the program's macroeconomic and fiscal framework, and the program’s
policy content. Strengths included the relevance and institutional depth of most prior actions
and their importance for achieving the stated objective. The evaluation, however, finds that
Bank's analysis of Montenegro's compliance with the criteria for a PBG was based on
controversial assumptions about fiscal consolidation in the short term. These assumptions did
not come from a credible analysis of the country’s fiscal policy stance, and, in this respect,
were not fully justified. In addition, major macro and fiscal risks warranted the mitigating of
measures in the program, but they were not addressed. The risks could have been addressed
only through an operational focus on the macroeconomic framework supported by necessary
actions and monitorable indicators.

Macroeconomic Framework and Risks
4.2     After a fragile recovery in 2010–2011, the country was hit by a new recession in 2012
from volatility in the external environment. Policy response was constrained by elevated
public and publicly guaranteed debt that had increased from about 30 percent in 2008 to 57
percent in 2011. Materialization of major contingency claims, such as the calling of
guarantees issued by the state for metallurgic companies, in the amount of 4–5 percent of
GDP further reduced the policy space. In addition, repayments of external debt scheduled for
2012 were quite large, which increased the country's financing gap further.

4.3     In February 2012, the government introduced a package of medium-term revenue and
expenditure measures for fiscal consolidation. It also announced ambitious medium- and
long-term fiscal targets. They included reducing budget expenditures to 38 and 35 percent of
GDP by 2015 and 2018, respectively, from 43 percent in 2011 and reducing public debt to 48
and 35 percent of GDP by 2015 and 2018, respectively, from 57 percent in 2011. Specific
and detailed spending adjustment plans were absent. The financing gap for 2012, however,
remained at an estimated €230 million to €250 million (7 to 8 percent of GDP), which the
authorities were planning to cover through commercial loans.

4.4     At the same time, the authorities were also discussing a possible program with the
IMF. It did not materialize because the fiscal consolidation measures were not sufficient to
contain a sharp increase in public debt. The IMF found that the announced medium- and
long-term fiscal plans lacked credibility and were inconsistent with the existing spending
programs. Areas of particular concern included large public sector wages, entitlement
spending especially pensions, and the low VAT tax rate.

4.5     To secure financing, the authorities borrowed €150 million from Credit Suisse in
April 2012 with a 6.5 percent premium over the Euribor’s 12-months rate and a maturity of
five years. The interest rate was quite high despite the use of gold as collateral to cover 30
percent of the loan.

4.6    Against this background, the World Bank made a decision to convert the second
operation of FSDPL in an envisaged amount of €20 million (0.7 percent of GDP in 2012)
                                              4


into a guarantee of €60 million, or 2 percent of GDP, to support a commercial loan in the
amount of €100 million, or 3 percent of GDP. By doing this, the Bank effectively provided
an exceptionally large balance of payment and budget support in a risky macroeconomic
environment, which made the program strongly macro relevant. The commercial loan
supported by the guarantee was finalized in July 2012 and had an interest rate of Euribor 12
months plus 3.5 percent.

4.7     The FSDPL that was converted into the PBG was intended to strengthen the banking
system and maintain an adequate macroeconomic framework.4 The macro objective was
effectively dropped during the conversion of the DPO into a much larger PBG operation and
macro and fiscal challenges were not reflected in the program's objective despite intensified
macroeconomic concerns during 2012. A strong need existed for recalibrating policy to
address growing risks. A few months after the approval of the guarantee, the World Bank
began preparation of a new DPO with a fiscal consolidation objective. It did not materialize
because the authorities did not implement the necessary actions for fiscal consolidation.

4.8      The importance of addressing of macro and fiscal challenges that Montenegro faced
is highlighted in the 2011–2014 CPS. It mentioned that the use of DPOs in a deteriorated
fiscal climate might be warranted to help reestablish growth and fiscal health.5 The CPS also
highlighted that the planned programmatic series of FSDPLs, the second operation of which
was converted into the FSPBG, would support the government's aims to maintain a stable
macroeconomic framework over the short to medium term, including sustainable deficit and
debt levels.6 One of the CPS outcomes was to improve public expenditure management as
indicated by decreases in the target deficit and debt levels.

4.9      The evaluation finds the decision to provide a very large financing in an environment
of major macroeconomic risks without a macro and fiscal objective was a design weakness.
While strengthening the banking system was important for maintaining macro stability and
fiscal sustainability, other significant risks associated with policy choices could have
undermined the soundness of the macro framework. The fact that the public debt rose sharply
after program implementation confirms that the risks at program preparation were significant.
Mitigating measures in the policy contents in the operation were much needed. For
illustration, in 2015, public expenditures were around 48 percent of GDP instead of 38
percent as targeted by the government in 2012.The public debt to GDP ratio was at 66
percent in 2015 versus 48 percent as announced by the government in 2012, while public and
publicly guaranteed debt was close to 80 percent of GDP.

Choice of Instrument
4.10 As the country's financing needs were sizeable, the choice of the instrument allowed
the Bank to provide financing to Montenegro beyond a typical DPO and without exceeding
country exposure limits set by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development

(IBRD).7 This evaluation finds that the World Bank's strategic consideration to substantially
cover Montenegro's 2012 financing needs was the key motivation behind the choice. The use
of the instrument could have helped to reduce the borrowing costs.

4.11 Montenegro's eligibility for PBG on macro, debt, and financing at the time of
program preparation was assessed on the basis of external and public debt projections
presented in the program document.8 These calculations assumed a declining path for public
and external debt starting 2012 and a return to more sustainable debt level by 2015 (49 and
92 percent of GDP, respectively). The evaluation finds that the projections deviated
substantially from IMF's projections prepared in April for the 2011 Article IV and available
for the Bank before the operation's appraisal. The IMF expected a steep upward trajectory for
public and external debt because of the lack of credible measures for fiscal consolidation.
The Bank, in contrast, used the authorities' optimistic announcements on aggregate fiscal
parameters as a basis for assessing Montenegro's eligibility for a PBG. Figures 4.1 and 4.2
indicate the scope of divergence between projections as well as actual developments in
2012–2014.

4.12 The evaluation finds an optimistic bias in the World Bank’s projections of the debt
parameters underpinning the assessment of the borrower's compliance with PBG eligibility
criteria. The government's assurances on reversal of the trend in debt accumulation presented
in the letter of development policy were not supported by concrete fiscal measures. They
contrasted with IMF's assessment that both external debt and public debt would continue to
grow in the absence of a credible fiscal consolidation plan.

4.13 The guarantee’s program document does not discuss IMF's projections nor provide
explanations on the divergence in debt and fiscal projections9. As public and external debt
projections were critical in determining eligibility for a PBG according to the operational
framework governing the instrument at the time,10 the evaluation finds that the eligibility
assessment could have reached a different conclusion if the Bank had used the IMF's more
realistic projections.

4.14 The guarantee supported a €100 million commercial loan from Credit Suisse with an
interest rate of Euribor12 months plus 3.5 percent. The interest on the loan, at face value, was
substantially lower than the €150 million loan from Credit Suisse with partial collateral
contracted in April 2012. However, comparing the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported
financial instrument with market rates available to the borrower may not be enough for
assessing the extent of reduction in the borrowing costs associated with the guarantee
transaction as the interest rate of the guaranteed instrument by definition should be lower
than the rates of “clean” instruments without guarantees. A more comprehensive approach
would be to assess the change in market’s perceptions of sovereign risk as a result of the

underlying macroeconomic and structural policy program supported by Bank’s policy
lending. This could be done by estimating the implicit interest rate on non-guaranteed
component of the loan by isolating non-sovereign risk factors associated with the transaction
(IBRD risk, liquidity premium, etc). Although IEG does not look at these aspects for
performance evaluation purposes, this evaluation highlights the importance of developing an
approach to comprehensively assess the impact of PBGs on client’s borrowing terms.11

Policy Content and Results Framework Analysis
4.15 Analysis of the program’s policy content and results framework focuses on the links
between objectives, outcomes, and policy actions; the relevance and quality of policy actions;
and the choice of result indicators. There were strong links between prior actions, outcomes,
and objectives and satisfactory institutional depth and criticality of most prior actions. The
program included important actions for cementing the reforms under the first operation of
FSDPL, such as satisfactory progress with Prva Banka’s restructuring, the maintenance of
periodic systemic risk monitoring, and further strengthening of regulations on deposit
insurance and various bank regulations by the Central Bank. Most of the results indicators
were adequate in measuring the outcomes pursued by the program.

4.16 The guarantee’s policy matrix mimicked the planned second operation of FSDPL,
which was converted into the program under review. According to the original design of
FSDPL, most critical actions were planned and implemented under the first operation, while
the triggers for the second operation were less critical. The fact that under the first operation
the Bank disbursed €60 million while it was planning to disburse only €20 million under the

other PPARs.

second confirms that the policy content of the programmatic loan was substantially
frontloaded. This evaluation finds that the conversion of the second operation with relatively
less critical policy actions into a guarantee without strengthening the policy matrix was a lost
opportunity given the slow pace of reform implementation in some areas at the time of
program preparation.

5. Implementation
5.1      The PBG was converted from the envisaged second operation of FSDPL and, as such,
it utilized the implementation mechanisms that were in place for the first operation of
FSDPL. Therefore, both the Bank team and government counterparts had previous
experience in dealing with various aspects of World Bank programs, including working on
the policy matrix and monitoring the results. The Bank’s experience with PBGs in the region
was utilized during program implementation. Preparation and implementation of the
operation also required strong cooperation among various units of the Bank, including the
core PBG team, the Bank’s lead network—FPD (Finance and Private Sector Development
network), PRM (Poverty Reduction and Economic Management network), treasury, FINCR,
and the country team. The Ministry of Finance, as the implementing agency, played a
coordinating role. The Central Bank of Montenegro was closely involved.

5.2    The operation triggered no safeguards. No specific Poverty and Social Impact
Analysis was conducted for the operation, although the team provided an adequate
assessment of possible adverse social and distributional effects of the policies it supported.

6. Achievement of Objectives: Strengthening the Banking
System—Modest
6.1    IEG assessed the objective’s achievement based on outcomes outlined in the program.
On balance, its achievement was modest. The banking system recovered from the crisis, and
the number of banks increased due to the renewed interest of foreign investors in
Montenegro’s financial system. Market confidence has been restored, and total deposits have
surpassed the pre-crisis level. The Banks’ capital adequacy remained strong, but
nonperforming loans were brought down only to a limited extent. They still represent a major
problem constraining credit growth. Prva Banka was substantially downsized, but the
government’s deposits still represented a significant portion of its total deposits at the end of
2015. The decline in the share of deposits of public agencies in Prva Bank’s funding base
that was observed in 2011–2013 proved to be temporary. The Financial Stability Assessment
Program (FSAP) highlighted gaps in crisis management and compliance with the Basel Core
Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. In addition, some outcomes in the banking
system were attributable to the policy actions supported by FSDPL, underscoring limited
value added of the FSPBG.
                                               8


Outcome 1: Strengthening Systemic Risk Monitoring and the Crisis
Management Framework—Partially Achieved
6.2     This was one of the primary areas of the program’s focus. Strengthening of the
Central Bank’s capacities for crisis response and establishment of the Financial Stability
Council (FSC) through new laws introduced in 2010 were important stepping-stones in
strengthening Montenegro’s crisis preparedness. Development of the institutional framework
for risk monitoring and crisis management occurred in 2011 and 2012 with regular quarterly
meetings of the FSC.

6.3     The program’s focus was on developing systemic risk assessment methodology and
contingency crisis plans including draft legislation that would grant extraordinary powers to
the Central Bank and the government to provide emergency liquidity and capital during a
declared financial crisis (a prior action). The program also included more institutionalization
of the risk-monitoring framework by supporting FSC’s periodic monitoring and
macroprudential decisions (a prior action). As a result of these actions, the macroprudential
oversight and crisis management framework were expected to be enhanced in line with
international good practice, as appraised by the next financial FSAP update.

6.4     In addition to the FSAP, the evaluation draws on interviews with stakeholders,
including the Central Bank and IMF. The FSC has continued to meet regularly, which has
helped to sharpen the focus of the authorities on important financial sector issues. The FSC
has adopted the National Contingency Plan (NCP) to complement institution-specific
contingency plans. However, the FSAP highlights that the FSC does not always focus on
crisis preparedness and its management mandate. The key focus has been on its systemic
risk-monitoring mandate, while the progress toward the NCP’s implementation is rarely
discussed by the FSC. A system-wide crisis simulation exercise involving all FSC members
and the Deposit Protection Fund has not been conducted yet. According to the FSAP, none of
the oversight agencies have formal cross-border arrangements with home resolution
authorities, nor is a cross-border crisis management framework in place. In general, the 2016
FSAP assessed actions by the authorities toward establishing a systemic crisis management
framework and a strategy for emergency liquidity provision as only partly implemented.

Outcome 2: Addressing Banking Sector Vulnerabilities—Partially
Achieved
6.5    Under FSDPL, the World Bank helped the authorities supervise major banks and
develop supervisory action plans for troubled banks. Under FSPBG, these activities were
continued, and the supervisory plans were updated for 2012 based on the results of on-site
examinations, off-site monitoring, and stress-test results (a prior action). An improvement
was expected in the asset quality as evidenced by a decline in the ratio of NPLs from 20
percent in 2011 to 12 percent by the end of 2013. It was also expected that the capital
adequacy ratio of the banking system would remain at 15 percent or higher.

6.6    The Central Bank continued undertaking annual exercises to prepare and execute
supervisory action plans in selected banks after the program’s end. Improved regulatory
oversight, tightened credit practices, and positive growth in the economy have contributed to
                                                           9


an improvement in the asset quality of the banks. However, NPLs have declined less than
expected. At the end of 2015, they were at about 14.5 percent12 instead of 12 percent as
targeted by the program. Although the ratio of NPL declined substantially since their peak
level of 25 percent in mid-2011, the decline largely took place in 2011 and 2012. In that
period, the ratio of NPL was brought down to less than 18 percent through policy actions
undertaken by the Central Bank with the support of FSDPL.13

6.7     The limited decline in NPLs is partly explained by slow implementation of
restructuring based on voluntary debt repayment (the “Podgorica approach”) and a temporary
increase in NPL that took place as a result of the second recession in 2012. The law
supporting the voluntary debt repayment mechanism was approved in April 2015 and
provided tax incentives for participants. It primarily targets firms that are facing temporary
problems with debt repayment rather than solvency issues—it would not be a solution for all
NPLs. The banks transferred about €600 million of their assets to factoring companies in
2011–2012 that substantially helped to reduce the ratio of bad loans. The lack of
transparency and oversight of factoring companies, however, creates additional risks for the
financial system.

6.8     The ratio of NPL varies from 9 to 23 percent across individual banks, indicating
variability in the banks’ asset quality. The construction sector, which went through a boom
and bust cycle, remains a major source of NPLs. The banks that are more exposed to the
sector have a higher NPL ratio. Some observers noted that because of shortcomings in asset
quality reviews, the actual extent of poor quality assets might be somewhat bigger than
official data show.

6.9    The capital adequacy ratio, an outcome indicator for the program, was about 15
percent at the end of 2015, in line with the target value. This is a substantial improvement
compared to 12 percent in 2011. However, as with the decline in the share of NPL, this
improvement largely took place in 2011 and 2012 with the support of the FSDPL. This
underscores relatively little value added of the FSPBG in reducing banking system
vulnerabilities.

6.10 All banks were in compliance with the capital requirement provision. Entry of three
foreign banks in 2014–2015 strengthened the overall capital adequacy of the banking system.
Returns to assets, which were negative in 2008–2012, turned positive in 2013 and remained
so although still quite modest (0.27 percent as of Q3 of 2015). Although the average interest
rate of new loans was reduced from 10.8 percent in 2014 to 9.6 percent in 2015, the spreads
remain quite large, at around 7.5 percent.

Outcome 3: Restructuring Prva Banka—Partially Achieved
6.11 Prva Banka was the largest domestically owned bank and of systemic importance
before the crisis. The Bank suffered substantial shortage in capital and a loss in confidence
resulting in a very large deposit outflow. It was the only bank for which emergency support

                                               10


was needed. After stabilization, the authorities focused on restructuring and downsizing the
bank. The Central Bank developed a supervisory action plan whereby the central government
was expected to gradually remove its deposits from Prva Banka and maintain a capital
adequacy ratio of at least 12 percent (prior actions).

6.12 Prva Banka was considerably downsized in 2011–2012, becoming an average-sized
market player. In 2013–2015, there was no substantial increase in its assets and portfolio, and
the bank was in compliance with the Central Bank’s regulatory provisions. According to the
authorities, the bank does not have strategic ambitions to recapture its previous market share.
However, a reversal occurred in the positive trend of withdrawal of government deposits
from the bank. While government deposits dropped to €700,000 by 2013, this was reversed
in 2014. Deposits grew to €4 million in 2014 and to €19 million in 2015, which is around 7.5
percent of all deposits. For comparison, the government’s deposits before the program were
€18 million. The evaluation finds that although Prva Banka has become smaller and no
longer represents a source of financial sector instability, the authorities were not able to
ensure fully market base financing for the Bank.

Outcome 4: Enhancing the Depositor Protection Scheme—Achieved
6.13 The operation was focused on improving the standards of communication of the
Deposit Protection Fund (DPF) and developing detailed regulatory framework for deposit
insurance, including the coverage and payment mechanisms of guaranteed deposit payouts
(prior actions). These actions were based on important measures supported by the first
operation of the programmatic loan, including enactment of the Law on Protection of
Deposits, to develop a mechanism for ensuring a smooth transition from the blanket deposit
guarantee and enhance the financial resources of the DPF by allowing additional funding
sources in an emergency. It was expected that strengthening of the deposit protection scheme
would further contribute to market confidence in the banking system as measured by positive
growth in deposits and their return to a précises level.

6.14 A major recovery occurred in banking sector deposits, an outcome indicator
monitored for the program. By the end of 2013, total deposits reached €2.1 billion. By the
end of 2015, they stood at €2.6 billion, substantially higher than before the crisis. The
number of banks totaled 14 at the end of 2015, reflecting the entry of more banks. The
authorities have encouraged the entry of new banks to increase competition and reduce the
interest spread, which stood at 7.5 percent at the end of 2015.

Outcome 5: Improving the Regulatory Framework for Banks—Partially
Achieved
6.15 The focus here was to further implement the Standardized Basel II Approach by
adopting regulations on capital adequacy, the calculation of bank exposures, public
disclosure of information and data by banks, and on minimum standards for credit risk to
implement international financial reporting standards for the banking system (prior actions).
To improve the legislative framework for collateral and facilitate enhanced liquidity
management at financial institutions, the program also supported approval of the draft law on
financial collateral as a prior action. As a result of these measures, all banks were expected to
                                                           11


produce financial statements in line with international accounting standards as of 2014 (an
outcome indicator) and the supervision of the banking system would be fully in line with
Basel Core Principles (an outcome indicator). Adequate liquidity in the banking system also
was expected (an outcome indicator).

6.16 Available information at the time of the evaluation indicates that the Central Bank has
adopted key prudential measures, and the regulatory framework has been improved. All
banks were in compliance with IFRS standards in 2015. The liquidity ratio in the banking
system has been satisfactory, fluctuating between 26 and 32 percent in 2013–2015. At the
end of 2015, liquidity was 28.5 percent. The Law on Financial Collateral was approved by
parliament and enacted in August 2012.

6.17 With respect to the compliance with the Basel Corel Principles, the FSAP highlights
some major gaps. The implementation of the Central Bank’s prudential limits for related-
party transactions and large exposures remains weak. The Central Bank’s measurement of
exposures is not fully in line with Basel norms. The aggregate limit for all related-party
exposures is 200 percent of own funds, which is too high compared to 25 percent under the
Basel Core Principles. There are also significant gaps in the definitions of “related party” and
“related-party transactions.” Addressing concentration risks, including sector concentration
and concentration through collateral, remains weak.

 Outcome 6: Macroeconomic Developments in 2012–2015—Not Rated
6.18 With respect to overall economic performance, growth has been volatile since 2012.
The recession of 2.5 percent in 2012 was followed by a recovery in 2013 of 3.3 percent,
which slowed to below 2 percent in 2014. Implementation of large capital expenditures as
well as a more favorable external environment have pushed growth to an estimated 4 percent
in 2015, where it is expected to remain in the medium term given large public investment
projects. The largest project, the highway connecting the country’s major port to the border
with Serbia, will be implemented in next few years and will cost more than 20 percent of the
2014 GDP.

6.19 Budget deficits during 2013–2015 reflected large capital expenditures (figure 6.1).
The key concern is that the government did not prioritize its spending programs to create
fiscal space for a strategic highway project. Its implementation will further elevate the debt to
GDP ratio to about 80 percent by 2018. The extent of economic and financial returns from
the project and, respectively, the capacity to repay the debt in a fiscally neutral manner,
remain uncertain. If assumptions on expected highway traffic and revenues do not
materialize, the project will pose major long-term risk to fiscal sustainability. The launch of
the highway project in 2014 was the key reason behind the downgrade of Montenegro’s
credit rating by Standard & Poor’s in 2014.14

6.20 With respect to the overall fiscal stance, the government announced in 2015 its
intention of implementing fiscal consolidation in the medium term. This evaluation finds that
under current circumstances and in the absence of a strong fiscal responsibility framework,15
fiscal consolidation will be difficult to achieve.

7. Outcome Ratings
7.1     The overall outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory. It reflects substantial
relevance of the objective and modest relevance of design as well as modest achievements in
the objective to strengthen the banking system. Notwithstanding important steps taken to
strengthen the banking system of Montenegro, some of the important outcomes in reducing
banking system vulnerabilities are attributable to the initial reforms in 2010 and 2011
supported by FSDPL. The overall reform agenda, at the same time, remains incomplete. The
quality of the banking system’s assets has not improved as much as expected. The initial
gains in restructuring Prva Banka were partially reversed in 2014–2015. Although some
improvements are seen in the Central Bank’s supervision and risks management capacities,
the 2016 FSAP highlighted gaps in crisis management and compliance with Basel Core
Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. In addition,

7.2    Program’s outcome rating was also affected by IEG’s assessment of Bank’s choice of
PBG as an instrument for this intervention. The evaluation finds that macro and fiscal
assumptions underpinning the use of the instrument were not in line with realistic projections
available at program preparation. This shortcoming was augmented by the fact that the
conversion of the planned FSDL operation into a PBG was done without mitigating
macroeconomic risks. The program was a lost opportunity in terms of addressing important



15According to the Law on Budget and Fiscal Responsibility, if public debt exceeds 60 percent of GDP, the government
should introduce a five-year plan to bring it below 60 percent.
                                              13


macro and fiscal challenges that the country was facing to ensure fiscal sustainability and
avoid large debt accumulation.

Risks to Development Outcomes
7.3    The risks to development outcomes are rated significant.

7.4     In the years after the economic and banking sector crisis, Montenegro has
strengthened its capacities to monitor financial sector risks and supervise the banks. The
authorities learned a lesson from the recent boom and bust cycle and, on balance, are better
prepared to withstand possible shocks through systemic risk monitoring. Possible build-up of
excesses in the banking system is less likely than in the past. Prva Banka, the main source of
concern in 2008–2011, was significantly downsized and poses no systemic risks.

7.5     Having said that, the risks to the banking system remain significant. This evaluation
highlights that banking system transparency remains a concern. Gaps still exist in banking
sector reporting, including lack of comprehensive reporting on loan provision and quarterly
reporting. Valuation of collateral also requires more transparency. Asset quality assessment
can be enhanced by external asset reviews— especially important given the relatively high
ratio of nonperforming loans.

7.6    Risks remain from large nonperforming loans transferred to factoring companies that
may still affect the functionality of the overall financial system. Currently there is no
oversight over factoring companies that generates potentials risks. With respect to Prva
Banka, in spite of substantial achievements, the Government continues to provide nonmarket
financing to the bank through the deposits of public agencies.

7.7     Risks also remain to the development outcome because of macro and fiscal effects on
the banking system as the result of possible economic volatility in the long term. The
momentum from the fiscal consolidation of 2011 and 2012 was lost, creating slow
expenditure reforms in critical areas such as pensions and public wages. Fiscal position was
further weakened by large infrastructure projects. These factors contributed to a substantial
increase in public debt to about 66 percent of GDP at the end of 2015 compared to about 50
percent as projected by the Bank and the government. Possible pro-cyclical fiscal stance may
exacerbate the risks to the banking system through the potential of amplifying the business
cycle.

World Bank’s Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY—MODERATELY UNSATISFACTORY

7.8     The operation was prepared against the background of a tense fiscal situation in 2012.
Authorities were facing a large financing gap from the second wave of recession and
expected debt repayments. To respond to Montenegro’s large financing requirement, the
second operation of FSDPL under preparation was converted into a PBG. Its indicative
triggers that were mostly achieved by the time of the conversion were used as prior actions
for the guarantee. By doing this, the Bank made a substantial amount of financing available
                                                14


to Montenegro to help address its larger than expected external financing gap amid
heightened macro risks. The Bank’s financing was particularly important as the envisaged
IMF program did not materialize because of diverging views on the scope of required fiscal
consolidation. This evaluation finds that given the borrowing costs in the markets, providing
additional financing to Montenegro was justified.

7.9     The main shortcoming in the Bank’s performance was using macro and fiscal
projections that were not credible and not in line with more realistic IMF projections to
justify Montenegro’s eligibility for the guarantee instrument. The Bank should have payed
closer attention to macro and fiscal issues especially in light of the inability of authorities to
negotiate a program with the IMF to address elevated fiscal sustainability risks.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION—SATISFACTORY

7.10 Supervision was a proactive process that involved monitoring progress in banking
sector reforms and overall economic development as well as technical support throughout
program implementation in 2012 and 2013. This was mostly done through FINSAC by
developing the Podgorica approach for resolving NPLs. The Bank worked closely with both
the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Program supervision coincided with the
preparatory stage of the planned budget support operation on fiscal consolidation, which did
not materialize. The Bank team provided input to that process based on knowledge generated
through the guarantee’s preparation and implementation.

7.11    Overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Borrower’s Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE—MODERATELY UNSATISFACTORY

7.12 The government demonstrated overall strong ownership of the reforms to strengthen
the banking system. With the support from international partners, including the World Bank,
it developed a credible reform program for the financial sector to address many sources of
vulnerabilities and improve crisis preparedness. Most critical actions were implemented with
the support of the first operation of FSDPL. The actions planned by the government for the
second operation and implemented under the guarantee further helped to strengthen the
banking system, especially with respect to developing capacities for systemic risks
management and banking supervision.

7.13 Despite these strengths, issues remained that authorities could have addressed more
proactively to improve the reform’s outcome. In particular, slow NPL resolution and re-
accumulation of the government’s deposits in Prva Banka ran against the spirit of the
reforms. Transparency in the banking system remains an issue. Impediments to developing
the mortgage market, such as the Consumer Bankruptcy Law complicating the use of
collateral, have not been addressed. In addition, the government has recently initiated a
lending rate cap aimed at reducing the spread through a draft law submitted to the Cabinet in
late 2015, which may be counterproductive for financial system development. The FSAP
                                               15


initially planned in 2013–2014 was conducted at the end of 2015 and finalized in 2016,
which is a shortcoming because of the importance of independent diagnostics.

7.14 The borrower’s performance was also affected by the shortcomings in macro and
fiscal management that created risks to fiscal sustainability with possible implications for
overall economic performance and soundness of the banking system. Because of the lack of
fiscal consolidation and introduction of large infrastructure projects with uncertain economic
and financial implications, the debt to GDP ratio reached 66 percent in 2015 while public
debt that includes loan guarantees reached 80 percent of GDP. It is expected to approach 80
percent over the next few years. Although Montenegro needs to upgrade its highway
infrastructure to improve connectivity, the decisions have not been based on fiscal
sustainability criteria. Political will to address key fiscal challenges and generate fiscal space
for strategic projects through measures to reform entitlement programs and public
employment, and to expand the tax base is weak. Fiscal challenges prevented authorities
from developing a program with IMF in early 2012 and securing a DPO with the Bank in late
2012. An improved external environment since then has masked risks to market access, debt
refinancing, and the cost of debt service, but they may materialize if the trends of 2013–2015
reverse.

7.15   Implementing agency performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

7.16   Overall Borrower’s Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation—Modest
DESIGN

7.17 The indicators selected for progress monitoring were linked to policy actions and
were generally measurable and quantitative. Most results indicators were outcome oriented
and were largely adequate for capturing the effects of policy actions. The target values
established for the results indicators were adequate for the stated ambition of the program.
The monitoring and evaluation framework drew on an update of the FSAP that was expected
to occur in 2013–2014 but happened in 2016.

IMPLEMENTATION

7.18 The Ministry of Finance coordinated data collection and reporting. The choice of
indicators allowed most of them to be updated with more recent data at the time of the
evaluation to assess the sustainability of achieved results. Non-implementation of FSAP in a
timely manner affected the quality of the program’s monitoring and evaluation.

UTILIZATION

7.19 No utilization was reported in the Implementation Completion and Results Report.
The evaluation highlights that most indicators continued to be monitored as proxies of
financial system stability after program completion.

8. Lessons
     PBGs can potentially be a useful instrument for supporting countries facing large
      external financing needs.

     PBGs implemented in a context of challenging macro-fiscal situation and large
      financing needs need to incorporate a consistent macro-economic framework with
      necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation.

     The choice of a PBG as an instrument should be based on robust macro and fiscal
      projections indicating that financing framework is sustainable and macro risks are
      mitigated. Montenegro’s case indicates that eligibility for a PBG cannot be decided
      based on general announcements by the government that lack details. The case
      highlights once again the criticality of Bank-Fund cooperation.

     Comparing the aggregate interest rate of PBG-supported debt instruments with
      counterfactual market rates may not be enough for assessing the extent of reduction in
      the borrowing costs associated with the transaction. Estimating the change in
      sovereign risk perceptions, although a challenging task, may give more accurate
      assessment of the impact of the program.
