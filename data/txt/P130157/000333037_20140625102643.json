Policy\n            Based Guarantee Project (FSPBG) for Montenegro were as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is important\n            to maintain sufficient flexibility, particularly in the case\n            of the envisaged programmatic policy development loans, so\n            as to adapt and respond to client needs and economic\n            realities in the country. As the external environment was\n            rather negative during the FSPBG preparation phase, adding a\n            strong sense of urgency to the need to adopt financial\n            sector related reforms, the team built sufficient ownership\n            of the many policy and regulatory changes. The conversion of\n            the second DPL to a PBG, which significantly leveraged the\n            Bank's lending, was a direct result of the Montenegrin\n            2012 financing gap, as the prior actions were not\n            significantly different. During the Eurozone financial\n            crises, it proved crucial that this operation narrowly\n            focused on key areas for good outcomes. The proposed\n            operation incorporates this lesson by focusing on a main\n            challenge recognized by the Government, namely, addressing\n            vulnerabilities in the banking sector and making the banking\n            sector more resilient to cope with possible future shocks.\n            Public understandings of key financial stability measures\n            adopted were substantially improved through a carefully\n            planned and implemented communication strategy by the\n            Government and the Bank. The staff of the World Bank Country\n            Office in Podgorica played a crucial role in this regard by\n            ensuring consistent and timely communication with key\n            stakeholders. The Bank also kept civil society and the\n            general public informed of its position on critical issues\n            through interviews to national media and press releases."}, "docdt": "2014-05-08T00:00:00Z"}
