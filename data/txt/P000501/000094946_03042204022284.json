Lessons show that\n            adapting an effective, agricultural extension management\n            system to the conditions of the country, substantially\n            exceed the high costs involved in establishing and modifying\n            extension management, as based on the increased\n            productivity. Whereas support by adaptive and participative\n            agricultural research is necessary, initially though, the\n            best practices of existing traditional known technology, may\n            well provide the adequate training material, tested on\n            farmers' fields, further allowing substantial\n            productivity, and income improvements. Although the cotton\n            sector was not specifically included in the project, an\n            important lesson drawn from the project suggests that\n            specific measures could have been taken to support a sector\n            as critical as cotton is in Chad, following the decline of\n            cotton prices. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and\n            bilateral agencies can be effective implementation agencies\n            for special types of components, though not necessarily less\n            expensive than Government agencies. To this end, the high\n            administrative, and operational costs absorbed by NGOs,\n            require that measures be developed to reduce costs. The use\n            of producer organizations as a basis for village\n            investments, provide benefits beyond those strictly\n            economic: provides a forum to fight HIV/AIDS; promotes the\n            position of women; and, improves communal, environmental understanding."}, "docdt": "2003-04-07T00:00:00Z"}
