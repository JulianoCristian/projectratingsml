an environmentally\n            sustainable manner, to improve producers' incomes, and\n            to rationalize the use of public resources in support of\n            rural services. The specific objectives of the project are\n            to: 1) reshape extension into an effective service\n            addressing farmer's needs for improved crop and\n            livestock production as well as for natural resources\n            management; 2) strengthen linkages between extension and\n            research focusing on participatory and adaptive research;\n            and 3) strengthen and build up producer's\n            organizations. The components of the project are as follows:\n            1) extension service activities which will progressively\n            cover the country's fourteen \"prefectures\",\n            for crop and livestock production, and natural resource\n            management; 2) the establishment of a minimum research\n            capacity, through collaboration among researchers, producers\n            and extension agents, to develop, test and promote improved\n            production practices and technologies; and 3) the\n            enhancement of the capacity of producers'\n            organizations, through training and technical assistance, to\n            carry out group activities such as crop and produce\n            marketing, management and distribution of farm inputs,\n            maintenance of agricultural equipment and basic animal\n            health care."}, "docdt": "1995-02-17T00:00:00Z"}
