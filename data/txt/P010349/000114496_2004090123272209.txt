documents and other evidence.
4.   For each payment made by PARC or the concerned Province, as
the case may be, out of a Special Account, PARC or the concerned
Province, as the case may be, shall, at such time as the Association
shall reasonably request,  furnish to the Association such documents
and other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3  of this
Schedule, the Association shall not be required to make further
deposits into a Special Account:
     (a)  if, at any time, the Association shall have determined
that all  further withdrawals should be made by PARC or the
concerned Province, as the case may be, directly from the Credit
Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of the
General Conditions and paragraph (a)  of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
     (b)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Credit
allocated to the eligible Categories for the parts of the Project
for which PARC or the concerned Province, as the case may be, is
responsible, less the amount of any outstanding special commitment
entered into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the
General Conditions with respect to such parts of the Project, shall
equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the relevant Authorized
Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Credit Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Credit allocated to the eligible
Categories for such parts of the Project shall follow such proce-
dures as the Association shall specify by notice to PARC or the
concerned Province, as the case may be. Such further withdrawals
shall be made only after and to the extent that the Association
shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in such Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Association shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of a Special Account: (i) was made for an
Page  15
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph 2 of
this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished
to the Association, PARC or the concerned Province, as the case may
be, shall, promptly upon notice from the Association: (A)  provide
such additional evidence as the Association may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Association shall so
request,  refund to the Association) an amount equal to the amount
of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or justified.
Unless the Association shall otherwise agree,  no further deposit by
the Association into the  Special Account shall be made until PARC
or the concerned Province, as the case may be, has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
     (b)  If the Association shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in a Special Account will not be
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, PARC
or the concerned Province,  as the case may be,  shall, promptly
upon notice from the Association, refund to the Association such
outstanding amount.
     (c)  PARC or the concerned Province, as the case may be, may,
upon notice to the Association, refund to the Association all or any
portion of the funds on deposit in a Special Account.
     (d)  Refunds to the Association made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Credit
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance
with the relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the
General Conditions.
