The key lessons learned are: a)\n            Over-ambitious project design and objectives should be\n            avoided. b) An implementation timetable should take into\n            account the administrative realities of the processes for\n            appointing key project staff, mobilizing counterpart funds,\n            and initiating activities with long lead times and the major\n            deficiencies in Government administrative and financial\n            systems. c) Where institutional change is needed, it is\n            essential to evaluate the options of either 1) creating new\n            bodies, regulations, and administrative procedures; or 2)\n            providing resources and human skills required to enable\n            staff to function better within the existing structure. d)\n            It is essential that designated individuals be given\n            responsibility for the management of the project and each of\n            its major components, and that they retain these positions\n            throughout the project in order to achieve commitment,\n            vision, and managerial stability. e) The Bank should be less\n            compromising and terminate projects or components of a\n            project when there is a persistent unsatisfactory performance."}, "docdt": "1998-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
