It concentrates on provincial research services,\n            reorganizing them to introduce more autonomy and flexibility\n            into staff and financial administration, and basing staff\n            promotion on merit and research achievements.  It: 1)\n            establishes the structures and procedures for research\n            planning, prioritizing, resource allocation, programming,\n            monitoring and evaluation; 2) assists the provinces to\n            prepare long-term Provincial Research Master Plans during\n            the project's first two years; 3) finances priority\n            research programs in horticulture, livestock, soil science,\n            integrated pest management and social sciences which the\n            Government has identified as areas of research to support\n            national development objectives; 4) provides research funds\n            for identified provincial priority research; and 5) provides\n            training to upgrade research scientists' skills and\n            efficiency, allowing their movement into priority areas for\n            research, and technical assistance to help with project implementation."}, "docdt": "1990-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
