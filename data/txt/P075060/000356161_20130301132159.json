lessons learned in India\n            (volume one) and to use those lessons and other experiences\n            globally, to serve as a guidance tool-kit for task managers\n            and program officers in the health-care sector (volume two).\n            The aim of the first part is to demonstrate practical and\n            feasible responses to the challenges faced while\n            implementing and improving environmental management. It is\n            hoped that the experience summarized here will enhance\n            understanding of the importance of core environmental\n            management and thus support the planning, budgeting and\n            monitoring of environment management activities in the\n            context of an inter-sectoral, integrated and coordinated\n            operational approach. Volume one of this report titled\n            'Mainstreaming Environmental Management in the\n            Health-Care Sector-Implementing Experience in India'\n            provides a detailed analysis of the challenges and practical\n            lessons learnt in implementing the basic standards of\n            infection control and health care waste management in the\n            health care sector of the second most populous country in\n            the world. It provides recommendations for improving the\n            existing systems and also for mainstreaming and scaling-up\n            the larger set of environmental management issues, including\n            water, sanitation and solid waste management, through an\n            integrated and inter-sectoral approach. Volume two of the\n            report-'Tool-kit for Managers' provides references\n            and synopses of national and international guidelines on key\n            technical issues, operational and cost parameters. It sets\n            out relevant national laws and regulations and also the\n            associated World Bank safeguard operational policies, along\n            with sample monitoring and supervision templates and\n            guidance on technology and construction management."}, "docdt": "2012-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
