                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project support to the RCH II program of the Government of India was restructured in May 2010 and the project closing date extended until March 31, 2012. The restructuring
                         entailed (i) a reallocation of credit proceeds; (ii) setting disbursements against polio operating costs based on the number of children immunized at standard unit costs; (iii) a revised
                         results framework. The program has seen some positive outcomes, measured by the mid-line household surveys and coverage evaluation surveys in terms of increased access to
                         deliveries by skilled birth attendants, children fully immunized, increased access to family planning and a moderate increase in breast feeding. However, concerns remain about the
                         quality of care in delivery of RCH services and the near stagnant rates for the use of Oral Rehydration Solution in management of diarrhea.

                         Several initiatives have been recently launched under the project to increase access to quality RCH services, including: (i) identification of 264 high focus districts with poor health
                         outcomes; (ii) plan for strengthening program management and supportive supervision in these districts; (iii) preparing district specific plans for the high focus districts addressing all

                         key inputs and processes; (iv) completion of first round of central level procurement of drugs and supplies and initiation of the second round of central procurement; and (v) continued
                         strengthening of financial management systems. Further improvement is required in the areas of: (i) training functions of states, especially skill based training; (ii) improving quality
                         assurance of delivery of RCH services; and (iii) timely availability of household survey data to measure end line program outcomes.
