                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project supports the RCH II program of the Government of India, which is also supported by other development partners. The program has made progress towards key
                         outcomes as measured by the mid-line household surveys and coverage evaluation surveys in terms of increased access to deliveries by skilled birth attendants, children fully
                         immunized, increased access to family planning and a moderate increase in breast feeding. However, concerns remain about the quality of care in delivery of RCH services and the
                         near stagnant rates for the use of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) in management of diarrhea.

                         The MOHFW is continuing to take actions to increase access to quality RCH services, including: (i) identification of 264 high focus districts with poor health outcomes and

                         strengthening program management and supportive supervision in these districts; (ii) preparing district specific plans for the high focus districts addressing all key inputs and

                         continued strengthening of financial management systems; and, (v) planning and implementing a scheme to support "zero cost" deliveries at facilities for pregnant women. Further
                         improvement is required in the areas of: (i) training functions of states, especially skill based training; (ii) improving quality assurance of delivery of RCH services in facilities; and (iii)
                         timely availability of household survey data to measure end line program outcomes.
