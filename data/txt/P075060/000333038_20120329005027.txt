A. SUMMARY

  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) has requested, through the
  Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), a re-allocation among expenditure categories. The
  reallocation would provide additional funds for category 1(b) required to support a larger
  share of financing for State level eligible expenditures based on 2010-11 audited
  expenditures. This will involve reallocating undisbursed balances from categories 1(a)
  (central procurement); 2 (polio eradication activities); 3 (procurement agents fees) and 4
  (governance accountability action plan), which total SDR 50,355,000 to category 1(b) other
  Eligible RCH II Project Activities. This reallocation will enable MOHFW to fully utilize the
  IDA credit against eligible program expenditures.


B. PROJECT STATUS

  Over the past year, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) has concentrated
  on actions to improve access to quality RCH services, resulting in improved impact in the
  following areas: (i) under the conditional cash transfer scheme of the Janani Suraksha Yojana
  (JSY) more than 11 million women delivered in institutions in 2010-2011; (ii) field visits
  indicate that essential maternal health drugs are now available in the system; (iii) the quality
  of data in the web-based Health Management Information System (HMIS) and the Maternal
  Child Tracking System (MCTS) has shown steady improvement; (iv) the state Program
  Implementation Plans (PIPs) and annual budgets demonstrate a stronger focus on reaching
  vulnerable groups, with some variations in approach; (v) State/District Programme
  Management Units have been set up in all states, are involved in the day to day management
  of the program and have greatly enhanced the efficiency of implementation; (vi) there are
  systematic district planning processes in place in most states, with continuous progress in the
  quality and number of District Health Action Plans which have increased from 284 in 2006-
  07, to 636/640 in 2011; (vii) the establishment of a system of quarterly financial reporting
  has led to improvements in the timeliness of financial reporting by states; (viii) program
  management has been strengthened and the Bank team has provided supportive supervision
  in 264 high focus districts with poor health outcomes; (ix) Quality Assurance Committees
  (QACs) at state and district level have been strengthened to improve quality of RCH
  services; and (x) a scheme to support "zero cost" deliveries at facilities for pregnant women
  using a results based financing approach was designed and implemented.

  This project is rated Moderately Satisfactory for both the Project Development Objective and
  Implementation Progress.
