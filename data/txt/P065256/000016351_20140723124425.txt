F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (PDO)

Project Appraisal Document (PAD): The development objective of the National Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Project (PRONASAR) is to increase the sustainable use of new and
rehabilitated water supply and sanitation facilities in rural areas and small towns while
emphasizing improvement in hygiene practices and training in operation and maintenance.2

Loan Agreement: The objective of the Project is to increase the sustainable use of water supply
and sanitation facilities in rural areas and small towns in the territory of the Borrower while
emphasizing improvement in hygiene practices and training in operation and maintenance.3

There is some difference in wording of the objective in the PAD and the Loan Agreement. The
words “new and rehabilitated” were not included and “in the territory of the Borrower” was
added in the loan agreement for the Additional Financing in December 2010. However, this
difference in wording does not change the essence of the project or how the project is being
assessed. The objectives stated in the loan agreement will form the basis of the evaluation.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN


1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Low water and sanitation coverage in rural areas. When the project was approved in
2002, Peru's total population was estimated at 26.3 million of which approximately 34% lived in
rural areas defined as population centers with less than 2,000 people.4 About 62% of Peru's rural
population had adequate water supply services, defined as access to either piped systems feeding
household connections, yard taps or public standposts or to point sources such as wells.
Approximately 30% of Peru's rural population has access to either on-site or (occasionally) piped
sanitation systems.

2.      Rapid increase in investments in the rural WSS sector in the 1990s but lack of
sustainability. Between 1992 and 1997 total investments in the rural WSS sector increased
from US$15 to US$88 million, mostly through the National Fund of Cooperation for
Development (Fondo Nacional de Cooperación para el Desarrollo-FONCODES) and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), but decreased significantly by the beginning of this decade
due to the closing of external loans and FONCODES’ loss of prominence. FONCODES
represented more than 75 percent of all rural WSS investments between 1992 and 2000, and they
reported to have built, improved and/or rehabilitated approximately 13,000 rural WSS systems.
However, baseline studies carried out in 2002 as part of the preparation of the Original Project
showed that around 80 percent of existing rural WSS systems (including those which had been
recently built) required additional investments for rehabilitation and 20 percent were not
operational, indicating a significant lack of sustainability of investments.

3.      PRONASAR as a response to sector challenges. Aside from poor sustainability of
rural water systems, Peru faced a number of other key sector challenges as it sought to
consolidate and expand upon the progress of the past decade: (a) lack of sector policy; (b) no
provision for investment in rehabilitation and expansion; and (c) no long-term technical
assistance to rural communities. It was within this context that the Government of Peru
requested a loan to finance the National Rural Water and Sanitation Project or PRONASAR
(Proyecto Nacional de Agua y Saneamiento), which aimed to address the key sector challenges
mentioned above. The project would introduce a paradigm shift in the concept of implementing
rural water supply systems where the construction is only a small part of the project cycle in
which training in operation and maintenance (O&M) and changes in hygiene habits would be
given a much longer timeframe to be internalized by beneficiaries than had previously been the
case. At the core of PRONASAR was the demand-responsive approach where the users
determined if they wanted to participate and selected their preferred level of service based on
their willingness-to-pay and assumed long-term responsibility for managing the WSS services.

4.      Importance of decentralization in increasing sustainability of rural WSS services.
The emphasis on the role of district municipalities in planning, monitoring of performance, and
provision of long-term technical assistance to communities was also a core element of the
project. The project aimed to contribute to the ongoing decentralization process in Peru which
began in the late 1990s.

5.      The Original Project was identified in the Peru Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of
1997 as a means to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction through the expansion
of sustainable services in rural areas.5

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.     The development objective of PRONASAR was to increase the sustainable use of new
and rehabilitated water supply and sanitation facilities in rural areas and small towns while
emphasizing improvement in hygiene practices and training in operation and maintenance. The
key indicators to measure the achievement of the PDOs are outlined in the table below:

Project Development Objectives                 Outcome/Impact Indicators
Increase the sustainable use of WSS             Number of people with access to improved water and/or
facilities in rural areas and small towns        sanitation service; 850,000

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

7.     Although the PDO did not change during the entire life of the project, the wording of the
PDO was changed, as mentioned in Section H. The words “new and rehabilitated” (referring to
water and sanitation facilities) were taken out in later documents, such as in the AF approved in
2006. In addition, key performance indicators were modified during project restructuring in
20106 to reflect the achievable goals within the remaining implementation time and budget, as
outlined in the table below.

8.      In assessing the project, the ICR uses these revised indicators as well as some additional
indicators measured in the Impact Evaluation of PRONASAR. The indicators changed in 2010
when the AF was approved, but not in a drastic manner. For instance, instead of the indicator
being the “number of water systems providing adequate service at community level; 2,500
rehabilitated and 450 new ones”, as stated in the PAD, it became the “number of communities
under Component 1 with systems providing continuous services for at least 12 hours per day,
thus adding more specificity to the definition of “adequate service”.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.      At appraisal, the project aimed to support the implementation of a demand-responsive
and sustainable basic water and/or sanitation services project for approximately 850,000 people
in 2,950 rural communities through the construction and rehabilitation of water points, piped
systems and sanitation facilities as well as training, operation and management of water and
sanitation facilities and extensive hygiene education. Other beneficiaries included 400 municipal
governments which were expected to provide technical assistance to the communities to manage
their system better and the Vice Ministry of Sanitation (VMS), expected to oversee sector
performance. More specifically, it was one of the four main divisions of the VMS, the General
Directorate of Sanitation (Dirección General de Saneamiento Rural – DGSR), which was one of
the main intended beneficiaries. In addition, project benefits defined at appraisal included the
temporary and permanent employment generated by the various activities of the project through
construction jobs (mainly masons and unskilled labor) as well as water system operators and
health promoters.

                                                   4
10.     The number of main beneficiaries changed over the course of the project and at the time
of the approval of an Additional Financing (AF) in 2010, which supported a cost-overrun7. The
target of the number of direct beneficiaries with access to improved water sources was revised
downwards from 685,000 in 2006 to 256,400 and beneficiaries with access to sanitation services
in rural areas was revised from 616,500 to 242,700 within the same period.8 The drastic
decrease in the number of beneficiaries is a result of cost overruns explained in Section 1.7.

11.     The project consisted of the following four components:

12.    Component 1: Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, Training and Hygiene Education.
Component 1 comprised of two sub-components, rehabilitation of existing systems and
construction of new ones, under the responsibility of FONCODES as the implementation agency.
This component aimed to build on the past experience of FONCODES in building infrastructure
(“hardware”) and improve on it by emphasizing “software” - the technical assistance to the
communities, establishing new and strengthening existing water user associations (Junta
Administradora de Servicios de Saneamiento – JASS) and district municipalities through regional
operators (RO) and social operators (SO) to be hired by FONCODES.

13.     Component 2: Water Supply and Sanitation in Small Towns. Under this component the
project provided both: (i) technical assistance to district municipalities interested in delegating
service provision to private operators or autonomous entities (cooperatives, municipal companies
etc.); and (ii) water supply system investment finance for district municipalities that have signed
delegation contracts. Component 2 had been designed as a follow-up to a pilot project to be
implemented by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)9 with CIDA funds (about US$4
million) in 8 municipalities.

14.     Component 3: Capacity Building. Under this component, consultants were hired to
strengthen the DGSR in its role as sector leader (e.g. by preparing policy and sector studies),
train its staff to assume their assigned functions, finance the training, orientation and
accreditation of the project's implementing agencies (including municipalities, regional
operators, NGOs, contractors, artisans, etc.), carry out pilot studies on source protection and the
implementation of the environmental guidelines, etc.

15.     Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision. This
component financed the activities of the Project Management Unit (PMU), including equipment
& software, contractual staff, external audits, the set-up and maintenance of financial
management and project monitoring & evaluation (M&E) systems, vehicles for the FONCODES
field offices, as well as special consultancies.

  The targets in 2006 are revised values which were defined during the restructuring in the same year. The expected
number of beneficiaries at appraisal was 850,000 for improved water and/or sanitation services, as defined in the
Project Description Section and Annex 1: Project Design Summary in the PAD (Report Number 24173).

  The pilot project was implemented by the Lima office WSP, a World Bank-executed international partnership to
help the poor gain sustained access to water and sanitation services.

1.5 Revised Components

16.    The components of the project at appraisal were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes

17.     In 2006, the Project was restructured mainly to address issues related to the inability of
FONCODES – originally the main implementing agency of Component 1 – to change its
methodology and implement the Project’s designed demand-driven and participatory approach to
building rural WSS systems. Under this Level 2 restructuring, the implementation responsibility
was consolidated under the Project Management Unit within PRONASAR (UGP-PRONASAR)
operating within the Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation. The restructuring also
included a reallocation of funds between components and a review of project indicators, though
the Project’s development objectives and components remained unchanged. While the
components remained unchanged, targets were revised, as mentioned in Section 1.4 above. The
Project restructuring, with an amendment and restatement of the Loan Agreement, was signed on

18.      In November 2008, a second restructuring for Loan No. 7142-PE was approved to extend
the original Loan closing date to December 31, 2010 in order to address delays in
implementation due to problems encountered in the calls for bids and the lengthy administrative
process involved in implementing each of the sub-projects (defined as a project that entailed
either construction or rehabilitation of a new system and/or construction of a basic sanitation
facility, coupled with social mobilization and support) in the communities.

19.    In 2010, a third restructuring for Loan No. 7142-PE was approved in order to support the
implementation of the AF in the amount of US$ 30 million (Loan 7978-PE). The AF was
approved to complement the original loan and help address the shortage of funds which emerged
due to cost overruns from: (i) underestimation of original costs at appraisal; (ii) changes in
implementation approach; and (iii) inflation and the impact of the increase in the value of the
Peruvian Sol given the implementation delays.10 First, the lower original costs at the time of
preparation were largely based on similar experiences implemented by NGOs at a small scale in
Peru, which were not representative of the national market and of the full scope of
implementation of project activities. Second, the changes in implementation approach for
Component 1 had cost implications since the transfer of responsibility of implementation of this
component from FONCODES to the Project Management Unit (Unidad de Gestión del Proyecto
- UGP-PRONASAR) resulted in additional direct supervision costs. Instead of the FONCODES
teams carrying out the construction works, UGP-PRONASAR had to contract firms to monitor
the work of the construction firms. Another change in implementation approach included the
expansion of the technology options for sanitation from dry pit latrines to pour flush latrines and
ecological toilets. These first two factors alone accounted for 80% of the cost increase. Third,
accumulated inflation of about 16% led to a US$13.8 million increase in project costs and the
appreciation of the Peruvian sol led to a decrease of US$8.5 million in available resources.

  See Annex 3 of the project paper for Additional Financing in 2010 (Report Number 56770-PE) for a
comprehensive analysis of the cost overrun.
                                                6
20.    To allow for the execution of the planned activities financed by the AF and complete the
implementation of the Original Project, the closing date was extended to December 31, 2013.
The financing per component is shown in the table in Annex 1.

21.     Finally, in 2013, a fourth restructuring occurred due to Government policy changes which
resulted in the Project design no longer being aligned with the Government’s policies in the rural
water sector. In 2012, Government sector policy orientation changed following the creation of
the National Rural Water and Sanitation Program (Programa Nacional de Saneamiento Rural –
PNSR). The newly established PNSR abandoned some key PRONASAR principles aimed at
sustainability, including the community demand-responsive approach and community
contribution towards capital cost as these principles were perceived as limiting inclusiveness
(based on the argument that only communities able to contribute in cash or in labor could benefit
from water and sanitation services, thereby excluding the poorest communities and also delaying
progress in construction of systems).11

22.     This last restructuring consisted of: (i) Advancing the closing of the Project (Loan No.
7142 and Loan No. 7978) six months earlier, from December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2013, to allow
all rural water and sanitation interventions in Peru to be aligned with the strategy of the National
Rural Sanitation Program; and ii) Modifying the financing percentages for Loan No. 7978 to
fully utilize the loan funds before the new closing date. The Government committed to finance
any remaining works and activities until finalization with own resources after the project’s new
closing date.


2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

23.     Solid background analysis at preparation stage. The project preparation process
benefitted from solid background analyses prepared by the Project Preparation Unit as well as
from previous studies by WSP and other organizations. These studies, which looked at a sample
of 66 water supply schemes in rural areas, showed that only 28.8 percent of the services in the
communities visited were categorized as “sustainable”; 57.6 percent were in a state of slight
deterioration; 10.6 percent in serious deterioration; and 3 percent had collapsed. Key factors for
lack of sustainability in the systems include lack of community participation in the decision-
making process and the lack of capacity of the communities in managing and maintaining them
due partly to the lack of household contribution to cover costs.

24.   In addition, the project design incorporated lessons from the FONCODES model of
implementing rural water supply systems. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as

11
   The co-financing arrangements under Component 1 of PRONASAR were: (i) new systems - The project financed
70-80 percent of total project costs and the municipality and community financed the rest. The municipality was
expected to contribute 10-20 percent in cash while the community was expected to contribute 10 percent of total
project costs through unskilled labor participation; and (ii) rehabilitated systems - The project financed 60 percent of
total project cost while the municipality and community financed the remaining 40 percent. The community was
expected to provide 100 percent of the required unskilled labor.
                                                           7
CARE and Caritas, which were already implementing projects similar to those proposed under
PRONASAR organized several stakeholder meetings in order to further scale up best practices
from their work and inform the project. The project design also leveraged lessons from a small
town pilot project financed by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and
implemented by WSP. Furthermore, the lessons from the Bank’s Operation Evaluation
Department report published in 2000 (“Rural Water Projects: Lessons from OED Evaluation”)
fed into the design, highlighting the need for a strong local organization capable of maintaining
water points or piped systems, the importance of institutional development and the need for
offering different levels of service.

25.     Project design was innovative and significant for sector advancement. The
objectives and components were clear, significant, and responsive to development priorities
since they sought to address key sector challenges such as sustainability and weak capacity at
different levels, particularly the communities and municipalities. Innovations in approaches also
characterized the initial project design such as: (i) the shift from a supply-driven approach, which
was the prevalent mode of implementation of rural water supply and sanitation sub-projects, to
community-driven demand-responsive approach; (ii) introduction of co-financing by the
municipalities and communities; (iii) introduction of the concept of Regional Operators to be
contracted to provide support for community mobilization and organization, engineering design
and education activities in project communities; and (iv) piloting of alternative models of
delegated management in small town water supply and sanitation, which included local private
sector participation (“Specialized Operator”).

26.     Realistic objectives, but overambitious targets given the nascent institutional
development of the WSS sector. The targets which accompanied the project objectives were
too ambitious and the project too complex at that time, making the project design rating
moderately unsatisfactory. The project was too demanding on the Borrower and the
implementing agencies, such as FONCODES and UGP-PRONASAR, created within the Vice-
Ministry of Water and Sanitation, which was just moved from the Ministry of Transport,
Communications, Housing, and Construction to the newly created Ministry of Housing,
Construction and Water in mid-2002. The project preparation stage, which lasted about three
years from 1999 to 2002, benefitted from adequate government commitment to tackle the issues
of sustainability and lack of sector policy. During this period, the General Sanitation Directorate
(Dirección General de Saneamiento" – DGS) was established as stipulated in a sector law which
passed in August 3, 2000. First, the DGS was initially established in the Ministry of the
Presidency and then subsequently moved under the Vice Ministry of Water and Sanitation in the
Ministry of Transport, Communications, Housing and Construction (MTHC). As mentioned
above, the government decided to move the Vice Ministry of Water and Sanitation (VMS) to the
newly established Ministry of Housing, Construction and Water in mid-2002, after splitting
MTHC into two ministries.

27.     Risk assessment was not realistic, given all the innovations and new concepts. Some
risks were more substantial than anticipated such as the “integration of physical investments with
training in O&M, hygiene education and long-term follow up is not done”, which was rated
modest. Given the novelty of the approach and the scope and depth of intervention needed in
thousands of communities that the project hoped to benefit, this should have been rated as
                                                 8
 substantial. A related risk which could have been identified then was related to the fact that there
 might not be enough capacity to implement the social and technical components of the project at
 the regional level, at scale, given that the pilot NGO experiences were localized and at a
 substantially small scale compared to what the project was trying to achieve. Furthermore, while
 the risk assessment at appraisal rightly points out important risks such as that of the national
 government not applying the DGS financial policies and norms, the mitigation measure could
 have been strengthened to include constant dialogue with key sector leaders and evidence to
 support that the policies and norms were working.

2.1 Implementation

 28.   Many implementation challenges arose during implementation, leading to significant
 changes in the project and significant delays.

 29.     Lack of alignment in sector policy and strategy: The policy and institutional context
 within which PRONASAR was prepared and implemented provided the first hurdle for the
 Project. Weak sector policy and institutions were identified during project preparation, which
 started in 1999. Policies for the rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) sector were not yet
 consolidated, with various actors in the sector implementing their own policies. This continued
 throughout the life of the project. The sector still lacked coherence and organizations within the
 sector lacked consolidation. For instance, many municipalities who had initially expressed
 interest changed their decisions because of competing government strategies and programs that
 provided 100% financing for WSS infrastructure as opposed to PRONASAR’s main principle of
 co-financing by both the municipality and community (through unskilled labor). After the first
 project restructuring in 2006, the PRONASAR had around 500 sub-projects in contract under the
 demand-responsive approach strategy, which included participation by the municipalities and
 communities through co-financing and unskilled manual labor contribution, respectively.
 However, many mayors decided not to continue with the Project and were tempted to participate
 in other government programs that provided 100 percent financial subsidy. This lack of
 alignment between PRONASAR and national government policies affected both the rural areas
 and small towns components but the effect was less on the latter since it was supposed to be a
 smaller scale pilot initiative.

 30.     Inability of FONCODES to implement the component 1 of the project. The project
 sought to build on the experience of FONCODES in efficiently transferring funds and executing
 small works in rural areas by adding the social mobilization and support component.
 Unfortunately, FONCODES was not able to adjust to the proposed approach as anticipated and
 this resulted in severe project delays. Another reason why there was very little progress made in
 the project in the first three years was because of the difficulty in transferring resources from the
 MVCS to FONCODES, a process which required a Ministerial resolution. This added burden
 made the PRONASAR activities less of a priority for FONCODES execution teams, thus
 contributing to project delays.

 31.     By early 2006, after almost two years of unsatisfactory performance the Project was
 restructured mainly to address issues related to the consolidation of sector institutions and the
 inability of FONCODES – originally the main implementing agency of Component 1 – to

                                                  9
change its methodology and implement the Project’s demand-driven and participatory approach
to building rural WSS systems. At this point, Component 1 also became the responsibility of the
PMU or UGP-PRONASAR, which had been implementing the small towns component
(Component 2) since the beginning. The restructuring helped improve the overall progress of the
project; the rating changed from Unsatisfactory to Satisfactory, showing improvements in
disbursements (jumping from US$ 0 to US$ 8.3 million from 2004 to 2006) and progress in the
infrastructure development. Subsequent delays after the restructuring can be attributed to the
poor performance of the firms delivering the feasibility and technical designs of the proposed
systems, as project documents reported. However, an unpublished report by the Swiss Agency
for Development and Cooperation (Agencia Suiza para el Desarrollo y la Cooperación -
COSUDE) analyzing the implementation timeline of the PRONASAR sub-projects shows that
the average time between the finalization of technical designs and the start of works was 734
days or 2 years.12 The report further suggested that this was determined by the restructuring
process, which emphasized the hiring of Technical Social Operators (Operadores Técnicos
Sociales – OTS) and Supervisor Operators (Operadores Supervisores – OT) and other human
resource to implement in this manner, which required a No Objection from the Bank.

32.     Delays in budget allocation and slow transfer process lasted throughout the life of
the project. Lack of coordination between the different ministries and related agencies
responsible for PRONASAR contributed to delays due to the budget allocation and transfer
process. In June 2011, the pace of execution had slowed significantly as the project did not have
a budget allocation corresponding to the Bank loans in the Ministry of Housing, Construction
and Sanitation (MVCS). PRONASAR had to use additional emergency budget allocations from
the MVCS, in order to commit a portion of the US$16 million worth of contracts that were ready
to be signed.

33.     Lack of capacity of private sector firms, NGOs, and national consultants to
implement the sub-projects. The design of PRONASAR assumed the existence of a private
and non-profit (NGO) sector that can implement the technical and social components at the
regional level. However, it became apparent that the NGOs, for instance, could not respond to
the rigid clauses of the contracts and the demand for a large number of sub-projects to be
implemented in each department. In addition, there was lack of human resources (national
consultants) to respond to the demand for the OTSs and the OTs, given the large volume of work
needed to develop project profiles and technical designs, as required in the Public Investment
System (Sistema de Inversión Pública - SNIP) and the large scale of a project like PRONASAR.

34.     Excessive administrative and licensing regimes led to significant delays in the
implementation of sub-projects. The project faced formidable bureaucratic challenges, which
significantly contributed to the tripling of time it took for a sub-project to be finalized. These
requirements are specific to Peru. For instance, the average time between the finalization and
approval of the technical project profiles and the start of construction was 481 days. Overall, it
took around 1,624 days or a little over four years for a sub-project to be completed and

Peru, titled Análisis de las fases de los proyectos del PRONASAR y la línea de tiempo de implementación (First and
Second Call for Bids).

 transferred and closed, according to official regulations (in the SNIP system).13 This was almost
 three times the amount of time originally planned, which was approximately a year and a half.
 Infrastructure projects funded by other donor agencies have also faced similar implementation
 challenges due to the heavy administrative burden involved in obtaining the necessary clearances
 and approvals.

2.2 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

 35.     M&E Design: A results framework with development objectives, outcome, and
 intermediate outcomes indicators was developed. While the values of the targets by indicator
 have changed during project restructuring, the indicators have remained the same. The key
 indicators are linked to the main objectives of the Project, as described in detail in Annex 2.

 36.     The Project’s M&E system also included an impact evaluation, with a baseline from 2005
 and an endline in 2014 to determine whether the project has made significant impact in the area
 of health and hygiene behaviors and resulted in positive outcomes in coverage and sustainability.
 The baseline included control and treatment groups in 43 sites in 19 districts in the eight
 departments where the Project was initially implemented. The results framework indicators
 along with the impact evaluation allowed for a clear assessment of the contribution of the project
 activities to the outcomes expected.

 37.     M&E Implementation and Utilization: Project M&E was under the responsibility of
 the UGP and additional evaluations were contracted out to consultancies to measure project
 progress and outcomes. Given the difficulties in accessing most of the locations where the
 interventions were carried out because of their dispersed nature, the M&E of the execution of the
 sub-projects was carried out by the operators, PRONASAR, and the Bank. However, even
 though an M&E system was developed at the national level, it started to show signs of weakness,
 particularly towards the end of the project and little information could be obtained by the Bank
 on the status of the different sub-projects and the overall intermediate outcome results indicators.

2.3 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

 38.     Safeguards. Overall, compliance to environmental and social safeguards was
 satisfactory throughout the project. Triggered safeguards include Environmental Assessment
 (OP/BP 4.01), Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) and Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10).
 An Environmental Impact Assessment was developed during preparation and properly disclosed
 as per Bank’s policy. The project as originally designed did not include a separate Indigenous
 Peoples Planning Framework or Plan given that most of the beneficiaries are indigenous peoples
 and thus provisions of the policy were mainstreamed into the design. An updated social
 assessment with emphasis on indigenous people and afro-descendants was prepared and
 incorporated in the Revised Operational Manual following the 2006 Project restructuring. New
 environmental guidelines for consulting firms were updated in 2009 and publicly disclosed in
 September 2010.

      Ibid.

                                                 11
39.     A review of safeguards implementation during preparation revealed that safeguards
instruments had been appropriate to meet the Project’s need for compliance.
Responsibility for the direct implementation of the safeguards in the field has been borne mostly
by consulting firms. These consulting firms included in their proposals the required personnel for
the intervention, including social and environmental specialists. Adherence to the social
intervention methodology was required for issuance of partial payments to the consulting firms.
This included prior informed consultation to the community, including the reporting of key
technical and social indicators. The implementation unit based in Lima monitored, evaluated
and supervised the process throughout and intervened where more detailed social, technical or
environmental intervention was needed. The implementation unit relied on a group of
decentralized technical and social specialists for managing the contracts with the consultant firms
including safeguards compliance. The unit also obtained support from the environmental
specialists at the Vice-Ministry of Construction and Sanitation.

40.     Overall, financial management arrangements worked well during project
implementation. PRONASAR benefited from the use of governmental financial management
information system, SIAF, and counted on qualified and experienced staff. However, the project
had complex institutional arrangements within the Ministry and UGP PRONASAR and
experienced high staff turnover of financial management personnel. This caused some delays in
the submission of project financial information and several reviews of roles and responsibilities
of financial management tasks to record project transactions and carry out payments on a timely
basis. In terms of project financial audits, they experienced delays due to General Controller’s
complex processes; however, audit reports were found acceptable. The closing date was June 30,
2013 and the grace period ended on October 31, 2013. The government agreed with the Bank to
complete some civil works with local counterpart funds until March 2014. Thus, the last
financial audit of the project is still pending and is expected to be delivered by September 30,
2014.14

41.     Procurement. The management of procurement processes by PRONASAR was
satisfactory overall. Several ex-post procurement reviews were performed during the
implementation and also IPRs (Independent Procurement Reviews) were conducted by an
independent expert. The ex-post reports, IPR reports and the Supervision Mission Aide
Memoires included recommendations that helped improve the management of procurement
processes, including: (a) management of the procurement plan (PP), with a complete
systematized information base for follow-up action (the Project’s PP was approved and
administered through SEPA); (b) training of procurement staff; (c) improvement of filing and
archiving of the procurement documentation; (d) introduction of appropriate provision for
advance payments for works; (e) the adaptation of adequate bidding documents for NCB; (f)
establishment of proper and reasonable time for the bidders to submit proposals; and (g)
improvement of the time required for evaluating bids for works. These recommendations were
included in the action plans of the ex-post reports which were carried out during project
implementation.

14
   As of June 25, 2014, the bidding process was still in progress in the works that were promised to be completed by
the government with its own funds after the project closed and there is no other known progress to report in this ICR
at this time.
                                                         12
2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phases

 42.    As mentioned earlier, the Project closed six months earlier than planned, in June 2013.
 By the team’s supervision mission in June 2013, there were 30 contracts still in progress and one
 contract with a firm that would provide consultancy services to the social component of 82
 works. Before the closing date, 21 works were planned to be finalized, leaving 61 contracts for
 works to be completed after June 30, 2013. The finalization of these 61 works contracts was
 estimated to cost US$18 million, to be financed by local counterpart funds. These works were
 expected to be fully executed by March 2014, adding 36,873 beneficiaries to the Project.15

 43.      WSP has also been working with the Government in strengthening sector policies and
 institutions, including the rural water supply and sanitation sub-sector to improve coverage and
 to ensure sustainability of investments such as those made under PRONASAR, an activity which
 has potential to be linked to future Bank-supported program.

 44.    The findings from the endline assessment from April 2014 will also be further analyzed
 to provide additional insights on how to move forward, given the lessons learned from the last
 decade of implementation of the PRONASAR project. A stakeholder workshop will be
 organized to further discuss the Bank’s role in the rural water supply and sanitation sector in
 Peru.


 3. OUTCOMES
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

 45.     The objectives of the Project were clearly defined and their relevance is rated
 Substantial. The objectives addressed the issue of sustainability, which remains one of the
 biggest challenges in the water and sanitation sector. Even after 11 years since the Project’s
 inception, its objectives remain the same as the ones expressed in the Ministry of Housing,
 Construction, and Sanitation’s Medium-Term Plan 2013-2016 regarding the need to ensure that
 the rural population has opportunities to improve their health through adequate and sustainable
 provision (quality and appropriate technology) of water and sanitation services. It is worth
 noting that the focus on rural water and sanitation remains extremely relevant, particularly in line
 with the Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. As shown
 in the graphs below, access to WSS by the rural population is still low and this is particularly an
 issue for the poorest quintile, around 60% of which lacks access to improved water sources.
 Sanitation remains a huge challenge across all quintiles.

 46.    The project’s objectives and design are also closely aligned with the most recent Country
 Partnerships Strategy (CPS) developed in 2012,16 particularly on three of the four pillars focused
 on increasing access and quality of social services for the poor, connecting the poor to services
 and markets, and inclusive governance and public sector performance. The emphasis on the

                                                      13
 social and governance aspects to ensure sustainability needs to be continued as the sector
 develops more and addresses the pressing issue of providing WSS services to the rural poor.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

 47.     The project development objectives were partially achieved and the ICR rates this
 as Modest. The assessment was made by referring to the level of achievement of target values
 for the outcome indicators and to other impacts and outcomes of the project directly related to
 the PDO, as provided by the impact evaluation study, M&E reports, and the UGP-PRONASAR
 assessment of the pilot project of the Component 2. Additional information on the findings of
 the beneficiary survey (the endline assessment undertaken in 2014) is in Annex 5 of this report.

 48.     Increasing access to WSS facilities in rural areas. This objective was partially
 achieved. The project helped in providing access to improved water services to an additional
 211,323 people (82 percent of target) and to improved sanitation services to 180,607 people (74
 percent of target). The project constructed 78 new systems and rehabilitated 282 water supply
 network systems. In addition, it provided 27,818 hygienic sanitation facilities and 34,299
 household water connections in 380 rural communities spread over 9 regions and 51 provinces
 across the country.

 49.     The impact evaluation provides evidence that access to improved water and sanitation
 services did occur as a result of the project. For instance, the evaluation shows a significant
 positive increase of 22 percentage points in the probability of having access to continuous
 improved water source in the Project’s intervention areas compared to non-intervention areas
 (p<1%). In localities where new systems were built, the access rate jumped from 36.9 percent to
 100 percent between 2005 and 2014 (p<1%). In areas where systems were rehabilitated, the
 coverage increased from 82.8 percent to 90 percent in intervention areas, though this finding was
 not statistically significant. There is a positive increase of 30 percentage points in the probability
 of having access to sanitation services in the intervention areas (p<1%). The table below shows a
 comparison between WSS coverage at the national level and in PRONASAR’s intervention areas
 between 2005 and 2014. Overall, access to improved water sources in the areas where
 PRONASAR implemented their sub-projects was much higher, 77.7 percent in 2005, compared
 to the national rural access figure, which was 33.4 percent. The sanitation figures were more
 similar at baseline. They provide further evidence that PRONASAR has had an impact in the
 increased access to sanitation, with the construction of improved latrines.

50.     Increasing sustained use of water supply facilities. There was a marked increase in the
percentage of communities with systems that are functioning without serious problems from
2005 to 2014 in intervention areas, showing increased sustainability. The percentage of localities
with systems that are functioning without serious problems increased by 69 percent between
2005 and 2014 in intervention areas compared to 27 percent in non-intervention areas, showing
increased sustainability of the WSS facilities as a result of PRONASAR. This is one of the key
results and contributions of PRONASAR to the sector. In addition, systems provide
continuous water services through household water connection for at least 12 hours per day in 73
percent of the communities. Furthermore, the endline study shows statistically significant results
on the households’ use of improved water sources for consumption and cooking. Where
PRONASAR financed new systems, the increase was much higher than where it financed
rehabilitated systems: 61 percent and 8 percent increase in intervention areas, respectively,
compared to 27 percent and 6.6 percent in non-intervention areas (p<1% for new systems; p<5%
for rehabilitated systems).

51.     Increasing sustained use of sanitation facilities. A smaller but also significant increase
of 11 percentage points can be observed in the impact of the PRONASAR in the increased use of
hygienic sanitation in its intervention areas compared to those that did not benefit from the
Project (p<1%). There was a dramatic increase in the percentage of men, women, and children
over three years of age who used latrines17 in the intervention areas compared to non-
intervention areas. For both new and rehabilitated systems financed by the project, this
percentage increase was 59 percent between 2005 and 2014, a significant difference from the
non-intervention areas where the latrine usage rate only increased by 16 percent for new systems
and 36 percent for new systems in the same time period (p<1%).

52.      Strengthening local communities’ capacity to manage services. In many ways, the
project helped strengthen local communities to manage, operate and maintain their water and
sanitation service. For instance, there was a 38.1 percentage point increase in the percentage of
JASS that are trained in managing, operating, and maintaining their water and sanitation
services; a 32.6 percentage point increase in the percentage of JASS with a complete and fully-
functioning equipment; and a 46.4 percentage point increase in the percentage of JASS trained in

  These latrines are not necessarily defined as hygienic, which refers to absence of feces on the floor, seat or walls
and absence of flies and bad odor.
                                                         15
the daily chlorination (both system and household). However, even though the JASSs were
trained in this aspect, the percentage point increase (24.8 percent) of systems in which daily
chlorination is done was lower. There was also dramatic reduction of 67.2 percentage points in
the percentage of JASS that know the method of calculating family contributions to O&M costs.
Even though this last indicator showed a negative reduction, it is clear that families in general are
paying for their water services and pay around US$ 2-3 a month, around 10 times more than the
average rural Peruvian family.18

53.     Strengthening municipal - district and provincial - level capacity to plan and oversee
water and sanitation services to rural communities in a sustainable and cost effective way. The
key indicators related to capacity building of local governments show a negative effect. For
instance, the percentage of municipalities that have incorporated and carry out their planning,
supervision, monitoring, and evaluation functions in water and sanitation services in rural
communities has decreased from 42.1 percent in 2005 to 31.58 in 2014. Another indicator that
shows the effect (or lack thereof) of the project on district municipalities is the percentage of
municipalities with at least one person who knows the management activities of the JASSs. The
baseline figure was 15.79 percent and this did not increase in the endline, putting into question
the long-term involvement of the local governments in the WSS services in the intervention
areas. One of the key instruments for decentralization under PRONASAR was the ‘mesa de
concertación’ outlined in the PAD, a consultation “space” for the prioritization of development
projects in the districts. However, the endline shows that the percentage of districts with a ‘mesa
de concertación’ or similar decreased from 47.37 percent to 42.11 percent.

54.     Improving health and hygiene practices. The project had no impact on household
health and hygiene practices compared to localities in non-intervention areas. The evaluation
study shows no impact of the project on the percentage of children under five with diarrhea in
the last 15 days and on the percentage of mothers with adequate hand washing practices
compared to the control group, which decreased by 16.2 percentage points from baseline to
endline for rehabilitated systems and 14.5 percentage points for new ones. The lack of health
impact is not surprising finding given the current literature on impact evaluations of
handwashing programs carried out by WSP under the Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project in
Peru and elsewhere, which found no health impacts on children under five.19 The lack of impact
on behavior change can possibly be attributed to the lack of intensity and frequency of the
behavior change intervention. There is a need to further link the water and sanitation sector to
the education and health sectors to maximize the effectiveness of interventions. The endline
shows that there is already an increase in collaboration between the water and sanitation and
education sectors: there was a 42.1 percent increase (from 10.53 percent in 20015 to 52.63
percent in 2014 in the percentage of district municipalities who collaborated with the Ministry of

past year.

55.     Improving sustainable management of WSS facilities in small towns through the
establishment of Specialized Operators and training on operation and maintenance. This
objective was not achieved and none of the five intermediate results targets were achieved.
Almost three years after the small towns component of the project closed, the UGP carried out an
assessment of the pilot project and found that none of the ten systems visited had operational
revenues greater than or equal to 110 percent of operational expenditure, seven out of the ten
systems provided continuous service for more than 16 hours a day and only one city out of 10
continued using micro-metering in billing its customers.

56.     Supporting the National Sanitation Directorate and the Vice-Ministry of Sanitation
in the normative and policy making role. This objective was partially achieved and the
intermediate results were partially achieved. The strategy of a key policy document, the National
Sanitation Plan (2006-2011), developed during President Alan Garcia’s term were similar to the
strategy and policy proposed by PRONASAR towards the beginning of the last decade (2000).
There was some progress in sector development with the creation of the National Sanitation
Directorate and the Vice Ministry of Sanitation by the time the Project was approved in 2002 as
well as the development of a ten-year strategic plan (2002-2011) adopting policies that aligned
greatly with PRONASAR, such as community participation, private sector participation, and
acceptance of an enhanced role of district municipalities for the provision of WSS.

57.     For this reason, PRONASAR’s role in the evolution of the Peruvian water and
sanitation sector should be considered as an important legacy. The whole premise of
PRONASAR was ambitious and given the institutional context in which it was designed and
implemented, it had made considerable progress in terms of introducing the concepts of demand-
responsive approach, community participation in the decision making process, capacity building
for operation and maintenance and enhance role of local governments. The concepts of
sustainability, community participation and social mobilization have already been mainstreamed
into key sector documents.20

58.     It is important to point out that even though these concepts have been mainstreamed into
key sector documents, there is much room for improvement in implementing them. The
prevailing policy under the PNSR is now to favor a supply-driven infrastructure-focused
approach, contradicting totally these core concepts introduced by the project. Government policy
now promotes funding 100 percent of the work, regardless of funding source. The new policy
also promoted the concept of “Baño Digno”, which expanded the menu of options for a basic
sanitary unit and further increased the costs of sanitation provision since the “Baño Digno
included a shower, toilet, sink, elevated tank, and septic tank. These policy changes triggered the

 government policies.

3.3 Efficiency

 59.    Overall, the project’s efficiency is rated Modest. The average net present value and
 average economic rate of return at ICR are US$ -40,781 and 3 percent, respectively, showing
 low economic efficiency. Even though prices had gone up throughout the duration of the project
 and the additional financing was a solution to the cost overruns met by the project, the lower than
 expected economic efficiency resulted mainly from lower benefits than those originally
 estimated.

 60.     The measures of efficiency used at the appraisal stage for both the original loan and the
 additional financing were net present value (NPV) and the economic rate of return (ERR) for
 each sub-project. At the project’s original appraisal in 2002, a cost-benefit analysis was carried
 out for 11 potential sub-projects, which had an average rate of return of 71 percent and an
 average net present value of US$ 10,940. The original analysis did not attempt to calculate the
 overall rate of return for the entire project given the demand-driven nature of PRONASAR
 which gave the community multiple choices of capital investments. For the additional financing
 in 2010, a detailed cost-benefit analysis was undertaken and at that time, it was for a sample of
 36 potentially eligible sub-projects (11 in the region of Apurimac, 3 in the region of Amazonas,
 and 22 in the region of Cusco) spanning the available technology choices for communities and
 using the same methodology as that employed in the appraisal of the Original Project. The size
 range of the systems analyzed was between 42 to 243 water connections. In spite of investment
 cost increases, each of these sub-projects is economically feasible, and they have an average net
 present value of US$161,894 and an average economic rate of return of 17 percent. This average
 rate of return is lower than the 71 percent average rate of return calculated at Project appraisal,
 and can be largely explained by the cost increases discussed in this paper. The calculation of an
 overall rate of return for the Program was not attempted, given that such calculation would be
 based on an assumed distribution of community choices of capital investments. Therefore, it was
 considered more important to establish that each of the possible choices would generate
 acceptable economic returns.

 61.     The endline study carried out in 2014 showed that the time savings, which was a key
 component in the calculation of Project benefits, was minimal, overall. The baseline showed
 that, for rehabilitated systems, 10 percent obtained water from rivers, springs, and lakes, in the
 intervention areas and while this number decreased to 2 percent, the number of minutes spent
 fetching water actually went up 17 percent, from 35 to 43 minutes. For new systems, there was a
 61 percentage point decrease (63.9 percent to 3 percent from 2005-2014) in the percentage of
 households obtaining water from rivers, springs, and lakes and there was a 10 percent drop in the
 time spent fetching water. In addition, health savings, which were a significant factor in
 calculating the economic efficiency of the project at appraisal and under the AF, were not
 included in the calculations at ICR because the impact evaluation did not find any statistically
 significant improvement in health outcomes attributable to the project.



                                                 18
 62.     At completion, unit costs were also calculated to provide an idea of the project’s
 efficiency. The cost per beneficiary of the entire project, taking into account all four
 components, was US$ 484.21 The cost per beneficiary in rural areas (Component 1) is much
 higher than in small towns (Component 2), US$ 497 versus US$ 120, respectively, though this
 was to be expected due to the more dispersed nature of the rural intervention areas. Under
 Component 1, systems were built or rehabilitated in nine regions, 51 provinces, and 117 district
 municipalities.22 The cost does not compare as favorably to other similar rural water and
 sanitation programs in other countries: less than US$ 400 in Paraguay and less than US$ 200 in
 Haiti. Around 32% of the total cost per beneficiary in Component 1 comprised the technical
 assistance to municipalities and communities and capacity building at the national level.
 However, when one takes into account only the infrastructure cost, the cost drops dramatically to
 US$326, which is actually in line with the estimates elsewhere in Peru23. The fact that this cost
 includes a basic sanitation facility makes it more comparable with the rest of the country.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

 63.      The ICR rates the overall outcome of the project as Moderately Unsatisfactory, given
 the significant shortcomings in the achievement of its objectives and its low efficiency. The
 targets were not fully achieved in terms of increased access and the improvement in hygiene
 practices (such as hand-washing at critical times) was not as significant as expected. However, it
 is important to point out that the larger objective of increasing the sustainable use of WSS
 facilities in rural areas and small towns was achieved, even though long-term sustainability
 remains to be seen.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

 64.     The project targeted the rural poor who represented 60 percent of the rural population
 through the FONCODES poverty map of Peru. The poverty map classified Peru’s 1,821 districts
 by poverty level (extremely poor, very poor, poor, marginally acceptable and acceptable) using
 indicators such as percent of households without access to potable water and adequate sanitation,
 percent of households without access to health clinics, and level of inaccessibility by road. Even
 though the implementation agency changed for the rural WSS component from FONCODES to
 the UGP-PRONASAR in 2006, the project was implemented in some of the poorest departments
 in the country: Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Huanuco, and Pasco, with poverty rates above 50
 percent a decade ago.

 21
    In calculating the cost per beneficiary, the author took into account the financing provided by the municipalities as
 well as the communities (unskilled labor participation). The latter was derived from author’s estimates based on
 available project documents.
 22
    The increased dispersion of the project was a response to government strategy and policies which required the
 project to include more locations.
 23
    The cost per capita estimates in rural concentrated areas in Peru, US$ 280 for rehabilitated systems and US$ 336
 for new systems, were derived from an unpublished internal working document written by staff from WSP,
 COSUDE, and CARE-Peru. This paper from 2009, which focused on gaps in access to water and sanitation in Peru
 particularly in dispersed rural and native communities, proposed that the actual costs in rural dispersed areas would
 be more given the geographic dispersion of the communities served.
                                                           19
 65.     A few aspects of the project related to gender were expected to contribute to improving
 sustainability, health outcomes and hygiene behavior in the communities. However, the
 percentage of mothers with adequate hand-washing practices and of women in leadership
 positions within JASSs was not statistically significant.

 66.    Community participation throughout the project cycle was at the core of PRONASAR’s
 methodology. It has long been argued that strong community participation leads to more
 sustainable outcomes, particularly when communities are involved in project planning and
 implementation (choosing appropriate service levels and discussing both financial and labor
 contribution to the development of the WSS infrastructure).

 (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

 67.     Institutional strengthening was a core element of the PRONASAR operations. As
 already mentioned in Section 3.2, the project contributed significantly to the evolution of the
 Peruvian water and sanitation sector in various ways. For instance, the continued dialogue on
 participation, sustainability and decentralization within the WSS sector could be partly attributed
 to the project’s core concepts.24 In addition, the creation of the PNSR, as a national program
 aimed at aligning policies and strategies and as the main vehicle to increase water and sanitation
 services in rural areas, has been largely inspired by the example of the PRONASAR.

 (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

 68.     No unintended outcomes and impacts were observed or measured.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

 69.    An endline was carried out for Component 1, which deals with rural WSS and the key
 findings have already been incorporated in the preceding sections. A more detailed summary of
 findings is presented in Annex 5.


 4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME
 70.     The ICR assesses the risk to the development outcome as High given the current
 challenges of ensuring enough social support to the communities and JASS to ensure
 sustainability. The lack of firms and NGOs to perform the role of providing social support and
 supervision (Operadores Sociales Técnicos or OST and Operadores Supervisores or OS)
 particularly in the regions of Piura, Huancavelica and Cusco continued to be an issue towards the
 end of the project in 2013.25 Even though the endline data point to a positive significant impact
 in terms of sustainability (i.e. functional systems) of a sample of the sub-projects under
 PRONASAR, long term sustainability remains to be seen.

 24
    There is ongoing dialogue about these concepts, as evidenced by a recent request for technical assistance by the
 Government of Peru to WSP) and discussions with key sector specialists.

71.      While community participation was emphasized throughout the project, it is not clear
how well the district municipalities will be involved in the post-construction phase. Government
commitment to policies that encourage and support decentralization of water and sanitation
functions and institutional arrangements to support such functions are of utmost importance to
fully realize the development outcomes that PRONASAR had envisioned from the start. The
endline survey of municipalities indicates that some work needs to be done to increase their
involvement in facilitating the successful provision of water supply and sanitation services.
Results have been encouraging - a 47 percent increase from 2005 to 2014 of the percentage of
district municipalities with a complete list of active JASSs in their district and a 32 percent
increase of district municipalities with information about coverage and quality of water and
sanitation services. However, the percentage of municipalities who carry out their supervision
functions decreased from 74 percent to 42 percent in the same time period. Although these
district municipalities have been trained in management, operation and maintenance of WSS
services, only 16 percent has at least one staff with knowledge of the main management activities
of the JASS, the same percentage as it was in 2005.

72.    Therefore, it would be important to help mitigate these risks by providing additional
technical assistance to the Government of Peru, both at the national and regional/local levels in
ensuring the sustainability of the newly rehabilitated and constructed WSS schemes, not just
under PRONASAR but also under the National Rural Water and Sanitation Program and the
investment programs funded by other donors.


5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     The performance of the Bank in ensuring quality at entry was Moderately Satisfactory.
The project preparation was a lengthy process and the multi-disciplinary Bank team handled the
political and institutional uncertainties of the sector at that time, adapting to the different changes
in sector authorities but maintaining the important concepts of participation and social support
throughout the project cycle, as well as institutional strengthening at the local level. The
demand-responsive approach promoted by the Bank as a way to increase sustainability was
timely and relevant in terms of the sector challenges at that time. In terms of strategic relevance,
approach and the poverty, gender, and social development aspects, the project pushed the
boundaries in the sector where supply-driven approach was still the norm (and continues to be in
many places). The project aimed at improving the access in poorer areas in Peru and
strengthening the capacity of local levels of government (district municipalities) and
communities to ensure sustainability, a concept that is still as relevant today as it was then.

74.    However, the ICR identified gaps in the project preparation process such as the
overestimation of the capacity of the borrower, private sector firms, NGOs, and national
consultants and consequently, the project outcomes, and the underestimation of costs and
administrative and licensing regime battlements, as discussed in Section 2. The risk assessment
                                                  21
at entry could have been more realistic, given all the new concepts and innovations proposed that
sought to transform the sector. Some risks were more substantial than anticipated such as the
“integration of physical investments with training in O&M, hygiene education and long-term
follow up is not done”, which was rated modest. Given the novelty of the approach and the
scope and depth of intervention needed in thousands of communities that the project hoped to
benefit, this should have been rated as substantial. A related risk which could have been
identified then was related to the fact that there might not be enough capacity to implement the
social and technical components of the project at the regional level, at scale, given that the pilot
NGO experiences were localized and at a substantially small scale compared to what the project
was trying to achieve.

75.    Despite these gaps at entry, it is important highlight that the project was highly
innovative when it was conceived and consisted of state-of-the-art features borrowed not just
from experiences in Peru but also around the world in order to address the fundamental issue of
sustainability.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

76.      The quality of supervision was Moderately Unsatisfactory. On average, the Bank
undertook three supervision missions per year and team members travelled to different parts of
the country to supervise the implementation of the project. It also engaged the support of WSP
staff to carry out some of the supervisory functions. The team was able to correctly detect and
identify implementation problems and propose solutions accordingly. The Bank team also made
key decisions to help move the project forward by restructuring and amending activities and
targets, while keeping the same development objectives. However, it was not always possible to
resolve the implementation problems due to the complexity of the project, the lack of flexibility,
the fear that drastic changes would have even further delayed progress in implementation, and
the different actors involved who were not always aligned to the project’s objectives. The
project went through three different restructurings before the government eventually requested
its early closure, yet the project components and methodology largely remained the same. Could
the supervision team have missed these opportunities to restructure the project in a more
meaningful and effective way to allow for the outcomes to be fully achieved? Could the Bank
team have overestimated the capacity on the ground, particularly at the local level, to deliver on
the results promised under PRONASAR? Given the complex and challenging nature of the
project, it would have been helpful to provide additional, just-in-time technical assistance at all
levels, to ensure that the social component and long-term capacity building would be addressed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

77.     The overall bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Even though the
supervision was strong for the most part throughout the long life of the project, the Bank’s
performance has much room for improvement. Continuous supervision and additional technical
assistance on the ground and more flexibility could have helped improve the Bank’s
performance. There were missed opportunities for reorienting the project in a deeper way,

                                                22
especially given the length of time that it took and the underlying context within which it was
operating. PRONASAR operated within a context of continuous sector transition. Policy and
institutional reform should have been given more priority in order to ensure that the outcomes
were achieved.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     The government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. A couple interlinked
factors negatively affected the performance of the government such as the lack of timely
resolution of implementation issues such as those related to long delays in appointment of key
staff and budget transfer and the lack of policy and institutional support to help fully achieve all
of the project objectives, such as reducing the bureaucratic process involved in implementing
small WSS projects in rural areas. Furthermore, even though rural areas are now prioritized
compared to when the project first began, there is still a predominant view of emphasizing
infrastructure development (“hardware”) and not placing enough emphasis on the social aspects
of infrastructure (“software”). The espousal of the demand-responsive approach by the
government did not quite materialize after over a decade of experience with PRONASAR.
However, the government tried the new and innovative concepts that PRONASAR promoted and
while over time, the level of commitment changed depending on the leadership of the agencies
and the political economic context, the request for additional financing showed the commitment
to continue the project. For this reason, the ICR rates the government performance Moderately
Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency - UGP PRONASAR
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

79.     The performance of the implementing agency is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory
mainly because of the following reasons: (i) implementation arrangements that relied too much
on a large centralized team and not enough field presence; (ii) inadequate coordination and
participation of stakeholders at the local level; and (iii) insufficient M&E to monitor progress
and make mid-course corrections to improve results. The project relied on a large team based in
Lima, which was not necessarily complemented with local support and presence to push the
project forward. Relationship and coordination with local governments was an important aspect
of the project as it aimed to strengthen their capacity in supervision, but supervision and
monitoring was largely centralized. Furthermore, municipalities were not enabled to sign
contracts, making them less accountable and ‘invested’ in the project. Though there were
significant shortcomings, it is important to commend the work of key UGP staff who worked
hard to push through different barriers to implementation. For instance, from 2009 to 2012, the
UGP supported the demand from households and municipalities of including a shower in the
definition of a basic sanitation unit, a relatively expensive option that lowered the economic
viability of the project dramatically. In the end, the PRONASAR leadership succeeded in
convincing the government to allow for such option. Another example is the way
PRONASAR’s leadership maneuvered its way within the difficult policy and institutional
environment which did not always align with the project’s objectives. To avoid competing for
                                                23
the same municipalities to participate in the investment program, PRONASAR discussed and
came into an agreement with the government about not intervening in the same places.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

80.     The overall performance of the borrower is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. The
government did not show enough commitment to achieving the project’s development
objectives, at times contradicting the core concepts introduced by PRONASAR, such as the
demand-responsive approach and importance of strengthening the municipalities and the
communities in the provision and management of WSS services. The readiness for
implementation was also not evident throughout the life of the project. In the end, the
government asked to close the project prematurely due to the lack of alignment of its strategy
with other government programs, such as those contemplated by the PNSR. While the
government had committed to funding and implementing pending activities, at the time of
writing of this ICR, those works had not yet been completed.


6. LESSONS LEARNED

81.     Accelerating water and sanitation services requires a common strategy and the
simplification of the country’s complex administrative processes. The PRONASAR co-
financing strategy by the municipalities aimed at ensuring ownership and long term support of
the JASS for the extension and rehabilitation the systems constructed by the project. However
both cumbersome administrative procedures and supply of other state programs without co-
financing, was a serious obstacle to the progress in project implementation. As an example, the
emergence of strategies like "National Growth Strategy" affected the third call for bids since it
expanded the project area, making it more expensive due to increased dispersion of sub-projects
in order to meet the targeting policy of that district national strategy. Simplifying the National
Public Investment system (Sistema Nacional de Inversión Pública – SNIP) to take into account
smaller projects in dispersed rural areas would contribute significantly to infrastructure
development for those without access. The two key priorities for the RWSS sector in the country
should be to eliminate these administrative bottlenecks and more importantly, define a common
strategy taking into account the lessons from PRONASAR and other projects.

82.     A more decentralized approach to planning, execution and monitoring of projects
needs to be emphasized to go to scale and ensure sustainability, supported by a strong
center and continuous capacity building and institutional strengthening. It took the project
11 years to provide about less than a quarter million people with water supply service. The
centralized planning, execution and monitoring approach used by PRONASAR implemented
from Lima, using consultants and contractors mainly based in the capital, did not necessarily
yield good performance in many areas of the project. Replicating the same approach would be
rather expensive. It would probably have been more efficient and sustainable to build capacity at
the Municipal District level to implement project activities and works. This lesson, however,
may not be applicable to all regions because capacity at the various levels of the public sector
varies across the country. A capacity assessment needs to be carried out to determine how much

                                               24
to decentralized and what the central government can do to support institutional strengthening at
the local levels. A good practice element of the small towns component (Component 2) was the
creation of Technical Management Units in the municipalities, which has contributed
significantly to improving the model. This unit served as a direct link between the local
government and the operator; in places where these units were functioning, the specialized
operator has been able to work well. Aside from the local government’s active role, it is also
important to establish user committees to help with monitoring (Junta de Vigilancia). More
research is needed on good practice cases in Component 1 to learn how good governance at the
local levels can work to ensure sustainability of rural water supply schemes.

83.     Municipal co-financing and community contribution requirements need to be better
adapted to the local context. The policy of municipal co-financing and community contribution
faced difficulties. Many municipalities did not have significant budgetary resources to participate
in the project. The Bank did not accept the co-financing from any regional governments or other
sources of funds. This led to redirect the proposed investment to other municipalities not
included in PRONASAR. In addition, over time, rural communities became more and more
reluctant to participate in the project due to the requirement to provide unskilled labor or local
materials. Increased economic activity in rural areas has increased the opportunity cost of labor
of the people, making it increasingly difficult for them to contribute in terms of labor. In some
cases, it has slowed and even paralyzed the implementation of works not only because the people
refused to participate, but because contractors, aware of this issue, either did not bid or withdrew
from it, affecting overall project progress. There were also limits to community participation
given community members’ work schedules which did not necessarily coincide with those
established by the contractors.

84.     Community participation in planning and operations underpins sustainability, but
adequate financial incentives are necessary for continued participation. The endline shows
that community participation in planning and operations underpins sustainability, as evidenced
by the fact that the percentage of localities with systems that are functioning without serious
problems increased by 69 percent between 2005 and 2014 in intervention areas compared to 27
percent in non-intervention areas. The demand-responsive approach, whereby communities
make informed choices regarding their participation and service levels, is implementable. The
project has shown that isolated communities, including the poorest - the project was
implemented in some of the poorest departments in the country, with poverty rates above 50
percent - can demonstrate their demand and contribute to partial capital investment as well as
manage the water supply system and fully or partially recover operation and maintenance costs.
The endline also found that well-organized and trained people may assume the management,
operation and maintenance, but to ensure sustainability they must be paid. In small towns, it was
clear that extensive consultations with the communities, particularly the involvement of women,
were instrumental in achieving more sustainable outcomes. For instance, the project found that
women were more willing than men to pay an additional amount to the monthly contribution in
order to cover the operations and maintenance of the water supply system, given the women’s
primary responsibility in water collection and use.

85.    It is important to think more holistically and involve other sectors in order to
achieve the higher level impact of improved health benefits. A project alone cannot achieve
                                                25
health benefits as evidenced by the fact the project has no impact on the percentage of children
under five with diarrhea within the 15 days and on the percentage of mothers with adequate
handwashing practices in the intervention area compared the no intervention area. Changing and
sustaining behavior change requires much more than hygiene education and more intensive
interventions at the level of the community; this lesson is actually consistent with recent impact
evaluation studies carried out by WSP under the Global Scaling Up Handwashing Project in Peru
and elsewhere, as already mentioned in Section 2.1. It is important to sustain handwashing
activities and reinforce the messages after the project; doing this requires a multisectoral
approach that includes not only the health and education sectors but also the private sector, to the
extent possible. Continuous training of frontline workers and delivery of such training through
local governments are key areas to focus on in the future in order to increase the changes of
behavior to occur and be sustained.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The project had four main components aimed at increasing the sustainable use of new and
rehabilitated water supply and sanitation facilities in rural areas and small towns while
emphasizing improvement in hygiene practices and training in operation and maintenance.
There was a strong emphasis on a demand-responsive approach coupled with social support to
local communities from planning to post-construction. The components along with their main
achievements are described as follows:

Component 1: Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, Training and Hygiene Education. Component
1 comprised of two sub-components, rehabilitation of existing systems and construction of new
ones. It also included technical assistance to the establishment of new and strengthening of
existing water user committees (JASS) to manage the systems, and hygiene education. An
important part of the overall objective of PRONASAR is capacity building at the community
level, a key project feature that was emphasized throughout the duration of the project by the
Bank team. The outputs under this component were partially achieved, as shown in the table
below. By the project’s closing on June 2013, there were 380 localities which benefitted from
the water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions, out of the target of 489. Project documents (i.e.
Aide Memoire, June 2013) mentioned that by the end of the project on June 30, 2013, around
211,323 people would have gained access to improved water sources (82 percent of revised
targets) and 180,607 would have gained access to sanitation services (74 percent of revised
targets).

Overall, Component 2 was fully implemented in nine regions, 51 provinces, and 117 district
municipalities, which means that systems were actually built or rehabilitated/expanded as
opposed to just technical designs developed. The table below provides further detail on the key
outputs of Component 1, such as the number of sub-projects, localities, beneficiaries,
connections, and sanitation facilities.

In addition, 177 technical designs have been finalized (86% of target), out of which 35 have
obtained approval (Resolución Jefetural) to move forward to the construction phase in the
regions of Ancash, Apurimac, Cajamarca, Lambayeque, and San Martin. Only the design phase
is covered by the Bank loan agreement in these five areas.

Some of the challenges faced by the implementation agency were:
 Lack of operators with sufficient capacity to implement sub-projects in rural areas;
 Lack of operators to implement the social component in Piura, Huancavelica and Cusco
 Complex process of obtaining licenses and approval (CIRA);
 Modifications in the menu of options to incorporate the demand from the communities to
   construct ‘complete bathrooms’, with a shower (Baños Completos) as opposed to simpler
   ones (Baños Comunes), particularly in Cusco and Piura. This process took time given that
   the economic viability of the projects were calculated without taking into account the
   showers which drove the prices up and the viability down. Different agencies had different
   rules and the UGP-PRONASAR worked hard to remove this impediment; and
 Intense rains which affected construction of the WSS systems (interrupted road access for
   delivery of materials and inputs) in Huancavelica, Cusco, and Piura.

Component 2: Water Supply and Sanitation in Small Towns. Under this component the project
provided both technical assistance to district municipalities interested in delegating service
provision to private operators or autonomous entities (cooperatives, municipal companies etc.)
and water supply system investment finance for district municipalities that have signed
delegation contracts. Component 2 had been designed as a follow-up to a pilot project to be
implemented by WSP with CIDA funds (about US$4 million) in 8 municipalities. In total, the
project established strategic alliances with 30 localities situated in seven regions throughout the
country. At the end of the Pilot Project, there were 16 municipalities which received financing to
rehabilitate, improve, and/or expand their water and sanitation systems.

The total investments in infrastructure amounted to US$ 2.9 and the estimated number of
beneficiaries was 55,000 people. However, not all of these municipalities signed a contract with
an operator, though other municipalities decided to go through the process of institutional change
and reform even without financing from PRONASAR. The table below shows the different
towns included under Component 2 and distinguishes between those which received financing
(middle column titled “Con ejecución de obra”) and those which did not (third column).
Furthremore, the table also shows which municipalities received financing and signed a
delegated management contract with a specialized operator (Vice, Piura; Chuschi, Ayacucho;
San Lorenzo, Junín; Río Negro, Junín; San Pedro de Cachora, Apurímac; Yuracyacu, San
Martín; Pampa Cangallo, Ayacucho; and San Salvador, Cusco). Seven of the 16 municipalities

     The number of localities was slightly higher, 380.
                                                               30
which received PRONASAR financing decided not to sign a contract with a specialized operator
for various reasons ranging from security to local authorities’ refusing to sign it. However, an
additional six municipalities decided to sign agreements with specialized operators even without
the investment financing from PRONASAR, thus yielding a total of 15 small towns with a
delegated management model and specialized operator in place.

The lower number of municipalities included in the Pilot Project was due to several factors that
include the lack of political will to be part of a new project that did not receive total subsidy from
the government; change in leadership at the municipal level with perspectives that did not align
with the project; and interest only in the construction of WSS infrastructure and not the social
components.

Before the closing of the Project, the UGP carried out an assessment of the results of the Pilot
Project and visited 10 of the 16 localities that had a Specialized Operator managing their water
and sanitation services. The key performance indicators after three years since the Pilot Project’s
closing are as follows: (i) only 7 of the 10 specialized operators have remained and the same
number of operators provide continuous water supply service greater than 16 hours a day; (ii)
none of the specialized operators are covering 110% of their operating costs; and (iii) only one
small town continues billing according to household consumption as measured by meters.

   The list of small towns under PRONASAR’s Component 2 comprises of those that received financing for
rehabilitation, improvement and/or expansion of the water and sanitation system. For additional information, see the
report on the pilot experience: Ministerio de Vivienda, Construcción y Saneamiento (2010). Proyecto Piloto de
Agua y Saneamiento en Pequeñas Ciudades PROPECI: Un Modelo de Gestión Sostenible.

The model proposed under the Pilot Project was based on the interaction among four actors: the
Technical Management Unit (Unidad Técnica de Gestión -UTG), the Citizen Monitoring Entities
(Organismos de Vigilancia Ciudadana -OVC), Specialized Operator (Operador Especializado -
OES) and the users. Despite the advances made in developing a new model for small towns
WSS management, the tariff issue remains with the district mayors strongly influencing the
process. As mentioned earlier, only one of the towns actually do micrometering.

From the user perspective, they have accepted the management model and the role that the
specialized operator plays. It is worth pointing out that while 93% of the users interviewed are
satisfied with the services, only 54% attributed this to the specialized operator. However, 70%
considers that the specialized operator should continue providing the service in the future.

Component 3: Capacity Building. Under this component, consultants were hired to strengthen
DGSR in its role as sector leader (e.g. by preparing policy and sector studies), train sector staff to
assume their assigned functions, finance the training, orientation and accreditation of the
project's implementing agencies (including municipalities, regional operators, NGOs,
contractors, artisans, etc.), carry out pilot studies on source protection and the implementation of
the environmental guidelines, etc. Studies carried out under this component contributed to sector
norms and policies. For instance, consultancies about the design of the process and operations
manual for investment programs shaped the organization of the Department of National
Sanitation and Water for All Program. The three resolutions related to the sanitation policy for
rural areas and small towns were adopted by MVCS were: (i) Investment Funds INVERSAN
Ley Nº29061; (ii) Policy Incentives to Access Investment Financing in the Sanitation Sub-Sector
RM. Nº681-2008-VIVIENDA; and (iv) Guidelines for Regulation of Sanitation Services in
Small Towns Population Centers RM. Nº269-2009-VIVIENDA. However, in terms of policy,
PRONASAR had limited impact in the end, given the new direction taken by the government at
the time of Project closing, to focus on the supply-drive approach and less on the social
component to help speed up infrastructure development.

Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision. This component
financed the activities of the Project Management Unit (PMU), including equipment & software,
contractual staff, external audits, the set-up and maintenance of financial management and
project monitoring & evaluation (M&E) systems, vehicles for the FONCODES field offices, as
well as special consultancies.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The measures of efficiency used at the appraisal stage for both the original loan and the
additional financing were net present value (NPV) and the economic rate of return (ERR) for
each sub-project. A sample of 9 sub-projects covering 13 communities was selected for the
economic analysis of the project for the ICR.32 These projects were selected from the list of
communities where the impact evaluation was carried out in order to have as much actual data as
possible instead of assumptions in the calculations. The average NPV was US$ -40,781 and the
average ERR was 3%, a substantial difference from those calculated in 2010 for the Additional
Financing and at the PAD stage.

At the project’s original appraisal in 2002, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out for 11 potential
sub-projects, which had an average rate of return of 71 percent and an average net present value
of US$ 10,940. At the project’s original appraisal in 2002, a cost-benefit analysis was carried
out for 11 potential sub-projects, which had an average rate of return of 71 percent and an
average net present value of US$ 10,940. The original analysis did not attempt to calculate the
overall rate of return for the entire project given the demand-driven nature of PRONASAR
which gave the community multiple choices of capital investments. For the additional financing
in 2010, a detailed cost-benefit analysis was undertaken and at that time, it was for a sample of
36 potentially eligible subprojects (11 in the region of Apurimac, 3 in the region of Amazonas,
and 22 in the region of Cusco) spanning the available technology choices for communities and
using the same methodology as that employed in the appraisal of the Original Project. The size
range of the systems analyzed was between 42 to 243 connections. In spite of investment cost
increases, each of these projects is economically feasible, and they have an average net present
value of US$161,894 and an average economic rate of return of 17 percent. This average rate of
return is lower than the 71 percent average rate of return calculated at Project appraisal, and can
be largely explained by the cost increases discussed in this paper

The two key drivers of this negative difference in efficiency between the two earlier calculations
and at the ICR stage can be attributed to: (i) lack of health benefits of the project, as evidenced
by the impact evaluation, which found that the impact on diarrhea for children under 5 was not
found to be statistically significant; (ii) lack of savings on coping costs for inadequate water
supply because more households were found to be boiling their water in 2014 (55%) than in the
baseline in 2005 (0%). However, it should be noted that even though there was lack of savings
on coping costs for water, it can also be taken as a good sign that people are now boiling their
water before drinking, which means that community education campaigns might have been
effective at instilling good habits to improve water supply at the household level. It is also not
surprising to see more people boiling water since the data show that not all the JASSs were
necessarily treating the water they were serving in an adequate and effective manner. Thus, the
methodology for the economic analysis was slightly revised at ICR stage given these changes
and also to take into account the on-site sanitation benefits, which were not included in the
previous economic efficiency calculations, given the planned variety in household technology
choices. In the end, over 90% of the households opted for a ventilated dry pit latrine, so this was
taken into account in the efficiency analysis.
32
  It was not possible to use the same sample from 2010 because the work in those communities had not been
completed by the time of project closing and the expansion to the new areas became more limited.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

One of the positive aspects of the PRONASAR project is the design and implementation of an
impact evaluation (IE) study which measured the impact of the project between 2005 (baseline)
and 2014 (endline)33. The focus of the evaluation was on Component 1: Water Supply and
Sanitation in Rural Areas, which consisted of two types of interventions: 1A: rehabilitation,
expansion, and improvement of existing systems; and 1B: construction of new systems. In both
cases, the intervention also included the financing of latrines or basic sanitation facilities;
training in hygiene education, management, operation, and maintenance; and the strengthening
of the capacities of the district municipalities in supervision and the JASSs.

The main objective of the IE was to determine whether the project had achieved its intended
impact and outcomes, asking the fundamental question – the counterfactual: What would have
happened if the program/intervention had not occurred? The baseline carried out in 2005 covered
a sample of 43 localities in eight departments included in the first and second call for bids for
PRONASAR.

The methodology included the following:             household surveys (860 total households
interviewed); JASS or similar committee surveys (43 local committees interviewed); and district
municipality surveys (19 districts interviewed). Survey questionnaires were generated and
applied in both the baseline and endline studies, which were quantitative in nature.

Health, Hygiene, WSS Access and Sustainable Management – PRONASAR’s Impacts

The tables below summarize the main findings of the impact evaluation in terms of the impact of
the interventions on health and sanitation access in the intervention areas, showing the treatment
effect for each indicator (difference between treatment and control groups or intervention and
non-intervention areas as well as the difference between the two periods, 2005 and 2015). Each
table shows the statistical significance per indicator (p-value), using a “difference of difference”
methodology/statistical test to measure treatment effect, with the exception of Indicator 1.6,
which deals with JASS. A simple statistical test was used (Fisher test, which looks at the
difference between the periods between the intervention and non-intervention areas) given the
small sample of localities with JASS (24 in the baseline and 30 in the endline).

At the impact level, the IE found that in the medium term, there was no statistically significant
impact for Indicators 1.1 and 1.2 below related to health and hygiene, for both treatments.
However, there were positive, statistically significant results in Indicators 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5. For
indicator 1.6, there was a positive result (18.8% treatment effect) for the rehabilitation system.

Indicators Related to PRONASAR’s Intended Outcomes

(a) Increasing sustained use of water supply facilities. One very significant positive outcome
    of PRONASAR is the increased sustainability of water supply systems which were
    rehabilitated. The treatment effect is 42%, which means that the difference between the
    intervention and non-intervention areas in terms of functionality of the systems was 42%. In
    2005, only 15% of the intervention areas had systems that functioned without major
    problems while in 2014, this has increased dramatically to 69%. In contrast, the non-
    intervention areas only experienced a 27% increase between these two periods.

     A few other statistically significant results are included below to further show what
     PRONASAR has achieved in the last decade or so of implementation. The results are much
     better for the new systems compared to the rehabilitated systems in terms of the indicators
     used below, but that is to be expected because the key indicator to look at in terms of
     sustainability of water systems, as measured by the impact evaluation is the percentage of
     systems which are functioning better, without major issues. This was one of the main
     objectives of the project and perhaps one of the key contributions of PRONASAR moving
     forward.

                         Indicator                                      Type of Intervention
                                                               New System           Rehabilitated System

  The treatment effect was calculated by the consultants, SASE Consultores, in determining the impact of the
project in the endline study.

                                          * = p<10%; **=p<5%; ***=p<1%


     In general, the degree of satisfaction with the quality of water supply is quite high among
     households in intervention areas, though this is also high in non-intervention communities
     (Intervention areas: from 64% to 91% and non-intervention areas from 84% to 88%).
     Satisfaction with their sanitation facilities increased, as well, but it was not statistically
     significant for both types of intervention, new construction and rehabilitation. In addition,
     families were also satisfied with the management by the JASS, but it was not statistically
     significant for rehabilitated systems (80%, compared to non-intervention areas, which was
     76%). For new systems with newly formed JASS, the level of satisfaction was 42% among
     households. While this was statistically significant, it still seems a bit low.

(b) Increasing sustained use of sanitation facilities. A smaller but also significant increase of
    11 percentage points can be observed in the impact of the PRONASAR in the increased use
    of hygienic sanitation in its intervention areas compared to those that did not benefit from the
    Project (p<1%). There was a dramatic increase in the percentage of men, women, and
    children over three years of age who used latrines35 in the intervention areas compared to
    non-intervention areas. For both new and rehabilitated systems financed by the project, this
    percentage increase was 59 percent between 2005 and 2014, a significant difference from the
    non-intervention areas where the latrine usage rate only increased by 16 percent for new
    systems and 36 percent for new systems in the same time period (p<1%).

(c) Strengthening local communities’ capacity to manage services.              In many ways, the
     project helped strengthen local communities to manage, operate and maintain their water and
     sanitation service. Below are select indicators that show this as well as some which show a
     negative effect such as in the percentage of JASS that know the method of calculating family
     contributions.

(d) Strengthening municipal - district and provincial - level capacity to plan and oversee
    water and sanitation services to rural communities in a sustainable and cost effective way.
    The key indicators related to capacity building of local governments show a negative effect.
    Below are select indicators that show the impact of PRONASAR on local governments,
    which can be summarized as low.

   the principal management activities of
   the JASSs

(e) Improving health and hygiene practices. The project had no impact on household health
   and hygiene practices compared to localities in non-intervention areas. The evaluation study
   shows no impact of the project on the percentage of children under five with diarrhea in the
   last 15 days and on the percentage of mothers with adequate handwashing practices
   compared to the control group. Furthermore, the percentage of latrines without flies, bad
   odor, and that are clean dropped from baseline to endline, showing a worsening of hygiene
   practices in the communities, as can be seen in the table below.
