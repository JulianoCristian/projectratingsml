                         Modify the finances percentages to fully utilize all of the loan’s funds before the Project’s new closing date. Also, the notification of the loan closing date and grace period was duly
                         signed by the Country Director and the letter has been already distributed to the Government. This grace period is of 4 months and this will allow the project to pay for goods and

                         The Project's progress towards the Project Development Objectives is considered Moderately Unsatisfactory as Project expected physical targets will not be met. It is expected that
                         256.400 people will have gained access to potable water and 180.600 to improved sanitation services, e.i. respectively 82% and 74% of the Project targets. By June 19, 2013, 84%
                         of the loans have been disbursed (U.S. $ 67'106, 280). It is expected that 95% of the two loans will be disbursed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         PRONASAR will maintain a steady team to take charge of project up to the complete execution of the remaining on going contracts. The latter will require U.S. $ 18'000, 000 for
                         completion, counting with the available resources allocated to the project by the MEF. An impact evaluation of the Component 1 will be carried out and results presented in October
                         2013.
