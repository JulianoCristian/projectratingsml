                         The additional financing loan of US$30 million became effective in March 2011, and the Project continues to be on track for the achievement of its PDO. Component 3, capacity
                         building, has been fully implemented and Component 2, water supply and sanitation for small cities, is expected to close at the end of August, with only a few pending activities to

                         date. The pace of execution of Component 1, water supply and sanitation for small rural communities, is subject to an appropriate budget allocation by the government. Available
                         resources might not be enough to complete all activities envisioned under Component 1; thus, the Project scope and budget will be reviewed and adjusted by MEF. No major issues
                         were identified regarding fiduciary management or safeguards.
