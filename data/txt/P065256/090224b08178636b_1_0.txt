                         The Project's progress towards the PDO isconsidered Moderately Satisfactory as a result of lack of progress in achieving the project expected targets and ensuring sustainability of
                         investments under Component 1 (water supply and sanitation for small rural communities). With a little more than a year remaining before project closing, 39% of the loan remains to

                         The last supervision mission encountered a lack of social support to the communities in which works construction was ongoing or about to start. This social support is a key part of
                         the methodology developed and implemented by the Project in the last nine years and is in line with sector best practices. Its absence is considered a shortcoming in project
                         implementation, as it is causing implementation delays and could compromise the long-term sustainability for the systems being built.

                         No major issues were identified regarding fiduciary management or environmental safeguards.
