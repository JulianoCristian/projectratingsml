       National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project -\n            Pronasar for Peru was judged to be moderately\n            unsatisfactory.  The Bank and borrower performance were\n            moderately unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome\n            was high. Significant changes included restructuring of\n            project methodology and implementation. Several lessons were\n            learned. Accelerating water and sanitation services requires\n            a common strategy and the simplification of the\n            country's complex administrative processes. A more\n            decentralized approach to planning, execution and monitoring\n            of projects needs to be emphasized to go to scale and ensure\n            sustainability, supported by a strong center and continuous\n            capacity building and institutional strengthening. Municipal\n            co-financing and community contribution requirements need to\n            be better adapted to the local context. Community\n            participation in planning and operations underpins\n            sustainability, but adequate financial incentives are\n            necessary for continued participation. It is important to\n            think more holistically and involve other sectors in order\n            to achieve the higher level impact of improved health benefits."}, "docdt": "2014-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
