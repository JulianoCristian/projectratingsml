                         modality of adult education based on competences. At the same time MoE has launched the bidding process to produce and print new textbooks and educational materials for
                         students and teachers in the adult education programs. Finally, the loan was restructured on September 15th, 2010 to respond to the Ministry of Labor request to pilot a Temporary
                         Employment Program to improve the Government capacity to address the impact of the economic crisis that affected employment.
