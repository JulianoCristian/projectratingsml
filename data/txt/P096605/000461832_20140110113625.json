Republic had an overall moderately satisfactory\n            outcome, with the performances of the Bank and the borrower\n            being deemed moderately satisfactory as well. Of the five\n            project development objective indicators, one exceeded the\n            target, two were achieved, and two were partially achieved.\n            Of the fifteen intermediate outcome indicators, seven\n            exceeded the target, four were achieved, three were\n            partially achieved, and one was not achieved. Significant\n            lessons learned during the project implementation include:\n            1) results from the Youth Employment Program impact\n            evaluation point to positive albeit modest overall labor\n            market outcomes; 2) there are trade-offs between equity and\n            efficiency objectives in the context of skills development\n            programs; 3) a sound system of incentives is crucial to the\n            success of skills development programs; 4) focusing on soft\n            skills can improve effectiveness of training programs; 5)\n            women appear to be particularly susceptible to the potential\n            positive impact from skills building programs targeted to\n            poor, unskilled youth; and 6) conducting a curricula\n            assessment should be a pre-condition of any project\n            activities focusing on the development, publishing and\n            distribution of learning and teaching materials."}, "docdt": "2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
