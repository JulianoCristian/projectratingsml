                         2012, plus several audio and video-conferences held with Ministry of Education (MINERD).The key development objective of the project (training at-risk youth) has been achieved
                         and the target (32,000 youth trained) set in the development objective indicators was exceeded and is expected to reach 38,000 beneficiaries by June 2013 (new closing date of the
                         project). A last round of training courses was launched in November 2012 and as of December 2012, 35,848 have graduated from the program.

                         The project's main component has been implemented timely and efficiently, allowing the implementing agency (Ministry ofLabor, MoL) to save US$2.7million.whichwas reallocated to
                         include a new fourth component in 2010. The main activity carried out with the resources from component 2 (institutional strengthening) is the impact evaluation of the youth training
                         program. The survey is still in the field and is expected to finish by end-March 2013.

                         Component 3(Basic Adult Education, EBA), implemented by the Ministry of Education (MINERD) has had a sluggish disbursement pace due to the failure of the competitive selection
                         process carried out to select a firm to elaborate and publish the textbooks of the new EBA curricula. MINERD presented a strategy to the Bank to complete the remaining activities
                         with individual consultants and initial progress has been made towards the elaboration of the twelve modules of the new education curricula. MINERD has recently launched a call for
                         proposals to competitively select a firm to print the first four modules of the new Adult Education curricula.

                         The temporary employment program ‘Santiago Trabaja’, implemented as a pilot program in component 4, reached 4,335 beneficiaries as of December 2012 (exceeding the initial
                         target by 8.3%). The last round of sub-projects is currently taking place and will close in April 2013.
