1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Dominican youth, particularly the poor, face structural barriers to enter labor
markets, including insufficient education, life skills, and job skills to make the transition
from school to work. Exacerbating this already precarious situation, a banking crisis
unleashed in 2003 had decreased the chances for youth to enter the labor market,
particularly those who were poor and unemployed. During the crisis, the youth
unemployment rate increased by roughly a third from the 2003 level to reach 31 percent for
ages 15-24 by 2005, as compared to 17 percent for the population at large (World Bank
2005).
2.      The operation responded to the urgent need to provide more opportunities to
disadvantaged youth from poor families and with little schooling. The project formed part
of a larger effort on the part of the Government of the Dominican Republic (GDR) to
strengthen the country’s social protection system and was complementary to other
operations, including the Bank-financed Social Protection Investment Project (P90010; for
US$1.4 million; approved in November 2005), and the Inter-American Development Bank-
financed (IADB) Labor Markets and Social Transfers Project (DR-L1006; for US$10
million; approved in November 2005).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
3.     The Project's Development Objective was to support the GDR in improving the
employability of poor, at-risk youth by building their work experience and life skills, and
expanding second-chance education programs to complete their formal education. 1 The
corresponding Key Outcome Indicators (KOIs) were:
    At least 65 percent of the Programa Juventud y Empleo (PJyE) graduates are employed
     or self-employed six months after program completion.
    PJyE graduates have earnings 10 percent higher than the control group.
    At least 80 percent of additional students from the Adult Education basic and secondary
     equivalency programs (Adult Basic Education (EBA), and Adult Secondary Education
     (PREPARA), respectively) obtain their basic and secondary degrees.
    Decrease in risky behaviors (e.g., substance abuse, cigarette use, alcohol use,
     unprotected sex, gang participation) and increase in self-esteem. 2

   There are some variations between the KOIs as defined in the PAD’s main text (p. 14) and the Project
Results Framework (p. 43-44). This ICR adopts the ones in the Results Framework, as they do not represent
significant differences from those in the main text and are the ones that had been used during project
supervision by both the Bank team and the Borrower. Moreover, these are the ones reflected in the Project
Manual, to which the Loan Agreement explicitly identifies as the ones to be used to monitor and evaluate the
Program (paragraph 2, Schedule 2).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
4.     The PDO was expanded as part of a Level One restructuring that took place in
August 2010 to reflect the inclusion of a Temporary Employment Program (TEP) in the
Santiago province—Santiago Trabaja—under the restructured Project. The revised PDO
was to support the Borrower in improving the employability of: (a) poor at-risk youth by
building their work experience and life skills and expanding second-chance education
programs to complete their formal education, and (b) poor, low-skilled, long-term
unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 65.
5.       An additional KOI was included in the original Project Results Framework (PRF) to
reflect the change in the PDO:
    Between 2,500 and 4,000 beneficiaries participate in the TEP.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
6.       As originally designed, the Project aimed at benefiting primarily poor, at-risk youth.
In the case of PJyE, the enrollment of beneficiaries was made by training providers and the
eligibility criteria were verified by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) on the basis of self-
reported information. As a result of the 2010 restructuring, the Project’s beneficiaries also
included poor, low-skilled, long-term unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 65.
The selection of TEP beneficiaries was based on a profiling strategy and the application of
an employability index to prioritize beneficiaries from the pool of enrolled unemployed.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
7.     Component 1: Consolidate and expand the Youth and Employment Program
(Programa Juventud y Empleo - PJyE) to provide increased access to a first work
experience for youth at risk (US$22 million, including US$18 million in Bank financing):
As requested by the GDR, this component aimed at broadening the PJyE’s coverage to
focus more intensively on poor and disadvantaged youth and expanding its content by
supporting pilot training courses and internships designed to promote entrepreneurship and
self-employment, in addition to the Program’s previous focus on private and public sector
employers.
8.      Component 2: Build capacity in the then Secretary of Labor (SET) 3 and the
National Training Institute (INFOTEP) to more effectively focus on at-risk youth (US$2
million total, all of which was to be financed by Bank): The objective of this component
was to improve the institutional capacity to reach disadvantaged out-of school youth
through strengthened program coordination, implementation, and evaluation, including the
gradual transition of the PJyE to the National Training Institute (INFOTEP) in order to
foster the sustainability of the program’s outcomes.

 The 2010 constitutional reform in the Dominican Republic converted the then Secretaries into Ministries.

9.      Component 3: Strengthen and expand the ‘Second Chance’ education programs
EBA and PREPARA (US$9.8 million total, including US$5 million in Bank financing):
This component aimed at strengthening and expanding primary and secondary equivalency
programs (EBA and PREPARA, respectively) focusing on accelerated courses with
improved materials, modules in life skills, as well as strengthening the institutional capacity
of the Department for Youth and Adult Education (DYAE) to implement the expansion of
these programs and monitor their results and impact over time.

1.6 Revised Components
10.      Component 4: Support a Pilot Temporary Employment Program (US$2 million
total, all of which was to be financed by Bank): This component, which was added under
the 2010 restructuring, provided support to pilot a TEP to reach between 2,500 to 4,000
beneficiaries. The overall duration of the TEP was 18 months, with individual beneficiaries
participating for four months. The TEP was targeted to selected municipalities in the
province of Santiago, in which employment was negatively affected as a result of the crisis.

1.7 Other significant changes
11.     In addition to the change in the Project’s PDO to reflect the change in the target
population and the incorporation of a new component to support a pilot TEP, the following
changes were introduced under the 2010 Level One Project restructuring: i) the
environmental safeguard category of the Project changed from C to B as a result of physical
works under the new TEP activity, triggering a new safeguard (i.e., OP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment); ii) Project funds were reallocated to finance the new component, creating a
new category of eligible expenditures and allowing financing of the new TEP component
costs from May 1, 2010 onwards; iii) the Closing Date was extended by twelve months
from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012; iv) the definition of “operational costs” was modified
and definitions for “remuneration for temporary workers” and “life skills learning courses
“were introduced in the Loan Agreement to reflect the new TEP component; and v) the
target value of an intermediate outcome indicator under Component 3 (i.e., number of
teachers trained and certified in adult education methodology) was reduced from 7,000 to
4,500.
12.     A Level Two Restructuring took place in 2012, which introduced the following
changes: i) given its sluggish implementation, US$1 million from Component 3
(implemented by the Ministry of Education - MoE) was reallocated to Component 1
(implemented by the Ministry of Labor - MoL); and ii) the Closing Date was extended for a
second time from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013, to allow the MoL to provide additional
training courses to at-risk youth, as well as to complete pending activities, such as the final
survey of the impact evaluation, which was carried out at the household level. 4

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Strengths:
13.     The Project was part of the GDR’s larger efforts to strengthen the social protection
system. It was also fully aligned with the GDR’s strategy toward youth development. The
Dominican Republic is one of the few countries in the world with a congressionally
approved General Youth Law, passed in 2000, which established both a Ministry of Youth
as well as a Youth Policy. The Youth Policy called for the development of educational
policies to foster a holistic approach to youth development, with corresponding strategies
for other sector policies, programs and community development initiatives. It also
guaranteed the active participation of youth themselves in the formal and non-formal
educational process. Youth representatives participated actively in the Project’s preparation
and their involvement continued during implementation.
14.    The Project was fully consistent with the focus of the World Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS; Report No. 31627-DO; 2005), which emphasized improving
competitiveness, and achieving greater social equity through investing in human
development and enhancing the access to and quality of basic services.
15.    The operation built upon an already successful Youth Employment Program that
had been originally financed with IADB support, which enhanced the Project’s probability
of success, reduced Project start-up times, and capitalized on the existing institutional
capacity of the MoL’s PCU.
16.     The Project reflected state-of-the-art knowledge on active labor market
interventions, building on the lessons learned from the previous version of the PJyE, and
other youth skills development programs in the region. While the core of the PJyE
remained the same—i.e., two-stage training followed by an internship—some innovations
were incorporated, including: i) a closer relationship between the training providers and the
firms providing the internships to develop training courses that reflected the firms’ specific
needs; and ii) the life-skills section of the training, which had been identified by employers
as the most valuable component of the training, was revamped and strengthened.
17.    The PJyE also embedded key principles of an integrated workforce development
system, including linkages between training and adult education programs, competition
among private providers, inputs from employers in training content, and quality control
mechanisms such as accreditation standards.
18.      Although logistically challenging, the Project’s design brought together key
institutional actors in workforce development—i.e., the MoL, INFOTEP, and MoE—and
relied on them to play their natural roles within the context of the Project. This strategy
eventually proved very successful, as it allowed capitalizing on the institutional capacity of
the various actors and contributed toward the sustainability of outcomes.
19.     The Project‘s overall design effectively balanced the role of public and private
actors. Specifically, the Project provided support to the MoL, INFOTEP and the MoE to
enhance their financing, quality assurance, and regulatory roles. It also relied on existing
private sector providers for the provision of training. The Project was grounded in a
competitive, demand-driven design that introduced a set of incentives to induce the sound
                                              4
performance of both, private training providers and trainees, including output-based
payment schemes. In addition, training providers played a key role in helping align training
content with the skills needs of private firms by seeking their input and securing internships
for trainees.
20.     The Bank’s and the IADB’s projects were in full alignment. They both provided
support to the PJyE and the randomized impact evaluation and, individually, supported
complementary actions. A randomized experimental design was embedded in the Project’s
design, which set the foundations for a robust evaluation of the PJyE’s impact on both labor
market and non-labor market outcomes.
Weaknesses
21.     In hindsight, it is now apparent that several key weaknesses in the curricula of the
EBA and PREPARA programs supported under Component 3 that were overlooked at
appraisal. Specifically, as per findings during mid-2009, the curricula supporting the two
programs were excessively long and lacked flexibility, neither of them was based on
competencies, and PREPARA did not have a curricula specifically designed for adults, but
instead shared the same curricula as the regular secondary education. In the absence of a
drastic overhaul of their curricula, the activities envisioned under the Project (e.g., revising
the textbooks) were not relevant. 5 In this context, the Bank endorsed the MoE’s decision to
proceed with a review of the EBA curricula and, once that task was completed, reviewed
the textbooks to support the resulting curricular changes.
22.    The Project Result Framework exhibited some weaknesses, which are discussed
under Section 2.3.

2.2 Implementation
Factors outside the control of the Government and the implementing agency
23.     The 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing global recession had a negative impact on
the country’s economic activity and overall employment. The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) approved a US$1.7 billion Stand-By Agreement for the GDR in November 2009 to
support the country’s strategy to cope with the negative global environment by
implementing countercyclical policies and reduce vulnerabilities. The 2010 Project
restructuring was consistent with the GDR’s coping strategy and IMF support, as it allowed
providing temporary employment opportunities to the Santiago province, which was
negatively affected by the global economic crisis. However, limited budget allocations for
counterpart funds and disbursement ceilings throughout the Project’s lifetime in a context
of fiscal austerity slowed down its implementation.

depth.


                                                  5
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control
24.    The project got started off slowly with an 18 month effectiveness delay due to the
need for congressional approval of the Loan.
25.      The Project benefited from strong support from top authorities within the MoL. This
support, in turn, was reflected in the high performance of the PCU that was responsible for
overall project coordination and M&E, as well as the smooth implementation the PJyE.
Even though the Project received continuous support from top MoE authorities throughout
its lifetime, recurrent changes within the DYAE hindered the implementation of activities
focused on the EBA and PREPARA programs under Component 3 (i.e., there were six
different DYAE Directors during the Project’s lifetime, four Directors of the EBA and
PREPARA programs and three different technical teams).
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
26.     The commitment of the MoL’s PCU toward fostering participation and
collaboration was a key determinant on the rich relationships forged under the Project
among the various institutional actors, including the MoE, INFOTEP, MoL, and the
Ministry of Youth. Although intangible, the relationships built under the Project are highly
valuable, as they have served to build trust and coordination among the various institutional
actors, including incentives to foster the integration between training and adult education
programs.
27.     As mentioned above, implementation of Component 3 was sluggish as a result of
several factors, including high rotation of DYAE authorities and technical teams, the
decision to transform the EBA curricula into a modular, competency-based one, and delays
in the procurement of key Project activities, such as the publishing of learning materials. As
a result, the disbursement of funds represented only 72 percent of the funds originally
assigned to this component. 6 The remaining funds were reallocated to Component 1 under
the 2012 Project restructuring.
28.    The demand-driven mechanisms envisioned under the PJyE did not fully work as
planned. Although employers’ willingness to pay a stipend to PJyE interns signals that they
valued the trainees’ skills, the following weaknesses were identified:
     Although training providers were required to include written commitments from at least
      one local firm to offer internships to trainees as part of their proposals, a survey among
      employers that participated in the PJyE revealed that only 39 percent of them were
      consulted about their specific demands for skills. Thus, training offerings have been
      fairly general in terms of their content and not tailored to specific employers.
     There have been, however, some exceptions in which new courses were developed to
      respond to the specific needs of employers, who, in turn, guaranteed hiring a certain
      number of permanent positions (i.e., Empleo Seguro). However, as denoted by the
      lower than expected new courses that were developed under the Program (i.e., IO 7),
      the incentives (i.e., greater payments to training providers, and customized course


6
 The original allocation for Component 3 was US$5.0 million. Later on, this amount was reduced to US$4.0
million under the second Project restructuring, of which US3.7 million were actually disbursed.


                                                   6
      offerings for employers in exchange for guaranteed employment of interns) were not
      effective in strengthening the alignment between training contents and employers’
      demand.
     Due to the time lag between the presentation of bids by training providers, the awarding
      of contracts, and the completion of training, some employers were no longer able to
      offer the internships initially promised. Thus, many trainees were placed in internships
      offered by employers different from those originally contacted by the training providers
      and, in some cases; the internships did not fully match the training they had received.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
29.     M&E Design: The PJyE’s implementation was supported by a robust management
information system (MIS) that incorporated all key users (i.e., the PCU, INFOTEP, and
training providers).   In addition, the Project placed a strong emphasis on the
implementation of the MoE’s School Management System (Sistema de Gestión de Centros
Educativos – SGCE) in the orbit of the EBA and PREPARA adult and youth education
programs.
30.     As noted earlier, one of the Project’s great strengths was the incorporation of a
randomized experimental evaluation in its design that included follow-up phone surveys to
PJyE graduates and an exhaustive household survey to be conducted 18 to 24 months after
graduation. 7 The evaluation’s rigorous methodological design was carried out by an
interdisciplinary team from the MoL, the IADB and the World Bank. The core
experimental evaluation was complemented by a series of studies that explored specific
aspects of the program, such as perceptions of training providers and employers.
31.     Although robust, the Project Result Framework (PRF) exhibited some weaknesses,
some of which reflect the challenges inherent to capturing the impact of skill development
projects aimed at enhancing employability of their beneficiaries. Specifically:
   Adopting an explicit definition of employability at appraisal would have been desirable
    to ensure the alignment of the PRF with the PDO.
   KOI 1 focused on the absolute employment rate of PJyE graduates (i.e., At least 65
    percent of the PJyE graduates are employed or self-employed six months after program
    completion), which is greatly affected by factors, such as economic activity and the
    structure of labor markets, which go beyond the skills training provided under the
    Project. In this regard, the PRF could have built upon the built-in experimental design
    and focus on the differences in employment outcomes between PJyE graduates and the
    control group.
   The target value for the earnings-based indicator (i.e., KOI 2) was set too high (i.e.,
    PJyE graduates have earnings 10 percent higher than control group.) considering that an

 The household survey included 15 modules that collected data on household composition and socioeconomic
characteristics, labor force participation, labor history, assets, time use, courses and the internship,
consumption, health status, risk aversion, future expectations, pregnancy history, dwelling materials and basic
skills, including non-cognitive skills and self-esteem.


                                                      7
      impact evaluation of previous round of the PJyE had shown an impact effect of 7 to 10
      percent conditional on employment (Card et al, 2011).
     KOI 3, which was added during restructuring to measure the impact of the newly added
      Temporary Employment Program (i.e., Between 2,500 and 4,000 beneficiaries
      participate in the TEP), was limited, as it only captured the employment outputs rather
      than the employability of the target population.

32.     M&E Implementation: The PJyE’s MIS and MoE’s SGCE were implemented as
anticipated—the former one early on during the Project’s lifecycle and the latter in 2009.
The Bank and the IADB coordinated efforts with the MoL to carry out the PJyE’s
experimental evaluation, applying the same evaluation methodology to different cohorts.
In addition, the Bank carried out a complementary evaluation based on another cohort of
trainees to analyze the impact of providing only life skills versus traditional technical
training.
33.     M&E Utilization: The PJyE’s MIS effectively supported all stages of
implementation as well as the operationalization of a results-based payment scheme to
training providers. It also permitted close monitoring of progress toward the achievement of
outputs and intermediate outcomes. PJyE program managers have also utilized the MIS
data to evaluate its implementation and to improve subsequent phases. As a result of the
SGSC implementation, the DYAE now can effectively monitor enrollment, drop-out and
completion rates at the student level.
34.     The PJyE’s experimental evaluation has permitted the rigorous assessment of its
overall impact on employment, wages and non-cognitive skills, as well as, the drawing out
of valuable lessons that can be useful in the design of similar programs in the region and
beyond. While no impact evaluation was put in place for TEP, data from the Project’s
M&E system was crossed checked with data from the Social Security Administration to
monitor formal employment rates of TEP beneficiaries after the program’s completion.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
35.     Environmental and Social Safeguards: Performance in relation to environmental
and social safeguards was satisfactory. The Project’s environmental safeguard category
changed from C to B as a result of physical works under the new TEP activity, under the
2010 restructuring, triggering a new safeguard (i.e., OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment).
The Project’s compliance with the Environmental Management Framework was
satisfactory and the minor weaknesses that were identified during implementation were
subsequently corrected.
36.     Financial Management – FM: FM performance was moderately satisfactory,
mainly as a result of weak FM performance under Component 3, including the closing of
the MoE’s Special Account in 2008 due to inactivity. Both the MoL’s PCU and the MoE
utilized the FM country systems—i.e., the sub-system within the GoRD’s integrated
financial administration system for projects with external financing (Sistema de Unidades
Ejecutoras de Préstamos Externos - UEPEX). Financial audits for the last fiscal year were
conducted on both implementing entities, and did not identify significant shortcomings,
while the last external audit for the Project has already been completed.


                                               8
37.    Procurement: Performance in terms of procurement was moderately satisfactory,
mostly as a result of weaknesses in the application of the procurement guidelines both in
the MoL and MoE, as well as a failed competitive process for the development and
publishing of textbooks under Component 3. 8 These weaknesses were due to: i) lack of a
dedicated, full time procurement specialist in the MoL’s PCU; and ii) low procurement
capacity and high staff turnover at the MoE.
38.      Compliance with DCA Covenants: At closing all covenants had been met.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
39.     Two new operations continue to support the GDR’s efforts to foster the
employability of unskilled vulnerable population groups, particularly unskilled youth, as
well as the development of labor market institutions. In addition to its continuous support
for the PJyE, IADB’s Program to Support the National Employment System Project (DR-
L1036, US$20.00 million, approved on July 20, 2011) focuses on improving labor
intermediation, including reducing the duration of job and hiring searches. The Bank’s
Flexible Employment System Project (P131109; US$20.00 million; under preparation) is
aimed at strengthening the National Employment Service to expand the Temporary
Employment Program. It will also support the consolidation of the PJyE into more
permanent and sustainable policies as part of INFOTEP’s regular functions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

40.     The Project’s objective of enhancing the employability of poor, at-risk population
groups, particularly youth, continues to be highly relevant. Unemployment has stubbornly
remained at around 14 percent despite strong growth in 2009 and 2010. Likewise,
unemployment is disproportionally concentrated among the youth (24 percent) and women
(20 percent), with almost one third of all young women in the labor force being
unemployed in 2011. As mentioned above, given the positive experience of the PJyE, the
MOL has decided to continue this Program and provide sustainable financing through
INFOTEP, increasing the intensity of life-skills courses and extending the duration of on-
the-job training. This is clearly in line with the priorities of the new administration, which
aims at creating 400,000 ‘living’ jobs (empleos dignos) as part of the Great Social Pact. The
Project’s objectives are also consistent with the National Development Plan 2010-2030
(Estrategia Nacional de Desarrollo – END), which articulates a long term vision to
transform the Dominican Republic, with an emphasis on achieving a society with equal


8
   The design and printing of Adult Education Modules required extensive discussions with technical teams in
MINERD that were constantly changing, which resulted in additional delays. Two competitive procurement
processes were launched with no success. Competition was low and prices were not acceptable for the
Ministry, this required a shift in the strategy. One of the possible reasons that could have caused the failure of
these processes was that the size of the contract, which did not seem attractive enough for qualified editing
firms to participate and offer feasible prices.


                                                        9
opportunities, including education, the gradual reduction of poverty, and the generation of
decent employment. Particularly notable is the high priority that the new administration has
given to the eradication of illiteracy, which has been declared a national interest.
Established in 2013, the new presidential flagship program “Quisqueya Aprende Contigo”
seeks to teach nearly 700,000 illiterate youth and adults to read by 2014. This initiative is
conceived as a feeder for the second-chance education programs supported under the
Project, the EBA program in particular. The DYAE is one of the key members of the newly
constituted National Literacy Board that is responsible for implementing this initiative,
with an allocated budget of RD$1,900 million. 9 In addition, the Project’s development
objectives are fully aligned with the Bank’s current Dominican Republic Country
Partnership Strategy 2010-2013 (Report No. 49620-DO, August 12, 2009), which
emphasizes protecting the poor while enhancing competitiveness and strengthening public
institutions for performance accountability.
41.     The relevance of the Project’s design is considered to be Substantial. Component 1
in particular, which focused on the PJyE program, continues to be a central component of
the new Bank-financed and IABD-financed operations. The Project’s embedded
experimental design also contributed to its relevance, as it contributed to the development
of a rigorous, evidence-based knowledge base to enhance both future lending operations
and active labor market policies. Despite oversight in component 3 to recognize the need to
revise the curricula of second-chance programs as a prerequisite for the other activities that
were supported under the Project, the overall design remained relevant.
42.     The relevance of the Project’s Implementation is deemed Substantial, as the two
restructurings introduced the necessary adjustments to ensure the Project’s continuous
relevance in view of changing macroeconomic conditions and implementation experience.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial

43.     Overall PDO achievement is deemed Substantial for both the pre- and post-
restructuring periods. Specifically:
• Pre-restructuring period: As shown in Table 1, the Project exhibited substantial
    achievements in terms of enhancing employability of poor at-risk youth by building
    their work experience and life skills through the PJyE, but only negligible achievement
    by expanding second-chance programs (i.e., EBA and PREPARA). Given that PJyE
    represented the bulk of the Project’s financing (i.e., US$16.6 million for Components 1
    and 2, focused on PJyE compared to only US$3.6 for Component 3, focused on the
    EBA and PREPARA programs), the overall achievement for PDO 1 is considered to be
    substantial for the pre-restructuring period.
• Post-restructuring period: Achievement of PDO 1 continues to be substantial, as no
    modifications were introduced during the restructuring. Achievement of PDO 2, which
    was introduced under the 2010 restructuring, is also considered substantial as, with the

44.      The Project’s achievement of individual PDOs is described below and in Annex 2:

PDO 1 - To improve the employability of poor at-risk youth by: a) building their work experience
          and life skills; and b) expanding second-chance education programs to complete their
          formal education.
Overall, the achievement of PDO 1 is considered to be Substantial. The Project has improved the
employability of participating poor youth by building their work experience and life skills, mainly
through the PJyE, which was the Project’s core intervention. The impact evaluations conducted by
the Bank and the IADB have identified positive impacts in terms of employment, earnings, and
quality of employment for some subsets of the PJyE beneficiaries compared to the control group.
Likewise, the results from the impact evaluation point to non-labor market outcomes, such as higher
self-esteem and improved cognitive skills among PJyE compared to the control group. By helping
the MoL and INFOTEP develop the institutional capacity required to implement skills development
programs aimed at poor at-risk youth, the Project’s impact is not limited to only those trainees that
benefited directly from the PJyE under the Project, but future cohorts as well.
While the Project’s impact in terms of expanding second-chance programs was negligible, it still
had some significant achievements, including ensuring adequate electricity supply in 350 schools
that offer EBA and PREPARA education mainly in the evenings. The adaptation of the EBA
curricula into a flexible, competency-based modality that includes soft skills training is expected to
have a positive impact once it is implemented. As described below, the development of the new
EBA curricula has already had a substantial—albeit unanticipated—impact in the design and
implementation of the literacy flagship program of the new administration. Overall, activities
focused on second-chance programs accounted for 16 %of overall IBRD financing.
The specific achievement under PDO 1 can be summarized as follows:
PDO 1.a - Impact on employability of poor at-risk youth by building their work experience
            and life skills - PJyE
Achievement of intermediate objectives

                                                     11
   Intermediate Objective 1 – The Project fully achieved Intermediate Objective 1, which called
    for the consolidation and expansion of the PJyE to provide increased access to a first work
    experience for youth at risk. Specifically, the PJyE effectively extended its coverage, with over
    38,000 beneficiaries under the Project, exceeding the end-project target of 32,000 by 19%. In
    addition, it reached its target population, as the overwhelming majority of PJyE beneficiaries
    lived in the poorest areas and more than half were women. The PJyE also successfully
    expanded employer participation, with over 3,000 private firms offering internships to PJyE
    graduates, exceeding the end-project target by 50%. In addition, stronger linkages between the
    PJyE and second-chance education programs have been developed, with 27% of PJyE
    beneficiaries being registered in EBA or PREPARA one year after program completion,
    exceeding the end-project target by 35%. Thus, all the targets under Intermediate Indicator 1
    were exceeded, with the exception of one—i.e., the expansion in the number of new course
    offerings, which was significantly smaller than anticipated—24 compared to the end-project
    target of 40 courses—which reflects the generalized nature of the training that was offered by
    training providers under the program as opposed to training offerings customized to the needs
    of specific employers as was hoped for.
 Intermediate Objective 2 – The Project fully achieved Intermediate Objective 2, which called
    for strengthening the institutional capacity to focus on at-risk youth in both the MoL and
    INFOTEP with a special emphasis on program coordination, implementation, and evaluation
    functions. Specifically, the implementation of the PJyE was supported by a robust MIS that
    permitted the implementation of a well-developed set of incentives that aimed to link payments
    to training providers to results (e.g., the final payment being tied to the completion of an
    internship). In addition, the PJyE was subject to a rigorous impact evaluation on the part of both
    the Bank and IADB, thus contributing further to advancing the limited body of knowledge on
    the outcomes of training interventions. It also supported the gradual transition of the PJyE to
    INFOTEP, which provided key institutional support during the PJyE implementation, including
    financing 400 courses. Taking full advantage of INFOTEP’s institutional capacity to support
    the implementation of PJyE was critical not only to ensure the Project’s successful
    implementation but also to help expand the agency’s traditional focus to include unemployed,
    at- risk youth.
Impact on employability of PJyE Program
The Project’s impact, on enhancing employability of the target group by building their work
experience and life skills, is substantial. The full achievement of the Intermediate Objectives 1 and
2 is reflected in the substantial achievement of the three Key Outcome Indicators related to the
PJyE.
 KOI 1 - At least 65% of PJyE graduates are employed or self-employed six months after
    program completion.
    Employment rate reported in the follow-up household survey by PJyE beneficiaries from the
       2008-2009 cohorts was 71.8% (i.e., 110 % level of achievement). 10
 KOI 2 - PJyE graduates have earnings 10%higher than control group.
    While there was no significant impact on earning for PJyE graduates as a whole, there is a
       positive income effect equivalent to roughly 7% of monthly earnings among employed PJyE

                                                 12
      graduates, including women in general and men in Santo Domingo, as well as 5% for women
      in general regardless of employment status. 11 Overall, these two groups represent 67.5% of
      PJyE beneficiaries.
 KOI 4 - Decrease in risky behaviors (substance abuse, cigarette use, alcohol use, unprotected
   sex, gang participation, etc.), and increase in self-esteem.
   A reduction in teenage pregnancy resulting from the reproductive health components of the
      life-skills component. 12
   The Project seems to have had a positive impact on self-esteem, as PJyE graduates,
      particularly females and younger individuals, report higher perceptions about their current
      situation and their expectations about the future. 13
 Other impacts
   In terms of quality of employment, results from the impact evaluations point to increased
      formal employment among PJyE graduates, particularly women that received training, who
      had a 12% increase in the probability of having retirement benefits, health insurance or a
      contract. 14
   PJyE graduates that are working appear to have greater job satisfaction than those in the
      control group, as signaled by a 3% reduction in the desire to seek a different job. 15
   The PJyE had a positive impact on non-cognitive skills as measured by three different scales.
      Scores improve between 0.08 and 0.16 standard deviations with the Program, which, as
      suggested by the literature, might increase employability and quality of employment. 16
   A positive impact of training was also found on alternative measures of life-skills,
      particularly leadership skills, conflict resolution, self-organization and persistency of effort. 17
   PJyE graduates are more likely to participate in political or religious associations than their
      peers in the control group. 18
PDO 1.b - Impact on employability of poor at-risk youth by expanding second-chance
           education programs to complete their formal education - EBA and PREPARA
Achievement of Intermediate Objective
 Intermediate Objective 3 - There was limited progress toward the achievement of this
   Intermediate Objective, which called for the strengthening and expansion of second chance
   education programs EBA and PREPARA. One of the Project’s main contributions in this area
   was the financing of 600 power generators that were installed in 350 schools offering EBA and
   PREPARA programs. Given that these generators provide electricity and thus, lighting, to
   schools that operate mainly in the evenings and that otherwise would have to rely on candles or
   gas lamps, the impact was significant in terms of providing a safer physical environment more
   conducive to learning. Another contribution under the Project was the overhaul of the EBA
   curricula, shifting from a traditional one to a flexible competency-based one that incorporates
   life skills training. Learning materials have been developed for seven of the 12 modules
   corresponding to basic education, four of which have already been published. Over 4,000 EBA
   teachers have been trained in the new curricula, which will be put in practice during this

    academic year for the first three modules. Since the curricular change has not yet been
    implemented, its impact is yet to be realized. However, the work done to develop EBA’s new
    curricula and the preparation of supporting learning and teaching materials permitted the DYAE
    to respond swiftly to the preparation and launching of one of the flagships programs established
    under the new administration—i.e., the Contigo Aprendo Literacy Program.
Impact on employability of second-chance education programs
The Project’s impact on enhancing employability of the target group by expanding second-chance
education programs to complete their formal education is negligible, as the new curricula is yet to
be implemented. This, in turn, is illustrated by the disappointing performance in relation to the
corresponding Key Outcome Indicator:
 KOI 3 - At least 80% of additional students of EBA and PREPARA obtain their basic or
    secondary degrees, respectively.
    Graduation rates have not improved as anticipated, with a 72.7% average aggregate
       graduation for EBA and PREPARA compared to 70% at the beginning of the Project and
       80% end-target. Graduation rates for PREPARA, however, exceeded the target (84.2%),
       while those of EBA are lagging behind (66.3%).
PDO 2 – Improving the employability of poor low-skilled long-term unemployed people between
         the ages of 18 and 65.
Achievement of Intermediate Objective
• Intermediate Outcome 4 - To address the intense negative shock on employment in Santiago in
    2010, the MoL effectively piloted a Temporary Employment Program. The Program provided
    the poor and less employable with an income to help them support their families, which is
    particularly important in times of crisis, but also provides them with a temporary job with
    benefits and health coverage. Based on the experience from the PJyE, Santiago Trabaja
    included a life-skills training program to motivate program graduates to search for a more
    permanent job.
Impact on employability of the TEP
The TEP’s impact on the employability of its beneficiaries beyond the temporary employment
provided under the Project is considered to be Substantial. Life skills training and additional work
experience that they received under the program, as well as potential gains in self-esteem, can be
expected to have a positive effect on participants' future labor market outcomes. The project’s
targets in terms of the number of TEP beneficiaries were met. In addition, after having successfully
implemented the country’s first TEP, the MoL now has the institutional capacity needed to
implement and scale up temporary employment programs.
 KOI 5 - Between 2,500 and 4,000 beneficiaries participate in the TEP
     A total of 3,920 low-income, unskilled long-term unemployed adults completed training
         and their temporary employment, which is at the upper bound of the original 2,000-4,000
         targets.
     TEP beneficiaries gained work experience by working in selected projects managed by non-
         profit organizations and municipalities, including, among others, maintenance of physical
         infrastructure such as street and drainage maintenance, and cleaning of public parks and
         watersheds.
     In addition, TEP beneficiaries can be expected to have enhanced life skills as a result of the




                                                14
        training they received under the program.
       Results obtained from cross checking TEP M&E data with administrative records from the
        Social Security Administration indicate that the formal employment rate of TEP
        beneficiaries increased with respect to non-beneficiaries after the program was completed. 19

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Modest

45.    The Project’s overall economic efficiency is considered to be Modest, given the
economic efficiency for each of the individual components, which can be summarized as
follows:
46.     Youth Employment Program (PJyE): The estimated economic efficiency of the
PJyE is considered to be Modest, with an estimated Internal Economic Rate of Return
(IERR) of at least 5.6 percent. This lower-bound estimated could result in a higher rate if
other more difficult to quantify effects had been included. While the project had direct and
indirect benefits, only a few were quantifiable which could explain the modest estimate of
economic efficiency. The quantifiable economic benefits associated to the PJyE include: i)
the stream of benefits derived from a 7 percent increase in earnings among employed men
living in St. Domingo and 5 percent for all PJyE female graduates over a 20 year life span;
and ii) the cost savings from averted teenage pregnancies considering a 5 percent reduction
among the 5,813 females age 15-19 that participated in the PJyE, based on annual savings
of US$1,318 per pregnancy over a 20 year time horizon. The economic efficiency of the
project, or its IRR, could be higher if other economic benefits, such as those derived from
having health insurance, reduced incarceration and crimes, and improved life skills would
have been possible to quantify. The economic costs included the cost of training under the
PJyE, equivalent to US$15 million.
47.     Second-chance education programs: The economic efficiency of the investment
made to enhance second-chance education programs, EBA in particular, can be expected to
be High. This is as a result of this operation’s contributions to some of the expected labor
market outcomes resulting from the increased earning capacity from graduates of the
literacy program that was designed based on the new EBA curricula. Specifically, the
economic benefits include the productivity gains that can be attributed to the improved
EBA curriculum (as opposed to the presumably less effective curricula that would have
been utilized otherwise). Although there is no data to perform a formal economic analysis,
it can be expected to be considerable given the Program’s extensive coverage (i.e., 700,000
beneficiaries in 2013 alone). For example, considering only a 0.1 percent differential from
the enhanced curriculum in the productivity gains among those enrolled during 2013 alone
and assuming participants have the same characteristics as PJyE participants in terms of
gender and average income, the investments made under Component 3 would yield an

IERR of roughly 85 percent. Indirect benefits with a more effective curriculum for the
literacy program would also include improved competitiveness and sustained economic
growth and accelerated poverty reduction and enhanced equity.
48.     Temporary Employment Program “Santiago Trabaja:” The economic efficiency of
this Program is expected to be Modest. Temporary workers were assigned to work in
projects proposed by non-profit organizations and municipalities. While no formal
economic analysis was performed, these projects can be reasonable expected to have
economic benefits greater than, or at least equal to the wages paid to temporary workers.
Indirect benefits that can also be expected in terms of enhanced life skills of beneficiaries
as a result of the training. These skills and added work experience, as well as the potential
gains in self-esteem resulting from their participation in the TEP can be expected to have a
positive effect on participants' future labor market outcomes, as suggested by the results
obtained from crosschecking TEP data with that of the Social Security Administration.
Given the lack of data on the type of investments under the TEP project, no economic
analysis was performed for this intervention.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

49.     Overall relevance is considered to be Satisfactory. Overall efficacy is considered to
be Substantial, particularly taking into consideration the relative weight of the PJyE in
relation to the other two interventions (i.e., second-chance education programs and TEP).
Finally, the efficiency rating is considered to be Modest for both the pre- and post-
restructuring periods. The combination of these partial ratings yields an overall Satisfactory
rating for both the pre- and post-restructuring periods, respectively (Table 2). In turn, the
overall ratings for the two periods are weighted by the disbursement percentages prior to
and following the 2010 restructuring, yielding an overall weighted rating of 5.00,
equivalent to an overall Satisfactory rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
50.     Improved poverty-based targeting. Through its geographically based targeting, the
PJyE has effectively reached youth living in the poorest areas—equivalent to 95 percent of
its beneficiaries compared to the 60 percent original target. Poverty-based targeting
improved for second-chance education programs EBA and PREPARA, with 76.2 percent of
participants living in the poorest areas according to the DR Poverty Map.

                                                                            16
51.     Improved gender-focused targeting. The PJyE has effectively expanded its targeting
of women, with almost 60 percent of its beneficiaries being female compared to the 45
percent original target and 40 percent at the beginning of the Project. Female participation
also increased in second-chance education programs EBA and PREPARA, in which women
represented 51.2 percent of all participants compared to the 45 percent original target.
Approximately 20 percent of them were single mothers
52.    Disproportionate impact on women: The PJyE seems to have had a greater impact
on female participants in terms of income. In addition, the impact evaluation identified a
reduction in teenage pregnancy by five percentage points in the treatment group (i.e., about
45 percent).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
53.     The Project has played an active role in the creation of dynamic linkages between
the programs under their orbit, including granting a tuition exception to those graduates of
the PJyE that choose to continue their secondary studies under the PREPARA secondary
equivalence program and actively disseminating the PJyE among those enrolled in the EBA
and PREPARA programs. Likewise, by requiring that PJyE training providers work closely
with the private sector identifying training needs and securing internships, the Project has
helped take a first step toward enhancing the pertinence of training. Finally, the Project also
had a substantial institutional impact on INFOTEP, which has expanded its regular course
offerings by including courses that were taught under the PJyE. Likewise, the number of
accredited training providers increased from 170 to 240 approximately, as a result of the
PJyE requirement that made their accreditation mandatory. Finally, after having
implemented the first TEP in the country, the MoL now has the institutional capacity to
duplicate and scale-up this type of program.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
54.     As an indirect effect from the PJyE’s implementation, there has been substantial
progress toward the development of institutions aimed at enhancing the functioning of the
countries’ labor market, including the creation of the National Employment Service
(Servicio Nacional de Empleo - SNE) and a Labor Market Observatory. All PJyE
participants were automatically enrolled in the SNE.
55.     As noted above, the DYAE played a key role in the swift preparation and
implementation of the new Presidential Literacy Program, utilizing the structure of the
flexible curricula and learning materials that had been developed for the EBA program
under the Project. A total of 700,000 illiterate youth and adults have already registered in
the program for 2013 alone. Although this outcome was unintended, it constitutes a
significant Project achievement, particularly in view of the ambitious targets and robust
budget of the Literacy Program.
56.    All PJyE participants have received their national ID card and have opened a bank
account, which are important steps toward their social and financial integration into society.
57.   The PJyE and the lessons learned by the MoL have been widely disseminated
among other countries in the region, being awarded, among other recognitions, Best

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Bank. 20

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

58.     With respect to the PJyE, the MoL will continue to transfer operational
responsibility for training program targeting poor, at-risk youth to the INFOTEP. Such
transfer of responsibility is a natural next step, as INFOTEP has played a central role in the
PJyE’s implementation. The integration of all training programs—i.e., INFOTEP’s
traditional training targeted toward formal workers and training programs targeted toward
poor unemployed youth—under the agency’s regular operations will not only result in
efficiency gains but will also help ensure their sustainability over the medium and long
terms. The PJyE will continue to receive financial support under the new Bank-financed
and IADB-financed operations. These operations will also continue to provide financial and
technical support to the MoL to continue its efforts to enhance labor intermediation
mechanisms. Professional staff within the PCU is in the process of being absorbed within
the MoL’s permanent structure.
59.      With respect to the MoE’s second-chance education programs, the new presidential
initiative on combating illiteracy will serve to ensure the implementation of the newly
developed EBA curricula. EBA directors are already reporting increased enrollment due to
added demand from graduates from the literacy program. The DYAE has made the decision
to implement the new flexible curricula in phases that are in sync with the demand of the
first cohort of graduates from the literacy program. Regarding the sustainability of the
equipment that was financed under the Project, it is important to underscore the importance
to assign resources to program directors to purchase batteries for the generators, most of
which have run out, as well as cartridges for printers. While these are relatively small
purchases, they seem to surpass the financial capacity of individual schools. Likewise,
large-scale purchases made by the MoE would be more price efficient than leaving it to
individual schools
60.    The successful implementation of the TEP ”Santiago Trabaja” provided the
opportunity to the MoL to develop the institutional capacity needed to design and
implement this type of program. While the GDR has not yet decided whether it will
implement other TEPs, it now has the capacity needed to do so should macroeconomic
conditions warrant it.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


61.     The Bank’s preparation team worked in close partnership with the Borrower. The
Project was well prepared and its design was robust and innovative, integrating state-of-the-
art knowledge in both the Project’s substantive area as well as its evaluation methodology.
It also included a sound system of incentives to encourage the various institutional and
private players to deliver and make good use of market-relevant training. As noted earlier,
the incorporation of a randomized experimental evaluation into the Project’s design
constituted a notable strength. The failure to identify the weaknesses in EBA and
PREPARA at appraisal and some weaknesses in the PRF were the only shortcomings in an
operation with an otherwise strong quality at entry.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

62.     The Project was well supervised, with regular field missions and in-depth
supervision reports. Sector Managers followed project implementation closely, as reflected
by their detailed comments in ISRs. Missions regularly included field visits to training
providers and employers participating in the PJyE and the TEP, as well as EBA and
PREPARA education centers. A wide array of specialists was included in these missions,
contributing valuable expertise on adult education, technical training, as well as
procurement and financial management. The Bank’s team also made it possible for the
PCU team to have first-hand exposure to other relevant international experiences and
disseminate its own experiences through study tours and other cross-fertilization activities.
The Bank exhibited flexibility and the disposition to respond to the Borrower’s needs by
restructuring the project twice. The 2010 restructuring responded to the Borrower’s request
to support a TEP in response to rising unemployment in the aftermath of the 2008 global
financial crisis. Likewise, the 2012 restructuring allowed reallocating Loan proceeds to
make effective use of Project resources and to extend the closing date to complete the final
stage of the impact evaluation.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.    Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory given that quality at
entry and supervision are rated moderately satisfactory and satisfactory, respectively.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

64.  The Project had the full support of the MoL, INFOTEP, and MoE authorities.
However, high staff rotation within DYAE and the EBA and PREPARA programs hindered

                                             19
performance under Component 3. The pace of implementation was also hindered by
recurrent budgetary problems, including lack of adequate counterpart funds and budget
limits that were below the recourses required for the pace of execution programmed at
appraisal.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory


65.     Operating within the MoL, the PCU was intensively involved in the design of the
Project as well as its implementation. Given the Project’s logistical complexity, sound
project management was a necessary condition for its successful implementation.
Throughout the Project’s lifetime, the PCU exhibited strong ownership of the Project,
willingness to learn by doing, and the ability and will to reflect upon the implementation
experience and make the necessary adjustments. The PCU also effectively coordinated and
provided support to multiple implementing agencies, including the MoL, INFOTEP and the
MoE, as well as the unit responsible for the implementation of the TEP in the city of
Santiago. During the PJyE’s impact evaluation, it was also effective in coordinating the
actions of the IBRD and IADB research teams to ensure internal consistency. Supported by
a robust information system, the PCU was also able to effectively monitor both
implementation progress as well as results. Stability within the PCU’s management brought
much needed continuity in the overall’s Project management. It generously shared its
experience in the implementation of the PJyE with other countries in the LAC and other
regions. Overall, the performance of the MoL’s PCU is deemed Highly Satisfactory.
66.     Also noteworthy was INFOTEP’s performance, which played an active role in the
implementation the PJyE. The agency exhibited a collaborative and flexible attitude
throughout the Project’s lifetime, contributing its know-how in content development,
preparation of bidding documents, evaluation of proposals, supervision, and accreditation
mechanisms of training providers. INFOTEP’s already established institutional scaffolding
was a critical determinant to the PJyE’s successful implementation, including regional units
and its network of accredited training centers and instructors.
67.     The performance of the implementation unit responsible for the Santiago Trabaja
TEP is also deemed satisfactory. It succeeded in setting in motion and effectively
implementing a logistically complex program in a relatively short time, widely
disseminating it among both potential beneficiaries and employers. Together with the SEN,
it deployed effective recruitment campaigns on the field and provided strong technical
support to potential employers, including municipalities, to ensure that their proposals were
in line with the Program’s requirements.
68.    As already noted, the lack of stability within the DYAE resulted in a difficult
environment for Component 3, which, in turn, translated into very slow pace of
implementation, leading to the closure of the MoE’s Project account due to inactivity in
2008. These implementation delays, in turn, negatively affected the Project’s outcomes, as
they resulted in the delivery of fewer outputs than anticipated. Performance within the
MoE, however, improved considerably from 2011onward. It is also noteworthy that DYAE
has been instrumental in transferring the know-how and EBA-related outputs developed
under the Project to the swift preparation and launching of the new presidential

                                             20
administration’s flagship literacy program. Considering the performance of both
implementing agencies the overall agencies’ performance is Satisfactory
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.     Overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory given that the
Government’s and Implementing Agencies’ Performance are rated moderately satisfactory
and satisfactory, respectively.

6. Lessons Learned
70.     Results from the PJyE impact evaluation point to positive albeit modest overall
labor market outcomes. A large heterogeneity is observed, with more significant results
reported for women in general, men in Santo Domingo, etc. While the specific design
features of individual programs can play a role in determining their efficacy and economic
efficiency, exogenous factors such as the level of economic activity and the structure of
labor markets are also likely to play an important role. Ultimately, this type of program can
help better align the supply and demand of labor skills within the envelope determined by
exogenous factors, such as the structure of labor markets and macroeconomic conditions.
71.     There are trade-offs between equity and efficiency objectives in the context of skills
development programs such as PJyE. Targeting the most vulnerable sectors of the
population, particularly poor at-risk youth who tend to have structurally less access to labor
markets than their peers from other socio-economic groups, is a clear priority from an
equity perspective. However, the impact on labor outcomes among this group can be
expected to be limited given the short nature of the training provided and the often dramatic
deficiencies in skills and education among this population group.
72.     A sound system of incentives is crucial to the success of skills development
programs. The PJyE was conceived as a demand-driven, results-oriented program; thus, it
effectively served to induce positive behaviors on the part of individual actors, including
trainees, employers and training providers. Some salient characteristics included
employers’ requirement to pay for trainees’ stipends, and payment schemes to training
providers that emphasize the trainee’s completion of the entire program. These
characteristics were crucial determinants of the program’s success and served to keep
supervision at a minimum.
73.      Focusing on soft skills can improve effectiveness of training programs. Both
employers and trainees appear to value them more than technical skills. In addition, results
from the impact evaluation suggest that training in soft skills might be more effective in
terms of employability than technical training. The experience of Santiago Trabaja also
illustrates that soft skills can be valuable for older beneficiaries as well.
74.     Women appear to be particularly susceptible to the potential positive impact from
skills building programs targeted to poor, unskilled youth, such as the PJyE. This is
particularly important, since poor young women tend to bear a disproportionate share of
unemployment. Indirect effects, other than labor market outcomes, such as teenage
pregnancy or reproductive health, seem to have been particularly effective among women,
especially younger cohorts.

                                             21
75.     The experience of Santiago Trabaja illustrates that TEPs can be swiftly
implemented in localities particularly hard hit by hikes in unemployment, providing a
social safety net to individuals affected by an economic shock or natural disaster. This type
of Program also benefits employers, such as municipalities and other public agencies that,
under severe economic conditions, are also forced to reduce public works and other
activities. The Santiago Trabaja also illustrates that these programs can be scaled down
when economic conditions improve.
76.     The high level of complementary exhibited by operations financed by IADB and the
Bank focusing on labor markets in the Dominican Republic, as well as the coordination
between, both supervision and evaluation teams of the two institutions should be
considered a best practice. The Borrower’s strong ownership of the Project—the PJyE in
particular—was a critical condition in ensuring the close alignment of the two banks.
77.    As the Bank’s and the IADB’s evaluations utilized the same research methodology
and instrument, applying to different cohorts of the same population of PJyE trainees, it
would be useful to explore the possibility of combining the data and analyzing it as a
whole, which would result in roughly twice the sample size as the one in each of the two
evaluations, which we conducted separately.
78.     Conducting a curricula assessment should be a pre-condition of any Project
activities focusing on the development, publishing and distribution of learning and teaching
materials. This is an important lesson that emerged from Component 3, which focused on
the second-chance education programs.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component 22

1.     Component 1 – Youth employment Program (Programa Juventud y Empleo -
PJyE)
The Project successfully consolidated and expanded the PJyE to provide increased access to
a first work experience for youth at risk (see Box 1 for a PJyE’s description). Specifically,
it effectively expanded its coverage both among that targeted population (at-risk youth),
and private sector firms offering internships. It also contributed toward expanding the
universe of private sector training providers. Building upon the Program’s strong
evaluation tradition, the Project also supported knowledge building through a rigorous
randomized evaluation. The specific outcomes under Component 1 include:
 Expanded coverage
    Exceeded (118 percent level of achievement): The PJyE has effectively extended its
    coverage, with the number of beneficiaries exceeding the original target by 18 percent.
 Expanded employer participation 23
    Exceeded (150 percent level of achievement): The PJyE has successfully expanded
    employer’s participation, with over 3,000 private firms offering internships to PJyE
    graduates, amply exceeding the 2,000 target.
 Expanded course offerings 24
 Not Achieved (60 percent level of achievement): The expansion in the scope of the
    training felt below expectations, as the number of new course offerings was
    significantly smaller than anticipated—24 compared to the target of 40 new courses.
    While the PJyE’s demand-driven nature is clearly a factor determining course offering,
    it might also be pointing to the need to develop more effective mechanisms to capture
    employers demand for labor skills.
 Improved poverty-based targeting
    Exceeded (158 percent level of achievement): Through its territorially based targeting,
    the JEP has effectively reached youth living in the poorest areas—equivalent to 95
    percent of its beneficiaries compared to the 60 percent original target.
 Improved gender-focused targeting
    Exceeded (132 percent level of achievement): The PJyE has effectively expanded its
    targeting of women, with almost 60 percent of its beneficiaries being female compared
    to the 45 percent original target and 40 percent at the beginning of the Project.

                         Box 2.1: Dominican Republic’s Youth Employment Program
                                    (Programa Juventud y Empleo - PJyE)
                                            Program Overview

Program Description: In operation since 2001, the Youth and employment Program (Programa Juventud y
Empleo – PJyE) is an active labor market program aimed at improving employability of youth between 16 and
29 years of age who did not complete high school.1
Content of training: The program offers a wide range of job training courses (e.g., administrative assistant,
data entry, hair stylist, beautician, clerk, auto mechanic, bartender, etc.). The training, which has a total of 225
hours, is divided into two parts: i) 75 hours of basic or life skills training aimed at strengthening trainees’ self-
esteem and work habits; and ii) 150 hours of technical or vocational training aimed at addressing the technical
training needs of local employers. Training is followed by a two-month internship in a private sector firm.
Eligibility criteria: The eligibility criteria are that participants should be 16 to 29 years old, living in poor
neighborhoods; not attending school; with incomplete high school or less; unemployed, underemployed or
inactive.
Training providers: The Ministry of Labor outsources the provision of training services to private training
institutions (Instituciones de Capacitación - ICAPs) that are registered and approved by the national training
entity (Instituto Nacional de Formación Técnico Profesional - INFOTEP). The ICAPs are selected through a
competitive bidding process.
Demand-driven mechanisms: ICAPs play a pivotal role in: i) tailoring course offerings to match the needs of
employers; and ii) matching trainees with employers. To ensure that the course offerings respond to the needs
of employers, ICAPs are required to contact potential employers and to develop training programs tailored to
their demand for skills. In their proposals, ICAPs are also required to include written commitments from at
least one local firm to offer two-month internships to trainees graduating from the provider’s program. Young
people are identified by the ICAPs according to their preferred vocation and the availability of the desired
course. They are recruited in a variety of ways, including word of mouth, posters and other advertisement, and
house visits.
Remuneration for trainees: While trainees were not paid during the classroom component of the training,
they received partial reimbursement for their transportation costs and meals, equivalent to roughly US$40 per
month). The program also provided trainees with insurance against workplace accidents.
Innovations: Two modifications were introduced with respect to the PJyE’s previous version: i) ICAPs were
supposed to work closer to the firms that provide the internship in order to develop tailored courses to train
people for real vacancies; and ii) the life-skills section of the training was subject to a drastic overhaul, as firms
argued that what they valued most from training were the general job-readiness/life-skills rather than the
technical training.
1
 Active labor market policies (ALMPs) are government programs that intervene in the labor market to help the unemployed
find work. They can be grouped in three main categories: i) public employment services; ii) training schemes, such as the
PJyE; and iii) employment subsidies.


    Improved monitoring and evaluation 25
     Achieved (100 percent level of achievement). The implementation of the PJyE was
     supported by a robust management information system that permitted to link payments
     to training providers to results, with the final payment being tied to the completion of
     internship. In addition, the PJyE was subject to a rigorous impact evaluation on the part

 This indicator is included under the “Results Framework” Table (Annex 3, p. 43), but it is not included as
one of the Intermediate Outcome Indicators under “Arrangements for Results Monitoring” (Annex 3, p. 46).
Thus, it has not been monitored under the Project’s ISRs.

     of both the Bank and IADB, thus contributing further to advancing the limited body of
     knowledge on the outcomes of training interventions.
    Improved linkages with education
     Exceeded (135 percent level of achievement): A total of 27 percent of PJyE
     beneficiaries were registered in EBA or PREPARA one year after program completion,
     exceeding the 20 percent original target. This was done by offering incentives for PJyE
     graduates to enroll in “second-chance” education programs (i.e., fee waiver) and
     providing them information, the Project helped build links between training and
     education programs targeting vulnerable young adults, which are vital components
     toward the development of an integrated lifelong learning strategy.

2.   Component 2: Build capacity in the then Secretary of Labor (SET) and the
National Training Institute (INFOTEP) to more effectively focus on at-risk youth

After the joint implementation of the PJyE, the MoL and INFOTEC now have an enhanced
capacity to target disadvantaged out-of school youth through soft skills and technical
training programs. The implementation experience has also served to strengthen program
coordination between the two entities, which is expected to continue during the gradual
transition of the PJyE to INFOTEP to ensure its permanent insertion within the government
bureaucracy. Specific outcomes under Component 2 include:
 Expanded Coverage
    Achieved (100 percent level of achievement): The Dominican Republic’s national
    training entity, INFOTEP, provided key institutional support during the PJyE
    implementation, including financing 400 courses as part of the PJyE.

3.    Component 3: Strengthen and expand the ‘Second Chance’ education programs
EBA and PREPARA
This component aimed at strengthening and expanding primary and secondary equivalency
programs (EBA and PREPARA, respectively) with emphasis on accelerated courses with
improved materials, modules in life skills, as well strengthening the institutional capacity of
the Department for Adult Education to implement the expansion of the programs and
monitor their results and impact over time. Specific outcomes under Component 3 include:
 Expanding coverage - EBA and PREPARA increase their coverage by 12 and 14
    percent respectively 26
    Partially Achieved (38 percent and 432 percent level of achievement for EBA and
    PREPARA respectively): Coverage for second-chance education programs has
    expanded substantially at the secondary level (PREPARA with 61 percent increase in
    coverage) but has experienced a more modest expansion for basic education (EBA, with
    4.6 percent increase in coverage).
 Improved poverty-focused targeting - At least 70 percent of beneficiaries from
    poorest 40 percent of households


26
  The target values are not consistent between those shown on the Results Framework Table (Annex 3, p. 43)
and the “Results Monitoring Arrangements” (Annex 3, p. 47). The highest target values have been adopted,
which is consistent with those that had been monitored by the MoE.


                                                   26
    Exceeded (109 percent level of achievement): Over 76 percent of EBA and PREPARA
    beneficiaries live in the poorest areas identified as priority areas I and II in the
    Dominican Republic’s Poverty Map, exceeding the 70 percent target.
   Improved gender-focused targeting - At least 45 percent of program beneficiaries are
    women.
    Exceeded (107 percent level of achievement): Women represent over half of EBA and
    PREPARA beneficiaries, exceeding the 45 percent target.
   Improved quality - 4,500 teachers trained in Adult Education methodologies.
    Partially Achieved (106 percent and 0 percent level of achievement for EBA and
    PREPARA, respectively). The MoE decided to concentrate its efforts on enhancing
    second-change education at the basic-education level (i.e., EBA), drastically
    overhauling its curricula adopting a flexible, modular approach, and training a total of
    4,247 teachers in the curricula. The new flexible EBA curricula incorporate life skills
    modules. No action was taken at the secondary level (i.e., PREPARA).
   Effectiveness - Program drop-out rate decreases from 23 percent to 18 percent
    Achieved (100 percent level of achievement): The aggregate drop-out rate for the EBA
    and PREPARA programs was reduced from 23 percent to 18 percent, meeting the
    anticipated target. However, it should be noted that there are substantial differences in
    the drop-out rates of the two programs—24.2 percent and 7 percent for the EBA and
    PREPARA respectively.
   Effectiveness -Books for EBA and PREPARA are distributed.
    Partially Achieved (25 percent level of achievement): Educational materials reflecting
    the newly developed flexible curricula for EBA have been developed for seven of the
    12 modules, of which three have been published and are ready to be distributed to
    students.
   Improved monitoring and evaluation
    Achieved (100 percent level of achievement): From having no M&E system, EBA and
    PREPARA now have an integrated MIS that tracks enrollments, attendance and pass
    rates, and provides regular tracer studies to assess longer term impact (i.e., SGCE).

4.    Component 4: Support a Pilot Temporary Employment Program
This component, which was added under the 2010 restructuring, provided support to a pilot
TEP to reach between 2,500 to 4,000 beneficiaries. The overall duration of the TEP was 18
months, with individual beneficiaries participating for four months. The TEP was targeted
to selected municipalities in the province of Santiago, in which employment was negatively
affected as a result of the crisis. Specific outcomes under Component 4 include:
 Expanding coverage –Between 2,500 and 4,000 low-skilled, unemployed adults
    participate in the temporary employment Santiago Trabaja.
    Achieved (100 percent level of achievement): A total of 4,395 beneficiaries were
    contracted under the TEP to work in 104 subprojects, with 3,988 of them receiving at
    least one payment. A total of 3,920 completed both the training and the temporary
    employment (i.e., 98.2 percent of all those that received at least one payment and 89.2
    percent of all those that were contracted).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.    The Project’s overall economic efficiency is considered to be Moderate, given the
economic efficiency for each of the individual components, which can be summarized as
follows:
2.    Youth Employment Program (PJyE): The economic benefits from the training
delivered under the PJyE can be distinguished as follows:
3.    Labor market outcomes: Although the Project largely achieved the Intermediate
Outcomes and KOIs specified in the PRF for Component 1, it had only a modest impact on
employment and income when comparing labor market outcomes of PJyE and the control
group. These results are consistent with the 2013 World Development Report ‘Jobs,’ which
states that these types of programs have positive yet modest results. Specifically, results
from the impact evaluations conducted under the Project have identified the following
labor-market outcomes: 27
 No significant impact on the probability of being employed between PJyE beneficiaries
    and their peers in the control group;
 A modest impact on earnings affecting roughly 68 percent of PJyE graduates—i.e.,
    roughly 7 percent increase in earnings among employed men living in Santo Domingo,
    and a 5 percent increase for women in general;
 A 12 percent increase in the probability of having a formal job with health insurance
    and other benefits between employed PJyE female beneficiaries and their peers in the
    control group.

4.   Non-labor outcomes: The impact evaluations have also identified other types of
impact that, although not related to employment per se, still have an economic impact.
These include the following ones:
 A reduction in teenage pregnancy by five percentage points in the treatment group
   (about 45 percent), which is consistent with an overall increase in youth expectations
   about the future compared to about 11.1 percent of females aged 15-19 years old in the
   control group already having children or being pregnant.
 Women that received training under PJyE show a 4 percent reduction in the probability
   of committing a crime or being incarcerated; and
 A positive impact of training on alternative measures of life skills, particularly
   leadership skills, conflict resolution, self-organization and persistency of effort. These
   skills, in particular persistency of effort, have been shown that they improve labor
   market outcomes in developed countries (Heckman et al., 2006).

5.    The economic efficiency of the PJyE is considered to be Moderate, with an estimated
Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of 5.6 percent. The economic benefits associated
to the PJyE include: i) the stream of benefits derived from a 7 percent increase in earnings
among employed men living in St. Domingo and 5 percent for all PJyE female graduates
over a 20 year life span; and ii) the cost savings from averted teenage pregnancies

considering a 5 percent reduction among the 5,813 females age 15-19 that participated in
the PJyE, based on annual savings of US$1,318 per pregnancy over a 20 year time
horizon. 28 The other economic benefits, such as those derived from having health insurance,
reduced incarceration and crimes, and improved life skills have not been quantified. The
economic costs included the cost of training under the PJyE, equivalent to US$15 million
(see Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3).

6.    Second-chance education programs: The economic efficiency of the investment
made to enhance second-chance education programs, EBA in particular, can be expected to
be High, as some of the expected labor market outcomes resulting from the increased
earning capacity from graduates of the literacy program that was designed based on the new
EBA curricula should also be attributed to this operation. Specifically, the economic
benefits include the productivity gains that can be attributed to the improved EBA
curriculum (as opposed to the presumably less effective curricula that would have been
utilized otherwise). Although there is not sufficient data to perform a formal economic
analysis, its economic impact can be expected to be considerable given the program’s
extensive coverage (i.e., 700,000 beneficiaries in 2013 alone). For example, considering
only a 0.1 percent differential from the enhanced curriculum in the productivity gains
among those enrolled during 2013 and assuming they have the same characteristics as PJyE
participants in terms of gender and average income, the investments made under
Component 3 would yield an IERR of roughly 85 percent. Indirect benefits that can also be
expected to arise from the Project’s implementation include improved competitiveness and

                                                 30
sustained economic growth, reduced costs of crime when idle youth are back in school or at
work, and accelerated poverty reduction and enhanced equity.

7.    Temporary Employment Program “Santiago Trabaja”: The economic efficiency
of this program is expected to be Modest. Temporary workers were assigned to work in
projects proposed by non-profit organizations and municipalities. While no formal
economic analysis was performed, these projects can be reasonable expected to have
economic benefits greater than, or at least equal to the wages paid to temporary workers.
These projects included, among others, maintenance of physical infrastructure, like street,
and drainage maintenance, and cleaning of public parks and watersheds. Indirect benefits
that can also be expected in terms of enhanced life skills of beneficiaries as a result of the
training. These skills, as well as potential gains in self-esteem associated with the life skills
training they received under the program, can be expected to have a positive effect on
participants' future labor market outcomes. Given the lack of data on the type of project, no
economic analysis was performed for this program.

8.     Weighted IERR: The IERR for the overall project can be expected to be around 21
percent when weighting the IERRs for the PJyE (i.e., 5.6 percent) and the Literacy Program
(i.e., 84.9 percent) by their respective financing under the Project (i.e., US$15 million and
US$3.6 million). The contrast between the economic efficiency of the PJyE and the
Literary Program is mainly the result of the number of beneficiaries under each intervention.
An important lesson learned from the implementation experience of this operation points to
importance of focusing technical and financial resources on programs with large coverage
in order to maximize economic efficiency.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Government of the Dominican Republic through the Ministry of Labor provided inputs
to the final version of this ICR. Specific comments, inputs and recommendations are
classified in five categories: a) aspects that could not be implemented as originally planned;
b) aspects of Project implementation that are worth repeating; c) aspects that deserve to be
re-considered; d) remarks regarding the sustainability of the Project; and e) Bank-borrower
coordination.
   Aspects that could not be implemented as originally planned
   a) During the internship phase, the design of the program included a 30-hour course
      that was expected to be delivered at the COS. Although optional, including these
      short modules was considered relevant for participants to share with their peers the
      experiences at the workplace. In future editions of the PJyE, it would be advisable
      to ensure that these short courses are being implemented by COS whenever
      necessary.
   b) Few COS requested the provision of a bonus (cash incentive) originally thought to
      increase the likelihood that firms hires participants beyond the internship phase.
   c) The employment rates resulted in much lower figures than expected. Only 32
      percent of the internship participants received a job offer from the firm, and just half
      of those accepted the offer and started the job.
   d) In the original design, 30 percent of the beneficiaries were expected to return and
      complete formal education (either EBA or PREPARA). The current figures reflect
      that this target was almost achieved with a 27 percent rate of participants returning
      to formal education.
   e) In the absence of progress on the national youth survey, the resources from
      component II, originally assigned to the Secretary of Youth, had to be reallocated
      for other purposes within the same component. The survey could not be carried out
      as planned.
   f) A communication media campaign, originally planned to be financed out of
      component 2 could not be carried out due to difficulties following the World Bank
      procurement guidelines.
   g) The improvements to the information system to select PJyE beneficiaries could not
      be carried out by INFOTEP. It was originally thought to be financed out of
      resources from component 2.
   h) The process to register beneficiaries for the Temporary Employment Program
      (component 4) needed to be modified with respect to what was originally
      envisioned. Mobile units of the Employment Offices were used to register
      beneficiaries in the areas where the program was deployed. This alternative strategy
      proved to be more effective than enrolling beneficiaries at the downtown locations
      of the Employment offices in Santiago.
   i) The original Operations Manual of the TEP Santiago Trabaja had to be modified to
      avoid unintended consequences in the health coverage of certain beneficiaries. The
      MoL paid contributions to Social Security for beneficiaries participating in the TEP
      Santiago Trabaja. TEP participants that failed to report being covered by the non-

                                             38
   contributory health system automatically lost the insurance. The operations manual
   was modified and private risk insurance introduced in the cases in which
   beneficiaries were detected as covered.
j) Project implementation suffered from the lack of availability of local resources to
   finance the expenses considered to be non-eligible in the loan agreement.
Aspects of Project implementation that are worth repeating
a) A very positive aspect of this Project is that from the design, it allowed the
   articulation of different institutions working with an overlapping target population.
   Including INFOTEP as an executing agency is extremely important to ensure the
   Project sustainability. Moreover, the Ministry of Education and the second chance
   education programs benefited from the development of a life-skills training
   curricula of the youth training programs
b) Most of program participants are drop-outs aged 15 to 25 years old that are neither
   in education or employment. The life-skills training curricula was developed as a
   stand-alone course that allows young people to create their own employment search
   strategy, work life plan on the basis of an effective timely guidance. Efficiency
   gains are obtained as a consequence of the higher results achieved and the lower
   cost incurred in the current set up of the PJyE
c) The rigorous impact evaluation included in the initial design of the PJyE, allowed
   feedback into the design of the successive versions of the PJyE. Strengthening the
   life-skills training courses is clearly the outstanding design feature modified as part
   of this feedback process
d) The TEP Santiago Trabaja resulted in an efficient and effective program that
   achieved its targets in spite of the reduced number of staff responsible for its
   implementation. Including municipalities as potential sub-project executing entities
   allowed the program to finance more inclusive and varied number of community
   initiatives. Three design aspects have worked as expected and are worth
   highlighting to be repeated in the future: a) payments are made through debit cards,
   increasing program transparency; b) contributions to social security were paid for
   program participants; and c) the enrollment of participants was performed through
   the intermediation services at the MoL.
Aspects that deserve to be re-considered
a) The PJyE courses need to be updated to better reflect the demands from the private
   sector.
b) The life skills training courses need to be adjusted upwards to include 150 hours of
   training. Courses on technical skills need to be adjusted accordingly to hold the
   overall number of training hours within budget and original designed (250 hours in
   total)
c) Given the positive experiences found in the life-skills training courses, it would be
   advisable to institutional strengthen by creating a life-long learning system in which
   the knowledge can be transferred across cohorts of trainers.
d) Monitoring course delivery and beneficiary performance can be improved by
   implementing a new management information system. Just in time smart reports are
   needed to be able to take timely decision while courses are being delivered.

                                           39
e) The management information system should move from decentralized databases (at
   COS level) to a unify registry of participants to improve program delivery and
   management.
f) Increase the amount of the incentive bonus offered to COS to promote participant
   labor insertion.
g) The beneficiary enrollment process for the TEP needs to be improved, to avoid
   potential dependence between beneficiaries and NGOs or sub-project executing
   agencies.
h) It would be advisable that life-skills teachers get paid directly. COS’ intermediation
   adds an extra step in the procedures without noticeable advantages.
i) The MIS module for the TEP needs to be improved to ease the use of the
   employability index used to prioritize applicants.
j) Additional resources to train administrative and PIU staff to improve their
   motivation and productivity.
Remarks regarding the sustainability of the Project
a) A Youth Entrepreneurship Unit was created within the Ministry of Labor. The
   former is funded through resources from the national budget with a yearly cost of
   US$ 83.000.
b) A large part of the team of consultants that have been working in the PIU since
   2001 will be no longer employed as consultants. Since 2013, the majority of the
   persons working at the PIU will be incorporated into the civil service of the
   Dominican Republic
c) INFOTEP has created a special unit within the PJyE to evaluate, monitor and
   supervise the program’s course delivery.
Bank-Borrower relationship
a) The relationship between the MoL through PIU and the World Bank officials
   leading the program has been fluid and fruitful. Despite having had three TTLs
   during the lifetime of the Project, the transition from one to another was performed
   in a smoothly way.
b) The Bank has provided great support to the various terms at the Mo, including a
   restructuring of the Project to launch the TEP "Santiago Trabaja". This innovative
   work was timely carried out as per MoL’s request to adapt the existing tools to
   provide response to a critical employment crisis in the city of Santiago.
c) A randomized impact evaluation has been considered in original design of the
   program and carried out through the lifetime of the Project. The World Bank team
   provided technical and non-reimbursable financial assistance and successfully
   completed the task towards the end of the Project’s cycle. A greater knowledge
   transfer process is still highlighted as a challenge for future operations.
d) The largest majority of the resources involved in this loan have been transferred to
   either beneficiaries or to training providers as part of the payment for the training
   courses. The Project experienced a slow start given discrepancies and
   interpretations generated at the operations manual and the World Bank procurement


                                         40
      guidelines. Once clarified, the Project has been able to compensate the lost time and
      recover the disbursement rate.
   e) The disbursement department based in Brazil, provided excellent and valuable
      support and technical assistance to the fiduciary teams at the MoL’s PIU.
   f) The World Bank would benefit from a deeper integration of its units, to be able to
      perform better and faster Project design process.

           Contribution from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) 29

1.    In 2005, the Dominican Republic was emerging from a crisis that left almost 20
percent of the population unemployed. The crisis affected particularly new labor market
entrants, most of them youth and women. At the same time, there was a limited capacity to
respond to this situation due to the low institutional capacity of the labor authorities and the
absence of training and intermediation mechanisms, which could help the youth and
unemployed to find jobs. Previous to the existence of the IDB’s Labor Markets and Social
Transfers Phase I Project (DR-L1006), there was little investment in job-search services
and on training for youth at risk. The existing investment in training for youth at risk lacked
the appropriate approach, it did not include training on life skills, and it did not connect the
trainees to labor market opportunities in the productive sector.
2.    To help the DR to tackle this situation, the Project called “Labor Markets and Social
Transfers Phase I” (DR-L1006), approved in 2005, funded the creation of a labor
intermediation system, which would help workers to search for jobs and employers to
recruit workers, as well as a youth training program called “Youth and Employment”, to
improve the labor market insertion of youngsters 16-29 years old who did not complete
high school. Regarding the intermediation system, the Project helped establishing an online
job search database and financed the creation of 12 regional employment offices and the
realization of job fairs. Regarding the program Youth and Employment, training services
were outsourced to private training institutions, which were registered and approved by the
National Training Institution (INFOTEP). Training activities were split in three parts: First
a life skills training modulus (75 hours); a technical/vocational training modulus (150
hours); and an on-the-job training module in a private sector firm for up to three months. In
order to be able to initiate stages one and two of the training activities, training institutions
had to demonstrate that they had identified a company which would accept a trainee for
stage three. Finally, the Project also supported a number of activities directed to strengthen
the response capacity of labor authorities, such as financing labor statistics and a labor
markets observatory, which would improve the quality of the information and analysis, and
strengthen labor market policy.
3.    The targeted population of the Project was low-income youth, workers searching for
jobs, and companies seeking to hire workers. With financing from the two multilateral
agencies, 57,000 low-income youth received labor training. Participants were secondary
school drop-outs of which, 22.6 percent had not completed primary education. More than
50 percent of the beneficiaries were women, and 20 percent of them were single mothers.
On its part, during 2008-10, the intermediation service received 101,463 unemployed
people and registered 31,302 vacancies, from 4,069 companies.

4.    According to the randomized evaluation implemented in 2011, the Youth and
Employment program increased the probability of formal employment by 17 percent and
also had a positive impact on earnings. The evaluation also shows that the program as
unexpected impacts; for example, it lowers the probability of teenage pregnancy. Based on
this evaluation, the IADB has approved in 2011 another Project called Support to the
National Employment System (DR-L1036) which consolidates and expands on these gains.
The new program will expand training in life skills, as recent studies show them to be the
most effective part of the training. It will also offer different modalities of services
depending on the degree of vulnerability of beneficiaries. The National Employment
Service will be consolidated and strengthened.
5.   The Ministry of Labor of the Dominican Republic has used the results from this
Project to promote higher investments for youth at risk in the Dominican Republic. The
experimental evaluation has served as a credibility instrument for a results-based approach
and help building a credibility of the Ministry in their employments services, not only the
Youth and Employment programs but others as well.
6.    Starting with the “Labor Markets and Social Transfers Phase I” (DR-L1006) Project,
the Ministry of Labor was able to build a stronger relationship with the Institute of
Vocational and Technical Training (INFOTEP). Before the Project, the relationship was
almost non-existent. The Project increased the collaboration of the two institutions on
training programs and the new phase of support from the IDB (Support to the National
Employment System, DR-L1036) will have the two institutions as co-executors, revealing
the importance and richness of that cooperation. One of the interesting spillovers of the
Program has been that, understanding the importance of the provision of training on socio-
emotional/basic skills, especially for the most vulnerable groups of the population,
INFOTEP has introduced these modules in its regular programs for those groups. This is
gain is incredible high, because it is an effort that has been institutionalized and therefore,
is sustainable.
7.    The Youth and Employment Program was financed by the IADB, as well as by the
World Bank. The two institutions have been partners in the execution of labor markets
programs in the Dominican Republic since 2005. The collaboration between the two
institutions has been fruitful because there is a coherent vision of where to go in terms of
the interventions necessary to overcome the challenges faced by the population. Given that
shared vision, the two institutions have made the necessary arrangements to execute their
programs using the same executing structure within the Ministry of Labor. In that sense, the
same PCU has been in charge of executing both IDB and World Bank Projects. For
example, the PJyE has been, at different points in time, financed by both agencies.
8.    In terms of research collaboration, the impact evaluation teams from both agencies
have been working together in the design of the randomized impact evaluation of the PJyE.
This collaboration will allow coherence in the data extracted for individual evaluations and
will allow putting together the two data sets in order to understand specific issues that can
only be analyzed with a larger dataset.

First Impact Evaluation by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)
Source: Card, D., Ibarrarán, P., Regalia, F., Rosas-Shady, D. and Soares, Y. (2011), “The Labor Market
        Impacts of Youth Training in the Dominican Republic,” Journal of Labor Economics 29 (2), pp. 267-
        300.
Methodology
A sample of applicants of the second cohort of the JyE program who applied to receive training in early
2004. Baseline data were collected from applicants prior to random assignment through registration forms
completed at the COS. A follow-up survey was administered from May to July 2005; some 10 to 14 months
after most trainees had finished their initial coursework.
Main Findings
   The estimated impacts on employment are all fairly close to zero, and there are no significant
    differences by gender, age, education, or geographic location (p. 285)
   There is evidence of a modest (7% to 10% ) impact on earnings per month (conditional on
    employment), although the estimated effect is only marginally significant (p. 287).
   The estimated impacts on monthly earnings are fairly similar for men and women, and for younger and
    older workers, but they show interesting patterns by education and geographic location. If one
    compares better-educated applicants in Santo Domingo to all others the results are striking: this
    subgroup accounts for virtually all of the observed positive impact on monthly earnings (p. 285-7).
   This article also contributed to the literature by providing an operational definition for “employability,”
    based on transition probabilities between employment and non-employment status. Building on this
    definition, a logistic model with state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity was fitted for the
    observed employment transitions of the treatment and control groups. The results of the model suggest
    that the JE program had no significant impact on trainee employability, although a similar model shows
    a modest impact on job quality, as measured by the probability of holding of a job that offers health
    insurance.
Main Conclusion
Findings of this evaluation suggest that the first round of PJyE training had (at best) relatively modest effects
on participants’ labor market outcomes, which is consistent with the results from evaluations in many
developed countries. Although it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of this and similar programs
in other Latin American and Caribbean countries, it is unlikely that programs of this nature, operating under
similar financial and operational constraints, can fully address the many barriers and problems faced by
disadvantaged youth in the region.

        for the Study of Labor (IZA), Research Paper Series, IZA Discussion Paper No. 6617
        (http://ssrn.com/abstract=2085204)
Methodology
The analysis was based on a sample of applicants for the cohort of trainees that participated in a version of
the JE program that was modified as a result of the first impact evaluation. The cohort under study applied to
receive training during 2008. After the completion of the courses, a follow-up household survey was carried
out between November 2010 and February 2011 (18 to 24 months after graduation) on a random sample of
5000 out of the 10,309 young people who had initially registered. This sample has 3,250 individuals from the
treatment group and 1,750 from the control group. (The sample size was set at 5,000 to detect an 8%
increase in income with a power of 0.8 and an attrition of 30% of the sample with the sampsi Stata
command.)

The questionnaire for the follow-up household survey was put together by an interdisciplinary team from the
Ministry of Labor of the Dominican Republic, the IADB and the World Bank. It included 15 modules that
collect data on household composition and socioeconomic characteristics, labor force participation, labor
history, assets, time use, courses and the internship, consumption, health status, risk aversion, future
expectations, pregnancy history, dwelling materials and basic skills, including non-cognitive skills and self-
esteem.

Main Findings
In terms of labor market outcomes, the Program was found to have the following effects:
        Simple comparisons between trainees in the follow-up survey and members of the control group
         show little impact on employment. The estimated impacts on employment are all fairly close to
         zero, and there are no significant differences by gender, age, education, or geographic location.
        For men it had significant impacts on formality, measured as employer provided health insurance or
         as having a written contract. Males assigned to the treatment group are four percentage points
         more likely to get a job in the formal sector than males assigned to the control group. This
         represents an impact of 17% over the control group average. This is consistent with the results
         from the first evaluation of the program, and with evaluations of similar programs that report
         impacts on the probability of getting formal employment (Attanasio et al (2011), Ibarraran and
         Rosas (2009)). The results are particularly strong for males in Santo Domingo.
        Estimates for monthly earnings conditional on being employed show that the program does have a
         positive statistically significant impact. Among those employed, individuals assigned to the
         treatment group have monthly earnings seven percent higher than individuals assigned to the
         control group. This holds for women in general, and for men in Santo Domingo.
        There also seems to be a relation with the duration of unemployment, which is longer for males
         assigned to the treatment group than for males assigned to the control group. This could reflect the
         fact that males assigned to the treatment group are searching for better quality jobs even if these
         are harder to find, or that they have higher reservation wages.

In terms of non-labor market outcomes, the program was found the following effects:
        A reduction in teenage pregnancy by five percentage points in the treatment group (about 45%),
         which is consistent with an overall increase in youth expectations about the future. In the country,
         about 17%of females aged 15-19 years old already have children (ONE, 2008).
        A positive impacts in terms of perceptions and expectations about the future, in particular for young
         women who simultaneously reduce their pregnancy rates significantly.
        The Project has a positive impact in improving youth perceptions about their current situation and
         about their expectations regarding the future. On average, individuals assigned to the treatment
         group are more likely to consider having a very good health than those in the control group, and are
         more likely to have higher expectations about their future in topics related to their education level,
         neighborhood, owning a business, having the desired job, completing professional aspirations,
         having a better life in 20 years, offering their children a better life, and having a wealthier position
         and more social recognition in 10 years. These impacts are stronger for females and younger
         individuals.
        A positive impact of training on alternative measures of life-skills, particularly leadership skills,
         conflict resolution, self-organization and persistency of effort. These skills, in particular persistency
         of effort, have been analyzed and the findings show that they improve labor market outcomes in
         developed countries. The impact of those soft skills on labor market performance in developing
         countries is a rich area for future research.
        A positive impact on non-cognitive skills as measured by three different scales, with scores
         improving between 0.08 and 0.16 standard deviations with the program. 30 On average, the total
         CPS score of individuals assigned to the treatment group is 0.11 standard deviations higher than
         the score of individuals assigned to the control group. Impacts of similar magnitudes hold for CPS
         scores on leadership, behavior in situations of conflict, self-esteem, and order and self-
         organization. There are no impacts on the CPS scores on abilities to relate with others and
         empathy and communication skills. For most of the indicators these results hold for both males and
         females, but the impact on males tends to be larger. By groups, the impact concentrates on the
         youngest individuals, on the better educated--incomplete high school is the highest education level
         to be eligible for the program--and in Santo Domingo. However, it is hard to interpret the practical
         significance of these results as evidence on this topic is very limited. Further analyses carried out in
         this paper show no correlation between some of these measures and employment.

        y Empleo - República Dominicana, Manuscript, August 5, 2013.
         Methodology
The IBRD impact evaluation applied the same methodology and questionnaire as the second IADB’s
evaluation, as the two were developed jointly in collaboration with the Borrower. The household survey
conducted in 2012 among 3,841 respondents from 2008 and 2009 PJyE cohorts. The only difference
between the two evaluations was that the IBRD evaluation included a complementary evaluation focusing on
the impact of providing only life-skills versus the traditional training.
Main Findings
In terms of labor market outcomes, the Program was found to have the following effects:
        In terms of employment, there was no significant impact for the overall group of participants, as
         both groups show the same probability of being employed.
        There are no significant impacts in terms of income, except for women who received technical and
         life skills training, who have an overall income that is 5%higher than that of its peers in the control
         group.
        In term of quality of employment, there is an increased on formal employment among women that
         received training, with a 12% increase in the probability of having retirement benefits, health
         insurance or a contract. Conversely, men that received training appear less likely to have formal
         employment than those that did not receive training, with a 6%decrease in the probability of having
         retirement benefits, health insurance or a contract.
        No significant impact on inactivity or actively seeking work, except for employed men that received
         training who are more actively seeking another job than their peers.
        An interest finding is that participating women are more likely to have rejected a job offer in the past
         two years (a 4% increase in the probability). Concomitantly, the expected salary is higher (also by
         roughly 4%).
        Participants were less likely to look for a job requiring skills different from those in which they were
         trained under PJyE.
        Other statistically significant differences with respect the control group include a 4%higher
         probability among male participants that he or a family member having his/her own business.
        Preliminary findings suggest that there is no valued added of the technical training when soft skills
         training is being provided, pointing to the importance of the latter.

In terms of non-labor market outcomes, the Program was found to have the following effects:
        There is a 4%higher probability to have children among those receiving training compared to the
         control group; and, among women, a 9% reduction in the number of children.
        There is a 2%higher probability of participation in an organization.
        Women that received training perceive themselves as being better off than their peers in terms of
         wealth right now (6%).
        Men perceive themselves as being better off than their peers in the future (9%) and the likelihood of
         having their own business (10%).
        Both men and women that received training have better expectations than their peers in terms of
         obtaining a desired job (5%) or achieving their professional objectives (5%).
        Women that received training show a 4% reduction in the probability of committing a crime or being
         incarcerated.
