Borrower                 Republic of Serbia

Implementing Agency      The Ministry of Finance (MOF) of the Republic of Serbia will be
                         responsible for the overall implementation of the proposed
                         Operation.

Financing Data           IBRD Loan of US$100 million.

Operation Type           Programmatic (2nd of 3), single-tranche.

Main Policy Areas        Public financial management (PFM), public administration, and
                         social assistance.

Key Outcome Indicators   The expected overall outcome of the Development Policy Loan
by End of Series         (DPL) program is an improvement in the efficiency of public
                         spending. This will assist the Government in bringing about the
                         necessary reduction in aggregate public spending levels over the
                         medium term, while improving current levels of service delivery.
                         Key outcome indicators include:
                              Public wage spending as a share of Gross Domestic Product
                                 (GDP) falls from 10.8 percent in 2009 to 9 percent or less in
                                 2012;
                              Pension spending as a share of GDP falls from about 13.8
                                 percent in 2009 to 12 percent or less in 2012;
                              A minimum of 10 percent of salaries of primary health care
                                 providers is calculated based on performance;
                              Nearly all qualifying hospitals start reporting to (Health
                                 Insurance Fund (HIF)) on services provided using Diagnosis
                                 Related Groups (DRG) coding for procedures;
                              Per capita financing system virtually piloted in at least 5
                                 municipalities.

                              Improved effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary
                                 spending and the effectiveness of internal audit -- move
                                 from a PEFA score of C in 2008 to B or higher by 2012;

                              The share of public procurement contracts awarded based
                                 on competitive procedures increases from 76 percent and
                                 their value from 61 percent in 2009;
                              Improved government debt management as measured by: (i)
                                 the debt management strategy is updated annually, based on
                                 sound cost/risk analyses under different scenarios, (ii), a

                                               i
                                    yield-curve building plan is developed; and (iii) the risks
                                    embedded in guarantees is properly assessed and quantified
                                    on an annual basis;
                                    Material Support for Low Income Households (MOP)
                                    coverage increases from 7.9 percent of the poorest quintile
                                    in 2009, to 8.7 percent in 2010, and at least to 10 percent in
                                    2012.
                                    Increase in MOP received by larger families (with more than
                                    3 family members) from two times the MOP amount of a
                                    single family member in 2009 to up to three times the
                                    amount in 2012.

Program Development         The objective of the proposed Public Expenditure Development
Objective(s) and            Policy Loan Program is to help reduce the size of Serbia`s large
Contribution to CAS         public sector by supporting reforms that will help improve the
                            efficiency of public spending, structured around three key policy
                            areas: (i) improving allocation of public expenditure to enhance the
                            efficiency of spending in the largest spending sectors; (ii)
                            strengthening of public expenditure and debt management to make
                            spending more strategic; and, (iii) strengthening social assistance to
                            cushion the impact of the economic crisis and expand the coverage
                            of the social assistance programs.

                            The PEDPL program is included in the proposed Country
                            Partnership Strategy (CPS) as updated by the Country Partnership
                            Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) that was presented to the Board
                            on November 17, 2009 together with the First Public Expenditure
                            Development Policy Loan (PEDPL1). The proposed operation will
                            support the accomplishment of Pillar II objectives of the CPS ­
                            providing opportunities and broadening participation in growth.

Risks and Risk Mitigation   The proposed DPL program has substantial risks. Serbia went into
                            the financial crisis with a high current account deficit (CAD),
                            aggravated by rapid foreign currency credit growth and large cross-
                            border borrowing by domestic enterprises. An ongoing International
                            Monetary Fund (IMF) program calls for ambitious fiscal adjustment
                            and requires significant external financial support and private sector
                            debt rollover.

                            Economic risks are substantial and include:

                            (i)     Potential further economic turmoil in euro-zone economies
                            could have a significant impact on Serbia. Greece, in particular, has
                            been the second largest investor in Serbia since the beginning of the
                            transition. Economic risks are partially mitigated by the multilateral
                            support package, including the IMF enhanced Stand-By
                            Arrangement (SBA) of EUR 3 billion, developed in close
                            coordination with the proposed PEDPL2.

                            (ii)    Despite external adjustment, Serbia faces considerable
                            balance of payments financing needs over the next few years. Risks
                            are partially mitigated by Serbia`s robust agenda of policy reform,
                            and also by the size of the multilateral support package.
               (iii) Potential vulnerabilities of the banking sector remain in the
               context of substantially reduced profitability and stable but high
               non-performing loans (NPLs). Mitigating factors include: (i) the
               high capitalization of the system, which can withstand the current
               level of NPLs; and (ii) the improvements in the bank resolution
               framework.

               Implementation risks are significant. The current capacity of some
               public sector institutions to implement an ambitious reform agenda,
               while much improved over the past few years, remains relatively
               weak. The execution risks will be mitigated in part through technical
               assistance (TA) that is provided by the World Bank and other
               development partners.

               Political risks are high. Although the past two years featured a
               period of political stability, social tension and discontent have
               increased lately as living standards have dropped owing to the crisis
               and required austerity measures (including the freeze on public
               sector wages and salaries) to stabilize the economy. This, combined
               with Parliamentary elections scheduled for early 2012, could lead to
               a slowdown in reforms, in particular during the pre-election period.

               IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED
   SECOND PROGRAMMATIC PUBLIC EXPENDITURE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                               (PEDPL2)
                      TO THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA

                                        I.    INTRODUCTION

1.      This document describes a proposed second loan in a program of three Public Expenditure
Development Policy Loans (PEDPLs) to Serbia. The proposed PEDPL program is central to the Bank`s
engagement in Serbia as described in the CPS and the CPSPR, which was presented to the Board on
November 17, 2009 (together with PEDPL1). The PEDPL program, which aims to reduce the size of
Serbia`s large public sector, is complemented by a private and financial sector DPL program and a Policy
Based Guarantee (PBG) (aiming to facilitate the growth of the private sector by enhancing the business
environment, strengthening financial discipline and building a more efficient and stable financial sector).
The proposed amount for the Second Public Expenditure Development Policy Loan (PEDPL2) is USD
100 million. The proposed PEDPL2 would be part of a coordinated financing package with the IMF and
the European Commission (EC).

2.      Given Serbia's relatively large public sector, expenditure re-prioritization and
consolidation of current expenditures remain critical over the medium term, especially in light of
government's plans to increase spending on infrastructure. As outlined in the Program Document for
PEDPL1, the objective of the proposed program is to help reduce the size of Serbia`s large public sector
by supporting reforms that will help improve the efficiency of public spending, structured around three
key policy areas: (i) improving allocation of public expenditure to enhance the efficiency of spending in
the largest spending sectors; (ii) strengthening of public expenditure and debt management to make
spending more strategic; and, (iii) strengthening social assistance to cushion the impact of the economic
crisis and expand the coverage of the social assistance programs. The Government`s Letter of
Development Policy (LDP), highlighting the commitment of the authorities to the implementation of the
program, is in Annex 1. Annex 2 presents the Policy Matrix, while Annex 3 has the results framework.

3.       As outlined in the Program Document for PEDPL1, the reform program is phased, and the
proposed PEDPL2 focuses on expenditure rationalization measures, targeting the public sector
wage bill and the pension bill. The public sector wage bill has been in excess of ten percent of GDP for
the past five years, and pension spending (the largest single spending category in Serbia) is the second
highest in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), a region where pension spending is typically high. After
PEDPL2, the proposed PEDPL3 will focus on expenditure rationalization in social sectors, including
rationalization of the school network and payment reform in health ­ areas where potential fiscal savings
are the largest. PEDPL1 focused on overarching public expenditure reforms.

                                  II.        COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. POLITICAL CONTEXT
4.       The past two years featured a period of political stability. Both presidential and parliamentary
elections were conducted in 2008, which resulted in pro-European Union (EU) political parties gaining a
majority and holding the presidency. The government coalition remains stable despite economic and
political challenges. Since the last election, there has been a number of positive international
developments, including the visa liberalization with the EU, the joint EU-Serbia resolution on Kosovo in
the UN, the unanimous decision of the EU Council to forward Serbia's membership application to the EC
for an opinion, and the recent ratification of the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with
Serbia by the European Parliament.
5.      Nevertheless, a drop in living standards owing to the crisis and austerity measures required
to re-stabilize the economy have heightened social tension and discontent of late. This, combined
with Parliamentary elections scheduled for early 2012, could lead to a slowdown in reforms, in particular
during the pre-election period. However, all major political parties, whether part of the current coalition
for government or in the opposition, share the same commitment to continue the European integration
process. This common goal and the framework of legal, economic and institutional reforms required to
advance the application of Serbia towards the EU candidate status, will continue to guide the direction of
economic policies and structural reforms in the coming years.

B. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN SERBIA
Pre-crisis and crisis

6.       The Serbian economy grew rapidly until 2008, fuelled by exports and domestic demand,
and significant economic reforms since 2000 (Table 1). GDP growth averaged 5.4 percent per year
during 2001-08, with exports growing at an average annual rate of around 30 percent, albeit from a low
base1. Output rose in real terms by nearly 50 percent between 2000 and 2008, as the corporate sector
started to post profits and the banking sector restructured. The supply response also reflected increases in
productivity and output in recently privatized and de novo firms, as evidenced by the particularly rapid
rates of output growth in precisely those sectors which underwent extensive privatization (e.g., steel,
cement, rubber, tobacco, dairy, sugar and banking) or attracted foreign investors. About 80 percent of
growth was attributed to non-tradable sectors (financial, telecoms, retail). Economic growth helped
improve social conditions, with poverty falling from 13.4 percent of the population in 2002 to 6.1 percent
in 2008. This lifted about 500,000 people out of poverty (before poverty rates began to rise again with
the onset of the global financial crisis).

7.       Strong economic growth was, however, accompanied by a widening external CAD and
increasing private sector debt in the period immediately preceding the financial crisis. Although
exports grew rapidly, imports grew even faster and the trade deficit reached 22.8 percent of GDP in 2008.
As a result, the external CAD sharply increased, from 8.7 percent in 2005 to 18.3 percent in 2008. The
deficit was driven by a widening private sector savings-investment imbalance (it accounted for about 90
percent of the deficit in 2008). Although until 2006 the external imbalances were financed largely by
FDI, 2007-08 saw a rise in debt-financing. In addition, while the Central Bank tightened prudential
regulation on bank activity, many companies switched to direct foreign borrowing. Inflationary pressures
also reemerged in the run up to the crisis, driven primarily by supply side factors 2.

8.      Although much of the external balance had a private origin, fiscal policies contributed as
well with the general government balance moving from a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to a
deficit of 2.6 percent in 2008. Two ad hoc extraordinary pension adjustments in 2008 increased
spending on pensions from 11.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to 13.8 percent in 2009. Large wage increases
were also granted in this period (e.g. wages of health workers were increased by 24 percent in real terms
in 2007). In parallel, revenues declined from 42.9 percent of GDP in 2005 to 40.9 percent in 2008,
primarily due to lower collection of Value Added Tax (VAT), excises and personal income tax. Capital
revenues also decreased sharply.


1
  The ratio of exports of goods and services to GDP increased from 20 percent in 2002 to 30 percent in 2008, still
low compared to regional peers.
2
  In 2007, for instance, higher prices of foods and agricultural products contributed to nearly 50 percent of total
inflation while oil products and electricity contributed to about 30 percent.


                                                        2
9.       In 2009, following the onset of the global financial crisis, the Serbian economy went into
recession as domestic (investment) demand contracted. GDP decreased by 3.1 percent in 2009, a
relatively shallow decline compared to regional peers. This was driven by a 16.1 percent decline in
investment (mostly reflecting running down of inventories), while consumption dropped by 3.6 percent.
The industrial output went down by around 20 percent between mid-2008 to mid-2009. Unemployment
increased from 14.0 percent in April 2008 to 17.4 percent in October 2009. The increase in the
unemployment rate was further aggravated by the transition dynamics; Serbia started its transition later
than most other regional peers, and some of the privatization related layoffs coincided with the onset of
the crisis. Exports fell by nearly 30 percent over the same period, while imports declined even more
sharply. The reduction in the trade deficit paired with strong unrecorded remittances resulted in a sharp
correction in the external CAD from 18.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 6.9 percent in 2009. With decreased
economic activity, and lower food and energy prices, inflation pressures also receded (to about 4 percent).
Credit activity reduced sharply with the onset of the crisis. Real year-on-year (y-o-y) growth rate of credit
to private sector went from over 20 percent in early 2008 to negative values in the second half of 2009.

10.      The authorities responded with a fiscal adjustment package, supported by the IMF. The
IMF approved a 15-month SBA for Special drawing Rights (SDR) 350.8 million, of a precautionary
nature in January 2009. Spending was contained by a range of expenditure measures, including most
potently a nominal wage and pension freeze, and cuts in subsidies and capital expenditures; but revenues
fell sharply, reflecting the contraction in aggregate demand as well as lower collection of trade taxes in
line with the implementation of the SAA with the EU. As a result, the 2009 fiscal deficit increased to 4.3
percent of GDP. In May 2009, the IMF approved an augmented arrangement for SDR 2.6 billion (around
EUR 3 billion, or 10 percent of GDP). The program period was extended to 27 months and the
arrangement was made non-precautionary.

Recent economic developments

11.      The 2010 fiscal deficit amounted to 4.5 percent of GDP, better than the target of 4.9 percent.
The 2010 fiscal policy provided a balanced response to continued economic weakness and the need for
medium-term fiscal consolidation. Revenues as a share of GDP have fallen by a further 0.4 percent of
GDP in 2010. Expenditures were slightly reduced due to disciplined observance of nominal freezes of
pension and public sector wages. A supplementary 2010 budget was approved by the Parliament in
November 2010. Revenues were roughly in line with projections and the deficit target in nominal terms
remained unchanged since the initial budget. However, space created by underspending on capital and
interest was re-allocated to pressing priorities, including social assistance programs. The deficit is
financed through a combination of domestic and external sources (including the EU and the World Bank
budget support), with domestic financing accounting for about 80 percent of the total. Placement of
Treasury Bills (T-bills) has, however, become increasingly difficult in 2010 owing to exchange rate
volatility and increasing risk premia following the Greek crisis; and commercial bank loans have become
the major source of deficit financing. Nevertheless, Serbia has recently managed to issue its first ever
Euro-indexed T-bills.

12.     Preliminary data for 2010 indicate that export-led economic recovery is gaining momentum
and GDP growth for 2010 is estimated to have reached 1.8 percent, but unemployment remains
high (Figure 1). Industrial output and exports have rebounded, and exports to the EU have recovered to
near pre-crisis levels. Key non-tradable sectors, however, remain depressed, indicating a welcome re-
balancing of Serbia`s growth sources.

13.      The real exchange rate has depreciated by about 20 percent since the beginning of the crisis,
facilitating external current account adjustment and boosting competitiveness. The exchange rate is
currently estimated to be slightly undervalued. While RSD depreciation has improved external price
competitiveness, it has also put pressure on corporate balance sheets (gross NPLs) as a share of total loans
stood at 17.8 percent as of end-September 2010, up from 10.2 percent in September 2008). However, due
to conservative pre-crisis provisioning requirements by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS), banks are
considered well-provisioned against credit risks and are able to absorb even a protracted corporate
restructuring process.

14.     After narrowing sharply in 2009, the external CAD is estimated to have stabilized in 2010,
while the trade deficit continues to fall. On the back of RSD devaluation, merchandise exports rose by
20 percent y-o-y for the first nine months of 2010, outpacing the 9 percent growth of imports and cutting
the merchandise trade deficit by 5 percent year-on-year. Despite solid improvement of the current
account, the weakening of capital and financial inflows has resulted in the overall balance of payments
remaining negative in 2010. Loans by foreign parent banks to the private sector have declined most,
driven by corporate sector cross border deleveraging. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has held up
moderately well, reaching 4.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and an estimated 3. 0 percent of GDP in 2010 - in
part due to receipts from privatizations completed in previous years.

15.      Monetary policy has been tightened after inflationary pressures resurfaced. Inflation
dropped from 14 percent y-o-y in the first half of 2008 to 4 percent in the first half of 2010 as the
economic activity contracted. However, since mid-2010 inflation has increased rapidly and at end-2010,
it stood at 10.3 percent (due to a recent spike in food prices and exchange rate depreciation). The Central
Bank is taking steps to counter further increases in inflation expectations, and has increased the reference
rate by 400 basis points (bp) since August 2010.

16.      The banking system has weathered the external shocks well and foreign banks have
generally maintained their exposure to Serbia. Liquidity of the banking sector remains high with the
ratio of liquid assets to total assets at 25.1 percent in September 2010. Capitalization remains strong, with
the capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector at 20.1 percent as of end-September 2010. While possible
spillover effects from foreign parent banks (especially Greek) to subsidiaries are a potential risk, so far
banks have broadly maintained their exposures to Serbia in the context of the Vienna initiative.
Furthermore, after a sharp drop and also due to the Government`s program of subsidized loans, credit
activity is starting to pick up again. However, the modest expansion in the private sector credit through
the domestic banking system is almost completely offset by the cross-border deleveraging of companies. 3

17.      The deceleration of economic growth which resulted from the crisis has led to an upsurge in
poverty. Poverty increased from 6.1 to 6.9 percent point in 2009, equivalent to 60,000 thousand people,
according to the Household Budget Survey (HBS), and evidence from the first six months of 2010 show a
further increase of poverty to 8.8 percent. Growing unemployment from already high levels has been an
important channel of impact of the crisis; unemployment reached 20.0 percent in October 2010. The
poorest groups have been most affected by these trends. The largest increases in unemployment and
largest decreases in employment were registered in the bottom consumption quintile. For this group, total
unemployment increased by 40 percent between October 2008 and October 2009, and total employment
decreased by 12 percent. 4 Most of the problems in coping with the crises are also reported by the
unemployed. Estimates from the special module on the effects of the crisis added to the Labor Force
Survey (LFS) suggest that more than half of those unemployed or discouraged in October 2009 reported
to have been very strongly affected by the crisis, compared to 27 percent among employees and 36
percent among the self-employed. At a variance with most ECA countries, declining wages appear to be a
relatively less important channel of impact of the crisis than growing unemployment.

18.      The Government is committed to the implementation of the IMF SBA. All end-December
2010 quantitative performance were observed. The IMF and Serbian authorities reached a staff level
agreement on the seventh and final review of SBA. Subject to approval by the IMF Management and
Executive Board, completion will allow Serbia to draw about EUR 365 million to support its external
reserve position. As the present SBA comes to an end, several high ranking officials ­ including Governor
of the National Bank, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance ­ have indicated publicly that the
authorities are interested in initiating a fresh program.

  After increasing at a rate of more than EUR 1 billion per quarter from Q2 2007 to Q3 2008, the stock of cross
border loans decreased by approximately EUR 700 million in 2009 and by an additional EUR 410 million in first
half of 2010.
4
  For comparison, employment decreased by only 0.9 percent and unemployment increased by only 7.7 percent
during the same period within the top consumption quintile. The quintile information refers to the consumption
distribution in October 2009 as the LFS in October 2008 did not collect a summary consumption module.

C. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
19.      Consistent with forecasts supported by the IMF SBA, growth is projected to accelerate to 5-
5.5 percent of GDP over the medium term, and to rely increasingly on exports and investments.
GDP is forecast to grow at 3 percent in 2011, due to a recovery of private investments and stabilization in
consumption (Table 2). Consumption is projected to continue expanding, although more modestly than
pre-crisis. Even though consumption is forecast to continue contributing positively to growth throughout
the forecast period, it is expected to grow slower than the overall output; therefore, its share in GDP will
gradually decline. Investment and net exports are forecast to become the main drivers of growth in the
medium term. On the back of the significant exchange rate depreciation, and following an estimated 24
percent export growth (in euro terms) in 2010, merchandise exports are projected to grow by 13 percent in
euro terms in 2011 and an ambitious 22 percent in 2012, while imports are forecast to increase by around
10 percent in both 2011 and 2012 (linked to the increases in imports of energy and intermediate goods).
As a share of GDP, merchandise exports are forecast to gradually increase from 25 percent of GDP in
2010 to around 30 percent in 2015 (still low compared to regional peers). This will be supported by the
fact that, with the 20 real depreciation of the currency in last two years, Serbia`s economy has regained
much of the price competitiveness that it lost in the pre-crisis years. However, despite solid growth of
GDP in the outer projection years, the unemployment rate is forecast to improve only gradually fro m the
current level of 20 percent, to about 15 percent by 2015.

20.     The projected recovery requires continued structural adjustment consistent with the
Government's reform program and the EU accession agenda, resulting in a rebalancing of the
economy away from consumption-led to export-led growth. Post-crisis growth is underpinned by
higher exports and savings, with more modest consumption growth. 5 The domestic savings rate is
ambitiously forecast to improve from 8.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 16.4 percent of GDP in 2015. About
half of the projected improvement in the savings rate will come from the increases in public sector
savings, brought about mainly by moderation in pensions and public sector wage spending. Increased
savings of the public sector are supported by the recently adopted Fiscal Responsibility Legislation
(FRL). Increased private sector savings are underpinned by the improvements in the business
environment and further privatizations, which will gradually improve corporate productivity and
profitability (the reforms supported by the World Bank Private and Financial Sector Policy Based
Guarantee (PFSPBG) and preceding Programmatic Private and Financial Development Policy Loan
(PFDPL) program are at the center of this agenda). Additionally, re-establishing Serbia as a viable
investment destination for global companies will be important in rebalancing the economy, as global
companies bring access to markets that were lost during the 1990s. The Government has recently taken
an increasingly active approach in attracting foreign investments in tradable sectors, for example through
forming a joint venture with the FIAT car company. However, these measures are just starting and the
progress has been patchy. Yet, despite the challenges, there is a broad political consensus that a shift to a
new growth model is necessary, as set out in the recently presented Government strategy, Serbia 2020.

21.      A return to the pre-crisis model of consumption-led growth would risk development of an
unsustainable external balance. If consumption were to return to pre-crisis levels, external debt would
start increasing again, driven by the further buildup of private sector debt. In this scenario, external debt
would likely be above 90 percent of GDP by 2015 and rising, potentially threatening external stability.
With higher consumption, the tax to GDP ratio would improve and the headline fiscal deficit would
narrow, but the structural fiscal deficit would remain elevated.

22.      Continued wage restraint and efforts to tighten monetary policy are needed to contain
inflation, although it is projected to remain elevated until 2011. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation
is projected to stay above the NBS target level for most of 2011, due to continuing high food prices, the
pass through of the large exchange rate depreciation, as well as increased inflationary expectations. The
central bank has indicated that it will further tighten monetary policy if needed, using all policy tools
available. The key to bringing inflation back to target will be to contain second round spillover effects,
particularly on wages.

23.     Fiscal policy is anchored in the recently adopted FRL 6, which sets the medium-term deficit
target at 1 percent of GDP, and outlines wage and pension indexation formulae until at least 2015.
The FRL sets out numerical targets for the general government deficit over the medium term, as well as a
cap on the overall level of public debt (standing at 45 percent of GDP, not including restitution liabilities
that could potentially arise from the compensation for assets confiscated after World War II).
Government revenues are projected to gradually decline over the medium term due to lower consumption
and lower taxes on foreign trade. The structural declines in revenues are projected to be offset through
improvements in the capacity of the tax administration as well as through further expenditure reforms.
Expenditure reprioritization and a reduction in current spending will remain necessary, especially given
the Government`s plans to increase spending on infrastructure. Progress with structural public

  As a share of GDP, consumption is forecast to gradually decrease from around 92 percent in 2010 to around 83
percent in 2015. About two thirds of this relative decrease will come from private sector and one third from public
sector.

  New Fiscal Responsibility legislation was enacted in December 2010 in the form of amendments to the Budget
Systems Law.

expenditure reforms in the largest spending sectors (pensions, education, and public wages) is critical in
this regard, and is supported by the PEDPL program.

24.      As detailed in the World Bank Serbia Report (2009)7, structural reforms will lead to
important fiscal savings over the medium term. The pension and wage freeze and the new post-freeze
indexation formulae in the FRL will contain pension and wage spending which will lead to a significant
drop in the pension and wage bill as a share of GDP (see Table 2). The projections in Table 2 also
incorporate the (initially modest) fiscal impact of structural reforms in health and education on the wage
bill, including the consolidation of under-enrolled primary classes. 8 Transfers to local governments are
projected to be only slowly restored to pre-crisis levels, and most subsidies will be frozen at their nominal
2010 level. The cost of the credit support programs in the 2011 budget will be reduced considerably,
including by phasing out cash loans and curtailing the subsidy rate for liquidity loans.

25.     The planned 2011 budget deficit of approximately 141 billion RSD, or about 4.1 percent of
GDP, is in line with FRL (Table 3). Telekom privatization proceeds (projected to be up to 4 percent of
GDP) will likely cover the major share of 2011 budget financing needs. There is a strong political
commitment and a consensus in the ruling coalition to go forward with the Telekom privatization.
Market prospects for this privatization appear good as seven companies have qualified for participation in
a public tender for the sale. Bids have to be submitted by end-March 2011 and the process is expected to
be completed in the first half of 2011. In the unlikely event that the sale of Telekom Serbia does not go
ahead, the authorities plan to cover the shortfall through a Eurobond issuance complemented by
additional borrowing from domestic banks and T-bill issuance. In this case, the Government`s gross
financing needs would increase compared to the baseline by approximately 1 percentage po int of GDP

 World Bank (2009) shows that the phasing in of DRGs can be expected to lead to savings equivalent to 1 percent
of GDP annually, while consolidating under-enrolled classes can save the equivalent of 1.3 percent of GDP
annually. However, the savings in the short term, especially in the case of the structural reforms in health and
education, are much more modest.

 throughout the forecast period. Public debt in 2015 would be about 4 percentage points of GDP higher
 than in the baseline case. If necessary, further expenditure restructuring would have to take place; the
 authorities have demonstrated their ability and commitment to do this effectively in the context of the
 crisis.

 26.     The external CAD is forecast to stabilize and remain in nominal terms at the 2010 level. As
 mentioned earlier, robust performance of exports is forecast (on the back of further structural reforms, a
 competitive exchange rate, and progress towards EU accession) and a gradual recovery of imports (aided
 by the adjustment in the exchange rate as well as slower growth in domestic consumption). Nevertheless,
 the external trade deficit is projected to remain high, declining to 10.7 percent of GDP at the end of the
 forecasting period. Despite these projected adjustments, Serbia still faces considerable balance of
 payments financing needs.

 27.      Serbia's external financing requirements will be high. Serbia`s gross financing needs amount
 to around 24 percent of GDP in both 2011 and 2012, or EUR 7.9 billion in 2011 and EUR 8.5 billion in
 2012 (Table 4). These financing requirements are largely due to high private sector debt amortization.
 Accordingly, financing needs are projected to be covered largely by private inflows. FDI inflows are
 expected to spike in 2011, reflecting the privatization of Telekom Serbia, and projected to stabilize at
 about 4 percent of GDP annually afterwards. As corporate restructuring restores investor confidence,
 other private external flows, mostly to enterprises, are also projected to resume. Disbursements from
 international financial institutions (IFIs) and other multilaterals, including IMF, EU and the Bank, will
 contribute further to the financing of the program.

28.      Foreign exchange reserves are forecast to remain at a comfortable level. Serbia`s reserve
coverage continues to compare favorably to other emerging markets. Following a decline in 2010, gross
international reserves are expected to stabilize in 2011, and rise in the outer years. As of October 2010,
gross foreign exchange reserves are at a comfortable level, as indicated by standard indicators (gross
foreign reserves are enough to cover 8 months of imports and the ratio of gross foreign reserves to M1
stands at 429 percent; ratio of gross foreign exchange reserves to short term external debt plus medium
and long term amortizations is estimated at 2.0 in 2010 and not falling below 1.7 throughout the forecast
period).

29.      Under the baseline scenario outlined, both external and public debt remains sustainable.
External debt is projected to gradually decline to 66 percent of GDP by 2015 (Table 5). Similarly, public
debt is forecast to decline after 2010 and fall to below 30 percent of GDP by 2015. Strong policies and
structural reforms (including those supported by Bank programs) will underlie higher growth rates and
improved public and external balances, underpinning the declining path of both external and public debt
over the forecasting period. In addition, other debt and debt service indicators do not point to immediate
areas of concern.

30.     Standardized debt stress tests, however, point to sizeable risks if some assumptions do not
materialize: the sustainability of Serbia's external debt depends on the performance of growth and
exports and the stability of the exchange rate. External debt does decline under scenarios in which
exports and growth consistently underperform, thus underlining the need for strong reforms and prudent
macroeconomic policies. Also, there are risks from exchange rate and other shocks:
     Real depreciation of 30 percent would bring the external debt to GDP ratio to just under 120
        percent. While the debt to GDP ratio declines afterwards, gross financing needs remain elevated.
        However, further large real exchange rate depreciation is considered unlikely.
     A current account shock would see the external debt to GDP ratio stop declining and stand at
        around 76 percent in 2015. In this scenario, external financing needs would be around USD 2 to 3
        billion (around 3 to 5 percent of GDP) above the baseline in each of the forecast years.
     A combined shock (permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth
        rate, and current account balance) would cause the external debt to decline slower than in the
        baseline and be around 74 percent of GDP in 2015. Financing needs would remain elevated.
     Other types of shocks would have a modest effect on the external debt path.

31.     Serbia's public debt outlook is sensitive to underperformance of growth, delays in fiscal
consolidation, and exchange rate shocks.
     If the growth rate underperforms by two percentage points annually over the forecast period,
        public debt would start gradually increasing again in the middle of the forecast period and reach
        43 percent by 2015. Towards the end of the forecast period, gross financing needs in case of such
        a growth rate shock would be some 6 to 7 percentage points of GDP higher than in the baseline
        scenario. However, Serbia's track record under the IMF, the EU and the World Bank supported
        programs, and it is macroeconomic and development policy programs provide comfort that the
        policy mix will be adjusted to avoid such a scenario.
     Under no policy change scenario, public debt would be declining, but only very gradually. By
        2015, it would stand at 41 percent of GDP. Financing needs in this scenario would be
        significantly higher than in the baseline.
     With more than 70 percent of public debt denominated in foreign currency, a real depreciation
        shock of 30 percent would initially push the public debt to around 60 percent of GDP. 9 Public
        debt would then gradually decline.
     Other types of shocks would have a modest effect on the public debt path.

32.      Overall, Serbia's macroeconomic framework is adequate for this operation. Post crisis, the
economy will be geared towards a more sustainable growth paradigm. This will require higher domestic
savings and increased competitiveness. With respect to the latter, continued progress in business
environment reforms remains crucial to solidify Serbia`s rebalancing of growth sources. Enhanced
competitiveness will also require investment in infrastructure. To free up fiscal space to invest in
infrastructure, privatization and financial discipline of non-private enterprise will be important, as will
further process in structural reforms in pensions and public sector wages. In this regard, reducing pension
spending (which is very large by any measure) is particularly critical and the new pension legislation is a
step in the right direction.

33.     Still, considerable risks remain. The global economic outlook, while improved, remains
uncertain, which may result in slower export growth and lower capital flows (FDI and portfolio).
Spillovers from Euro area include risks of lower growth in Serbia`s main trading partners slowing
Serbia`s own growth and current account adjustment. In this scenario, external debt would remain at
around 75 percent of GDP throughout the forecast period (as opposed to gradually decreasing in the
baseline) and external financing needs would be higher by some 3 percent of GDP. Further, lower growth
could also cause the public debt to move to a potentially unsustainable path. There are also risks of
external financing shortfalls, including from the envisaged telecom privatization. The external financing
outlook could also be impacted by increases in the country`s risk premium due to external shocks,
including possibly a new round of euro-area periphery spillovers 10.                Under such scenarios,
macroeconomic policies will have to be adjusted with a greater focus on stabilization rather than
countercyclical policies. As the crisis has illustrated, the authorities are committed to act quickly and
decisively if the need for larger fiscal consolidation arises. Political challenges, including opposition of
some unions to the pension reform and potential backlash from prolonged public sector wage freezes,

9
   Ministry of Finance`s Budget Memorandum estimates that 1 percent depreciation of the nominal effective
exchange rate would increase the public debt to GDP ratio by 0.33 percentage points. Thus, nominal depreciation of
30 percent would increase the public debt to GDP ratio by 10 percentage points.
10
   Direct spillovers from the Greek crisis are likely to be limited. Greek banks account for about one sixth of
Serbia`s banking sector, but they are well capitalized and liquid. Trade links with Greece are relatively minor, and
although it has been one of the largest investors in Serbia in the early years of the transition in 2008-2010, Greece
accounted for a small share of total FDIs. However, indirect channels (risk perception, interest rate spread and in
medium to long term EU accession skepticism) may present a problem.

 could slow progress on the reform agenda. The 2012 elections are likely to intensify spending pressures,
 although the FRL and creation of the Fiscal Council are aimed at containing those pressures.

      III.       THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

 34.      As discussed in detail in the PEDPL1 Program Document, the strategic setting for reforms
 in Serbia is to a large extent defined by the ongoing work on Serbia's integration into EU. The latest
 strategic document that defines the agenda of EU integration is contained in the 2008 National Plan for
 Integration. This detailed document explains the Government`s priorities for the harmonization of
 Serbia`s institutional and legal framework with the EU. 11 In December 2010, the Government adopted the
 action plan on gaining EU candidate status by end-2011. Important progress on EU accession has been
 made in 2010 and early 2011. In late 2010, EU Council decided to forward Serbia's application to the EC
 for an opinion and the questionnaire on Serbia's application for EU candidacy was given to the
 Government. In addition, the European Parliament ratified the SAA with Serbia in January 2011.

 35.     The level of public spending in Serbia remains high relative to other countries in the re gion
 of similar levels of income. Table 6 demonstrates the economic classification of consolidated general
 government expenditures. Capital spending as a share of GDP has been relatively volatile in recent years,
 ranging from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to 4.8 percent in 2007, and it is generally below the levels for
 other countries at similar stages of development.

 36.      While recurrent spending as a share of GDP has been roughly constant, there have been
 important shifts within recurrent expenditures. Prior to the crisis, subsidies and interest payments
 have been declining quite sharply (as a result of the crisis-related increases in public debt, interest
 payments are forecast to increase again, although they will remain relatively modest). On the othe r hand,
 transfers to households, and pension payments in particular, have been increasing prior to the crisis.
 Although pensions have been nominally frozen throughout 2009 and 2010, a large increase in pension
 expenditures as a share of GDP in 2009 reflects significant increases in pensions in late 2008. The public

sector wage bill has been in excess of ten percent of GDP throughout the past five years. Similar to
pensions, public sector wages have been nominally frozen throughout 2009 and 2010 to contain
expenditures during the crisis. As a result, their share in GDP has decreased both in 2009 and 2010, but it
remains comparatively high, on the back of large increases in employment levels and wages in health and
education, prior to the crisis. The post-freeze indexation policy set out in FRL aims to ensure that both
pensions and public wages expenditures are brought down to more manageable levels.

37.     As shown in Table 7, the composition of spending is dominated by non-discretionary
spending and in particular social sector spending. The largest single item of expenditures consists of
pensions, consuming more than one quarter of public expenditures in 2010. Spending on health (largely
financed from social contributions to the Health Insurance Fund, HIF) is the second largest item of
consolidated spending.

38.      The Government's reform program to reduce the size of Serbia's large public sector and
improve the efficiency of public spending is based on three pillars: (i) public expenditure allocation
reforms to improve the efficiency of spending in the largest spending programs; (ii) public expenditure
and debt management reforms to make spending more strategic and to improve fiscal management with a
particular focus on fiduciary conditions; and, (iii) social assistance reforms to cushion the impact of the
current crisis and to enhance the coverage of the programs going forward. These pillars are discussed in
further detail below.

PILLAR I ­PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ALLOCATION REFORMS

Policy area 1.a: Containing the public sector wage bill and improving public administration

39.     As outlined in the PEDPL1 Program Document and mentioned earlier, public sector wages
in Serbia had grown rapidly during the last decade and are now equivalent to about ten percent of
GDP. While this proportion is typical of Eastern European countries, Government`s fiscal constraints
suggest that further growth in the wage bill is unaffordable. Historically, the system of public sector
personnel management has also been plagued by overstaffing in some sectors, as well as ad hoc wage
increases and pay inequities.


                                                      14
40.      Efforts are continuing to bring down the wage bill and improve the efficiency of spending,
in line with the targets set under the FRL. In the short term, such savings are coming primarily from
continued wage restraint, which will bring down average public administration wage levels (which are
still high by regional standards), as well as through some reduction in employment levels. In response to
the deteriorating fiscal situation, the Government imposed a freeze on nominal public sector salaries in
2009. This applied not only to central government ministries, but also to staff paid by social insurance
funds, including the HIF, and local governments. The Government continued the wage freeze throughout
2010. In January 2011, indexation has resumed. The Government had planned to increase wages in
January 2011 on the basis of inflation in the second half of 2010, but this was capped to two percent to
contain fiscal costs. From now on, wage increases will be linked to inflation plus one half of GDP growth
through 2015. As per the FRL (in the form of amendments to the Budget Systems Law), public wage and
employment policies for 2012-15 will be constrained by a rule to gradually reduce the general
government wage bill to 8 percent of GDP. If the target is not met by 2015, the legislation stipulates that
the limits will continue to apply beyond 2015, until the targets are met.

Education

41.      Government efforts are focusing increasingly on medium-term structural reforms. The
Government is attempting to right-size staffing in the education sector. Several recent studies show that
there is scope for reducing teaching staff (along with non-teaching staff) in schools without hampering the
quality of education. Due to Serbia`s declining birth rate, the number of school age children has fallen.
The number of teachers has not, at least not as fast, resulting in extremely low student/teacher ratios in
some classes. The studies show that significant fiscal savings could be achieved merely by consolidating
under-enrolled classes of the same grade within individual schools. 12 Larger reductions could be achieved
by a similar exercise of class consolidation across different schools within the same municipality or
school district, or school closures. 13

42.      The Ministry of Education and Science (MES) has begun the first phase of the school
network rationalization process. Its first move was to ensure full enforcement of the minimum class
size standards for primary schools with more than one class in the same grade. These took effect in
September 2009 (for the 2009/2010 school year) 14. The methodology for rationalization will apply only to
grades 1st, 5 th, and 9 th (the latter being the first year of secondary school). In the next three years, the
standards will be extended to the same set of grades (1 st, 5 th, and 9th) for three new cohorts, ensuring that
the whole primary and secondary education system (grades 1 through 12) will be fully rationalized by the
end of the school year 2012/2013. This timetable is intended to overlap with the gradual introduction of
capitation-based financing, which will be rolled out at the beginning of school year 2012/13 and
implemented full nationwide at the beginning of the 2014/15 school year. According to the MES, the
application of the rationalization instruction in school year 2009/10 resulted in the closing of 658
                                                                15
classrooms in 2009/10, or about 1.4 percent of the total . Preliminary numbers for the school year

12
   Eri (2010) shows that the ongoing class consolidation plan of the Government could result in savings for the
education sector of about 3% of the education budget. See Eric, M. (2010); Rationalization and optimization
initiatives for the Education Sector in Serbia: Analysis and Fiscal Implications, Background Paper prepared for the
World Bank, p.13
13
   A detailed analysis by Mónica Robayo for the upcoming World Bank Skills Flagship Report - see Sondergaard
and Murthi, eds. (forthcoming); Skills, Not Just Diplomas ­ Managing for Results in Education in Europe and
Central Asia ­ shows that savings would more than double if a 30 -student class size rule were to be enforced within
each of the municipalities, be it through class consolidation or school consolidation (merging/closures).

   Per Ministerial Technical Instruction No: 401-00-481/1/2009-08 titled "Technical Instructions on Forming
Classes and the Method of Funding in Elementary and Secondary Schools".
15
   Based on the number of primary and secondary school classes reported in Table 5 of Doing More with Less


                                                        15
2010/11 show that a total of 533 classes have been closed so far. Similar figures are expected for the next
two school years.

43.     This gradual but steady decrease in the number of classes, along with two voluntary
separation programs16, have so far achieved some cost savings in the sector. A total of 287 employees
in the education sector have been made redundant during the last two school years (184 employees in
school year 2009/10 and 103 employees during the ongoing school year so far). More important,
however, is the reduction in full-time norms (full-time equivalent teaching status) for about 4,500 teachers
ever since this first phase started. Considering the fact that the primary education sector has roughly
50,000 teachers, the reduction in the number of hours for approximately 10 percent of them is not
negligible.

44.      The second stage of the school network rationalization process has also been kicked -off.
This will entail the complete re-design of the school network of pre-primary and primary institutions, per
the mandate of the by-law issued last October 21, 2010 17. This new normative stipulates the obligation of
municipal governments (or local self governments (LSGs)) to pass an act on the consolidation of their
school network in their own legislatures within the period of one year. The said act should abide by the
fact that a primary school will only be considered a legal entity if it has a minimum of 400 students or if it
has less than 400 students but no other primary school exists within a 2 km-radius; otherwise, the school
is considered a school object and bound for closure or consolidation. This means that a potentially high
number of schools, especially in urban areas, is likely to start being consolidated (closed or merged with
other schools) within a couple of years, once the LSGs have submitted their school network acts and the
Ministry, in collaboration with the LSGs, starts undertaking the consolidation process.

45.      Over the medium term, improvements in the efficiency of the education system are sought
by changing to a per capita financing model. 18 In late 2009, the Law on the Foundations of the
Education system was enacted, which creates the legal framework for introducing changes in resource
allocation mechanisms in the education sector subsequent to that legislation. The international consultant
hired by MES finalized in January 2011 a policy options paper submitted to the authorities of the MES.
MES is expected to endorse this paper March and decide about the specific options to be used for the roll-
out of the system in September 2011. This policy options paper, once endorsed, will set the stage for the
adoption of a formal Action Plan for the introduction of per capita financing (PCF) in the education
sector. PCF will be further legislated through a set of upcoming by-laws, which will clarify the type of
financing modality, the expected coverage by level of education, as well as the timing and phasing of the
new model. With the introduction of capitation financing, municipal governments will have increased
responsibilities for effective resource management and a total of five to fifteen municipalities are
expected to be piloted in the first phase.




16
   The stimulus plan consists of two voluntary separation programs. The first is for staff who meet one of the two
conditions for normal retirement (age and years of service) but not both. Such staff were offered six gross salaries as
an incentive to depart in lieu of the typical severance package of three gross salaries. The second option, available to
all staff, offers 200 Euro per year of service.

School Network.
18
   Other countries in the region have found it useful to enlist local governments to help improve the efficiency of
spending in the education sector. The Bulgarian Government, for example, allocates funding for education to each
local government on the basis of enrollment, and allows each local government to recommend which schools and
classes to close.


                                                          16
Health

46.      Reforms in the health sector have focused on productivity incentives. The top priority in
health financing reform is the introduction of a productivity factor into the calculation of the wages of
health care staff. An amendment to the public sector wage law that would allow health care staff to be
paid, in part, on the basis of the number of patients they see has been submitted to Parliament in
September 2010. This is to be followed by a gradual shift to output based financing. For primary health
centers, the HIF will allocate 10 percent of funding to individual doctors within each health care center
according to a formula that largely reflects the number of patients they see. Productivity related
percentage of salaries of health providers will progressively increase over time. In secondary health care,
compensation in hospitals will be based on DRGs where hospitals will be paid according to number and
category of services provided instead number of beds and staff as it is at present. The HIF has completed
the Blue Book defining/coding services in hospital care and has downsized the number of diagnoses
from 14,000 to 8,000. At present, HIF is in the process of defining and verifying time and staffing norms
for each service/code listed. Hospitals that are eligible will then start reporting to HIF on services
provided using DRG coding for procedures.

47.      Pending the introduction of these financing reforms, staff rationalization in the health
sector is likely to be limited. Staffing norms currently exist for doctors, nurses and non-medical staff in
health care institutions. These are based largely on population. But actual staffing numbers are heavily
influenced by history. As a result, according to the Ministry of Health`s (MOH) own norms, there are
approximately 5,000 more non-medical staff and 5,000 less nurses than needed (the number of doctors is
approximately consistent with the norms). Some staff rationalization is reportedly proceeding under the
aegis of the human resources committee of the MOH. If the number of staff in a given category is above
the norm in a given health care institution, his/her position cannot be advertised once the current occupant
retires. Exceptions, however, are often granted.

Pay and Grading

48.      Preparations are underway to extend the earlier pay and grading reforms to the majority of
staff not covered by the 2005/6 civil service law. 19 At present, these staff is classified into 612 separate
position titles, each with its own wage coefficient. In normal years (i.e., when wage freezes are not in
effect), the wage setting process consists of case by case negotiations, in which the more influential
unions tend to emerge with the largest increases in coefficients. The immediate aim of the pay and
grading reform is to reduce pay inequities within the public sector; to ensure that comparable positions in
different ministries are comparably compensated. It is conceivable, nevertheless, that a more systematic
and transparent wage setting mechanism would strengthen the Government`s ability to resist ad hoc wage
demands. It might eventually permit the Government to benchmark public sector wages against private
sector comparators, reducing the scope for over (or under) compensation.

49.     The Government has constituted a working group under the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare (MOLSP) and charged it with preparing a pay and grading rationalization plan for this
group of staff. The MOLSP`s current proposal would consolidate all existing job titles and coefficients
into twelve grades, each with a single coefficient. Individual wages would be determined by multiplying
the coefficient for a given grade by a single base salary, applicable to all public service employees. The
latter would be adjusted periodically at the discretion of the Government. However, considerable work
remains to be done in preparing for the reform. Inter alia, the MOLSP will have to seek the consensus of
the relevant sectoral ministries as to the matching of existing positions to the proposed twelve grades.
Although MOLSP intends to initiate such discussions in early 2011, this process is likely to take time.

19
     This effort would exclude police, military, and local government personnel.


                                                            17
50.      Before proceeding, the Government has made a rough calculation of the impact of the pay
and grading reform on the wage bill. The calculation assumes that the coefficient for each grade will be
set at the median of the existing coefficients to be consolidated into that grade. In this way, the refor m
would reduce spurious disparities in compensation within a given grade but would not have a substantial
impact on the average level of wages. Even such a limited reform would, nevertheless, imply transition
costs. The consolidation of positions into a limited number of grades will inevitably result in increased
coefficients for some positions--in this case, those that are currently below the median for the respective
grade. In theory, these costs could be offset by decreases in coefficients for positions that are currently
above the median for that grade. It is likely, however, that such positions would be grandfathered; i.e.,
that the coefficient of the exiting occupant would remain unchanged, although any subsequent increases
could be capped and the correct coefficient imposed once the position is vacated. Under these
assumptions, it is estimated that the net cost of the reform, in its first year of full implementation, would
be about 0.35 percent of GDP. The precise fiscal impact of the reform will depend not only on the extent
of grandfathering but also on final decisions concerning the matching of the existing positions to new
grades and the base salary and coefficients for each grade that the Government ultimately decides upon.

51.     Enactment of the pay and grading reform will only occur when the fiscal space is available
to implement it. The Government is, therefore, holding further action on this reform in abeyance.

Policy Area 1.b: Making the pension system fiscally sustainable

52.     The pension system is another target for reform as it is the largest single spending program
and runs a deficit of 6 percent of GDP. Serbia also has the second highest ratio of pension spending to
GDP in the ECA region, higher than the pension spending ratio in Croatia and Slovenia and the other
countries of the former Yugoslavia. The immediate problem is that there are too many pensioners, with
many people collecting benefits who are below the retirement age, and with a level of benefits that is
much higher than affordable.

53.      The problem was exacerbated by two extraordinary pension increases in 2008 , in addition
to the legislated pension increases in April and October. With the onset of the financial crisis, the
slowdown in economic growth and resulting unemployment, revenues of the pension system itself were
adversely affected, leading to higher deficits which needed to be financed from the budget and was also
constrained by falling revenues. The immediate measure taken was to freeze pensions in nominal terms
in 2009. The pension freeze was extended in 2010, with the expectation that a new pension law would be
drafted and enacted in 2010. The higher than expected revenue growth in 2010 has also allowed the
Government to allocate an additional RSD 5,000 per pensioner, restricted to those pensioners receiving
less than RSD 30,000 per month, as a one-off payment to help compensate for the recent inflation.

54.      The FRL sets targets and pension indexation rules for medium-term pension spending. The
Government plans to raise pensions by inflation and half of real GDP growth in 2011 and half in 2012
and return to inflation indexation by second half of 2012 with the provision that should GDP growth
exceed 4 percent per year, pensions would be increased by inflation plus the difference between actual
GDP growth and 4 percent. This system of indexation will substantially reduce the fiscal burden of the
pension in the next few years, with pension spending as a share of GDP falling from 13.8 percent in 2009
to less than 12 percent in 2012. As per the FRL, if the 10 percent of GDP spending target will not be met
by 2015, the limits on pension increases will continue to apply beyond 2015, until the target is met.

55.     A new pension law has been enacted by the Serbian Government following discussions with
stakeholders. The law contains measures which (i) reduce the number of people receiving pensions, (ii)
reduce the level of benefits, (iii) reduce benefits and privileges for the Ministry of Interior employees and


                                                     18
the military; and, (iv) increase minimum pensions. Number of pension beneficiaries will be reduced as
the minimum age of pension receipt is increased from 53 to 58 and the age at which widows and
widowers receive pensions is raised to 53 and 58 from 50 and 55, respectively. Benefit levels will be
reduced as the 15 percent bonus women received in their pensions is gradually reduced to 6 percent. The
law also reduces extra pension privileges for the Ministry of Interior employees and moves to basing
pensions on career average salaries rather than the last salary. The same is true for the military and
contractors working for the military and will result in an integrated pension system covering all workers
in Serbia with the same rules and regulations. The draft law also contains an increase in minimum
pensions for all pensioners, given the hardships lower income pensioners have faced, particularly in 2010,
with pensions frozen while prices continued to rise. In response to opposition by the trade unions, all
measures affecting women will be delayed by two years. The trade unions also made other requests
which have not been incorporated in the new law, but which the Government agreed to study further.
There are risks that these measures, if implemented, might undermine some of the fiscal savings achieved
by the new law.

56.      Further measures will be needed to ensure the structural soundness of the system. Pension
benefits are based on a point system as defined in the April 2003 Law. Individuals accumulate personal
points based on the length of their contribution history and their contribution wage relative to average
wage. The Serbian system unusually links the value of the general point (a measure of the generosity of
the benefit) to the indexation that individuals are given post-retirement. This de-links the benefits
received from the wages on which contributions were actually paid. Indexing pension contributions to
inflation before retirement allows their value to erode over time in a growing economy, which raises
generational equity issues and implies that the younger cohort is generally worse off. International best
practice suggests that the general point should be indexed to wage growth, while pensions after re tirement
are linked to inflation. Given the high benefit ratio in Serbia, moving immediately to international best
practice would be quite expensive, but at some point the switch will need to be made. The Bank is
working with the authorities to do the preparatory work for such a change.


PILLAR II: PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND DEBT MANAGEMENT REFORMS

Policy area 2.a: Putting in place a more comprehensive, integrated medium-term planning and
budgeting framework.

57.      The National Assembly adopted a revised Budget Systems Law (BSL) in October 2010,
primarily to introduce fiscal responsibility provisions as part of its aim to strengthen control of
public expenditure. The new provisions establish principles for fiscal responsibility, explicit fiscal
targets for budget deficits and debt as a share of GDP and creation of an independent Fiscal Council to
advise the National Assembly on the government`s fiscal strategy. The fiscal responsibility provisions are
in line with recommendations of the IMF. The revised BSL also strengthened existing provisions for
financial management control and internal audit, debt management, accounting and financial reporting
standards. These changes build on the improvements adopted in the 2009 BSL, allowing for greater
budgetary expenditure planning and control, increased transparency of fiscal policies, projections and
risks, improved accountability and financial management.

58.     The 2011 Budget Memorandum and Budget Law reflect the implementation of many
aspects of the revised BSL and comply with the fiscal responsibility provisions established in 2010.
The Memorandum provided better information on medium term fiscal projections, fiscal risks and budget
assumptions than was available previously. The estimated budget deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP is within
the range required by the IMF SBA and below the maximum annual deficit target set in the BSL.



                                                    19
59.      The government has completed a public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA)
review which indicated significant improvement in scores since 2008. The PEFA review concluded
that improvements had been made across all sections of the financial management indicators with
particularly strong improvement in accounting, recording and reporting. The introduction of an integrated
Treasury information system and a single Treasury account has been a major factor in improving the
quality of budget execution, accounting and reporting. Some PEFA scores were lower than 2008, largely
due to the effects of the international financial crisis on predictability of revenue and expenditure.

Policy area 2.b. Improving public expenditure monitoring and control (covering external/internal audit
and procurement)

Budget Execution, Internal Control and Internal Audit

60.      The Government, through the Treasury, has strengthened its focus on improving the
quality and consistency of accounting and cash management. The government passed a decree in July
2010 to apply international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS) for government accounting
starting from January 1, 2011. The decree has been reflected in the revised BSL and related government
regulations. The adoption of IPSAS will address the conflicting requirements previously applied to
accounting and reporting in Serbia. Each budget beneficiary will be required to maintain accounting
information according to accrual based IPSAS but reporting on the final accounts will be on a cash basis.

61.     The Treasury is receiving support from the EC and United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID) on development of new accounting and reporting arrangements. A project is
underway to refine further the central financial management information system (FMIS) to meet the
accounting and reporting needs of Serbia. This project builds on substantial previous work since 2002,
supported by the EC, to implement the new FMIS and integrate it with other accounting and reporting
systems with the government and the National Bank of Serbia.

62.      Internal audit and financial management control arrangements took an important step
forward in late 2009 with the adoption of the government's strategy for development of public
internal financial control (PIFC) arrangements. Since then the government has worked steadily to
implement the strategy, starting with the establishment of the central harmonization unit (CHU) for
internal audit. The first annual report on internal audit activities in line ministries was prepared in June by
the CHU and provided to the Minister of Finance. Refinements have been made to the definitions,
responsibilities and activities associated with the public internal financial control and internal audit in the
BSL as part of the changes adopted by the National Assembly on October 12, 2010.

63.     Internal audit and financial management control arrangements in government bodies
remains patchy with substantial work to be done to complete implementation. Although 70 people
have been fully trained and have performed the requisite two audits under supervision from the Ministry
of Finance, there have been no internal auditors certified due to the absence of authorized qualifications,
which are currently being developed by the CHU to confer certificates for qualified internal auditors.

Public Procurement

64.     The bylaws related to the implementation of the new Public Procurement Law (PPL) have
been completed and approved by the Government. Specifically, the following bylaws have been
prepared, adopted and published on the Public Procurement Office (PPO) web-site:
     Low Value Public Procurement Procedures;
     Certification of the Public Procurement Officers;
     Domestic Preferences Definitions and Application;


                                                      20
        Ordinance on Public Procurement Committees;
        Mandatory Parts for the Tender Documentation Used in the Public Procurement Procedures (in
        addition to this, PPO has prepared the respective models of tender documentations and forms);
        Bids Opening Procedures and Minutes of Bids Opening Form;
        Public Procurement Data Processing;
        Electronic Offers and Procedures for Electronic Public Procurement.

65.      Despite recent progress, there remain outstanding concerns about the implementation of
some of the provisions of the new PPL. According to the new PPL Art 102, the Republic Commission
for the Protection of Rights in Public Procurement Procedures, or Republic Commission (RCPR) shall be
elected and dismissed by the National Assembly upon Government Proposal within 6 months from the
enforcement of the new PPL. The appointment of the RCPR by Parliament was significantly delayed and
was one of the main impediments for the proper application of the PPL and respective bylaws. The issue
was resolved recently, on October 12, 2010, by a Decision on the Appointment of the Chairman and
Members of the Republic Commission for the Protection of Rights in Public Procurement Procedures
("Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia", No. 73/10). According to the PPL, the certification of the
Public Procurement Officers should have been completed by September 2009, whereas it is still ongoing.
Further progress also needs to be made towards the update and implementation of the baseline of Strategy
for Upgrading Public Procurement in Serbia and the establishment of a well-functioning e-procurement
system.

66.      TA is provided to support Government's efforts to strengthen the public procurement
system in Serbia. As a part of this support, the EC through its Instruments for Pre-Accession Assistance
(IPA) is currently financing a Twinning Project: Strengthening Public Procurement in Serbia, in the
amount of about EUR 1.5 million. 20 The project provides TA to the PPO in: institutional strengthening
(legal, institutional and methodological strengthening; preparing a strategy and action plan for upgrading
the public procurement system and functioning of the key stakeholders), capacity building and training of
the staff of PPO and RCPR, and MOF and other stakeholders. OSCE, UNDP, USAID, and other donors
are also providing support to institutional strengthening and capacity building, including through seminars
and public discussions relating to public procurement in Serbia.

External Audit

67.      The State Audit Institution (SAI) provided its first complete audit of the 2009 final accounts
of the Republic of Serbia in December 2010. The previous year, only a partial audit had been possible
and no opinion was expressed, so the audit presented in 2010 was a substantial improvement in quality
and transparency from the previous year. In addition to the audit of the final accounts, SAI delivered
audits of seven ministries, one administration, and public finance related elements of the National Bank of
Serbia. Further audits are underway for three more public enterprises.

68.      The prospect of improvement in the capacity of the SAI and the number and quality of
audits was given a boost in May 2010 with the amendment to SAI law allowing for increases in
salaries for SAI auditors. SAI expects that the changes will permit it to attract sufficiently qualified staff
to deliver its work program in the future. SAI has been able to increase the number of senior auditors and
other staff in 2010 and has commenced new audits for bodies not previously subject to audit, for example
public enterprises.

Policy area 2.c. Improving public debt management
20
  The Member State Institution in charge of the project implementation is the Local Government of Denmark,
Kingdom of Denmark.


                                                     21
69.      The Public Debt Administration (PDA) is fully staffed. The PDA was established in
September 2009. It now comprises 23 staff members, including two fulltime consultants financed by
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau Bankengruppe (KfW). The staff is loosely organized into a legal support
unit, a combined front- and back-office function, a middle-office function, a general support team, and a
unit for domestic market development comprised of the two consultants.

70.     A comprehensive debt database that includes all current debt data has been established. All
debt data has been migrated to Trasset (the government debt management system). Historical data,
however, are still recorded on Excel spreadsheets, and some work remains to be done to fully use the
Trasset report generator.

71.      A draft comprehensive medium-term debt management strategy has been approved. The
draft strategy covers both the foreign and domestic debt, and the three main risks of the debt portf olio,
namely the refinancing (rollover) risk, the exchange rate risk, and the interest rate risk. It also provides
guidance for future borrowings, including a plan for extending maturities of RSD denominated securities
in the domestic market. 21

72.      Preparation of a description and a qualitative risk assessment of all outstanding
government guarantees have started. A first assessment of the risks embedded in outstanding
guarantees has been conducted, the main risks being with Railways Serbia and Roads Serbia. Th e
guarantees have been classified according to default risks. Some further work is needed to describe the
risks in more detail. 22

73.     As next steps, a borrowing plan for 2011 will be prepared based on an approved medium-term
debt management strategy. In 2011, the medium-term debt management strategy will be updated to
include a sensitivity analysis of main risks. The annual assessment of the risks embedded in outstanding
guarantees will include both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. The auction syst em used for the
issuance of government securities in the domestic market (T -bills and T-bonds) will be improved.

74.       TA has been provided by the World Bank to strengthen the institutional framework and
improve the debt management strategy. At the request of the Minister of Finance, a note on
Establishment of a Public Debt Administration within the Ministry of Finance was prepared in
September 2008, which covered the functions, internal organization and staff requirements of the
proposed PDA. In September 2009, a note on Borrowing Requirements, Debt Management Strategy, and
Annual Borrowing Plans was prepared that included guidance on the process in developing medium-
term debt management and annual borrowing plans, the content of the strategy, as well as comments on
the first draft of the strategy that had been prepared by the PDA. Also, TA was provided in 2002 and 2003
for drafting of the present Public Debt Law, as well in 2010 for the revision of this Law.

PILLAR III: SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION OF THE MOST VULNERABLE

75.      The need for protecting the poor and vulnerable increased at the time of the economic
crisis. Serbia had more than 400,000 people living below the poverty line in 2008 and this number
increased by 60,000 following the real GDP fall of 2.9 percent in 2009. Higher risks of falling into
poverty remained in 2010 despite the estimated GDP growth of 1.8 percent. 23

21
   According to the Budget System Law, the debt management strategy is included in the Budget Memorandum that
was adopted by the Government on December 29, 2010.
22
   This assessment will form part of the Budget Memorandum as well.
23
   The National Statistical Institute reported increase in the poverty rate to 8.8 percent during the first half of 2 010.


                                                           22
76.     Serbia entered the crisis with a well established social assistance system that operates over
twenty schemes for the poor, for families and children, people with disability and war veterans.
However, most of the programs are categorically targeted 24. Only one ­ MOP ­ is an explicit poverty
reduction program, and a second one ­ the means tested monthly child allowance ­ has dual (anti-poverty
and demographic) objectives. Administrative data indicates that the main social assistance programs (the
MOP, child allowances and caregivers` allowances) are expanding slowly and rather as a long-term trend
than as a specific response to the crisis (as automatic stabilizer`). Most pronounced was the increase in
the spending on MOP ­ by 38 percent in 2010, compared to 22 percent in 2009. The number of MOP
beneficiaries also increased more pronouncedly compared to previous years ­ by close to 20 percent in
2010 compared to 6.5 percent in 2009. At the same time, as of the end of 2009, the Centers for Social
Work (CSW) which administer the MOP benefit observe increase in the number of new applications
which come mostly from families of unemployed, families of employed who are not paid wages regularly
and families with children. The cases of provision of one-time ad hoc financial assistance to families
which are transiently poor but not meeting the eligibility criteria for MOP increase as well . 25

77.      The safety net for a growing number of poor and vulnerable will have to be provided within
a constraint budget envelope. As mentioned, Serbia spends 1.86 percent of GDP on non-contributory
social benefits which is slightly higher than the average spending in ECA of 1.6 percent of GDP. In 2009,
the social assistance transfers were not affected by the fiscal spending cuts necessitated by the crisis. 26
This allowed increasing the means-tested monthly child allowance by 30 percent and the eligibility
threshold for it by 20 percent as of August 1, 2009. The executed budget for MOP was increased by 11
percent compared to the planned budget. The financing gap was covered with state budget reserves, state
crisis mitigation fund allocations and savings from veterans` benefits. In 2010, the budgeted spending on
social assistance was 5.6 percent higher compared to the executed budget in 2009. Higher increase was
envisaged for means-tested benefits: close to 10 percent for the child allowance and 16 percent for the
MOP. The executed budget for the MOP proved to be even bigger ­ by 38 percent. Overall, however, the
spending on poverty targeted social assistance remains at a relatively low level 27. Some room for
increasing the spending on poverty-targeted social transfers exists following (a) curtailing of spending on
war veterans` benefits due to beneficiary attrition, savings as a result of eligibility audits and
establishment of a national electronic registry, and (b) expected containment of spending on wage
compensations during maternity leave 28 following strengthening the linkage of the benefit with the
actually received wage by amending the Law on Financial Support for Families with Children as of
January 1, 2010. 29

78.     The higher demand for social assistance requires medium-term structural reforms to make
the system more cost-effective and accessible by the poor while keeping it accurately targeted. 2010
was the final year for the implementation of the National Social Welfare Strategy 2007-2010 which aims

24
   Serbia spends 1.86 percent of GDP on non-contributory social benefits, out of which 1.44 percent is allocated to
categorical programs and 0.42 percent to all means-tested programs.
25
   Observations communicated by social workers and data collected by the Center for Liberal Democratic Studies,
Gordana Matkovic, 2009.
26
   In May 2009, the Government adopted a supplemental budget envisaging a 27 percent cut of the budgets of all
ministries.
27
   Serbia spends on MOP 0.14 - 0.17 percent of GDP in the second half of the 2000s, while other European countries
spend on similar programs up to 0.5 percent of GDP. The spending on means tested child allowances is also not high
­ around 0.28 ­ 0.3 percent of GDP.
28
   In 2009 the actual spending on wage compensation during maternity leave increased significantly ­ by 22 percent
compared to the planned amount. In 2010, the expected increase in spending compared to 2009 (actual) is only 2.6
percent.
29
   The full impact of this policy change will be observed in 2012.


                                                        23
at improving the efficiency of the safety net and harmonizing it with the EU models through linking the
passive receipt of cash assistance with investment in skills and employability; developing a network of
supporting social care and labor market services and engaging the civil society in their provision;
increasing the flexibility and cost effectiveness of service delivery while reducing b ureaucracy and
paternalism. The strategy identifies as priorities: (i) the correct identification of the poorest citizens and
accurate targeting with social assistance of those members of the society who are unable to earn their
living; (ii) the development of alternative community-based social welfare services; (iii) the development
of professional standards, procedures, protocols and norms for the delivery of services; (iv) raising the
citizens` awareness about different social welfare programs; (v) the decentralization and linking of all
social welfare actors at the local level; (vi) enhancing the support for persons with disabilities; (vii) the
development of specific programs aimed at integration of Roma, refugees and internally displaced
persons (IDPs). The main instrument for achieving the objectives of the National Social Welfare Strategy
is the new Social Welfare Law which was approved by the government in the end of 2010 and is awaiting
approval by the Parliament.

79.      With the Social Welfare Law the Government is planning to implement a reform aiming to
improve certain design parameters of the MOP that will lead to increasing its coverage and
adequacy. Currently, the MOP`s targeting accuracy is quite high: 76.6 percent of the transfer is received
by households belonging to the poorest 20 percent of the population Living Standards Measurement
Survey (LSMS) 2007. The MOP coverage, however, is low and given the limited financing, could hardly
be able to expand proportionately to the increasing demand. At present, the MOP covers only 6.7 percent
of the poorest population quintile and only 40 percent of the extreme poor (LSMS, 2007). 30 Low coverage
is the result of three main factors: (i) program design envisaging rigorous eligibility requirements; (ii)
limited financing; and, (iii) low take up (eligible families do not receive the benefit) due to weak outreach
to the poorest ­ IDPs, migrating people (Roma in particular), are unable to comply because of missing
personal documents and proof of residence and high cost of application.

80.      The adoption of the new Social Welfare Law will contribute to scaling up the MOP and to
delivering more adequate benefits to multi-member households. The Law will introduce equivalence
scales (consistent with what is prevalent in EU and OECD countries), which will result in an increase of
the benefit amount paid to multi-member households/families (of more than 3 members) thus eliminating
the overestimation of the economies of scales from sharing assets and expenditures in o ne household, as
well as the current bias of the MOP towards small units of recipients. It envisages up to 6 members in one
family/household to be eligible to receive the benefit, instead of up to 5 members, as it is now. The MOP
will be scaled up in rural areas by relaxing the eligibility criterion related to land ownership which
currently acts like an exclusionary filter`. The limit of allowable owned land will be lifted from 0.5 ha to
1 ha for MOP applicant families where none of the members is capable to work. Certain vulnerable
groups as families, where all members are not capable to work, and single-parent families with children
will become entitled to higher MOP (by 20 percent). Simulations with 2007 LSMS data indicate that
these parametric changes could lead to increasing MOP coverage by 22 percent in case of full take up,
and a budget increase of up to 35 percent (see also section on Poverty and Social Impacts for details).
Other estimates31 come up with an increase in MOP coverage of up to 40 percent and an increase of
program budget by 60-65 percent from its 2009 level.


30
   The LSMS data on low coverage is also confirmed by the annual HBS. According to the 2009 HBS, the coverage
of the poorest population quintile with MOP was 7.9 percent.

   World Bank staff estimates and estimates made by G. Matkovic and B. Mijatovic. Impact Assessment of the State
Financial Support to the Poor. Deputy Prime Minister`s PRS Implementation Focal Point, Belgrade, 2009. The latter
estimate is of 70 percent budget increase but it factors in also the cost of the institutional framework that needs to be
established for the functioning of social services.


                                                           24
81.     The `improved MOP' will be better positioned for the mitigation of the poverty impacts of
specific reforms which necessitate price liberalization and price increases. The government is
currently considering electricity price reform and trying to identify the population groups which will be
most severely affected. A MOP program with improved coverage and adequacy could be used as the
instrument for alleviating the reform impact - alone or in combination with categorical targeting of other
vulnerable groups which emerge as energy poor`. The targeting should be undertaken by the Centers for
Social Work which are best positioned in terms of human capacity and technology to implement income
and asset tests.

82.      The Government reform program envisages improving the effectiveness and impact of
social assistance by linking the `passive' cash transfers with social care, employment and activation
services, and putting employment integration at the very heart of social policy. One of the main
objectives of the new Social Welfare Law and the related secondary legislation is to provide a
comprehensive regulation of the provision of social care services by non-state providers, to create the
procedures for outsourcing, to develop standards for service quality and establish institutions responsible
for quality assurance. The law also introduces the concept of activation of those who are able to work.
Incentives for overcoming the long-term dependence on social benefits are envisaged in the draft Social
Welfare Act They are expected to counteract the existing disincentives for participating in public works,
training and other activation measures; to encourage the efforts on behalf of the employment services in
helping benefit recipients overcome the obstacles on entering into paid work; and also to encourage
benefit recipients to actively search for paid work and to invest in better employability. These policies
will be supported with active labor market programs targeted to the recipients of non-contributory social
assistance that will be included in the National Employment Action Plan for 2011, and in subsequent
strategies and plans for active labor market programs.

83.     The Government reform effort also envisages strengthening the administrative capacity at
central and local level for social policy making. The MOLSP is enhancing the current registries to
ensure better tracking of the demand for social assistance and its underlying reasons. The registry of
veterans is in place, and is already being used for eligibility audit through screening of the supporting
documents. It is also tasked with the development of an integrated information system which can track the
beneficiaries of cash transfers for various vulnerable groups and can communicate with the health and
education information systems.

            IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A. LINK TO CPS
84.      As described in the CPS and as updated in the CPSPR that was presented to the Board on
November 17, 2009, the total lending envelope for Serbia was increased by US$ 300 million beyond
the original CPS. This additional lending was allocated to development policy lending, which would
help meet Serbia`s medium-term financing needs, and complement support under a coordinated donor
assistance package comprising EU assistance and IMF SBA. The PEDPL program is complemented by a
PFDPL program targeted at facilitating financial and private sector development. In the context of
preparation of the third operation under the PFDPL program, the government requested to avail of an
IBRD PBG rather than a loan. As PBGs are stand-alone operations, the PFDPL program was terminated
and PFDPL3 has been transformed into a stand-alone PBG operation, while the reforms proposed under
the originally planned PFDPL3 formed the basis for the PFSPBG.
B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
85.   The Bank maintains close working contacts with the IMF and other donors assisting the
government for the purposes of harmonizing policy recommendations, seeking synergies among the



                                                    25
respective operations, and avoiding overlaps. Coordinated efforts are in place to provide budgetary
support under the general fiscal framework of the IMF SBA and include the conversion of EC IPA funds.

86.      While the IMF's primary concern is short term balance of payments risks, and the Bank's
is medium term and structural reforms, there is a high degree of coordination between the two
institutions. There has been close collaboration between the Bank and the IMF on key fiscal issues. For
instance, the Bank conducted an extensive dialogue with the authorities on pension reform including a
pension round table in which IMF participated. Similarly, on public sector wages and employment, the
Bank and IMF consulted frequently during the preparation of the SBA and the PEDPL2. It is expected
that this cooperation will be actively continued through the rest of the PEDPL program.

87.     More widely, the Bank has maintained a robust dialogue with the donor community in
Serbia in order to avoid duplication of efforts and leverage support for the government reforms in
the area of public expenditure systems. The Bank hosts and chairs an active donor group comprising
donors engaged in public and financial management reforms. The Bank`s coordination and cooperation
with EU, Serbia`s most important development partner, is deepening since practically all World Bank
assistance is aimed at helping Serbia in the process of convergence with the EU.

88.     Other development partners have specifically been supporting strengthening of PFM in
Serbia. USAID and EU have supported establishment and development of the central Treasury financial
information system and its integration with other key management and reporting systems. The EU
continues to support the refinement and broader integration of Treasury and budget execution systems,
public internal financial control, public debt administration and public investment management reform.
Until 2010 the EU, DFID and UNDP supported improvement of policy development and planning
capabilities. GTZ and USAID have assisted the reform of taxation laws and administration during the last
decade and GIZ continues to support taxation reform. DFID financed the 2010 PEFA review, supported
by other development partners. IMF, with support from the Swiss Government, retains a resident adviser
on PFM in the MOF and a new position of advisor on tax administration is being established. Additional
support is provided to local government on financial management by USAID and other bilateral donors.
PFM is considered a priority area for many donors in Serbia and continues to feature in their plans.

C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
89.      This programmatic DPL series is complemented by a PFDPL series (and the subsequent
PFSPBG). The PEDPL program targets public expenditures while the other, the PFDPLs/PBG focuses on
enhancing the business environment, strengthening financial discipline for non-private enterprise sector
and building a more efficient and stable financial sector. The two series reinforce each other in a number
of important areas. For instance, the PFDPL/PBG benchmarks on financial discipline of socially owned
enterprises should serve to limit quasi fiscal deficits with positive spillovers for public expenditure
management. Similarly, the PEDPL benchmark relating to public debt management will help the
development of private capital markets and, thus, support the objectives of the PFDPL/PBG. In fact, the
teams also used the TA resources for capital markets development to support the public debt management
strengthening process.

90.      The PEDPL program is supported by several complementary World Bank Operations,
including in pensions, health and education. Complementary to the proposed PEDPL series, the
objective of the Delivery of Improved Local Services (DILS) project is to improve access to and the
efficiency, equity and quality of local delivery of health, education and social protection services. Under
both the DILS project and the additional financing to the Serbia health project, the World Bank will
continue to partner with MOH and develop an evaluation plan to monitor and analyze progress made
under reforms with respect to hospital productivity, cost drivers, and insurance solvency and


                                                    26
effectiveness. Under DILS, MES is also working on the design and piloting of the per capita reform in the
education sector, as well as on the school and class optimization efforts of the Government. The same
project supports the improvements in the MES` information system, the Education Information System
(EIS). In addition, two World Bank projects are being prepared to partner with the Government in
payment and management reforms in hospitals and outpatient centers, and to invest in d ata collection and
analysis in HIF and health facilities. TA is provided in the pension area with the aim to support the
Government`s effort to prepare the strategy for reforms of the pension insurance system. To a large
extent, dialogue in this field benefits from the work under the project Consolidated Collection and
Pension Administration Project. TA in the area of public administration reform is also on-going.

D. LESSONS LEARNED

91.     The World Bank has been using Development Policy Lending as the primary tool to assist
the Government of Serbia with the design and implementation of important structural reforms
since 2000.

92.      The Bank's experience with Development Policy Lending in Serbia since 2000 has
highlighted the need for and benefit of maximum flexibility including policy areas to be
supported. 32 Within Serbia`s complex political economy, and against a particularly volatile political
background, past development policy credits have proved effective in supporting the Government to
undertake difficult policy reforms, in part because they served as basis for reaching political consensus
within the Government and allowed for significant flexibility in terms of the timing as well as policy
areas to be supported. In the past, there were two Structural Adjustment Credits (SAC) (mainly focusing
on the public sector reforms), two Private and Financial Sector SACs and one Social Sector SAC. More
recently a new series of two Private and Financial Sector DPLs was completed and the subsequent
PFSPBG was submitted to the World Bank Board (see also the previous section). With the support of
these credits, Serbia has developed medium to long-term reform strategies that guide sector reforms,
revamped its legislative frameworks in many areas, and embarked on the long road of institutio nal
development.

93.      There is a high payoff to have an appropriate focus for a DPL and avoid too wide a
purview. Successful reform implementation is heavily dependent upon an effective champion, and the
presence of such champions can be important in selecting the key focus areas for the Bank`s policy
dialogue. While there can be no guarantees of tenure of political appointments such as ministers, it is
important to have as clear a picture as possible of any potential problems. Moreover, having separate
series for improving public expenditure performance and growth and private sector development issues
appear to have worked well in the Serbian context and have allowed for better management of the reform
agenda, both in terms of Bank assistance as well as implementation by the Republic of Serbia. 33 This
division of labor also lowered the probability of unforeseen problems and lags in implementation which
could have in turn led to delayed disbursements.

94.      A strong analytical basis is needed to design effective operations. Analytical work can play an
important role to crystallize clearly the areas to be supported under development policy lending, ensuring
at the same time a strong Government buy-in at the preparation stage and a strong commitment during
implementation. In the case of the current Operation, set against the background of a quickly evolving
international finance crisis, the Public Expenditure Review (PER) titled Addressing the Fiscal Crisis by

Increasing Public Sector Productivity is informing the dialogue with the Government and other donors,
and anchoring the scope and substance of the proposed DPL.
E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
95.     In recent years, the Bank has undertaken extensive economic and sector work in areas
covered by the proposed Operation. In addition to the work outlined in Table 8, analytical activities
also include a set of round-tables with the Government and local academia on the broad spectrum of
policy issues including pensions, education, transport, etc. as well as other one-off activities including
those on development of the T-bills market; policy notes on various topics; and capacity building for
poverty monitoring within the Government, statistics office and local research centers.

                        problems in the wage setting process.
                    The Government should take a more targeted approach to determining staffing levels,
                        and the methodologies used to identify staff reductions in the education sector provide
                        a model that could be extended to other sectors.

                        improve the system`s sustainability. Over the medium term, the system`s
                        sustainability can be improved by a more comprehensive reform including rising the
                        retirement age for women, and reducing pensions for early retirees.
                    Health: International experience shows that adopting a capitation based payment
                        system in primary care and an output-based system in hospital care can generate
                        substantial savings. But reforms need to be carefully designed to prevent fraud.
                    Education: The efficiency of spending can be improved by consolidating under-
                        enrolled classes.
                    Social assistance: The Government should consider increasing funding for the two
                        poverty-targeted programs that are well designed but small and with inadequate
                        coverage.

                        timeliness of fiscal accounts also need improvement.
                    Introducing a multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and
                        budgeting also remains a challenge and the budget memorandum contains no links
                        between strategies on the one side and actual costing on the other.
                    In public procurement, there is a need to improve enforcement of competitive
                        mechanisms and a clearer justification for the use of less competitive mechanisms.
                        The complaint mechanism is also currently insufficient and needs strengthening.

                   type of social assistance, this represents only a fraction of monthly needs defined by the

   V.       THE PROPOSED SECOND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE DEV ELOPMENT
                            POLICY LOAN (PEDPL2)

A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION
96.     The PEDPL2 is the second of three DPL operations to be executed sequentially. The PEDPL
program will support Government reforms in: (i) public expenditure allocation; (ii) public expenditure
and debt management; and, (iii) social assistance and protection of the most vulnerable. The reform
program, objectives and outcomes are summarized in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2) and the Results Matrix
(Annex 3). The results indicators aim at monitoring and reporting the outcomes of reforms, which in turn
help to gauge progress and fine tune the reform strategy going forward. In several areas, results
indicators are closely related to the reforms supported by the DPL program. However, given the
complexity of the program, there are outcome indicators which reflect the combined effect of several
reforms supported by the PEDPL series and other reforms implemented in the context of the
Government`s broader reform program. In other cases, the proposed series supports the first stage of the
reform and therefore it is too early to measure results. In these cases, such as the health care reform, the
DPL program monitors and reports on indicators of general developments in the sector.

97.      Progress with reforms has proceeded broadly as envisaged. The authorities remain committed
to the overall reform program which is expected to proceed broadly as set out to the Board of Directors on
November 17, 2009. The Government remains committed to decreasing wage and pension spending o ver
the medium term, which is also in line with targets sets under the proposed fiscal responsibility
legislation. In the short term, fiscal savings have come primarily from continued wage and pension level
restraint. Over the medium term, structural reforms of the public administration (consisting primarily of
employees in the health and education sectors) will be critical in reaching the Government`s targeted
fiscal consolidation. While some efficiency gains can be achieved by administrative fiat, the ke y to
fundamental improvements in health and education over the medium term has to be through a change in
the way they are financed. Table 9 summarizes the proposed changes to the PEDPL2 triggers.

B. POLICY AREAS

Pillar I: Public expenditure allocation reforms

98.     The proposed PEDPL2 continues to support an appropriate overall fiscal stance as well as
efforts to improve the efficiency of spending in the largest spending sectors. The level of public
spending in Serbia remains high relative to other countries in the region of similar income levels. The
Government`s reform strategy continues to focus on reducing current spending over the medium term,
while creating room for higher investment spending. Containing the high public wage and pension bill is
absolutely essential to this medium-term strategy and this, in turn, requires efficiency-enhancing reforms,
including in education.

The specific prior actions and triggers are:

Public sector wage bill
 Nominal wage freeze for public employees at all levels of Government until end-2010, and the
   Government decision on a post-freeze wage indexation policy (PEDPL2 prior action).

These measures have controlled the ratio of the wage bill to GDP, which shows a modest decline from
10.8 percent in the baseline year of 2009 to 10.2 percent in 2010 (see Annex 3).

Education
 The new 2009 Education Law creates the legal preconditions for introducing changes in the resource
   allocation mechanisms in the education sector.
 Capitation based financing for primary schools piloted virtually in at least 5 municipalities by the start
   of school year 2012/13 (PEDPL3 trigger).

It is too early to measure outcomes of reforms. However, these actions contributed to the consolidation of
658 classes at the end of the school year 2009/10 (see Annex 3).

Health
 Amended law authorizing productivity-based wages for public service employees enacted (PEDPL3
   trigger).
 The MOH implements productivity-based wages (capitation) for primary health care medical staff
   (PEDPL3 trigger).
 The HIF issues a Directive defining DRGs and payment levels for hospitals (PEDPL3 trigger).


                                                    32
It is too early to measure outcomes. However, three key indicators of health care show resilience despite
the severe impact of the crisis: (i) the immunization of children at age 7 is high at 97.7 percent in 2009,
and showed a slight improvement to 98.0 percent in 2010; (ii) the share of health care and
pharmaceuticals expenditures as per the HBS of the two lowest percentiles improved from 8.1 percent in
2008 to 8.4 in 2010; and, (iii) the consolidated general government health care expenditures per capita
have been relatively stable at 22,612 RSD in 2009 and 23,940 RSD in 2010.

Pensions:
 Enactment of Law to address fundamental problems in the pension system with parametric changes to
   strengthen the public pension system (mandatory, contributions funded pillar of the pension system)
   (PEDPL2 prior action).
 Any additional reforms to the pension system should continue to strengthen its medium and long term
   financial sustainability (PEDPL3 trigger).

These measures are first steps towards strengthening the fiscal sustainability of the pension system which
runs a deficit of 6 percent of GDP and is the second highest ratio of pension spending to GDP in Europe
and Central Asia. The measures supported by the PEDPL2 have contributed to improving Serbia`s
pension spending to GDP from 13.8 percent in 2009 to 13 percent in 2010. It is expected that by the end
of the program this ratio will improve to 12 percent or less thereby approaching gradually to levels that
are affordable and comparable to other countries in the region.

Pillar II: Public expenditure and debt management reforms

99.      The proposed PEDPL2 continues to support public expenditure management reforms to
make spending more strategic and to improve fiscal management with a particular focus on
fiduciary conditions. PEDPL1 supported the passage of a number of critical laws, as well as the
establishment of two important institutions, while the remainder of the program is focusing on
implementation issues.

The specific prior actions and triggers are:

Putting in place a more comprehensive, integrated medium-term planning and budgeting
framework
 PEDPL1 supported the enactment of a new Budget Systems law, expanding coverage and laying out a
    framework for a comprehensive and integrated medium-term planning and budgeting.
 Budget Memorandum includes: (i) All General Government Sector revenue and expenditure; (ii)
    identification of fiscal risks, including contingent liabilities; and, (iii) medium term estimates for three
    years by direct budget beneficiary (PEDPL2 prior action).
 The National Assembly approves an annual budget and estimated revenue and expenditure for the
    following two years (PEDPL3 trigger).

The reform aims at improving budget planning and execution as well as transparency and accountability.
The targeted indicator is PEFA`s indicator 12 which focuses on multiyear perspective in fiscal planning,
expenditure policy and budgeting. The baseline was a PEFA rating of C for indicator 12 since there was
no medium term budget plan in 2008. Although the reform takes time, Serbia is making good progress
and by the end of the program it is expected that the PEFA rating of indicator 12 becomes B or higher by
establishing a medium term budget system to include all line ministries.

Improving public expenditure monitoring and control ­ budget execution, internal control and
internal audit


                                                      33
    PEDPL1 supported the enactment of the new Budget Systems Law, including new provisions
    establishing public internal financial control and internal audit arrangements and the use of
    international standards for public expenditure accounting and reporting purposes.

The PEDPL 2 reforms target improvements in two PEFA indicators on internal audit and controls. The
internal controls for non-salary spending were only partially effective in 2008 so the PEFA rating of
indicator 20 was C, which was upgraded to C+ in the 2010 PEFA. Similarly the internal audit was only
partially effective in 2008 so PEFA rating for indicator 21 was C; it was upgraded to B in the 2010 PEFA.
The internal audit function is expected to improve as internal audit units become operational in all line
ministries by 2012 and as a result PEFA rating of indicator 21 will improve to B or better.

Public procurement
 PEDPL1 supported the enactment of a new public procurement law.
 Public Procurement Office and RCPR functioning in accordance with the new Public Procurement
   Law (PEDPL3 trigger).

The Government of Serbia is taking steps to strengthened implementation of its new law. It has created
the Republic Commission for the Protection of Rights in Public Procurement Procedures and public
procurement officers are certified. The expected outcomes include improving the number of contracts
awarded using competitive procedures which were 76 percent in 2009; and increasing the value of
contracts awarded by competitive procedures which was 61 percent in 2009.

External audit
 PEDPL1 supported the external audit of the 2008 financial statements for the Republic of Serbia has
   been initiated in a scope and manner satisfactory to the Bank.
 Completion and provision to the National Assembly of the external audit o f 2009 final accounts for
   the Republic of Serbia and at least 10 other external audits by SAI or its agents (PEDPL3 trigger).

The PEDPL2 supports reforms aimed at improving the scope, nature and follow-up of the external
auditing. Specifically, there was no external audit of final accounts in 2008 so the rating of PEFA
indicator 26 on external auditing function was D. The reforms supported by the PEDPL series are
expected to improve this rating to C or better as external audit function is strengthened.

Public debt management
 PEDPL1 supported the establishment of the public debt administration.
 PDA is fully staffed and has completed, inter alia, the establishment of a comprehensive debt
   database, the preparation of a comprehensive medium-term debt management strategy, and the
   description and qualitative risk assessment of all outstanding Government guarantees (PEDPL2 prior
   action)
 The PDA is fully functional, and: (a) based on the strategy for 2011, an annual borrowing plan to be
   prepared; (b) the medium-term debt management strategy to be updated by the PDMA, and includes
   sensitivity analyses of the main risks, as well as a yield-curve building plan for the next three years;
   and (c) annual assessment of outstanding guarantees includes a quantification of the risks (PEDPL3
   trigger).

The reform is strengthening the quality of public debt management by preparing a comprehensive debt
database, carrying out annual updates and including a risk assessment based of outstanding guarantees.
The Debt Management Strategy is prepared by the Public Debt Agency which is part of the Ministry of
Finance and makes the debt data and strategy available to the public. By the end of the PEDPL series, the




                                                    34
debt management strategy is expected to include sensitivity analysis of main risks and the risk assessment
of outstanding guarantees is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Pillar III: Strengthening social assistance and protecting the most vulnerable

100.    The proposed PEDPL2 supports the continued strengthening of the social assistance
framework to cushion the impact of the economic crisis and to enhance the coverage of social
assistance schemes going forward. Although Serbia entered the crisis with a well-established social
assistance system, the need for protecting the poor and vulnerable increased at the time of the crisis. The
higher demand for social assistance has required medium-term structural reforms to make the system
more cost-effective and accessible by the poor while keeping it accurately targeted. The new social
welfare law, which aims to increase the coverage and adequacy of the MOP, is critical in this regard
(supported by PEDPL2).

The specific prior actions and triggers are:

     PEDPL1 helped protect social assistance spending in the May 2009 supplementary crisis budget.
     Submission to Parliament of a new Social Welfare Act to improve the access of vulnerable groups to
     last resort cash assistance by applying the equivalence scales in accordance with the prevalent EU and
     OECD practices and adjust the spending on last-resort cash assistance accordingly (PEDPL2 prior
     action).

There are two indicators of expected outcomes: (i) the coverage of the poor of the MOP; and (ii) that the
MOP is higher the larger the size of the families who are poor. According to the HBS of 2008, the MOP
reached 7.9 percent of the poorest quintile. This improved to 8.3 percent in 2010 (preliminary, based on
the first 6 months of HBS) and is expected to increase to at least 10 percent of the poorest quintile in
2011. The MOP of a family of 5 to 6 members was two times larger than the MOP of a single -member
family in 2008. By the end of PEDPL series in 2012, the MOP of families with 5 members is expected to
increase to 2.2 to 3 times that single-member family; and to 2.5 to 3.5 times for families with 6 members.

                           VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
101.     The PEDPL2 comes at a time of heightened concerns about poverty and unemployment in
the country. Estimates of poverty based on the first six months of 2010 show that poverty overshot its
2008 level (the headcount reached 8.8 percent). This increase is higher than initial simulations had
suggested, and is accompanied by growing unemployment (the unemployment rate is now 20 percent for
the 15-64 age group). 34 In addition, concerns are growing for the possible impact of food price hikes.
Some preliminary cross-country analysis for ECA countries suggest that these impacts might be higher
than average. Against this background, some of the measures supported by PEDPL2 help expand the
reach of the last resort social assistance and support the livelihoods of some of the most vulnerable
groups. Some of the measures to improve the efficiency of public spending, such as the wage freeze, are
likely to have had a negative if small impact on some groups, but these impacts were partly cushioned by
other elements of the policy package. This also applies to other measures implemented by Government,
such as the pension freeze which is likely to have had limited negative impact (it was partly offset by
lump sum payments to low income pensioners). The process of school rationalization is unlikely to have a
negative impact on access, though it might be opposed locally by some communities.

34
  A more detailed update in these trends is provided by World Bank (2011) Western Balkans Programmatic
Poverty Update: Poverty Update for the Republic of Serbia.


                                                    35
102.     The wage freeze in the public sector through December 2010 is expected to result in an
additional 0.2 percentage points increase in the poverty headcount.35 Simulations based on HBS 2009
data suggest that the effect of the freeze 36 in 2010 was partly cushioned (by 0.1 percentage points) by a
lump sum transfer of 5,000 RSD to public sector workers earning less than 50,000 RSD. The two percent
wage increase in 2011 will help limit the effects of the growing inflation forecasted for 2011, so that the
headcount is expected to rise only by an additional 0.6 percent. This increase in poverty is going to be
marked more in rural areas. In households with at least one employee in the public sector the simulations
predict the poverty headcount to increase from 3 percent in 2009 to 5.7 percent in 2011, although poverty
incidence in these households would still remain below average.

103.    The social assistance reforms supported by this operation are expected to lower poverty, as
they protect and increase access to means-tested programs. At present, means-tested programs are
small relative to other programs (0.4 percent of GDP). The largest of them, the MOP, reaches only a
fraction of the poor (only 6.7 percent of the poorest population quintile, and only 40 percent of the
extreme poor according to the LSMS 2007) and provides the equivalent of 30 percent of consumption of
those in the bottom quintile. The proposed reforms will enhance the adequacy of the MOP and its
coverage of households with three or more family members (that is, mainly families with children)
through a more favorable equivalence scale, including raising the limit for MOP recipients from five to
six per family. Despite these efforts, how much poverty reduction will take place due to these reforms
depends on the success of the outreach effort, elimination of administrative barriers, and size of benefit
increase.

104.     According to the new simulations, the implementation of the Law would result in a 3.5
percent increase in the disposable income of those in the lowest income decile and, in particular,
would decrease by 3.4 percent of the number of households with income levels below what now
identifies the bottom 5 percent of the population 37. The newly designed SRMOD program allows a
sophisticated evaluation of the effects of the draft law on social protection, taking into account behavioral
responses to the changes introduced in the legislation. The program which is based on EUROMOD, a tax-
benefit micro-simulation model for countries in the EU, allows estimation of the effects of taxes and
benefits on household incomes and work incentives for the population. The first Serbian version,
calibrated using the LSMS 2007 data by the Foundation for the Advancement of Economics based in
Belgrade University, has just become operational and allows for a more sophisticated (but consistent)
modeling of the effects of the draft Law than what had been possible before. According to the findings,
the changes envisaged in the draft Law on Social Welfare and in the secondary legislation could lead to
an increase in the theoretical MOP coverage by 22 percent (i.e., by approximately 11,828 households). 38
The model also predicts that total fiscal expenditures on the MOP will increase by 35 percent. While the
distribution of benefits reaching those in the bottom decile of the income distribution declines marginally,
the number of beneficiary households in that group rises by 18 percent. Overall, this increase would imply
that 21 percent of the households in the bottom ten percent of the population would be covered by the


35
   This is in addition to the 0.4 percentage points increase in 2009.
36
   Note that in the data, we cannot distinguish civil servants from other members of the public sector.
37
   By construction, SRMOD relies on income data and it is not possible to apply to it a standard national poverty line
which would be consumption based. Note that in 2007, the LSMS data used to run SRMOD estimated that poverty
was 6.6 percent. Using 10 percent of the current income distribution absolute poverty line, the impact of the
measures considered by the new law would be more muted (a decrease in the number of poor households by 8
percent) which suggests that the new Law is very effective in identifying individuals at the very bottom of the
income distribution.
38
   The model cannot account for effective take-up ­ as mentioned above, efforts to remove administrative barriers
and the outreach effort will be critical in this respect.


                                                         36
MOP (from 18 percent right now). Beneficiaries in this group would also experience an 11 percent
increase in benefits. 39

105.      Results from these simulations also highlight how the provisions included in the new Law
on Social Protection and draft secondary regulation will be particularly effective at targeting some
of the most vulnerable households. The group of households which appear to be most affected by the
changes is households with 3 or more children, whose members are most likely to be in the bottom decile
of the distribution. Analysis with SRMOD also shows that further relaxing (without abolishing) key
eligibility criteria for MOP eligibility would almost also negligible effects on the number of
beneficiaries. 40

106.    Simulations based on the 2009 HBS suggest that the effects of prolonging the pension freeze
­ introduced by the Government 2 years ago as a benchmark for the previous DPL 41 ­ through
2010 may have added 0.6 percentage points to the poverty incidence between 2009 and 2011 ,42 with
significant heterogeneity across groups. The impact on poverty is more marked in rural areas. 43

107.     To address concerns raised by the protracted pension freeze, in depth qualitative work was
conducted in March 2010, focusing on poor and vulnerable pensioners. This work (18 focus groups
from all regions of Serbia) was designed to focus on the poorest of the pensioners ­ a group which is hard
to isolate in regular household surveys, given the limited number of observations in this category. Women
on survivor`s pensions, receiving 70 percent of their husband`s pensions, appeared to be the group most
likely to be vulnerable if their husbands were at the low end of the pension spectrum. The analysis
confirmed the strain in which poor pensioners are living due to a combination of factors, of which the
pension freeze was only one. Adverse price developments in the farming sector (lower farm gate prices
and higher retail prices) and high utility prices were quoted among other unfavorable developments.
Focus groups highlighted the problems of cutting consumption further, particularly when high shares of
resources are devoted to health expenditure or utility bills (mostly electricity). This was mentioned
forcefully by poor urban pensioners, whose coping strategies predominantly included cutting food
consumption in terms of quality of calories and sometimes also quantities. The need to care for
dependents, who lost jobs, cuts in the private transfers from other close family members and the barriers,
often due to declining health, to conduct activities to supplement pension incomes, also emerged. Some
positive developments over the last 12 months were also noted, such as the greater reliability of pension
payments, and the introduction of a list of subsidized medicines for low income citizens, though they
were not seen as sufficient to reverse broader negative trends. An important element that emerged from
the study was the limited number of programs and benefits to which the poorest pensioners have access.
Special assistance is available on a city level basis (e.g., 4,000 RSD a quarter integrative income
distributed by the city of Belgrade and free public transport), while pension receipt typically puts
pensioners above the threshold for social protection.

108.   Against this background, the lump sum payment to all pensioners receiving less than RSD
30,000 which was distributed in October appears to have contained the poverty impact of the

39
   The size of the increase for recipients in higher income groups would be 15 percent.
40
   The most significant of these changes would be to increase further (to 7) the number of household members who
can receive MOP, which would result in a 0.7 percent increase in the number of beneficiaries.
41
   Note that as such this action is not a prior action for the current operation.
42
   Assuming the full translation of the income shock into a consumption shock, an assumption which appears closer
to reality as the crisis becomes more protracted and the asset base of the most vulnerable is eroded.
43
   Households composed only by individuals of 65 and over would experience an increase in the poverty rate from
8.5 in 2009 to 10.6 percent in 2010; the elderly living alone would see their poverty increase from 6. 6 to 7.5 and
households with at least one pensioner from 5.7 to 6.7 over that same period.


                                                        37
pension freeze, particularly in rural areas. It is estimated that, as a result of these payments, poverty
would have risen only by 0.2 percentage points nationally and in rural and urban areas. 44

109.     Further support to poor pensioners, particularly in rural areas, is offered by the provision
of the new Pension Law supported by this operation which raised the minimum pension. According
to the administrative data, 95 percent of rural pensioners, who receive lower benefits than retired
employees and self-employed, 45 were receiving pensions equal to or below the minimum level in 2009. 46
Farmers` minimum benefits were equivalent to 105 percent of the poverty line at the end of 2009, and a
freeze in 2010 would have eroded their purchasing power to just about the value of the poverty line. The
raise in the minimum pension to 9,000 RSD in January 2011 raises its value to 106 percent of the poverty
line. According to the administrative data, non-agricultural employees received a minimum pension level
at the end of 2009 of RSD 11,088, equivalent to 138 percent of the poverty line, and a total of 14 percent
of recipients had pensions equal to, or below, the minimum level. The purchasing power of the non-
agricultural pension would have eroded to 130 percent of the poverty line by the end of 2010. Under the
new law, the value of the non-agricultural minimum pension has been increased to 11,448 RSD starting
from January 2011, which is equivalent to 137 percent of the poverty line. 47 The data collected on
participants to these focus groups offer the possibility of further monitoring their wellbeing over time,
possibly in conjunction with further quantitative data.

110.      Among other measures undertaken by the Government to rationalize public expenditures,
the grading exercise, currently on hold, is unlikely to have a negative welfare impact on existing
workers as they would be grandfathered. The Government is, however, working on other measures
which would contribute to rationalization of the public expenditure. The planned enforcement in large
schools of a minimum class size of 25 in grades 1 and 5 (such as at the beginning of two sub-cycles of
primary) ­ which is a benchmark for the current operation ­ could lead to a reduction of classes by 5
percent. Experience with rationalization of class sizes to date seems to have resulted in changes in the
number of teachers with full teaching loads with very limited labor shedding. As of now, it seems
unlikely that major poverty impacts are going to arise from this measure. 48 According to 2008 data,
secondary school teachers had average salaries of about RSD 400,000 per year, with primary school
teachers having salaries that are 7 percent lower (or RSD 372,000). These salaries are more than four
times 49 the 2008 poverty line. 50 A 50 percent salary reduction (such as, for instance, due to a 50 percent
decrease in the teaching load) would lower the salaries for those teachers who are subject to such
reductions to 225 percent of the poverty line for secondary school teachers and to 209 percent of the
poverty line for primary school teachers. While changes in teachers load have been the main form of
adjustment, the Ministry is also relying on natural attrition and two voluntary separation programs which



44
   Among households with at least 1 pensioner the increase is 0.35 percentage points.
45
   According to LSMS 2007 data average old-age pensions from the Fund for Farmers were 1/3 rd of the average old-
age pensions from the Fund for Employees or the Fund for Self-employed.
46
   Receiving less than the minimum pension amount in both rural and urban areas is due to either receiving a
survivor pension, or of having worked only part of the working life in Serbia.
47
   In the law the minimum pension is set with respect to the average wage. The law stipulates that from January 1 st
the minimum pension was increased so that its value as a share of average wage rose by 1 percentage point to 33.53
percent of the average wage. The law also guarantees that this share will not drop below 27 percent over the next 5
years.
48
   Given that the HBS data identify only workers in the educational sector in any capacity and for any education
level, it is not possible to simulate poverty impacts in the data without further information or somewhat heroic
assumptions.
49
   450 percent and 419 percent, respectively.
50
   The national poverty line in 2008 was RSD 88,812 per year per adult equivalent.


                                                        38
offer monetary compensation. 51 Lay-offs and severance packages will be considered only when these
other methods of down-sizing the number of teachers have been exhausted. Finally, the government has a
number of Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs) in place including education and training, employment
subsidies and public works. We are currently working with the National Employment Service and the
Statistical Office on an impact evaluation of the effectiveness of the Government`s employment subsidy
program.

111.     The process of school rationalization is unlikely to have a negative impact on access. From
the perspective of service users, the negative effects on access to education are likely to be limited, as
reductions in teaching personnel will mostly take place as part of the class consolidation process within
schools. School closures and relocation of students across schools are likely to occur mostly for satellite
schools in urban and rural areas, with students transferred to other local satellite or local central schools
located within a 2-km radius. While access would be guaranteed by the local governments responsible for
transporting children to the local central school, residents in villages far away from the central schools are
likely to oppose these closures which are being considered on a case by case basis as the standards do not
set a minimum class size for schools with only one class in a given grade.

B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
112.     As noted in the PEDPL1 Program Document, the specific country policies supported by this
DPL program and this operation are not likely to have significant impact on Serbia's environment
and natural resources. The measures contemplated under the Loan are primarily geared towards
supporting the increased efficiency and sustainability of public expenditures. This will cover public
expenditure management reforms, public expenditure allocation, and social protection. None of the
sectors included in the Operation are expected to have any direct significant links to the environment.
There might be indirect positive impact on environment due to reforms in the social protection if the
targeting and allocation for the social assistance leads to improvements that might prevent the poor and
most vulnerable for the use of trees for heating during the winters. 52 Increased transparency and access to
information, supported by Pillar II of the proposed Operation, could also have a positive environmental
impact.

C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
113.    The MOF will be responsible for overall implementation of the proposed operation and for
reporting the process and coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. The
Bank will monitor actions and review progress of the implementation of the proposed operation, as well
as the subsequent actions of the Government`s program by using the overall program outcomes outlined
in the Policy Matrix. Close Bank supervision will also help ensure synergies with other donors.

D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
114.   This fiduciary information section and the set of fiduciary measures included below for the
Operation are based on the findings and recommendations of the 2007 PFMA. It takes into account


51
   Employees on the payroll of the Ministry of Education who opt to vacate their posts as part of the class
optimization exercise are offered a severance package equivalent to 200 Euro for every year of employment, or, for
those who fulfill retirement conditions in terms of years of service, a severance payment of six gross average
salaries, according to the institution they work in, or six gross average salaries in Serbia (as defined by the Statistical
Office) Eric, Milos. 2010. Rationalization and Optimization Initiatives for the Education Sector in Serbia: Analysis
and Fiscal Implications. Background paper prepared for the World Bank.

more recent assessments by the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department in December 2008 and IMF Staff Reports
published in since then and the PEFA review completed at the end of 2010. It also reflects consideration
of OECD SIGMA assessments of public expenditure management and public internal financial control.
Disbursement and auditing arrangements have been determined based on the prevailing fiduciary
environment, standard procedures for DPL disbursements and experience with PEDPL1 in Serbia.

115.     PFM system: 2007 PFMA concluded that despite the improved public disclosure of basic fiscal
and budget execution data, the lack of transparency and operating checks and balances in public finance
still appeared to be an overarching problem in Serbia. This is reflected in the relative poor performance on
several PFM performance indicators.

116.    Significant steps have been taken towards strengthening PFM, such as the modernization of the
central Treasury system, the establishment of arrangements for internal audit across central Go vernment,
the establishment of the SAI in September 2007 and the adoption of the new Budget System Law in July
2009. While these efforts are encouraging, IMF concluded in its December 2008 report that much
remained to be done to strengthen transparency and accountability in PFM in Serbia. 2010 PEFA review
showed that there has been an improvement in financial management performance across most
dimensions, particularly in the area of accounting, recording and reporting.

117.     In its report on Fiscal Responsibility Legislation in January 2010, IMF identified several key
areas where further improvements in the PFM framework would be beneficial, including strengthening
procedures for budget preparation and approval, improving capacity for macroeconomic forecasting,
integrating capital spending into the budget process, and strengthening fiscal transparency and reporting.

118.    The independent assessments of PFM performance suggest that the fiduciary risks
associated with the PFM system in Serbia are high. IMF concluded that important areas of budget
coverage, preparation and execution, accounting and fiscal reporting, internal controls, external audit and
debt and cash management require improvement, although several key areas of the PFM system work
well. The beginnings of independent audit through SAI are encouraging, building on the partial audit in
2009 and demonstrate a consistent strengthening of external scrutiny and assurance on financial
management in Serbia. The government response to the audit reports shows recognition of the importance
of good financial management.

119.     Mitigating fiduciary risks requires strong and sustained commitment towards tr ansparency
and accountability in budget management which is incorporated as part of the Bank's DPL
program combined with PFM reform initiatives from other development organizations. The
Government has taken steps to strengthen budget execution and reporting arrangements and is developing
improved arrangements for PIFC and audit as part of its pre-accession program. The EC is providing
significant support to strengthen financial management systems and internal audit and control
arrangements amongst other PFM reform initiatives. This assistance has resulted in considerable
improvement in the quality and timeliness of financial information and provided the foundation for
effective internal and external control.

120.    The corrective actions taken by NBS to safeguard funds in the foreign exchange account are
deemed adequate. An updated IMF Safeguards Assessment, conducted in March 2009, found that the
NBS safeguards framework had been considerably strengthened and the quality of financial statements
and internal audit had improved markedly since the initial assessment in 2001. Key recommendations
include strengthening external oversight of NBS operations and amending the NBS law to increase
operational and financial independence.




                                                    40
121.    The Operation has a major focus on further actions required to attain acceptable fiduciary
arrangements through implementation of the new provisions established in the revised Budget
Systems Law in key areas of comprehensiveness, transparency, planning and budgeting, debt
management, fiscal and budget reporting, and internal audit and control. The benchmarks also
include achievement of progress on external auditing of the Government`s financial statements.

E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
122.     Borrower and Loan Amount: The Borrower is the Republic of Serbia. This Operation is a
single-tranche loan. The loan proceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon the effectiveness of
the Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of Serbia.

123.     Disbursement: The proposed loan will follow the Bank`s disbursement procedures for
development policy loans. Upon approval of the loan and notification by the Bank of the effectiveness of
the Loan Agreement between the Bank and Republic of Serbia, the Borrower will submit a withdrawal
application to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The IBRD will
deposit the proceeds of the loan into a foreign currency deposit account that forms part of the country`s
official foreign exchange reserves, designated by the Borrower, to be held at the NBS. This account will
be managed by and subject to control of the MOF. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit of the
Loan into said account, that it is available to finance budgeted expenditures and the management of public
debt, and is accounted for in the country`s financial management system. The Closing Date is December
31, 2011.

124.     Disbursement arrangements reflect the appropriateness and adequacy of the procedures applied in
PEDPL1 in Serbia. The MOF will provide IBRD with a confirmation of the receipt of the loan proceeds.
This confirmation letter is required within 30 days of receipt of the amount. No additional fiduciary
safeguard measures are required as the disbursement arrangements are confined to the NBS and Single
Treasury Account, which are among the stronger elements of the fiduciary arrangements. Moreover, the
DPL program for Serbia, combined with active PFM engagement with other development organizations,
will strengthen quality and transparency of the fiduciary framework.

F. CONSULTATIONS
125.    The Government's reform program underpinning the PEDPL2 has benefitted from
consultations with relevant stakeholders (as required by OP 8.60). As discussed in the Program
Document for PEDPL1, the Rulebook of Government of Serbia 53 envisages that all legislative changes
which significantly affect existing system and ways of operations (as assessed by the relevant Council of
the Serbian Parliament) need to go through public consultations. Only following the public discussion
and/or further inter-ministerial harmonization process, the proposed drafts become official proposals
which are then submitted for the Parliament`s consideration. Furthermore, the practice has been that all
new laws are, in fact, subject to public hearings where relevant stakeholders, including private sector
representatives and NGOs, are able to provide their comments to offered solutions. This is also the case
with legislative reforms supported by this series of DPLs, such as Public Procurement, Budget System,
Pension and Social Protection laws.

126.   With respect to more specific impact analysis, the Government has fiscal impact analysis,
regulatory impact analysis and environmental impact analysis. Fiscal impact analysis is done for
each new piece of legislation by MOF. It is important to stress that this is still in the early phase of
development though it is a major improvement in full costing of some reforms. Regulatory impact

assessment is done by the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development (MOERD) to check the
impact of any new legislation on the business environment. Finally, for regulations that explicitly or
implicitly deal with environmental issues, several checks will be in place. First, the Regulatory Review
Unit will check all such regulations and screen them for potential impact on the environment. Second ly,
the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MOEP) will review all proposals and decide if they are
acceptable. Finally, all proposals will have to comply with recently passed package of environmental
laws.

127.     Consultations and discussions of the Bank's analytical work have played a catalytic role in
designing policy options and mobilizing stakeholders. For instance, the findings of the 2009 PER,
serving as the analytical underpinning for many of the reforms in the proposed Operation, have been
discussed by the Government and the Bank with a wide range of stakeholders in the country (including
the Parliament), and have been the subject of extensive press coverage.

G. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
128.     The proposed DPL program has substantial risks. Serbia went into the financial crisis with a
high CAD, aggravated by rapid foreign currency credit growth and large cross-border borrowing of
domestic enterprises. An ongoing IMF program hinges on ambitious fiscal adjustment targets and
requires very significant external financial support and private sector debt rollover. Specific economic
risks include:

        The global economic outlook, while improved, remains uncertain. Furthermore, potential fallout
        from weaknesses and risks in euro-zone economies could have a significant impact on Serbia.
        Greece, in particular, has been the second largest investor in Serbia since the beginning of the
        transition. Economic risks are somewhat mitigated by the multilateral support package including
        from the IMF enhanced SBA of EUR 3 billion, developed in close cooperation with the proposed
        DPL.

        Despite the external adjustment, Serbia faces considerable balance of payments financing needs
        over the next few years. Risks are somewhat mitigated by Serbia`s pursuit of a robust agenda of
        policy reforms and, as above, also by the size of the multilateral support package.

        Potential vulnerabilities of the banking sector remain in the context of substantially reduced
        profitability and stable but high NPLs. Key mitigating factor is the very high capitalization and
        liquidity of the system. As of September 2010, the aggregate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was
        20.1 percent and the banking system`s liquid assets covered 40 percent of short term liabilities.
        While the sector has enough cushions to withstand the current rate of NPLs, which has stabilized
        at around 17.8 percent in recent months, an increase could pose a risk to the solvency of the
        system.

129.     Implementation risks are significant. The current capacity of some public sector institutions to
implement an ambitious reform agenda, while much improved over the past few years, remains relatively
weak. Relatively weak institutional capacity, including for fiduciary management raises concerns on
internal controls. Improving the public expenditure management system is an important component of the
operation, but institutional change comes slowly. Other potential risks relate to specific actions of the
reform program including delays in the implementation process of the overall program. The execution
risks will be mitigated through utilization of continued TA facilities and active coordination of bi-lateral
donor funded TA.




                                                    42
130.     Political risks are high. Although the past two years featured a period of political stability,
social tension and discontent have increased lately as living standards have dropped owing to the crisis
and required austerity measures (including the freeze on public sector wages and salaries) to stabilize the
economy. This, combined with Parliamentary elections scheduled for early 2012, could lead to a
slowdown in reforms, in particular during the pre-election period. However, all major political parties,
whether part of the current coalition for government or in the opposition, share the same commitment to
continue the European integration process.

     included as a prior action. Unbolded actions are not linked to disbursement.

                    SRMOD micro-simulation of the Draft Law on Social Welfare

         SRMOD is a tax-benefit micro-simulation model, constructed along the lines of the EUROMOD
model developed and maintained by the University of Essex for EU member countries. This type of
models enable researchers and policy analysts to calculate the effects of taxes and benefits on household
incomes and on work incentives for the population of a country, and to evaluate the effects of tax-benefit
policy reforms and other changes on poverty, inequality, incentives and government budgets. Tax-benefit
micro-simulation models are based on micro-data for a representative sample of households within a
population. These models calculate disposable income for each individual household which is
incorporated into the model. Such calculations are made possible by combining information on levels and
sources of income from specific data collection efforts (e.g. Living Standards Measurement Survey), with
rules and regulations set up within the micro-simulation model (e.g. eligibility criteria for social
assistance).
         SRMOD has been developed in October 2009 by the Foundation for the Advancement of
Economics (FREN), a research institute located at the Faculty of Economics of the University of
Belgrade, in collaboration with the University of Essex. This initiative came as a response to the growing
need for ex ante public policy analysis in Serbia in the wake of the global economic crisis.
         The SRMOD simulations commissioned as part of the background work for the preparation of
this project rely on LSMS 2007 data, the most reliable data source available that contained micro data on
both income and social programmes. Given that the set of modelled tax and benefit rules also refer to
2007, no updating or re-weighting of the data was necessary.
         The following list of tax and benefit policies were simulated in SRMOD while taking into
account their interactions and the constraints that resulted from data availability:
      Personal Income Tax ­ on employment income, self-employment income, rental income, interest,
         dividend and lottery winnings
      Social Security Contributions (SSC) ­ on employment income for full time and part time
         employment (on behalf of employer and employee), self-employment income, on income from
         agriculture, on unemployment benefit and maternity and child care salary compensation. All
         options (including lower and upper threshold for the base for calculation of social security
         contributions are included, so various scenarios related to reform of these rules may be simulated)
      Unemployment benefit
      Social Assistance (MOP)
      Birth grant
      Child Allowance
      Caregivers allowance
      One-off Social Assistance
      Veterans benefits
      Pensions: old age, disability, survivors

         For the purpose of simulating the effects of changes to the Law on Social Welfare only personal
taxes, SSC and social assistance (MOP) were simulated, while retaining original values for other benefits
listed above, since the validation of their simulated values is still in progress. Since all proposed changes
to the MOP design could be simulated, the simulations are able to assess the poverty and distributional
impacts of these changes.
             SRMOD was validated through a two-stage process. The first stage consisted of a micro-
             validation (or case-by-case validation), where the amounts of taxes and benefits
             computed by the model were checked individually for a selection of households. The



                                                     62
             second stage, macro-validation (or aggregate validation) consisted of producing aggregate
             SRMOD results and summary statistics using the whole sample of the underlying database
             and comparing them with comparable figures from other sources.
             Main simulation results
        The new Law on Social Welfare introduces a number of changes into the eligibility criteria for
MOP, a parametric change to the equivalence scale with the purpose to make the MOP more equitable
and a link to the passive` cash support to social care and employment services for the p oor and
vulnerable. As a result the Government expects to increase budget expenditures on social assistance by
some 70% (albeit starting from a low base).
    The following changes to MOP rules in the Law on Social Welfare were simulated in SRMOD:
    - introduction of the new equivalence scale (modified OECD);
    - increase in the maximum number of eligible household members from 5 to 6;
    - increased MOP payments for single parent households with one or two underage children;
    - increased MOP payments for households in which all members are incapable to work;
    -    ceilings on land ownership for those households in which all members are incapable to work
        raised from 50 to 100 acres;
    - extending the category of incapable to work by increasing the age limit for those in education
        from 19 to 26 and including those on maternity leave.

        The simulations suggest that the envisaged changes in the Law on Social Welfare lead to an
increase in theoretical MOP coverage by 22.1 percent (i.e. by approximately 12,000 households). 56 Total
fiscal expenditures on MOP increase by 34.6 percent, i.e. by around 0.05 percent of GDP, which is
equivalent to an increase in the total consolidated government expenditures by 0.1 percent. 57

       Of the total number of eligible HHs according to old MOP eligibility criteria (53,444 HHs),
43,468 belong to the first income decile, while 9,976 HHs belong to other deciles. The introduction of
new MOP rules leads to an increase of 8,021 recipients HHs in the first decile, and 3,807 new eligible
HHs in deciles 2-10.

   Number of eligible HHs refers to the number of households who fulfill all eligibility criteria in the simulation,
regardless of whether they take up the benefit or not, rather than the LSMS estimate of MOP recipients.
57
   The LSMS database does not provide information on people living in shanty towns (mostly Roma), as the sample
is based on Census data, so these estimates represent a lower bound of the total population in Serbia eligible for
MOP.

          Out of the total of 241,477 HHs in the first income decile, 18 percent fulfil all MOP eligibility
criteria according to the old Law, and the coverage rate increases to 21.3 percent under new eligibility
criteria.

              Note: Decile cut-offs are based on pre-MOP disposable household income per

         The new Law on Social Welfare also increases the average amount of MOP assigned to eligible
HHs. The simulations suggest an increase of 10.6 percent per adult equivalent for the first income decile,
albeit from a low baseline.

IMF Completes Sixth Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with
Serbia and Approves (;373 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 10/513
December 22, 2010
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the
sixth review of Serbia's economic performance under the program supported by a
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The completion of the review enables the immediate
disbursement of SDR 319.595 million (about (373 million, or US$489 million).
Drawing the full amount would bring total disbursements under the SBA to SDR
1.59 billion (about (1.9 billion, or US$2.4 billion) .
Serbia's initial 15-month SBA was approved on January 16, 2009, in the amount of
SDR 350 .8 million (about (409 .5 million, or US$536 .9 million) . On May 15, 2009,
the arrangement was extended by one year and augmented to SDR 2.6 billion
(about (3 billion, or US$4 billion) to support the government's economic program
amid a sharper than expected impact from the global financial crisis (see Press
Release No. 09/169).
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Serbia, Mr. John Lipsky, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
"The Serbian authorities' implementation of the IMF-supported program has been
broadly satisfactory, and an export-led recovery has gained momentum. Continued
vigilance will be critical as macroeconomic stability risks have increased, including
from a surge in inflation, continued high trade deficits, and potential adverse
spillovers from regional developments.
"The authorities have appropriately tightened monetary policy in line with the
inflation-targeting framework . With inflation risks remaining tilted on the upside,
the authorities should continue to use all tools available to contain inflation
expectations and bring inflation back within the National Bank of Serbia's tolerance
band.
"Fiscal policy has remained in line with the program, and the 2011 budget targets a
deficit consistent with the new fiscal responsibility framework. Determined efforts
will be needed to achieve the 2011 fiscal targets, in view of growing pressures for
higher spending. It will be important to pursue structural fiscal reforms. The
current pension reform is a step in the right direction. Further reforms will be
needed in future to ensure the sustainability of the pension system .
"Banking sector reforms have been commendable, and Serbia's banking system is
well buffered to absorb the deterioration in corporate balance sheets. Continued
vigilance is needed given elevated external risks. Swift adoption of the legal
framework for the out-of-court debt restructuring mechanism will be important.
"Accelerating structural reform will be critical to rebalancing the Serbian economy
toward the tradable sector. In particular, efforts in deregulation and the
restructuring of public utilities should be stepped up".
