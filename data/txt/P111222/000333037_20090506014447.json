Government of Bhutan (RGoB)\n            has made significant progress in implementing its\n            medium-term program of institutional and policy reforms\n            anchored in its Ninth Five Year Plan (9FYP).The World Bank\n            has supported the RGoB's development efforts through\n            two budgetary operations. The First Development Policy Grant\n            (DPG1) provided US$15 million in budget support in FY06 to\n            help the RGoB meet selected development goals, and\n            contributed to deepening the policy dialogue. Based on\n            continued good progress on the medium-term reform program, a\n            Second Development Policy Grant (DPG2) for US$12 million was\n            approved in May 2007, and was linked to strengthening the\n            reform program and quickening the pace of implementation.\n            Both operations have closed, and have satisfactorily\n            achieved their development objectives. Section two of this\n            paper summarizes the recent economic, social, and political\n            developments in Bhutan. Section three describes the key\n            elements of the RGoB's overarching reform agenda and\n            its distinctive development vision, anchored in the tenth\n            five year plan, which are highlighted in its own program in\n            a medium-term framework. Section four discusses the\n            Bank's engagement in Bhutan. Section five presents the\n            specific components of Bhutan's policy and\n            institutional reforms that constitute critical actions for\n            the Development Policy Financing for Institutional\n            Strengthening (DPFIS). Section six outlines implementation arrangements."}, "docdt": "2009-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
