provinces and\n            Chongqing Municipality.  The Mid-Yangtze Agricultural\n            Development Project's objectives are to increase\n            production, productivity and marketability of fruit in low\n            income areas and thus increase income and alleviate poverty.\n            This will be achieved by structuring production to satisfy\n            domestic and export demand for quality, variety and\n            seasonality, and by stimulating the development of effective\n            marketing institutions.  The project will : 1) develop\n            11,986 ha of new orchards on presently uncultivated hilly\n            slopes and rehabilitate 2,473 ha of existing ones; 2)\n            increase the provincial Agriculture Bureaus' abilities\n            to identify, propagate and distribute healthy, disease-free\n            planting material to institutionalize virus indexing and\n            budwood registration programs; 3) provide technical\n            assistance for research and extension and training for\n            managerial and technical staff in all aspects of fruit\n            development and marketing; and 4) establish new and\n            strengthen existing commercially independent Fruit\n            Development Corporations including three new joint stock\n            companies to market quality fruit in local, distant and\n            export markets by introducing modern post-harvest\n            techniques, packing and storage facilities."}, "docdt": "1990-07-17T00:00:00Z"}
