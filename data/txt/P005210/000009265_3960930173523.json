managing\n            reconstruction; (b) to assist in the development of\n            long-term measures for seismic risk prevention and\n            mitigation; (c) to improve seismic design standards in the\n            reconstruction of housing; and (d) to ensure greater\n            efficiency and economy through international procurement.\n            The project consists of the following components: (a)\n            equipment and construction materials for housing\n            construction and repair; (b) agricultural construction\n            equipment and machinery (mainly pumps, tractors and tillers)\n            and materials for repair and improvement of irrigation and\n            drainage infrastructure and land levelling; and (c)\n            equipment and technical assistance for implementing the\n            Seismic Risk Prevention and Mitigation Program, including\n            seismic zoning, research and updating of building codes."}, "docdt":
