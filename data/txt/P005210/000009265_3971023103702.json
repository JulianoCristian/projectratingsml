The objectives of the proposed\n            project were to promote economic recovery through: a)\n            assisting Iran in setting up an effective organizational\n            framework for managing construction; b) assisting the\n            Iranian scientific community in the development of long-term\n            measures for seismic risk prevention and mitigation; c)\n            ensuring greater efficiency and economy through\n            international procurement; d) improving seismic design\n            standards in the reconstruction of housing; e) providing\n            Iran with a portion of the required foreign exchange to\n            finance its Earthquake Emergency Reconstruction Program\n            (EERP). The Bank's performance during this phase was\n            highly satisfactory. The Borrower's performance on the\n            whole was satisfactory. The key lessons learned from the\n            project were as follows : (i) concerning procurement,\n            although several procurement and disbursement seminars were\n            organized at the time of start-up to familiarize the\n            implementing agencies with the Bank's procurement\n            rules, problems persisted; (ii) the Bank should reflect on\n            measures to make funds available as early as possible; (iii)\n            care should be taken that implementing agencies are staffed\n            with highly capable staff experienced in project\n            implementation; (iv) the housing reconstruction process\n            using the self-help method was very efficient; and (v) the\n            provision of agricultural machinery and equipment to the\n            farmers at a price including maintenance cost ensures that\n            the equipment is properly maintained and normally has a life\n            span in excess of the depreciation period of 5 to 10 years,\n            depending on the type of equipment."}, "docdt": "1997-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
