                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective is to contribute to the improvement of the overall quality and performance of teachers through enhancing teachers' knowledge of
                         subject matter and pedagogical skills in the classroom. Improvement of teacher quality and performance is to be measured by: (i) the increased number of
                         teachers meeting academic qualifications mandated by the Teacher Law; (ii) the increased number of primary and junior secondary teachers in BERMUTU
                         Districts using classroom instruction with specific subject and age appropriate pedagogy; and (iii) the reduction in absenteeism of teachers in BERMUTU
                         Districts.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Task Team has observed continuing solid progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) as measured by the progress toward the attainment of agreed
                         targets on the key and supplementary indictors. Particular highlights are the 39 percent increase since the project baseline in the number of basic education teachers meeting
                         academic qualifications mandated by the 2005 Teacher law. Approximately 182,000 primary and junior secondary education teachers have participated in grant program for the

                         professional teacher working groups (KKG/MGMP) to improve their pedagogic skills; however, just the numbers involved do not tell the complete story and qualitative monitoring is
                         needed to see how this program translates to improving the quality of student learning.

                         The other major project highlight is the success of project support for building a strong regulatory framework. Regulations have now been issued for recognition of Prior Learning
                         (RPL), teacher career progression, continuous professional development (CPD) and new teacher induction. The current indicates that some 35,000 teachers have received
                         Recognition of Prior Learning; however, while this is good progress the feasibility of achieving the project final target of 700,000 by 2013 is being re-examined as part of the Mid-term
                         review which is scheduled to be completed by end of September 2011.

                         The strengthening in the depth and breadth of the regulatory framework continues to be perhaps the strongest indicator of the project's contribution to improving the quality of
                         Indonesia's teaching workforce. In the remaining three years of the project the challenge will be to build on this solid foundation and we draw reiterate that the focus of monitoring and
                         evaluation should now move from what has been largely a quantitative perspective to a more qualitative view; concentrating not on how many or how few but on recording an
                         assessment of utilization and of the changes produced.
