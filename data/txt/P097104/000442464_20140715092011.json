Teacher Upgrading\n            (BERMUTU) Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: improving teaching quality and performance\n            requires an articulated, focused, and holistic approach,\n            just like the one included in BERMUTU. Ministry of Education\n            and Culture (MoEC) being in the driver seat owning and\n            implementing the program without the need of parallel\n            structures greatly contributed to the satisfactory\n            achievement of the stated project development objectives\n            (PDOs) and ensured technical, institutional, and financial\n            sustainability of BERMUTU's key interventions after the\n            closing date. BERMUTU-follow up programs currently\n            implemented by MoEC and some districts, largely navigating\n            in new and unchartered territory will greatly benefit from a\n            continued technical support from international and\n            multilateral donors providing sound technical advice and\n            linkages with worldwide best practices."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
