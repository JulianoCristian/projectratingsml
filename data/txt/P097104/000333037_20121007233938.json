As a\n            follow up to the mid-term review of the project, the\n            proceeds of the said credit, loan and grant were reallocated\n            (dated November 23, 2011) to reflect the actual disbursement\n            as of 2010 and revised disbursement plan 2011-2013. However,\n            the Government of Indonesia changed the official exchange\n            rates used for budgeting purposes from IDR 9,200/USD in\n            FY2011 to IDR 8,800/USD in FY 2012. As a result, the actual\n            expenditures of each category up to December 2011, and the\n            budget allocation in FY 2012 (both in USD currency) are\n            slightly different from the agreed disbursement plan for\n            2011-2013 (used as a basis for the amendment of the proceeds\n            in November 23, 2011). This especially affected the\n            allocation for the working group program (under category 4)\n            increasing by USD 566,898, or about one percent. This amount\n            is to be covered by using the unallocated (category 7) and\n            some efficiency of categories 2, 3 and 5. The reallocation\n            of proceeds is to accommodate such changes in the exchange\n            rates and has been incorporated into the revised\n            disbursement plan for the remaining two years of the project\n            implementation (2012-2013). This reallocation of proceeds is\n            necessary to properly finance the implementation of the\n            project activities and meet the agreed project development objectives."}, "docdt": "2012-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
