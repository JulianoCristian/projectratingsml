                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective is to contribute to the improvement of the overall quality and performance of teachers through enhancing teachers' knowledge of subject
                         matter and pedagogical skills in the classroom. Improvement of teacher quality and performance is to be measured by: (i) the increased number of teachers meeting
                         academic qualifications mandated by the Teacher Law; (ii) the increased number of primary and junior secondary teachers in BERMUTU Districts using classroom
                         instruction with specific subject and age appropriate pedagogy; and (iii) the reduction in absenteeism of teachers in BERMUTU Districts.

                         Progress towards achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) is solid as evidenced by significant progress towards achieving the project’s Key Performance Indicators.
                         Some highlights are: (1) Increased number of teachers meeting academic qualifications mandated by the Teacher Law. At the time of this report over 1.7 million (of total 2.74 million
                         teachers) teachers have acquired the mandated 4-year college degree. This exceeds the final target of 1.4 million, (2) Improvement in the pedagogic skills of teachers: 214,380
                         teachers are participating in the 6,107 teacher, principal and supervisor professional working groups with the primary aim to improve their pedagogic competency. The appraisal of a

                         random sample of classroom performance has validated that improvement is occurring, (3) Reduction in Teacher Absenteeism in BERMUTU Districts. There are two sets of teacher
                         absenteeism studies. The study by SMERU (funded by the Bank) on randomly selected public primary schools in 2003 and 2008 using nationally representative samples of primary
                         schools found the teacher absenteeism rates to be 19% and 14% respectively. Another national representative study is being conducted in collaboration with the ACDP (an ADB
                         program jointly funded by the European Commission and the AusAid). To check the rate in the BERMUTU districts, MOEC conducted a study on selected schools in 20 districts
                         participating in BERMUTU. In 2010 it found absenteeism rates of 8.35% in primary schools and 12.84% in junior secondary schools; and in 2012 it found 6.6% and 6.3%
                         respectively.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As of to date, data shows that almost all of the PDO and Intermediate Outcome Indicators are achieved. Results of two indicators, i.e., number of beginning teachers received/
                         receiving induction programs and graduates from accredited bachelor degree program for primary school teacher meeting the mandated competency standards are still being
                         collected. It has been agreed that the data will be reflected in the Project Completion Review being prepared by the Government Team.
