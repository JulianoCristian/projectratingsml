As\n            part of the mid-term review, the Government and the Bank\n            team have jointly reviewed the actual expenditures of each\n            loan, credit and grant category during the first half of the\n            project period (2008-2010). There are some shifts from the\n            original cost calculations, primarily that the number of\n            teachers participating in the working group program (under\n            Category 4) has substantially exceeded project design\n            estimates. This substantial increase has a flow-on effect\n            for the budget required for supporting activities such as\n            training of trainers and master teachers, workshops and\n            program management under category three. The reallocation of\n            proceeds reflects these changes in the scope of activities\n            and is detailed in the revised disbursement plan for the\n            remaining three years (2011-2013). This is necessary to\n            properly finance project activities and meeting agreed\n            project development objectives."}, "docdt": "2011-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
