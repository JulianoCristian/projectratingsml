                      social inclusion initiatives.




                      The development objective of the DPL program is to support the GoM
                      in implementing its program of reforms aimed at improving the
                      financial, environmental and social performance of the municipal solid
                      waste sector in Morocco. The first DPL (DPL1) supported the key
                      foundations of the Government's reform program, which established
                      the enabling environment for an integrated and affordable municipal
Program               solid waste system. This second DPL (DPL2) supports capitalizing on
Development           the momentum gained during the first operation while deepening the
Objective(s) and      reforms at the regional and municipal levels.
Contribution to CAS
                      Support to the municipal solid waste reform program is a key
                      component of the new CPS. DPL2 will contribute to the achievement of
                      the CPS'second and third pillars: (i) support to the improvement in
                      access to, and quality of services; and (ii) sustainable development in a
                      changing climate. In addition the operation is fully supportive of the
                      CPS cross cutting theme of enhancing governance.

                      The risk environment is substantially the same as for the 2009
                      operation, for which 3 main risks were identified:

                      1) Commitments to the reform and implementation capacity risks.
                      The quality of the Bank-client dialogue during 2009-10 and progress
                      made towards the prior actions for the second operation indicate that
                      reform commitment remains robust. However, the spotlight is moving
                      onto implementation capacity as a potential risk to the achievement of
                      the national solid waste management program's objectives. More
                      specifically, implementation progress will depend on the
                      systematization of procedures for the allocation of financial support to
                      municipalities, the capacity of municipalities to manage investments
                      and service outsourcing (and in particular the capacity of medium-sized
                      and smaller municipalities), and the central government's monitoring
Risks and Risk        arrangements. This potential risk is mitigated by the Government's
Mitigation            strong commitment to (i) scale up and mainstream the solid waste
                      capacity building activities within the Government program to support
                      decentralization at the municipal level, and (ii) mobilize appropriate
                      financial and human resources to support the management of the
                      program at national and local levels.

                      2) Social acceptance risk, namely the risk that the reforms will be
                      unacceptable to the general public and to waste pickers. So far the
                      public profile of the solid waste reforms has been fairly low. However,
                      there remains a risk of an adverse reaction to the transfer of collection
                      service employees from the public to the private sector. Early signs
                      indicate that pilot projects implemented so far for the re-employment of
                      waste pickers are proving successful. This potential risk is mitigated
                      through the Government's decision to create a specific line item within
                      the national solid waste program's 2010 budget to expand these pilots
                      and the mandatory requirement for operators to cover social aspects in
                                               iv
               future contracts.

               3) The possibility of municipalities' resisting the solid waste
               reforms was identified as a minor risk for the 2009 operation
               initially, to be mitigated by the allocation of targeted financial support.
               However, concerns remain that the incremental cost of the required
               investments may prove too high for some municipalities. For example,
               the annualized payments from the Solid Waste Support Program to
               municipalities may not be enough to finance up-front capital investment
               in improved waste sites and the financial implications for medium-sized
               and smaller municipalities may prove particularly daunting. The
               magnitude of this potential risk is being addressed through the ongoing
               KFW funded study on institutional and financial aspects, and the
               government is fully committed to tailor its financial support to small
               and poor local governments if needed. In the longer term, the
               progressive shift of financial responsibility from government budgets to
               municipal taxpayers may weaken municipalities' commitment to
               improved solid waste management practices. This potential risk is
               mitigated by the Government's strong commitment to proceed with the
               envisaged municipal finance reforms. Efforts are underway from both
               cost reduction and revenue generation perspectives ranging from short
               to medium and long term time frames. Inter-municipal cooperation and
               regionalization of solid waste disposal facilities will also help
               especially small municipalities to take advantage of the significant
               economies of scale in waste management.

                                PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
     SECOND MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                              TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO


I.      INTRODUCTION

1. This Program Document proposes a Second Municipal Solid Waste Sector Reform Loan (DPL
   2) to the Kingdom of Morocco in the amount of 100 million (US$ 138.6 million equivalent). The
   proposed operation is the second of a programmatic series of two single-tranche DPLs. The first
   operation (100 million) was approved by the Board in March 2009. In accordance with the initially
   agreed reform program, this second operation is specifically designed to capitalize on the momentum
   gained during the first operation while deepening reform through results-oriented actions at the
   regional and local levels.

2. The program for the municipal solid waste sector was defined at the outset of the new
   Government in October 2007, and has been implemented since. Reform of the sector is viewed as
   a core component of improving the urban environment and is central to the decentralization agenda
   that the Government is carrying out, especially to improve service delivery in urban area.
   Mainstreaming environment and social concerns is also one of the fundamental principles of the
   recent Charter of the Environment and Sustainable Development called for by His Majesty the King
   in his speech of the Throne on July 31 2009, and finalized in April 2010.

3. The Government's program includes three strategic reform areas: i) enhance the governance of
   the sector; ii) improve the sustainability of municipal solid waste services; and iii) mainstream
   environmental and social dimensions. The key outcomes of the reform program include: (a)
   effective inter-ministerial coordination of the National Solid Waste Program (PNDM) and a
   strengthened regulatory framework through the enactment of executive regulations for Solid Waste
   Management (SWM) planning, norms and standards; (b) better financial sustainability through:
   allocation of financial resources consistent with sector policies and programs, improved cost
   effectiveness of private sector operators involved in providing SWM services, and additional sources
   of revenues generated through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); and (c) waste disposal
   practices consistent with international social and environmental good practices.

4. With the support of the first operation (DPL 1), the reform process has made substantial
   progress with tangible results. Morocco has moved from lagging behind most of its regional peers
   to pioneering the implementation of an integrated and policy-oriented approach to address sector
   needs. Actions and policy measures supported through the first operation succeeded in establishing
   the key foundations of the sector reform, including a sound institutional footing, a strengthened
   regulatory framework for the solid waste sector and the EIA system, growing and sustained
   Government financial support to local governments and transparent fund allocation through
   performance-based criteria. This has translated into the professionalization of collection services
   through increased private sector participation (now reaching 60% of urban areas), and the launch of
   the upgrade of waste disposal practices to meet environmental and social standards (targeting waste
   generated by 50% of the urban population). Climate mitigation is now fully integrated into the
   national SWM program with a GHG reduction potential of about 9 million tons of CO2 equivalent
   (tCO2e) over the next 10 years.

5. The implementation to date of the indicative triggers for DPL2 is satisfactory. Out of the nine
   indicative triggers, 8 of these actions have been met and there is only one action that is delayed and
   subsequently the number of prior actions for DPL2 is 8. This program document reviews the progress
                                                   1
       made in implementing the reforms with a focus on the prior actions for the second operation DPL2

       first DPL that were incorporated into the design of the proposed operation.

6. Bank support to the municipal solid waste sector in Morocco continues to advance in close
   collaboration with other partners. Although there are no co-financiers of the proposed operation,
   the team is working very closely with other donors involved in this sector in Morocco, including
   UNDP, GtZ and KfW who are providing coordinated technical support.

7. Morocco carried out sound macroeconomic policies and continued to sustain the momentum of
   structural reforms. As a result, the growth trend shifted to a higher level averaging 5.1 percent over
   2001-09, almost twice the average rate of the 1990s (2.8 percent). The good growth performance
   allowed GDP per capita to almost double over the last decade to reach US$2,890 in 2009.
   Furthermore, sound fiscal policies led to the consolidation of public finances, allowing the budget to
   run surpluses in 2007 and 2008 (averaging 0.3 percent of GDP) and to withstand well in 2009 the
   impact of the global crisis, with a manageable budget deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP. The Government
   adopted a prudent debt strategy and central government debt steadily declined to 46.9 percent of GDP
   in 2009 from 62 percent in 2005. In addition, the monetary authorities pursued appropriate monetary
   policy geared toward maintaining low and stable inflation (an average of 2.2 percent since 2005) and
   enhanced financial sector supervision. Furthermore, the country sought to deepen its integration into
   the world economy through the signing of many FTAs culminating with the recent "Advanced
   Status" awarded by the UE. Overall, these efforts have led to a stable macroeconomic stance,
   stronger public finances, and a sound financial sector. On the basis of these achievements Morocco
   gained "investment grade" rating in 2007 from Fitch, which was confirmed again in 2009. In March
   2010, it received the "Investment grade" again from Standard & Poor (BBB- with stable outlook),
   which further reinforced the confidence of investors, both domestic and foreign.

 9. Reforms triggered positive changes in the Moroccan economic structure but manufacturing is
    losing momentum. The structure of production changed in favor of services with both primary and
    secondary sectors' shares in GDP declining over time. The shrinking of the secondary sector's share
    is mainly due to falling manufacturing share, which has steadily declined over the last two decades,
    denoting a weakness of the productive tissue that reduces its productive capacity and hinders its long
    term growth and development. This weakness stems from the slow structural transformation in the
    manufacturing sector, which also explains the modest results of Moroccan exports. The latter
    continue to be concentrated around relatively undiversified, low knowledge, low value-added,
    traditional products. As a consequence, exports do not fully benefit from trade dynamics of
    Morocco's trade partners and thus have been unable to fulfill their potential for contributing to growth
    and job creation.

                 B.      RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN MOROCCO

10. In the context of the global economic crisis, growth performance in Morocco has been good.
    Economic growth in 2009 reached 4.9 percent following a growth rate of 5.6 percent in 2008. This
    performance is mainly due to an exceptionally good agricultural output, which gained 30.6 percent
    benefiting from favorable rain conditions. This shows that agricultural variations due to weather
    conditions still affect GDP growth, albeit with less intensity than in the past. Growth of the non-
                                                   4
    agricultural GDP slowed down to a much lower rate than projected due to the negative impact of the
    global crisis. It edged down to 1.4 percent over 2009 compared to 4.2 percent registered the previous
    year and it is mostly explained by a slow-down or decline of most of the activities, especially
    manufacturing and tourism.

11. Data for the first half of 2010 show that the economy is recovering from the effects of the global
    economic slowdown that started in late 2008. Non agricultural GDP gained 5.4 percent in the first
    quarter of 2010 and stabilized at 4.8 percent in the second quarter. It is expected that growth
    momentum of the non-agricultural activities would continue through the end of the year. However,
    total GDP growth is estimated to be around 3.5 percent for the whole year owing to a lower, although
    good, harvest this year compared to the exceptional one of last year, translating into an estimated
    negative growth of the agricultural output (down 8 percent). Furthermore, there are no apparent signs
    that the recent sovereign debt crisis of Greece and the subsequent restrictive policies of some
    European countries have had any major impact on exports or capital inflows.

12. The Government has implemented a stimulus package to support the income of the population
    and help the most affected sectors (Box 1). The income support package is mostly benefiting the
    low income employees. It includes an increase of 10 percent in the wages of civil servants at the
    lower end of the salary scale and the Minimum Wage for private sector employees. The wage
    increase was implemented in two steps, the first increase of 5 percent in July 2008 and the second one
    in July 2009. In addition, effective January 2009, the marginal income tax rate was cut from 42
    percent to 40 percent and further to 38 percent in January 2010. At the same time, the upper end of
    the exempt income bracket was extended. Direct support measures for affected firms included
    financial relief (guarantees on loans; rescheduling of debt; help with export insurance) as well as
    subsidies for training and marketing. Economic stimulus was also provided through some monetary
    easing. The total budgetary gross cost of the stimulus package has been estimated by the government
    at MAD 21 billion3 (over the 2008-2010 period) or 2.7 percent of 2010 GDP, and as such does not
    pose a risk to the medium term sustainability of public finances.

 Because of their structural nature, the extra subsidies for food and petroleum products (MAD 7 billion) generated
by higher world prices of cereals and fuels are not included in the stimulus package.
                                                         5
                                  Box 1: Fiscal Stimulus packages and Outcomes
 The Government has implemented several measures to help affected firms cope with the decline of external
 demand. Early in 2009, the government set up a high level Council for Strategic Monitoring (CSM), comprising
 concerned ministers as well as representatives of the business community and banking sector, to follow
 developments related to the ongoing global crisis. The CSM targeted the export sectors hit by the effects of the
 global crisis for support through the following measures that would expire at the end of 2010 (and amount to a
 budgetary cost of 0.2% of 2010 GDP):

     Social component: budgetary support to help firms in the payment of their contribution to employees' social
     benefits
     Financial component: public guarantees for financing roll-over funds of firms and for rescheduling of their
     debt service
     Commercial component: budgetary support for the prospection and marketing costs abroad, and preferential
     conditions for export insurance
     Training component: Budgetary support for training and logistics

 Subsequently specific support programs have been designed for tourism and remittances and investment of
 Moroccan workers residing abroad.

 Data as of June 2010 show that 70 percent of the demand for support concerned social benefits relief and was
 requested by 443 firms, of which 398 firms operating in the textiles sector and the remaining firms in
 automotive equipment and electronics. At the same time, 129 firms benefited from loan guarantees (of which
 most are operating in the textiles sector), and 134 firms benefited from training, of which 111 firms from the
 textiles sector and 20 from automotive equipment.

 Measures to help low income households were already started in 2008 and included in the 2009 and 2010 Budget
 Laws. For the most part, they consisted of tax relief and wage increases for selected groups as well as an increase
 in social expenditures by relevant government departments. These measures, along with a much higher public
 investment program in place for 2009 and confirmed for 2010, kept domestic demand high as reflected in the
 rising credit to consumption, equipment and real estate (see below). Specific measures included the following:
     The marginal income tax was cut from 42 percent to 38 percent, and the upper limit of the tax-exempt
     bracket was increased by 25 percent;
     Salaries of civil servants at the lower end of the pay scale were increased by 10 percent (5 percent in July
     2008 and 5 percent in July 2009);
     For private sector employees, the minimum wage was raised by 10 percent (5 percent in July 2008 and 5
     percent in July 2009);
     Minimum pension payments were increased by 20 percent and family allowances by 33 percent.

 Economic stimulus was also provided through monetary easing. Reserve requirements for banks were cut in
 steps from 15 percent to 8 percent over 2009, and further to 6 percent effective April 1st, 2010. The Central
 Bank also cut its policy rate by 25 basis-points in March 2009 translating into a policy rate of 3.25 percent.


13. Public finances continue to be well managed despite the impact of the global crisis on the
    budget. The steady reform efforts of expenditure and tax management and sound active debt
    management over the last few years have been critical in maintaining public finances on a sustainable
    path. These reforms translated into better control of the Government's consumption, enhanced tax
    collection, and declining public debt. In this context, the budget deficit was limited to 2.2 percent of
    GDP in 2009 despite decreasing revenues impacted by the reduction of corporate and personal tax
    rates, the exceptional revenues of 2008, the slowdown of economic activities ensuing the global
    crisis, and the introduction of the stimulus package. This manageable deficit follows a good
    performance of public finances that were in slight surplus in 2007 (0.2 percent of GDP) and in 2008




                                                         6
       (0.4 percent of GDP)4, which is remarkable given the impact on the budget of high subsidies5
       following the food and fuel crisis.

14. Recent data on budget execution over the first 9 months of 2010 show that the annualized
    budget deficit was contained to around 3.4 percent of GDP. The budget deficit is mainly
    explained by soaring food and fuel subsidies (up 143.2 percent) caused by increasing world prices.
    The deficit however, may have been even larger without efforts to improve revenue collection that
    helped fiscal revenues to stabilize (down only 0.9 percent) despite the impact of the global crisis and
    the effects of the stimulus package. It is clear that subsidies still represent a heavy burden on the
    budget and thus constitute a potential risk factor for its sustainability in case of exogenous shocks
    such as continued higher world prices of fuels and food items or severe drought. Nevertheless, public
    finance stance remains sustainable due to the sound macroeconomic policies and accompanying
    sectoral measures the Government is undertaking to mitigate the effect of such shocks. Indeed, the
    Government continued to improve tax administration and collection and contain recurrent
    expenditures, of which the wage bill. It launched a medium term plan to reform the subsidy system
    along an ambitious program aiming at enhancing the productivity of the agricultural sector and
    insulating it from the uncertainties of the climate conditions. In addition, the Government is
    implementing better targeted social programs such as conditional cash transfer program and a scaled
    up non-contributory health insurance scheme for the poor (RAMED). The stable macroeconomic
    stance and the continued reform momentum have allowed Morocco to successfully issue Euro 1
    billion of bonds in the international market end September 2010, at relatively low interest rate (4.5
    percent), of which a low spread of 200 basis points, showing the recognition of international investors
    of the positive economic prospects for Morocco.

15. Sound fiscal management helped further reduce the central government's debt. Reflecting the
    good performance of public finances and sound active debt management, the debt stock of the central
    government declined to 46.9 percent of GDP in 2009, down by almost a half percentage point
    compared to the previous year (and by more than 6.5 percentage points relative to 2007). The decline
    is explained by a decrease in that of domestic debt, which fell by 1.2 percentage points to reach 36.2
    percent of GDP, while foreign debt slightly increased by 0.8 percentage point of GDP (representing
    10.7 percent of GDP) reflecting the new government's debt strategy to improve the share of external
    debt in total public debt while meeting the hard currency needs of the country.

16. The Government and the central bank showed continued commitment to fight inflation.
    Helped by prudent monetary policies, protected domestic markets from increasing world food and
    fuel prices, and ample domestic food supply, inflation was low over the first 9 months of 2010 (up
    0.7 percent). This inflation rate is less than that of 2009 (1.5 percent) the same period and much less
    than that of 2008 (3.7 percent). Both food and non-food inflation have been low (0.2 and 0.9 percent
    respectively).

17. The external position remains solid despite the recent deterioration of the current account. For
    the first time since the 1980s, the current account ran large deficits in 2008 (5.2 percent of GDP) and
    2009 (5 percent of GDP). The latest data show that current account deficit deteriorated to 6.6 percent
    of GDP over the first half of 2010. Current account deficits followed comfortable surpluses over the
    period 2001-06 (average surplus of 2.8 percent of GDP) and a quasi-balance in 2007 (a deficit of 0.1
    percent of GDP). The worsening of the current account is principally explained by the decrease in
    workers' remittances and tourism receipts that had been compensating in the past for the rising trade
    deficits. However, the on-going recovery of world economy is having a positive impact on these two
    important sources of foreign exchanges: over the first 9 months of 2010, remittances increased by 8.2
    percent and tourism receipts by 6.4 percent. Consequently, after declining by US$ 5.3 billion (or

       last months reducing the loss to US$ 2.6 billion by end September 2010, reaching US$ 22.2 billion,
       which represent 6.9 months of imports, down from 7.6 months in 2009. Foreign reserves are
       expected to improve further thanks to the Euro 1 billion raised by the Government end September
       2010, the recent selling of 40 percent of Medi-Telecom for Euro 640 million, and increasing share of
       foreign financing of the budget.

18. The recent economic events revealed once again the weaknesses inherent in the Moroccan trade
    structure. The trade deficit deteriorated to 24.7 percent of GDP in 2008, up from 22.3 percent of
    GDP in 2007 (and only 11 percent in 2000). It improved in 2009 as imports declined by more than
    exports in nominal terms (20.8 percent of GDP). The latest data show the deficit further improved to
    19.7 percent of GDP by end September 2010. The high trade deficit is mainly a volume effect rather
    than a price effect because Morocco actually benefited from positive terms of trade movement; while
    the price of oil and food imports increased, so did the price of key Moroccan exports such as
    phosphate products and agri-food. The poor performance of exports reflects their low diversification
    and lack of competitiveness. This explains largely why Moroccan exports were not able to benefit
    fully from the many FTAs it signed over the last decade such as those with the EU, the USA, and
    Turkey.

19. Monetary and exchange rate policies remained appropriate. In 2008, the central bank (BAM)
    resorted to raising the cost of money (plus 25 basis points in September 2008) to contain soaring
    credit and moderate inflation, while it relaxed its policy to enhance liquidity in the face of the global
    crisis. As liquidity tightened and inflationary pressures started to ease over the second half of 2008
    through 2009, BAM relaxed gradually the money reserve rate reducing it from 15 to 12 percent
    January 2009, and then to 10 percent July 2009. BAM decided to further cut the money reserve rate
    to 8 percent in October 2009 and to 6 percent starting April 2010 to ease the pressure on liquidity and
    thereby allowing Banks to be able to cope with the new money demands while contributing to
    keeping interest rates close to the BAM's policy rate. It has also cut its policy rate by 25 basis points
    in March 2009 to reach 3.25 percent. Despite these relaxed policies, money supply slowed to 5.5
    percent (y/y) by end September 2010, compared to an average 14.5 percent over 2005-2008.
    Although credit for equipment soared at 24.4 percent, total credit to the private sector slowed down
    (up 11 percent) driven by reduced growth in credit for consumption (up 9.5 percent), construction (up
    9.1 percent), and for working capital (up 0.1 percent). At the same time, the stock of non-performing
    loans increased by 7.8 percent (y/y), but their share in total credit to the economy has been steadily
                                                                                 8
      declining over time (from 4.8 percent in September 2009 to 4.6 percent September 2010). In recent
      years, the exchange rate remained in line with macroeconomic fundamentals with no signs of
      misalignment.

20. Sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies, as well as efforts to improve sector productivity and
    competitiveness, put Morocco in a better position to maneuver with less damage through the
    moderate effects of the global crisis, while being in a position to benefit from the recovery of the
    world economy (Table 2). The decision of the Government to continue its reform efforts and revamp
    its sector strategies along the targeted and short term sector fiscal stimulus should allow the Moroccan
    economy to expect good prospects over the medium term. Meanwhile, economic growth is estimated
    to be around 3.5 percent in 2010 mostly owing to the recovery of the non-agricultural sector
    benefiting from contribution of dynamic activities such as construction, finance services,
    telecommunication, and tourism.

21. Growth prospects in the medium term are positive. It is assumed that the Government will sustain
    the reform momentum of the last few years, achieve the ambitious public investment programs it
    devised, and continue to implement the main sector strategies it launched, thus consolidating further
    economic diversification, growth potential, and domestic demand, and it is also assumed that the
    world economy will slowly recover from the current crisis to allow the on-going export promotion
    strategies to achieve their targets and contribute to growth. Under these conditions, growth rates will
    improve from the low 3.5 percent estimated for 20106 to around 5.2 percent in 2013. Should the
    underlying sources of growth assumed above be slow to materialize, growth prospects would have to
    be adjusted downward. Moreover, there is a potential risk that even pre-crisis growth levels might not
    be sustainable over the medium term if internal demand remains the key driver of growth.

22. Sound macroeconomic policies would help contain inflation at low levels. Inflation edged down
    to 1 percent only in 2009, mainly driven by ample food supply and to a lesser extent by declining
    prices of imported food items, and should remain subdued at around 2 percent thereafter. As the


6
 The low growth in 2010 is mainly explained by normal agricultural output translating into a negative growth rate
for agriculture after an outstanding growth in 2009.
                                                         9
    Moroccan agricultural sector meets domestic demand for most of basic food commodities and even
    allows it to export many food items, its inflation rate is only slightly impacted by international food
    price fluctuations. In addition, subsidies for key food and energy prices ­ while clearly having an
    impact on the budget ­ contribute to a stable inflation rate.

23. After a temporary higher estimated deficit in 2010, the fiscal stance should remain sound over
    the medium term, with fiscal deficits around the targeted threshold of 3 percent of GDP, benefiting
    from the ongoing fiscal reform and more targeted social programs, as well as a better-controlled wage
    bill. The budget deficit is expected to edge up to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2010 before gradually
    dropping to 3.2 percent by 2013. Reaching this outcome implies maintaining momentum of the
    ongoing tax reform to broaden the tax base, improve the efficiency of the VAT, strengthen tax
    administration, and remove unproductive tax exemptions in order to reduce the high tax expenditures.
    These measures would offset the negative impact of the reduced top rates on corporate and personal
    income taxes. Under these assumptions, revenues are projected to stabilize at around 25 percent of
    GDP. On the expenditure side, the consolidation of public finances relies on four critical measures:
    deepening of fiscal reform, achievement of oil and food subsidies reform, continued tight control of
    the wage bill evolution, and an active debt management. Under these conditions, public debt will
    slightly increase in 2010 48.2 percent of GDP before following a downward trend to decline to less
    than 46.5 percent of GDP in 2013.

24. The financing needs stemming from the higher budget deficit in 2010 and declining deficits over
    the medium term are easily financed through domestic market as well as from increased
    drawings on external loans (Table 3). In this context, domestic financing would remain the main
    source, although external financing would improve its contribution. Indeed, since 2006, net external
    financing reversed its long negative trend to turn positive, reflecting the government's strategy to
    slightly change the debt composition in favor of external borrowing. This financing strategy would
    ease the pressure on domestic financial markets and prevent any crowding out of the private sector's
    investment now that the money market is less liquid than over the last years. At the same time it is
    consistent with the intention to maintain a comfortable level of foreign reserves.

25. The Government's debt strategy is to diversify financing sources and take on a greater
    proportion of external financing. Three main factors underpin the decision of the Government to
    reinforce its external sources, especially multilateral and concessional. The first is linked to
    Morocco's public debt maturity structure. The maturity of public debt has fallen in recent years and
    will fall further given that the central government mostly financed its needs through issuing T-bills of
    up to 1 year maturity in the domestic market. The main reason behind this choice was to avoid

    bonds). The second relates to the higher balance of payments needs although the level of foreign
    reserves remains relatively comfortable. The third is due to the current higher borrowing requirements
    of the Budget, in a context of tightening liquidity of the domestic financial markets after a long period
    of an over-liquid money market. Consequently, additional external lending is consistent with prudent
    debt management which fosters improved terms of debt, while maintaining a comfortable level of
    foreign reserves and at the same time avoids pressure on domestic financial markets. In September
    2010 Morocco successfully completed a ten year bond issue for one Billion Euros against a total
    demand of over 2.2 Billions, further attesting international markets confidence in Morocco's sound
    macroeconomic stability.

26. A comprehensive public debt sustainability analysis shows that the fiscal framework is robust
    to downside risk in the medium term (see Annex 4). Public debt under the two main shocks
    proved sustainable over the medium term8. Under alternative scenarios, six other shocks to the
    baseline scenario are simulated9, and public debt sustainability is preserved in all of them. Under
    these shocks, public debt would slightly increase in 2010 and, for a few shocks, in 2011 as well,
    before steadily declining over the medium term.

27. The external position is expected to remain sustainable over the medium term. The current
    account is expected to slightly deteriorate in 2010 (5.4 percent of GDP) before following a slight
    downward trend over the medium term to edge down to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2013, as the impact of
    reforms and sector strategies take hold. Indeed, the balance of payments is expected to progressively
    improve, with lower trade and current account deficits, which would benefit from improved export
    potentials and a recovery of tourism activities and workers' remittances. This scenario assumes that
    Morocco would reap the fruits of its continued reform efforts, its sound macroeconomic and fiscal
    policies, and targeted sector strategies that entail higher public investments, which would translate
    into higher private investments, including FDI, and progressive gains in competitiveness of its
    exports, including tourism. In this context, external debt is expected to follow an inverted U path
    reaching a maximum at 28.1 percent of GDP in 2011 from 24.7 percent of GDP in 2009 before
    steadily dropping to 26.7 percent by 2013 while net foreign reserves will stay at an average of 6
    months of imports.

28. Balance of payments financing requirements do not constitute a serious concern given the
    sound economic fundamentals, the country's low external debt stock, and the ample foreign
    reserves. As the current account deficits are projected to steadily improve in the medium term, there
    are no constraints on financing them through multilateral and bilateral credit lines along other private
    capital flows, including FDI. The latter is expected to gradually improve, attracted by an improved
    business environment and the opportunities offered by important structural projects and the devised
    privatization program of the country.

29. In sum, Morocco's macroeconomic framework remains adequate and sustainable in the
    medium term. The moderate effects of the global crisis on the Moroccan economy have been
    mitigated by the good economic fundamentals resulting from sound macroeconomic policies carried
    out over the last years and by the response of the Government through the stimulus package to
    mitigate these effects on the population and businesses alike. The stimulus package has allowed
    supporting investors' confidence and domestic demand while reducing risks. The Government's

III.      THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

            A.    SECTOR BACKGROUND

30. Out of a total Moroccan population of 30 million, 18 million live in urban areas. Moroccan cities are
    characterized by high population densities and rapid growth. They suffer from several forms of
    environmental degradation, one of which resulting from the poor management of municipal solid
    waste. The cost of the environmental degradation due to solid waste was estimated at 0.5 % of GDP
    in 2003 (among the highest in MENA).

31. In 2008, Morocco produced about 5 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) per year and this is
    expected to reach 6.2 million in 2020. Only 70 % of urban MSW was collected and less than 10 % of
    collected waste was being disposed of in an environmentally and socially acceptable manner. There
    were 300 uncontrolled dumpsites, and about 3,500 waste-pickers, of which 10 % were children, were
    living on and around these open dumpsites.

32. MSWM is the primary responsibility of local governments in Morocco. Thus MSW management also
    suffered from often weak managerial, planning and technical capacity to ensure efficient service
    delivery. As a result, and despite the key role played by the private sector (70 % of total spending on
    MSW Services contracted to private operators on a PPP basis), MSWM services were not cost-
    effective, while they are one of the largest categories of expenditures of cities: total recurrent
    municipal solid waste expenditures were estimated to MAD 1.3 billion in 2007, or about 10.5 percent
    of the total municipal budgets in urban areas. Of this amount, MAD 1.1 billion, or 85 percent, was
    allocated to collection and transfer services. Waste disposal in 2008 was insignificant in terms of
    allocated financial resources (less than MAD 200 million), as municipalities have not had political,
    economic, or regulatory incentives to finance disposal facilities.

33. Prior to the program of reforms, Morocco's MSW services were defined only in terms of
    "cleanliness", with very limited attention and resources allocated to waste disposal/treatment. The
    resulting impacts on the quality of life, public health, environmental and natural resources, and vital
    economic activities such as tourism, were huge. Major issues and challenges in the sector prior to
    formulation of reform program: a) poor sector policy focuses mainly on "cleanliness" with very
    limited attention to waste disposal/treatment; b) weak legal and institutional framework, which
    constrains effective strategic planning and governance; c) ad-hoc fiscal transfers to municipalities and
    uncertain financial sustainability; d) poor cost effectiveness of PPP mainly due to limited
    competition, lack of transparency, and poor accountability; and e) huge impacts on the quality of life,
    public health, environment and social and economic development.

            B.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

34. Morocco initiated the solid waste reform program with the enactment of its first Solid Waste
    Law 28-00 in December 2006 that, established the fundamental principles and key rules that will
    govern the management of solid waste in Morocco. This formed the foundation for Moroccan policy
    for the sector with two key objectives: to establish integrated and affordable solid waste management
    systems and to mitigate negative impacts of the sector on public health and the environment. More
    specifically, this law (i) establishes the institutional framework for SWM; (ii) requires the
    development of solid waste master plans at the national, regional, and municipal level; (iii)
    establishes cost recovery principles, including the "polluter pays" principle and the possibility of user
    fees (redevances); (iv) introduces sanitary landfills as the standard for final waste disposal and
    requiring regulations establishing landfill norms and standards; (v) introduces regulations for
    hazardous waste management, and (vi) establishes a system to monitor compliance with the law.
                                                     12
35. In 2008 Government also launched its first national municipal solid waste management
    program to help municipalities comply with the new solid waste law. The government recognizes
    that failing to tackle the sector issues in a timely and integrated manner would further exacerbate the
    poor environmental, social and economic performance of the sector. In this context, a MAD 4 billion
    program, called Plan National des Déchets Ménagers (PNDM) was developed and launched in 2008.
    It sets out objectives for the modernization of SWM, in particular, expanding and professionalizing
    collection services, modernizing disposal practices and promoting recycling activities. It includes
    specific long-term (2021 horizon) targets for the municipal waste sector, including: increasing
    collection coverage from 70 percent to 90 percent; reaching 100 percent use of sanitary landfills in
    urban areas; closure and/or rehabilitation of 300 open dumps; and sorting of 20 percent of recyclable
    materials.

36. The overall reform program supported by the Bank focuses on three areas: governance,
    sustainability, and environmental and social issues. The full scope of the program was presented in
    detail in the program document of the first DPL and is included in Annex 2 of the present document.
    The sections below summarize the key objectives for each reform area of the government's program
    as well as their expected benefits.

    allocation criteria for government       approving prefectural MSW master plans and of providing
    subsidies to support municipal SWM       technical assistance to LGs; (ii) LGs are the primary responsible
    operations and investments in an         for municipal solid waste management. They can manage these
    equitable, transparent, and cost-        services directly, or delegate them to professional operators based
                                             on the "Loi sur la gestion deleguée". Regardless of the

    appropriate communications and public awareness programs. Responsibility for the implementation

                                                       13
    of these reforms rests primarily with the MoI and the State Secretariat for Water and Environment
    (SWE), with the CN-PNDM serving as the main coordination entity.

38. Reform Area 2 ­ Enhancing sustainability of services. The Government recognizes that
    sustainability of the municipal solid waste sector is critical. There are two main aspects to the
    Government's strategy to promote financial sustainability ­ improving municipal financial capacity to
    meet the funding requirements of modernizing the MSWM system, both for investment and
    operation, and improving the cost effectiveness of services. In terms of improving municipal financial
    capacity, measures include: (i) in the short to medium term, the provision of rules-based targeted
    subsidies to municipalities to cover the incremental costs associated with complying with the
    requirements of the PNDM; improve contractual conditions for private sector participation so that
    private sector funding is available for investment where needed; and implement a reform of the
    municipal finance framework geared to maximize the fiscal potential of local taxes, thus increasing
    municipalities' own revenues, from which most of MSW investment and operation is and will remain
    funded; (ii) in the long term, supporting municipalities in mobilizing additional funds through the
    international carbon market, and exploring tools and mechanisms for generating additional revenue
    such as the creation of solid waste fees (redevances) allowed under Law 28-00 and possible
    introduction of "eco-taxes" on packaging waste. A KfW-funded study on options for mobilizing
    additional resources for SWM is underway and should be completed by the end of 2010.

39. In terms of improving the cost effectiveness of services, the Government intends to: (i) introduce
    incentives and tools to promote inter-municipal cooperation and regionalization of solid waste
    disposal facilities; this will help municipalities to take advantage of the significant economies of scale
    in waste management, and (ii) revise contracting documents and procedures for private sector
    participation in SWM.

40. In addition the Government will scale up its program to strengthen municipal capacity in SWM. In
    this context, the Ministry of Interior's training department launched a multi-year program of solid
    waste management capacity-building for local officials in June 2010. This program is being executed
    by the training institute of the Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP), the national water supply
    authority. The program's objectives are to: (i) train staff responsible for solid waste management in
    private sector participation, monitoring contractors, and the NSWMP approach (ii) raise awareness of
    the NSWMP's procedures among Communes and Municipalities, and help them to prepare funding
    proposals (iii) provide solid waste management officials access to the technical documentation and
    management tools developed by the METAP project and other MENA countries.

41. Reform Area 3 ­ Mainstreaming environmental and social dimensions. The GoM is committed to
    promoting environmentally and socially sound disposal facilities as recently confirmed by the launch
    of an extensive consultation towards the adoption of a nationwide Environment Charter called for by
    H.M the King Mohammed VI. To this end, the primary focus of the reform program is to: (i) support
    the implementation of environmentally and socially sound disposal facilities and (ii) improve the
    social and working conditions of wastepickers, whose livelihoods will be affected by closure of
    existing dumpsites. Furthermore, the Government recognizes the need to upgrade the existing EIA
    system to be applied, in particular, to landfilling projects. It is committed to improving the
    regulatory, administrative, technical, and managerial frameworks of the prevailing EIA system so that
    an improved EIA platform can facilitate direct investment and donor support and elevate Morocco's
    environmental image in the international arena. These improvements include: (i) establishment of
    criteria, guidelines and procedures for reviewing EIAs, approving EIA reports, and the inclusion of
    mitigating and monitoring measures for EIA in services and work contracts; (ii) preparation of
    standard TORs for preparing EIA reports for solid waste management, and TORs for environmental
    audits for landfills; (iii) adoption of procedures and modalities for integrating social concerns into the
    EIA process for projects in general and, for SWM projects in particular, specifically in relation with
    the issue of wastepickers; (iv) increase in number of specialized technical staff, as well as availability

                                                     14
    of resources and operational manuals to review EIA reports, and; (v) improvement in monitoring and
    enforcement of EIA mitigating measures at the national and local levels..

42. The reform program also supports cities for contributing to the climate mitigation agenda.
    Morocco is committed to promoting projects and activities to reduce GHG emissions, particularly
    thru the solid waste sector. The FEC, a public development bank providing financial support (loans)
    to municipalities' infrastructure projects, is now playing a key role in supporting local authorities
    gaining access to the international carbon market and developing CDM projects in the municipal solid
    waste area. Capitalizing on the momentum gained to date, the FEC will be focusing on the following:
    (i) solidifying the pipeline of solid waste-CDM projects in close coordination with the
    implementation of the PNDM; (ii) providing municipalities with technical and financial support to
    help them prepare CDM project documentation and generate carbon assets; and (iii) assisting both
    private landfill operators and municipalities in bringing Emission Reductions (ERs) to market,
    including through the signature of an Emissions Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA) with the
    Carbon Partnership Facility, managed by the Bank. The FEC program offers a GHG reduction
    potential of about 9 million tCO2e over the next 10 years.

          C.     CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESS

44. Since the beginning of the reform process, the reform program has been the topic of numerous
    consultation events with large participation of civil society. For its part, the Bank has not only
    participated in this process as appropriate, but has also collected many insights and suggestions on
    the topics considered for this operation through consultations in the context of the preparation of the
    recently Morocco Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The consultation process carried out during
    the preparation of the CPS highlighted several areas relevant for this operation. The theme of
    improved governance has emerged as a necessary entry point to improve the efficiency and
    transparency of public action particularly for enhanced service delivery. The CPS consultations have
    also reconfirmed the adequacy of the strategic objectives of this operation and the need to continue
    the support the solid waste agenda.

45. Government has led public consultations under each of the targeted policy areas inviting local
    participation in many of the engagements. Several workshops were held during the last few
    months with focus on some important topics of the reform such as private sector participation, social
    inclusion of the informal sector, and the development of CDM project activities. Participants to these
    events included representatives of national, regional and local authorities, private operators, NGOs,
    donors, and informal sector:

        a. In June 2008, during the preparation of the DPL program, a large consultation took place in
           Rabat to discuss improvements to the EIA system as applying in particular to the solid waste
           sector. This consultation laid the ground for harmonization measures in the framework of the
           "Use of Country Systems" policy currently piloted by the World Bank across many countries
           worldwide.
        b. Public consultations were held in December 2009 to present the strategic action plan to
           improve the private sector participation in delivery of SWM services and the new bidding
           documents and model contracts between the private service provider and the municipality.
           Inputs from these consultations covered important issues including, accountability of the
           service providers, transparency of bid evaluation process, LG capacity to manage and
           supervise private contracts, and social aspects.
        c. Government held consultations in December 2009 on mainstreaming social aspects in the
           solid waste sector with focus on the wastepickers' role in upgrading the MSW systems. The
           participants not only raised awareness on the planned areas of support under the PNDM and
           alternatives possible for the informal waste workers, they also set a list of recommendations
           toward the reliability and sustainability of the social inclusion activities.

           the Oum Azza landfill in May 2010 to present the first project activity that will be
           implemented under the CDM program of activities in the MSW sector. In total, more than 50
           stakeholders attended the consultation including local authorities, local associations, experts,
           academics and media. The participants discussed the project's technical and operational
           aspects, the role of FEC as the coordinating entity of the CDM program of activities and the
           progress made in the CDM registration cycle. Stakeholders appreciated the efforts made to
           integrate the development of CDM activities as part of the PNDM.
46. Furthermore, communication on the reform and consultation efforts to inform the public about
    the operation and support provided by the Bank took place on September 29, 2010 in Rabat.
    The main objectives of these consultations were to: a) update the stakeholders on the implementation
    status of the PNDM; b) present results and achievements of policy measures supported through the
    first DPL, and; c) key policy measures supported by DPL2 and solicit feedback. More than 140
    person representing involved government entities, NGOs, private operators, consulting firm, donors
    and sub-national governments attended that consultations. The participants raised important issues
    such as capacity of local government to modernize the sector, monitoring and supervision of project
    quality and environmental impacts, and valorization of waste. Although, these important issues are
    being addressed under DPL2, the Government is committed to consolidate the related measures
    during the next phase of their 15-year reform program. A report on these consultations will be
    included in the program documentation, as well as disclosed to the public on the SEE's website
    (www.minenv.gov.ma).

IV.     BANK SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

          A.    LINK TO CAS

47. The Bank's support to the implementation of the Morocco Municipal Solid Waste Management
    program is detailed in the FY10-13 CPS that was discussed by the Board in January 2010. The
    CPS is designed to help achieve Government objectives in a flexible and responsive way and is
    organized around three main pillars: the first concentrates on activities that will help enhance growth,
    competitiveness and employment. This objective will entail efforts to foster macro-economic stability
    and promoting private sector development as engine of growth. The second pillar supports the
    improvement in access to, and quality of, services to citizens. This will involve treating the
    institutional aspects of public services through appropriate public management measures with a view
    to reinforcing both the diagnostics (targeting) and accountability elements of service delivery. The
    third pillar aims at ensuring that Morocco's development can develop sustainably and address natural
    resources and climate change challenges. It reflects the Government's intention to enhance awareness
    of Morocco's exposure to climate change impacts while at the same time starting to step up
    coordination across departments and agencies for adaptation. In addition, the CPS places a strong
    emphasis on the governance agenda which will be mainstreamed across the envisioned program.

48. The program of two DPL operations, which was launched by DPL 1 in 2009, is fully consistent
    with the CPS. The lending program envisaged in the CPS includes the proposed DPL2 operation
    which contributes to the achievement of the CPS second and third pillars: (i) service delivery to
    citizens and (ii) sustainable development in a changing climate. In addition the operation is fully
    supported the CPS cross cutting theme of enhancing governance. Specifically, the sub-pillar 3.3 on
    solid waste management describes the outcomes which the Bank expects to influence: (i) effective
    inter-ministerial coordination of the PNDM and strengthened regulatory framework through the
    enactment of executive regulations for SWM planning, norms and standards, (ii) better financial
    sustainability of SWM sector and improved cost effectiveness of PSP in providing of MSW services,
    (iii) additional sources of revenues generated through CDM, and (iv) disposal practices comply with
    international social and environmental standards.


                                                    17
          B.    COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

49. The World Bank and the IMF maintain close collaboration in Morocco. Regular contacts
    between the IMF and World Bank country teams are customary, with discussions focused on the
    respective work programs, country priorities, recent developments and prospects, and reflecting the
    growing weight of DPLs in the Bank's Morocco portfolio. Collaboration between the Fund and the
    Bank has been seamless, with general understanding on the division of labor and a shared assessment
    of the critical macroeconomic challenges facing the country.

50. The Fund participates in Bank project review meetings where relevant. Similarly, Bank staff
    contributed to the IMF's 2009 Article IV consultation mission to Morocco. The ongoing analytical
    work being carried out by the Fund team, which was welcomed by Bank counterparts, focuses on the
    medium-term outlook for public finances in Morocco and the macroeconomic implications of the
    global financial crisis and economic downturn. Morocco's most recent Article IV consultations were
    discussed in the IMF's Board and concluded on January 25, 2010.

51. The proposed DPL operation was prepared in consultation with donors active in Morocco's
    solid waste sector. Close collaboration has been developed with KfW, UNDP, PPIAF, and GtZ to
    ensure full coordination with ongoing donor support activities and to share insights on reform
    progress and constraints. The proposed operation will expand on KfW and GtZ operations supporting
    the development of local capacity under the decentralization agenda and assisting the SEEE and MoI
    in strengthening the solid waste legal, institutional and financial framework and more generally the
    Environmental Impact Assessment regulation and related institutional arrangements. Bilateral donor-
    funded studies are supporting the Government's program. KfW is funding the study on financial and
    institutional frameworks, including options for small municipalities. This study will assess the cost
    incidence of various financing options for solid waste management. The Belgian PSIA TF jointly
    managed by the Bank and UNDP is financing the second phase of the Poverty and Social Impact
    Analysis (PSIA 2).

          C.    RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

52. Engagement between the Bank and Morocco on SWM has steadily strengthened and deepened
    since 2002 through dialogue and technical assistance, in large part through the Mediterranean
    Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP). In parallel with the preparation of the
    proposed DPL operation, the Bank provided the sector with technical support and advisory services,
    including (i) support to the operationalization of the Morocco national solid waste program including
    the elaboration of an operational manual; (ii) assessment of the Moroccan experience in term of PSP
    in the solid waste sector and the development of a strategic action plan; and (iii) capacity building and
    technical assistance in the areas of carbon finance and the CDM.

53. The operations in support of the urban transport sector, under preparation, draw on and
    complement the reform agenda supported by the municipal solid waste program of DPLs. The
    Bank is currently preparing a DPL to support Government reforms in urban transport, scheduled for
    Board presentation in FY11. This operation benefits from and expands on each of the components
    supported by the present DPL as it devotes attention to the governance agenda and service delivery at
    local level covering transport.

54. The Series of DPLs set the ground for the first "Use of Country systems" for safeguards in
    Morocco: The actions undertaken by the government in term of mainstreaming environmental and
    social concerns led to a significant improvement of the Moroccan EIA system. The benefit of
    upgrading the EIA system and its decentralization goes beyond the solid waste sector. For instance,
    the recent rural sanitation project with ONEP (Office National de l'Eau Potable) approved in June
    2010 represents a breakthrough as the first operation financed by the Bank in Morocco that has been
    submitted to the "Use of Country systems" for safeguards. The assessment carried out by the Bank in
                                                     18
    Morocco that has been prepared in compliance with the "Use of Country systems" Bank Policy (OP
    4.00) for environmental safeguards, has shown only limited discrepancies between the recently
    enhanced national EIA system and internationally accepted principles and good practices.
    Consequently, the Carbon finance operation prepared by FEC will also be prepared on the basis of a
    "Use of Country Systems" assessment.

          D.    LESSONS LEARNED

55. The proposed operation will build upon the experience of the 2009 Municipal Solid Waste Sector
    Development Policy Loan, other recent sector DPLs in Morocco as well as Bank lending for solid
    waste management in general.

56. The experience of the 2009 Municipal Solid Waste Sector DPL has been very positive.
    Contributing factors included a long history of Bank-client dialogue on sector policies and analysis,
    largely in the context of the METAP program, the strong coordinating role assumed by the MoI, the
    existence of a home-grown national strategy for the municipal solid waste sector, owned by the
    Ministries of Interior, Finance and Environment, the emphasis on the simplicity of the program
    matrix, the Government's commitment to social impact mitigation, and the broad support of the
    general public for improved solid waste management. The 2009 operation also confirmed that a solid
    waste DPL offers the value-added of bringing the multiple ministries concerned together around a
    shared policy matrix. All of these positive elements will remain in place for the Second Municipal
    Solid Waste DPL.

57. Continued coordination among ministries, national entities and municipalities is needed for
    sustained successful results. One of the major impacts of the first operation is to mainstream
    coordinated planning to support MSW reform program. This is a major milestone in the way the
    Government of Morocco will conduct business in the future not only in the solid waste sector but in
    other reform areas. The second operation has recognized this momentum and is continuing to foster
    this productive relationship among the agencies by building sustainable systems of incentives and
    support.

58. Policy reforms adopted under the first DPL may have advanced more quickly than the
    administrative procedures required to implement them. This was in particular to the allocation of
    financial support from the center to the municipalities for solid waste investments and the
    implementation of model contracts for private service-providers. The preparation of the present
    project will therefore pay attention to the implementation capacity of the relevant agencies for
    investment appraisals, financing, contracting mechanisms adopted under the 2009 DPL. The Bank is
    advising the Government on the strengthening of the Program Management Unit as well as
    supporting the preparation of an operational handbook for the PNDM.

59. Municipalities' financial and technical capacity to implement the policy reform has also come
    under the spotlight. Municipalities are benefiting from capacity-building support provided by the
    Ministry of Interior as well as the AfD, GtZ and KfW. As the focus of the solid waste management
    reforms shifts from the early reform- stage, focused on large and well-resourced cities to medium-
    sized and smaller municipalities, the planning and management of capacity-building activities will
    become increasingly important.

60. Critical "back-loading" but politically sensitive reforms as triggers for second and subsequent
    operations carry the risk of interrupting the sequence of operations. This was a lesson from the
    Morocco water and energy sector DPLs of 2007. The Second Municipal Solid Waste Sector DPL is
    aiming to avoid this risk by ensuring that the triggers for the second operation are logical extensions
    of prior actions of the first operation.



                                                    19
61. Commitment of the Government and seeing through the implementation of the reforms are key.
    More recent operations for education and public administration (2010) in Morocco have shown the
    Government of Morocco to be a savvy DPL client. It takes advantage of the analysis, planning
    framework, implementation support and convening power offered by a DPL whilst maintaining full
    leadership and ownership of the reforms themselves.

62. Reform is a continuous process and the Bank needs to ensure the sustainability of the program.
    The proposed operation will also benefit from the incorporation of lessons learned from a number of
    solid waste and municipal development projects undertaken across the Bank's regions. It is
    increasingly evident from projects (i.e. Argentina, Brazil, India, and China) that the slow rate of
    change typically characterizing reforms in the solid waste sector requires sustained support from the
    Bank. A standalone intervention in this area would not be sufficient to put in place the right
    framework and institutional ownership for the reforms to be sustainable in the long term.

          E.    ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

63. In parallel with the preparation of the proposed DPL operation, the Bank provided technical support
    and policy advisory services in many areas, including (i) municipal finance, including the
    development of a set of matrices to guide the allocation of state financial support for the
    implementation of the PNDM; (ii) a technical note on the main options to improve the financial
    sustainability of the sector; (iii) a PPIAF-funded study for the development of a strategy for private
    sector participation in the sector; and (iv) support of the MoI and Department of Environment for
    elaboration of their draft decrees, generic ToRs, operationalization of the PNDM, and a capacity-
    building program in the solid waste sector.

64. The SWM program is also supported through analytical work executed under the GtZ Environmental
    Program in Morocco (Programme de Gestion de Protection de l'Environnement, PGPE). GtZ has
    assisted in the development of the four laws on solid waste management, EIA, environmental
    protection, and air pollution. More recently, it has engaged in providing technical assistance and
    capacity building in the solid waste sector.

65. In summary, the program has an extensive analytical foundation in the form of recent sector work,
    including:

V.  THE PROPOSED SECOND MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR
DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

          A.    OPERATION DESCRIPTION

66. The proposed loan will continue supporting the Government's program summarized above and
    detailed in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 1). The development objective of the DPL
    program is to support the GoM in implementing its program of reforms aimed at improving the
    financial, environmental and social performance of the municipal solid waste sector in Morocco. The
    first DPL (DPL1) supported the key foundations of the Government's reform program, which
    established the enabling environment for an integrated and affordable municipal solid waste system.
    This second DPL (DPL2) supports capitalizing on the momentum gained during the first operation
    while deepening the reforms at the regional and municipal levels.

67. The specific benefits expected from the implementation of the reform supported by this
   operation are: (i) improved environmental and social conditions which would result from the
   progressive elimination of existing uncontrolled dumpsites and construction of sanitary landfills; (ii)
   enhanced access to waste collection services for the urban poor; (iii) reduced cost of waste landfilling
   resulting from more cost-effective planning regulations and standards; (iv) more efficient use of
   resources allocated to the solid waste sector and better targeted public subsidies to the sector; and (v)
   growth and job creation resulting from the creation of small and medium enterprises, the promotion
   of recycling and integrating informal actors such as wastepickers in an organized system.

68. Building on DPL1, the proposed second operation is justified by the need to strengthen inter-
    ministerial dialogue and preserve momentum for consolidating deeper medium-term reforms.
    The GoM is aware of the need for cross-sectoral policy dialogue between the various government
    entities and sustained commitment toward effective reform of the sector. This operation will
    contribute to structuring such commitment and to further accelerating the implementation of an
    integrated program of solid waste reforms.

69. Bank support to the implementation of sector reforms has gone through successive stages. The
    first operation has focused on establishing a national framework to implement the national policy and
    securing continued engagement of all concerned ministerial departments and national agencies. This
    second DPL focuses more closely on the policy actions needed to reach the local level, where actual
    implementation of the MSW policy, and resulting outcomes, will materialize.

          B.    PROGRAM ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE

70. The first Bank development policy operation in support of the sector reform agenda has contributed to
    tangible results in several policy areas. Over the last two years, Morocco made great progress toward
    the establishment of foundations for integrated and affordable municipal solid waste management
    systems. Beyond meeting indicative triggers for the second operation (as described in Section C
    below), progress is measurable both through additional reform actions taken by the GoM and through
    already observable outcomes. This section presents these actions and direct or indirect outcomes
    reached so far.

 AREA 1: GOVERNANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR
71. There is now a well-ingrained and effective coordination of sector policies and government
    actions within the 15-year national municipal solid waste program. This program provides an
    unprecedented national framework for government support to local authorities with quantitative
    objectives in terms of service delivery, quality, and environmental and social performance. The
    National Commission of the PNDM (CN-PNDM), established as a prior action to DPL1 (see Box 3),
    has been meeting regularly with key players on board. It systematically reviews and approves annual
    action plans that detail planned funding allocations and implementation progress of the PNDM.
                                                     21
72. Financial support to municipalities is better aligned with sector policy priorities and national
    program objectives. A result-oriented incentive mechanism is in place for the allocation of national
    financial resources, to support municipalities in establishing modern and integrated systems in line
    with the objectives of the PNDM. 77 LGs, hosting about 53 % of urban population, are being
    supported through the PNDM to professionalize their collection services and/or to upgrade disposal
    facilities. For better transparency in the treatment of funding requests, the PNDM eligibility criteria
    have been published on the SEEE website (www.minenv.gov.ma).

73. To be fully effective, coordination by the CN-PNDM is supported by a functional program
    management unit. With the technical assistance of the Bank, since early 2010 the GoM has been
    gradually reinforcing this unit and formalizing its work. A manual of procedures has been prepared. It
    details how the unit reviews funding requests from municipalities before their submission to the CN-
    PNDM, to ensure that they meet the financial, environmental and social support criteria that have
    been defined in line with national objectives. Procedures also detail how to document the workflow,
    to ensure full transparency in the treatment of requests, and to ensure a systematic and expeditious
    follow-up of both requests and on-going projects. The Government has nominated a full-time unit
    head and it is in the process of contracting out four full-time external experts (one technical and one
    financial to ensure an adequate and streamlined processing of requests, and two to provide ad-hoc
    support in the field to local governments). These experts are expected to be on board by November
    2010. To date, UGP records shows that about of 50% of MSWM projects supported under PNDM
    comply with the adopted eligibility criteria. To improve such compliance, the Minister of interior
    issued, in September 2010, a circular to LGs reminding them with the need to comply with the
    established criteria prior to claiming any financial support to upgrade their MSWM systems.

74. Beyond ensuring consistency and transparency of government actions, the program management unit
    should also progressively become a tool to accelerate deployment of the PNDM and trigger targeted
    technical assistance to municipalities to
    help them meet PNDM criteria ­ and
    hence expand and accelerate the use by
                                                     Box 3: National Commission of PNDM
    municipalities of the governmental
    incentive program.                               A National Commission (NC) was formed in 2009 to
                                                      coordinate, supervise and monitor implementation of
75. New projects are more consistent with             activities under the PNDM and the sector reform program.
                                                      Its mandate includes the following main tasks:
    better defined national regulations and
                                                       Coordinate the implementation of the PNDM and
    standards. Morocco has now almost                      propose strategic measures for the efficient execution
    completed the required legislation in the              of the reform program of the MSW sector;

    specifications for sanitary landfills                  implementation of PNDM's support activities;

    PNDM budget for FY10 for the                      Affairs, and the Fond d'Équipement Communal (FEC).
    preparation of seven provincial and
    prefectural MSW master plans. These
    three sets of administrative guidelines
                                                    22
    were key to meet the challenge of bringing down to the local level, in the form of implementable
    procedures, the national planning requirements of Solid Waste Law 28-00.

76. The regional commissions are in charge of reviewing and validating provincial and prefectural MSW
    master plans to ensure that solid waste management systems meet national regulation and standards.
    Such commissions are now established throughout the Kingdom and some of them are operational.
    This is a key step to initiating a process of decision making and consultative review, and validation of
    solid waste planning with the participation of regional government entities, professional associations
    and representatives of civil society.

77. The greatly increased clarity and visibility of the government's commitment has sent a positive
    signal to the solid waste market. The role of the private sector has kept increasing. The private
    sector now provides street cleaning and waste collection services to more than 11 million inhabitants,
    representing about 34% of the total population of Morocco, 61% of its urban population, and about
    70% of total collected tonnage. During 2009 and 2010, 15 new or renewed contracts have been signed
    with PNDM support. For MSW transfer and disposal, 10 private sector participation contracts cover
    today 8.5 million inhabitants, or about 30% of the Moroccan population and almost 50% of the urban
    population. This translates into improved service delivery in terms of quality and coverage.

78. To better align the contribution of the private sector with national objectives, new tender
    documents and model contracts have been developed to increase transparency and
    competitiveness. Three sets of model tender documents, including model contracts, were prepared by
    consultants under the PPIAF-financed study on private sector participation (see paragraph 63). A
    fourth set is being prepared. These model documents have been submitted for wide-reaching
    consultations, among municipalities, private operators, central departments, and legal experts. Each
    set corresponds to a specific contract mode: collection; disposal under a design, build, finance and
    operate contract (DBFO); disposal
    under a design, build and operate                       Box 4: New tools for local public services
    contract (DBO); and disposal under a     introduced by the 2009 amendments to the "Charte Communale"

    criteria instead of the former opaque

                                                         23
    of a new DBO option. The new DBO option provides for a significantly better balance of risks than
    the prevailing DBFO, since switching construction finance from the provider to the municipality
    ensures that the provider does not bear the financial consequences of erroneous waste flow estimates
    made at planning stage. It also relieves the private sector financially at a time when equity has
    become scarce, which levels the playing field between operators and should see prices decrease.

80. As a further positive signal to the solid waste market, amendments to the Charte Communale
    provide for new public service and PSP regulation mechanisms. With Law 54-05 (Loi sur la
    gestion déléguée), Morocco had opted for regulation by contract of the private delivery of public
    services. In the case of weaker municipalities, the absence of a regulator and a possible lack of clarity
    in the definition of responsibilities could be seen as a risk by the market. In addition to the new
    mandated model tender documents and model contracts for MSWM (described in the previous
    paragraph), that provide for clear and equitable risk sharing, the Charte Communale now grants the
    MoI extensive regulatory powers in the field of locally delivered public services (see Box 4), with
    the dual objective of ensuring national coherence (in standards, tariffs, and monitoring) and
    remedying insufficient local capacity with technical assistance, or, in the worst case, by taking over
    services.

81. Local governments have moved solid waste management up in the list of their priorities. This is
    in particular apparent in the new thematic conventions that have been developed over the last year
    between some central governments and the regions: they all place integrated MSWM, and in
    particular the improvement of disposal, among the top investment priorities. This was already
    reflected in specific conventions between the center and provinces to support 70 municipal solid
    waste projects throughout the Kingdom. During 2009-2010, eight (8) thematic partnership agreements
    (conventions de partenariat) have been signed between the central administrations targeting the
    upgrade of municipal solid waste systems.

 AREA 2: SUSTAINABILITY OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SERVICES

82. Effective tools have been put in place that should allow municipalities supported by the PNDM
    to better sustain the increasing financial burden of modernized solid waste collection and
    disposal. Despite cost efficiency improvements expected from the program, it is estimated that the
    upgrade of municipal solid waste systems in Morocco, in terms of both service quality and
    environmental performance, costs around MAD 160 per ton (US$20) for collection and MAD 100 per
    ton (US$12) for disposal. The program therefore includes several actions to reach the outcome of
    improved cost efficiency and financial sustainability in municipalities supported by the PNDM.

83. In Morocco, the waste service is funded from the municipalities' general budgets. There are no direct
    user charges in place. The "communal services tax" (TSC), traditionally understood to cover
    municipal services such as street cleaning, waste collection and street lighting, typically represents
    between 15% and 30% of total current municipal revenues. VAT transfers (30% of the country's
    VAT receipts are transferred to local governments according to a set of criteria) constitute another
    large part of current revenue, up to 35% of total revenue. In 2007, the estimated increased cost from
    modernizing solid waste systems in medium and large cities represented around 10% of municipal
    current revenue. The General Treasury has a Division dedicated to the collection of nationally-set
    local taxes, which has engaged in extensive modernization efforts to increase collection rates: through
    modern data processing techniques (including mass-mailing, multiple new modes of payment for
    local taxes including payment on-line, and direct seizures on bank accounts), collection rates have
    already increased to reach [80%] of billed amounts and [2/3] of billed accounts.

84. Growing State support, coupled with increased local tax revenue, ensure that the cost of
    modernization the MSWM systems can be covered. One of the main components of the PNDM is
    the financial support mechanism, in the form of Government funding of a dedicated account
    (corresponding roughly to the savings from reduced environmental externalities) which, as an
    incentive to modernization and for a limited period, will cover incremental costs to municipalities that
    upgrade their MSWM systems. The substantial and growing commitment by the Government to
    support the sector is evident in the financial allocation made to this mechanism: MAD 332 million for
    2010, and MAD 200 for 2009, compared to MAD 100 million in 2008. This in addition to MAD 200
    million mobilized annually through the MI (programme d'emploi de la TVA) to support mainly the
    professionalization of the collection service. Financial sustainability of the sector requires however
    that improved services remain adequately funded beyond the PNDM time span.




                                                     25
85. Recently introduced improvements to the municipal financial management framework should
    greatly contribute to medium-term financial sustainability. Since the first DPL, a new local
    government finance law has been published: Loi 45-08 d'Organisation des Finances Locales du 5
    mars 2009 (LOFL). The law is expected to contribute both to increasing revenue and to secure
    funding and payment for private sector-executed service provision contracts. In particular, the latter
    are now non-discretionary expenditures ("dépenses obligatoires") with effective budgeting and
    payment mechanisms. Provided municipal income is sufficient, these mechanisms give strong
    assurances to operators that the costs of their contracts will be covered for the whole of their duration
    (see details in box 5). Combined with the fact that almost all municipalities participating in the
    PNDM took the decision to implement their MSW modernization plans through PSP ("délégation de
    gestion"), the municipal financial management improvements ensure an adequate funding of both
    investment in new MSW infrastructure and operation services until at least the end of the newly
    signed contracts (ie 10 to 20 years in the case of new landfills), and thus provide a very strong footing
    to the medium-term financial sustainability of the initially subsidized investments.

86. However in the longer term, despite these improvements, there is still a risk of insufficient municipal
    capacity to fund the cost
                                      Box 5: Improvements brought by the new local government finance law

                                  adequate funding to municipal solid waste services by: (i) ensuring, once a PSP
    initiated the preparation of  contract is signed, mandatory budgeting and payment of amounts due to the private

87. An innovative nationwide CDM program of activities will also help municipalities mobilize
    additional financial resources, while contributing to the climate mitigation agenda. A well
    staffed and skilled unit within the Fonds d'Equipement Communal (FEC) developed this ambitious
    clean development mechanism program for the solid waste sector in Morocco. The preparation phase
    of the Program of Activities
    (PoA) is now complete: FEC                  Box 6: Improving municipal revenues through the development of
                                             a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Program of Activities (PoA)
    prepared all the CDM-
    required documentation and           The Morocco CDM PoA, which targets 13 municipal landfills in Morocco, will
    identified a first project to be     be implemented as part of the Programme National de Gestion des Déchets
    developed under the program          Ménagers et Assimilés ­ PNDM. In addition to reducing GHG emissions, the

    of the program design                investment in such projects. Each of the LFG projects, to be developed on
    documents on the UNFCC               separate landfills throughout the country, will correspond to a CDM Project
    website, in August 2010,             Activity (CPA). All CPAs will be implemented as voluntary activities by the
    officially     launched       the    municipalities, which will either construct and operate the project themselves or

    with       the     rules     and     years. The CPF has agreed to buy at least 2 million ERs over that period

    A site visit was carried out by      Coordinating Entity of the PoA. FEC is a state-owned Moroccan Bank and
    a            UNFCC-accredited        specialized in the financing of local investment projects of municipalities and
    Designated          Operational      local public institutions. FEC's mission is to support the implementation of
    Entity, or DOE, in September         national policies for local development with the provision of loans and technical
                                         assistance to municipalities. FEC will provide technical assistance for the
    2010 as part of the validation       development of individual CPAs, manage the PoA and sell the resulting ERs on
    procedure, which, in turn,           behalf of the municipalities.
    will result in the formal
    request for registration of the program under the CDM in early 2011. Once the registration milestone
    is reached, which is expected around the end of 2011, the PoA will be entitled to generate carbon
    assets, or Emissions Reductions (ERs), through the implementation of specific landfill gas capture
    and utilization activities. The first of such activities, to be implemented on the inter-municipal landfill
    of Oum Azza, has been identified and developed, and is expected to start operations in 2010. In
    addition, by signing a Seller Participation Agreement with FEC in October 2009, the Carbon
    Partnership Facility (CPF), managed by the Bank for public and private carbon investors, has
    formally marked its interest in purchasing part of the ERs that will be generated through the activities
    implemented under the CDM program of activities. Through this agreement, Morocco officially
    became the first potential seller of CERs to the CPF.

88. The CDM program of activities will provide equal opportunities to municipalities in gaining
    access to the carbon market. The program coordinated and managed by FEC, will provide a
    framework under which any interested municipality, or group of municipalities, will be able to
    develop a CDM project activity in the solid waste management sector, as long as it meets the
    eligibility criteria established by the CDM (see Box 6). By pooling similar project activities under one
    commonly-managed CDM program of activities, municipalities will be able to gain access to the
    carbon market at a relatively low cost, taking full advantage of economies of scale and keeping
    transaction costs down. Through this mechanism, municipalities will be able not only to mobilize
    additional revenues but also to gain knowledge and build capacity in the carbon finance domain. FEC
    has so far identified 13 potential sites that could join the program. The scope of the program,
    however, is not limited and will depend on the willingness of municipalities to join it. Moreover, this
    programmatic approach will be a good opportunity to showcase an innovative public-private
    partnership, which will bring together a public development bank (FEC), local authorities
    (municipalities) and the private sector (landfill operators). FEC will create the link between the
    national MSW sector and the international carbon market, by negotiating and signing Emissions

    Reductions Purchase Agreements (ERPAs) with public and private sector carbon buyers. FEC will
    also be the Focal Point for all communications with the CDM Executive Board.

89. According to estimates from the design documents, the CDM program of activity has the potential to
    reduce approximately 9.6 million tCO2e over the period 2012-2021 in 13 different landfill sites. In
    terms of potential revenues for the municipalities, and based on an average ER price of
    US$10/tCO2e, this could amount to a total of roughly US$96 million over 10 years. The CPF has
    agreed to buy at least 2 million ERs over that period.

90. The Government has not only continued capacity-building activities in the MSW sector, but has
    put them on a more secure and long-term footing. Many municipalities lack technical and
    managerial capacity to manage solid waste services, particularly to plan, contract out, supervise, and
    evaluate services. Since the first operation, the Government has included SWM capacity-building
    activities for municipalities in separate ongoing FEC-, JBIC- and GTZ-funded programs, and thus
    made progress towards the outcome of having key players, at municipal and regional level, able to
    plan and efficiently manage solid waste systems.

91. However, beyond meeting the DPL2 trigger (Continuation of this multi-year capacity-building
    program), the Ministry of Interior has recognized the particular challenge that capacity issues and
    local ownership represent to a sustainable expansion of PNDM implementation (and to achievement
    of the DPL matrix indicator targets). It has therefore decided to put capacity-building for
    municipalities in solid waste management on a more integrated, secure, and long-term footing. To do
    so, it has mandated its training department to develop and carry out an integrated multi-year capacity-
    building program targeting managerial and technical staff in charge of MSWM at municipal and
    provincial level. This program was initiated in April 2010 as part of the MoI general multi-year
    capacity-building program, one of the main components of the Government's program to support
    decentralization (Programme d'appui à la décentralisation). It will be implemented by ONEP's
    training institute under a framework procurement agreement with MoI. A first training session for
    trainers took place in June 2010. The program comprises 30 modules covering 4 main themes of
    SWM and targets, in its first year, 40 trainers, 240 LG staff and 320 elected representatives. So far,
    1635 local and regional technical and managerial officials have received training in municipal solid
    waste management and related environmental aspects i.e. EIA.

 AREA 3: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

92. A fully operational EIA system to reduce social and environmental impacts is now in place and
    effective. The GoM has successfully addressed the regulatory, administrative, technical and
    managerial deficiencies of the former EIA system which hindered direct investment and donor
    support. Under the first operation in this programmatic series, the Government had published two
    decrees that completed the legal framework for an upgraded EIA system, including regulations
    related to public consultation, and a decentralized review and validation of EIA through regional EIA
    commissions. Since the approval of the first operation, the GoM has already established and
    operationalized regional EIA committees throughout the Kingdom. 9 have held a first meeting in
    2009 and a further 2 held their first meeting in 2010. Although not all have yet forwarded activity
    reports to the SEEE, at least 4 committees have examined over 10 EIAs relative to local projects with
    investments below the MAD 200 million threshold. This promotes the involvement of local
    stakeholders in the management of the EIA system and should reduce delays in the review and
    approval of EIAs.

93. Commitment of the Moroccan government to this agenda is solid as demonstrated by the extensive
    consultation following the call made by H.M the King for (i) the definition and enactment of an
    Environmental Charter that will recognize that sustainable development must be a fundamental value
    of the Moroccan Society; (ii) that all public authorities, elected officials, and private businesses
    integrate the environmental aspect in the planning and implementation of policies and programs; and
                                                    28
    (iii) strengthen the role of public consultation and environmental and social due diligence in all areas
    of infrastructure and human development. Conditions for Public consultation continue to improve.
    Full implementation of this legal requirement requires an official inter-ministerial circular that will
    instruct local authorities and project holders on how to carry out the required payment of the fee to
    cover the cost of the public consultation.

94. Since the first DPL, the implementation of environmentally sound disposal practices has kept
    increasing. The corresponding DPL2 trigger (launch of the construction of at least three new sanitary
    landfills and closure or rehabilitation of at least three open dumpsites) focused on government action
    demonstrating the reality of the reform program, in term of upgrading the poorest segment of the
    existing MSWM systems and mitigating the related environmental and economic impacts.

95. While this target has been met, excellent progress has also been observed towards the outcome
    indicators initially set for the whole program. Indeed, municipal waste landfilling contracts already
    cover about 50% of the urban population, which should lead to exceeding the outcome indicator of
    30% of collected waste disposed of in sanitary landfills by 2011. The 2010 investment program
    approved by the CN-PNDM includes twelve further closures/rehabilitations, while the original
    outcome target was eight. On-the-ground results will provide incentive for additional municipalities
    to apply for financial support for MSW investments, increasing the momentum of reform
    implementation
    while incorporating
    lessons learned from
    initial investments.            Box 7: Broadening the social integration program: the case of the Oum Azza

    social concerns at        leachate collection system that carries by gravity the leachate to a biological
    all levels of the         treatment basin. A collection system is also used to carry rainwater into a storage
                              basin for multipurpose uses. Currently, the generated biogas is not collected,

                              waste pickers have benefited from this initiative for social inclusion. The main
    waste collection and      principles under which CARE operated were as follows: (i) made waste a resource,

    initiatives are underway in Tangier, Casablanca Rabat and Agadir. Rabat waste pickers inclusion
    initiative is the most advanced one and it covers 180 pickers.

97. To reinforce the systematic consideration of social aspects in SWM modernization projects (and
    following the benchmark action in the matrix), the GoM has decided to avail itself of the mandatory
    use of model tender documents for MSW contracts with the private sector ("gestion déléguée"
    contracts, in application of Law 54-05). These model documents, which have been finalized and
    recently adopted by the CN-PNDM, include specific provisions requiring the private sector
    contractor, possibly with the assistance of NGOs, to make proposals on social aspects, including
    sorting activities and the integration of informal workers, for inclusion in the final operation contract.
    These proposals must take into account the recommendations contained in the related environmental
    and social impact assessment and they must be evaluated as part of the award criteria.

98. Looking forward, the second PSIA, currently under preparation, will evaluate progress and
    achievements of first round actions, in particular (i) the effects of social inclusion in private sector
    contracts and partnership agreements; (ii) the extent and impact of CSO involvement; (iii) how the
    official recognition of waste picker status has influenced living, professional and health conditions;
    (iv) the social impact on poor customers of increased cost of solid waste services as a result of sector
    reforms; and (v) the social impact resulting from the transfer of service provision for solid waste from
    municipal execution ("régie") to the private sector.

          C.    STATUS OF DPL 2 TRIGGERS AND PENDING ACTIONS

99. While progress has been excellent in the first operation with the establishment of a national
    framework to implement the national policy, and with securing continued engagement of all
    concerned ministries and national agencies, this second DPL is focusing more closely on the policy
    actions needed to deepen the outreach to the local level, where actual implementation of the MSW
    policy, and resulting outcomes, materialize.

    The program policy matrix (included in Annex 3) consists of key actions based on and aligned with
    the GoM's reform program. Under the first operation, nine actions were identified as indicative
    triggers to be verified to initiate the preparation of DPL2. Their scope and rationale were described in
    the program document of the first operation, and they are summarized hereafter. Eight (8) of these
    actions have been met and there is only one indicative trigger which is delayed and thus the number
    of prior actions for DPL2 is 8 (see below). Some triggers have been reworded to improve clarity and
    specificity without changing the original spirit of the activity (see table 6).

    AREA 1 ­ GOVERNANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR:

100. Under this reform area, four indicative triggers of DPL2 have been confirmed with the objective to
    solidify and put into implementation measures undertaken under the first DPL, including:

101. The National Commission for the National Municipal Solid Waste Management Program has
    met at least twice a year in the calendar year 2009 and the calendar year 2010 to coordinate, review
    and evaluate the implementation of the National Municipal Solid Waste Management Program,
    including review and approval of progress reports and annual action plans. This action was retained to
    ensure effective and transparent coordination and consultation in preparing and adopting the annual
    PNDM work program, as well as ensuring appropriate allocation of resources mobilized under each
    annual fiscal law. A continued and sustained engagement of both line ministries and the ministry of
    finance is key in such multi-dimensional sector.

102. Two regional commissions for the review and validation of provincial and prefectural municipal
    solid waste master plans have been established and are operational This action, the first of its kind

                                                     30
    in Morocco, creates an institutional framework at local level towards effective implementation of the
    solid waste law in term of sector planning. It will ensure a consultative and decision-making process
    for the review and validation of solid waste master plans at the regional level involving local
    governmental entities, professional associations, and civil society representatives.

103. The National Commission for the National Municipal Solid Waste Management Program has
    reviewed and approved the three sets of model bidding and contracting documents and the Minister
    of the Interior has issued a circular to dispatch them and require their use. This action provides one
    of the key means to municipalities to enable them to achieve, on the ground, the program objectives
    in terms of transparency, competitiveness, and accountability for better private sector participation in
    MSW management. In addition, the minister of interior has issued, in application of law 54-05, a
    circular mandating their immediate application. These models are also available on the site of the
    Official Gazette of Local Governments (www.bocl.gov.ma).

104. The 2010 action plan for the National Municipal Solid Waste Management Program provides
    for adequate funding of the execution and mainstreaming of a communication and public
    awareness program. This action is directed toward effective implementation of the communication
    component of the PNDM, which is a necessary input into behavioral changes among the public as
    well as into establishing communications between municipal decision makers and the public
    regarding priorities, concerns, and expectations.

    AREA 2 ­ SUSTAINABLITY OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SERVICES

105. Originally, the triggers were: (i) signature by the Minister of Interior of a circular on the application
    of Article 23 of Law 28.00 on user fees (redevances) for municipal solid waste; and (ii) continued
    implementation of a multi-year capacity building program.

106. One indicative trigger could not be met on time: the signature by the Minister of Interior of a
    circular on the application of Article 23 of Law 28-00 on user fees for municipal waste. When the
    first operation was prepared, this new possibility of introducing user fees ("redevance déchets") was
    envisaged as the key tool to complement general budget revenues in order to ensure the strengthening
    of municipal financial capacity to meet the financial requirements for modern, integrated MSW.
    However the GoM and the Bank agreed that the preparation of such circular needed to be informed by
    a detailed study on sector financial sustainability (financed by KfW). In particular, the study must
    determine adequate implementation modalities of such a new revenue source (legal, social, practical,
    etc.). Although the study is on-going (see par 34), its full results are not expected before early in
    2011, after which it will require substantial discussion and consultation before concrete decision can
    be taken on its implementation.

107. On the other hand, there is a strong positive trend in overall municipal revenue. Following a
    simplification of local taxation, which reduced the number of taxes by merger of similar ones, and
    efforts in improving billing and collection, receipts from the communal services tax (TSC) increased
    from MAD 1.4 billion in 2008, to MAD 2.6 billion in 2009, and a forecast of MAD 3.4 billion in
    2010 (actual cumulated receipts as of July 2010 are 44% higher than they were in July 2009). VAT
    receipts have also shown strong growth. Overall, current revenue for urban municipalities increased
    by 17% between 2009 and 2008, and data for July 2010 showed a 19% increase over the same period
    of 2009. This is to be compared with the estimated cost of modernizing MSW systems, which
    typically represents 10% of current revenue (see Table 5 : Municipal waste service cost and budget
    data in select municipalities). A further step-up in optimizing the revenue potential of local taxes in
    Moroccan cities is expected from the implementation of the Law on local finance (45-08) and related
    Decree 2-09-441, and the modernization of the financial departments inside municipalities, with
    revised function definitions and a new financial information system.



                                                     31
108. Moreover, the recent reforms of the local government finance framework introduced new legal and
    administrative tools (see par. 79 and Box 4) to secure budgeting and payments to operators that,
    together with these improvements on the revenue side, can ensure medium-term financial
    sustainability for the modernized, integrated MSWM systems.

109. For the longer term, the Government will continue to work towards the objective of
    implementing new tools for financial sustainability. While user fees in Law 28-00 were only meant
    to complement, and not replace, existing revenue sources (and thus have become less critical since
    these existing sources have shown strong growth), they also serve other purposes not permitted under
    the current funding of MSW from general budget revenues. Namely, they (i) allow municipalities a
    degree of freedom to keep matching revenue to cost increases of the waste service (while the rate and
    basis for the TSC is set nationally); (ii) provide adequate incentives for waste reduction; and (iii)
    capture additional revenues from large producers (such as restaurants, markets, etc.). The KfW-
    financed study will determine, beyond the medium term, which new income sources (dedicated waste
    fees) are necessary or useful to ensure long-term sustainability. These recommendations may include
    alternative mechanisms to meet the sustainability objective. The Moroccan Government has
    confirmed its interest in implementing such tools provided they do not merely duplicate existing local
    taxes (which would go against the recent simplification) but apply to well-defined categories of the
    population and can be expected to have good collection efficiency.

110. Given the strategic importance of the decisions to be taken on the basis of this study, the GoM will
    involve all concerned departments early on, and in particular submit all intermediate reports to a
    broad panel including representatives of the MoI's Water and Sanitation Directorate (DEA), Local
    Finance Directorate (DFL), and Legal Directorate, of the State Secretariat for Water and Environment
    (SEEE), of the Ministry of Finance's Budget Directorate, and of the Local Finance Directorate of the
    General Treasury.

111. Overall, the Government of Morocco remains committed to its plan for sector sustainability,
    and the very significant steps outlined above demonstrate good progress towards this objective.
    The plan is as follows (see also par. 38 to 40):
       (i)    cities keep the primary responsibility of covering the majority of costs, in particular
              through their general budgets;
       (ii) the Government provides financial support (corresponding roughly to the savings from
              reduced environmental externalities) in the first 3 to 5 years of each eligible SWM
              modernization project;
       (iii) over the medium term, measures undertaken cover both the cost and revenue sides: on the
              cost side, the Government promotes inter-municipal disposal facilities and mandates the
              use of improved bidding documents and contracts; on the revenue side, the reform of local
              government finance is expected to contribute to increased resources through the
              maximization of the fiscal potential and offers new tools to secure funding and payment for
              service providers (currently 60% are private operators); additional revenues are also
              expected from the newly developed carbon finance program.
       (iv) for the long term, the general budget revenues of municipalities need to be complemented
              through a new instrument (user fees) to be defined in its details.

112. The capacity development program on municipal solid waste management has been continuing in
    the calendar years 2009 and 2010 and has been mainstreamed into a fully funded government
    training program. This action targets the managerial dimension of sector sustainability. It will
    significantly contribute to addressing the lack of managerial, technical and financial management
    capacity at the municipal level. Given the key roles being played by the private sector in providing
    services, this action will focus on strengthening municipalities to plan, manage and supervise private
    operator contracts.



                                                   32
AREA 3 ­ ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
113. Three triggers for DPL2 were identified under the environmental and social policy area.

114. Three regional EIA committees have been established and are operational. The intention of this
    action is to demonstrate the commitment of the government towards reaching a consistent and
    comprehensive framework for environmental management in general and an effective EIA process
    for the establishment of sanitary landfills in particular

115. Three partnership agreements ("conventions de partenariat") have been signed between the
    central and local governments to improve solid waste practices. This government action will
    demonstrate the reality of the reform program by the actual establishment of sanitary landfills and
    rehabilitation and closure of open dumpsites. The related quantitative target indicator reflects a
    realistic time frame and potential implementation challenges for such disposal infrastructure. On-the-
    ground results will provide incentive for additional municipalities to apply for financial support for
    MSW investments, increasing the momentum of reform implementation while incorporating lessons
    learned from initial investments.

116. The 2010 action plan for the National Municipal Solid Waste Management Program provides
    for adequate funding for extension of social inclusion programs to disposal investments supported
    by the National Municipal Solid Waste Program. This action has been selected to demonstrate the
    commitment of the government to mainstreaming social concerns into projects supported by the
    PNDM. It will ensure that the Government is concomitantly placing increasing emphasis on making
    sure that the local authorities take adverse negative impacts of the MSWM investments into account.
    Also, for the first time, the PNDM Action Plan for 2010 considers `the social dimension of the
    PNDM' as critical to the success of the reform and includes substantial resources to social issues
    resolution in selected important investment sites.

          D.    FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR BANK ENGAGEMENT

117. Through these two operations, the Bank has established itself as a valued interlocutor in the solid
    waste sector. As expressed in its Letter of Development Policy, the GoM has expressed strong interest
    for further Bank engagement to support the reform of the sector beyond DPL2. After this operation,
    the legal and regulatory framework for the national municipal solid waste strategy will largely, but
    not entirely, be in place. The next challenge will be to ensure that the Ministerial Departments of the
    Interior and the Environment and the municipalities keep developing the systems and technical,
    financial and managerial capacity to implement, monitor and regulate modernized systems. For
    instance: further development of private sector participation and consolidation of the results achieved
    so far requires mainstreaming contract management practices in municipalities; ensuring lasting
    environmental performance requires the expansion of independent audit/inspection mechanisms at
    national or local level; and as noted in paragraph Error! Reference source not found. above, long-
    term financial sustainability at municipal level, environmental supervision, monitoring and control,
    and strengthened local project preparation and management capacity will require additional measures
    to be defined and implemented. Choosing the appropriate instrument to address these challenges will
    need further discussion with both the Government and other active donors.

118. Given the effectiveness of this policy development operation in providing a clear and conducive
    national environment for the reform of a major municipal service, as well as the emerging cities and
    climate change agenda, one option the team is exploring possible broadening of the approach to cover
    reforms needed in other urban services for Morocco to meet the challenges and investment needs of
    broader urbanization. This would capitalize on the progress accomplished with all urban-related
    development policy operations (water, housing, solid waste, and urban transport) and be aligned with
    the important CPS objectives on territorial development and climate change.

VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

          A.    POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

119. The DPL program's design takes into account the results of an analysis of potential socio-
    economic impacts of solid waste management reforms. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
    (PSIA) was conducted between March and June 2008 to: (i) establish baseline data regarding the size
    of the informal solid waste sector, the characteristics of the groups and individuals involved, and the
    economic relevance of waste collection activities for their livelihoods; (ii) determine the likely
    negative and positive effects of the reforms; (iii) identify options to mitigate adverse impacts and
    maximize potential benefits; and (iv) identify the remaining analytical and data requirements for the
    proposed second DPL. The analysis benefited from inputs from decision makers at various levels as
    well as several civil society organizations, and in this sense served as a platform for stakeholder
    consultation on the objectives and broader dimensions of the reform program. This section highlights
    the main conclusions of the analysis and how they informed the policy matrix.

120. The informal system of waste collection and recycling plays an important role in the
    livelihoods of marginalized groups. The number of individuals deriving a substantial part of their
    incomes from collection on landfills is estimated at 5,500, of which 3,500 are directly involved in
    informal waste collection and recycling on landfills and 2,000 are herders. These figures are subject
    to seasonal increases related to the rate of economic growth, with individuals not normally involved
    in waste-picking attracted to the landfills by the opportunity of additional income during systemic or
    other shocks. The estimated monthly average income of a waste-picker is MAD 2,300 per month, and
    the average additional income from herding is around MAD 1,000 per month. 20 percent of active
    individuals are estimated to be women; 15 percent under 18, and 10 percent over 65. The negative

                                                    38
    social externalities of informal waste picking include impacts on children's education and adverse
    health impacts for all wastepickers.

121. Without adequate mitigation measures, the reforms risk having significant negative direct
    impacts on wastepickers and indirect impacts on other social groups and economic sectors. The
    closure of landfills without accompanying mitigation measures would translate into losses of jobs,
    income, and homes, with total welfare losses estimated at MAD 88 million per year. Experience from
    the closing of landfills in Fes, Oujda and El Jadida suggests that 20 to 30 percent of waste pickers
    normally operating on landfills seek new economic opportunities in waste collection in cities, thereby
    compounding the problem there. Between 200 and 300 families living inside the perimeter of landfills
    are estimated to lose their homes. Moreover, the consequent reduction of the volume of recycled
    material would imply additional welfare losses through extra imports on the part of industries that
    rely on informal recycling. A 15 percent reduction in the amount of recycled materials (a conservative
    estimate of those accrued from informal activities) would translate into a 30 percent increase in the
    cost of inputs, due to higher prices and taxes.

122. Any sustainable solution must begin with the sensitization of decision makers, especially at
    the local level. The analysis showed an insufficient level of awareness among local and national
    decision makers on the scope and relevance of the informal waste sector, and of the adverse impacts
    of existing reforms. Morocco's demonstrably high level of political attention to the themes of poverty
    and social exclusion offers an opportunity to remedy this situation. In addition to a range of options
    for the absorption of informal waste workers into the formal waste management system and the re-
    conversion of others into different activities, the analysis suggests a range of actions aimed at
    sensitizing decision makers and the private sector to the key issues. To this effect, the policy matrix
    includes the introduction of Environmental and Social Impact Assessment tools aimed at placing
    recognition of the role of the informal waste sector and the adverse impacts of landfill closing at the
    center of decision-making.

123. The private sector and civil society play a fundamental role in mitigating negative effects of
    landfill closings and in protecting and strengthening the economic role played by the informal
    waste sector. The PSIA suggests one mode of integration of informal waste workers into the
    operations of private solid waste contractors, based on recent successful experience with the
    reconversion of Rabat/Akreuch/Oum Azza landfill. The matrix thus requires the inclusion in the
    bidding documents and contracts for solid waste operators of provisions for the absorption of
    informal waste workers. Based on that same experience, the PSIA further outlines the role of Civil
    Society Organizations in facilitating the interface of informal waste workers with private sector
    actors, and suggesting a range of measures related to re-absorption, reconversion and schooling to be
    implemented in partnership with civil society organizations.

124. The prior action relating to the social sustainability dimension of the second operation has
    been achieved. This prior action ­ which consists in ensuring the extension of social inclusion
    programs to PNDM-supported disposal investments ­ is met by generalizing the inclusion of
    provisions on the management of the social aspects of SWM reform and investments in both model
    bidding documents and private-sector contracts. Contracts for new PNDM investment sites
    (Marrakesh, Beni Mellal, Benslimane, Khourigba) include clauses concerning the organization and
    re-absorbtion of informal waste pickers in the new investments. In the framework of a contract
    modification for the realization and management of the Casablanca landfill, (whose initial contract
    precedes the PNDM) the authorities have requested Government support in terms of financing and
    technical assistance for addressing the informal sector problem, which was included in the PNDM
    Action Plan of FY2010. For Agadir, the local authorities have requested Government assistance to
    develop a recycling center with a capacity of 130 workers. A feasibility study has been completed and
    an action plan is under preparation.



                                                    39
125. The Government is concomitantly placing increasing emphasis on making sure that the local
    authorities take adverse negative impacts of the MSWM investments into account. For the first
    time, the joint Ministry of Interior/Environment PNDM Action Plan for 2010 considers `the social
    dimension of the PNDM' as critical to the success of the reform whilst at the same time earmarking
    substantial resources (MAD 10.5 Million) to its resolution in two important investment sites
    (Casablanca and Agadir). Conscious that the sensitization and capacities of local authorities are key to
    the performance of the institutional architecture developed in the framework of the DPL1 and 2, the
    PNMD Management Unit within the Ministry of Interior is setting up a technical assistance program
    aimed at: a) supporting the development of a social action plan specific to Casablanca; b)
    strengthening the consideration of social aspects within Environmental Impact Assessment and
    Feasibility Studies; and c) supporting local authorities capacities to submit social action plans in the
    framework of their PNDM financing request.

126. A follow up PSIA financed by UNDP/Belgian Cooperation and fully owned by the
    Government is currently being finalized. The PSIA2 focuses on street picking in urban areas on
    households. Preliminary findings estimate the total population of informal street pickers in urban
    areas at 5300 nationwide. Regarding the socio-economic profile of urban waste pickers, and
    compared to the situation on landfills, the study notes the near-absence of women and a relative high
    presence of youth (13-18) but a relative absence of children on the collection segment of the chain.
    Roughly 30% of street pickers are illiterate. Revenues from street picking average around MAD 100 a
    day, with highs nearing MAD 200, placing informal wastepicking as a more profitable occupation
    than a range of formal jobs.

127. The study highlights the win-win of addressing waste picking in urban areas organically, as
    done with landfill wastepicking. First, it stresses the economic potential of the informal sector in
    terms of valorization and recycling (306000 Tons/year equal to 8,8% of total waste produced) and its
    increasing organization by formal `intermediaries' (wholesalers and small recycling industries).
    Second, the switch to private sector operators (gestion deleguée) away from public operators (gestion
    directe) foreseen by the reform program is unlikely to have substantial negative impacts on informal
    street pickers: this group normally continues to operate as before, and a conflictual relationship
    between urban street pickers and private sector operators tends to develop due to the `interference' of
    the former in collection activities. The study concludes by recommending two possible options to be
    piloted aiming at the incorporation of street pickers in formal collection activity: these options
    include: a) the organization of street pickers in cooperatives operating side by side private operators;
    and b) the organization of street pickers by a recycling firm in selective recycling at industrial level.

          B.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

128. Expected to be available by board date, the final PSIA report will be presented to the steering
    committee composed of Ministry of Interior and Environment, as well as UNDP, GTZ and the World
    Bank. The PSIA component relating to the impact of the introduction of cost recovery fees has been
    dropped, due to delays in the KfW-financed study on local financing, and the elimination of related
    measures from the policy matrix.

129. An assessment of the potential impacts of supported policies on the environment and natural
    resources was carried out, and concluded that the measures supported by the proposed program are
    likely to have significant positive effects on the environmental. The implementation of the first stages
    of the reform program has allowed significant improvements in the country's environmental
    regulatory and institutional framework. The State Secretariat (Water and Environment) within the
    Ministry of Energy, Water and Environment oversees a fully fledged environmental administration at
    the central level and recently at the regional level. The system is now essentially coherent and
    complete. The EIA process is being strengthened at the regional levels. To this effect, regional EIA
    committees have been established throughout the Kingdom and are operational. According to the
    EIA law, they review and approve impact on the environment in their regions, for projects which cost
                                                     40
    less than MAD 200 million. The operationalization of these regional committees is likely to promote
    local participation in the EIA management system and reduce delays in the review and approval of
    impact assessments. As additional confirmation of the commitment of the country to promote
    environmental sustainability, it is noteworthy that on July 31, 2009, H.M. the King of Morocco
    requested the preparation of the Environment and Sustainable Development Charter which was
    formally finalized in April 2010, which establish clearly the principles of sustainability that should
    accompany the country development agenda. As a follow up to this initiative, the preparation of an
    environmental and sustainable development framework law will be launched in the short term, in
    order to translate into the law the principles adopted in the Charter.

130. Following the enacting of its first solid waste management law (Law 28-00) in December 2006, the
    environment protection law and the EIA law, Morocco has now almost completed the required
    legislation in the municipal solid waste sector namely by issuing, the decrees related to waste
    classification, technical specifications and standards for sanitary landfills and the circulars related to
    the establishment of regional commissions for the review and validation of provincial and prefectural
    MSW master plans.

131. In parallel to the DPL preparation, the World Bank has completed a safeguard diagnostic review
    (SDR) for the use of national country systems (UCS) for EIA in the water sector. Although the DPL
    should comply with OP 8.60 while not being subjected to safeguards requirements per the World
    Bank Safeguards Policies, it was found useful and appropriate to initiate early in 2008 an analysis of
    the environmental and social implication of the policy reforms being supported by the DPL under the
    format of a SDR, which is the tool used for assessing the equivalence and acceptability of the country
    systems compared, in the case of environmental assessment, to a set of principles defined in the
    Operational Policy 4.00.

132. An SDR process has been initiated for the waste sector in 2008 and will be completed as part of the
    CDM program to be implemented by the FEC. The initial findings of the SDR determined that the
    Moroccan EIA laws and regulations are generally equivalent to the Objectives and Operational
    Principles of OP 4.00 and that the application of these laws and regulations are also in conformity
    with this policy in the waste sector. Some initial gaps related in particular to public consultation have
    since then been bridged which allowed the successful completion of the SDR in the water sector
    mentioned above. The issue of capacity within the new institutional set-up has also been raised as a
    potential gap but the Government has taken credible steps to fill that gap by reiterating its
    commitment through the recently adopted Environment Charter. A detailed and comprehensive
    manual on EIA review and approval was issued to the Regional Committees for use and a
    comprehensive training program is being implemented with GTZ support.

133. In particular, further areas for improvement would be the following: (i) increase the availability of
    technical staff and resources for the regional EIA committees to review EIA reports, (ii) systematize
    public consultation in accordance with the EIA law # 12-03 and disclose information on EIA reports,
    (iii) ensure the systematic monitoring and enforcement of EIA mitigating measures at the national and
    local levels

134. Potential positive effects: Main positive effects include (i) improvements in public health through
    proper collection, transport and disposal of municipal solid waste; (ii) decreased potential
    contamination of groundwater (aquifer) and surface contamination from waste leachate; (iii) pollution
    reduction from on site burning of waste; (iv) improved waste management with a special focus on
    waste treatment and disposal in sanitary landfills; (v) protection of the global environment though
    methane capture and (vi) empowerment of municipalities as implementers of integrated municipal
    solid waste management.

135. Furthermore, the positive contribution of the proposed operation is the mainstreaming of
    environment and social dimension into the solid waste management sector as well as mainstreaming
                                                     41
    the global environment into the local environment through the operationalization of the Clean
    Development Mechanism in the waste sector. More specifically, the third pillar under the DPL is
    exclusively an environment and social related policy area. It has established standard TORs for EIAs
    that will be used by all operators, and requires that the environment and social mitigating plans are
    included into the solid waste management contracts and will also ensure that the social programs for
    waste pickers are being implemented in accordance with the PSIA.

136. The program is also supporting the development of the first program of CDM activities in solid
    waste sector in Morocco. In addition to significantly reducing GHG emissions compared to the
    emissions that would occur in the absence of the proposed activities and contributing to Morocco's
    climate change mitigation efforts, the program will generate local environmental and socio-economic
    benefits through the promotion of an integrated MSW management approach. In terms of
    environmental benefits, the destruction of landfill gas will contribute to (i) the reduction of local air
    pollution in and around landfill sites, (ii) the control of safety hazards and public health risks
    associated with municipal waste disposal in open and uncontrolled dumps, (iii) the minimization of
    LFG migration and associated risks of fires and explosions in landfill sites' neighboring areas, and
    (iv) the displacement of fossil-fuel based electricity generation by a renewable source, i.e., biogas
    from municipal waste. The socio-economic benefits of the program are associated with (i) an
    improvement of the quality of life of the communities living close to the landfill sites, (ii) capacity
    building for the development of clean technology projects in Morocco, (iii) greater awareness in
    sustainable development practices, and (iv) creation of short and long term employment opportunities
    to install, operate and maintain LFG systems.

137. Potential negative effects: The above-mentioned environmental and social benefits of these DPL-
    supported reforms are expected to overwhelmingly exceed potential negative effects. These effects
    are not expected to be substantial, but would be related to the risks of inappropriate operation of
    waste facilities supported under the PNDM. For example, the GoM is aware of potential negative
    effects and is working on measures and actions to mitigate them. The GoM has established specific
    criteria for providing financial incentives to the municipalities. These incentives are based on the
    principles of equity and transparency for environment and social protection. In order to benefit from
    the financial incentives, each municipality will: a) prepare an EIA in accordance with the standard
    TORs; b) agree to close the illegal dumps upon the beginning of operation of the landfill, and; c)
    implement the social measures for waste pickers. Furthermore, the DPL supports the financing by the
    Government of training for EIA, review and approval, monitoring and follow up of environment and
    social mitigating measures. On the basis of these measures, the assessment concluded that GoM
    demonstrates that potential negative effects will be addressed in a satisfactory manner.

          C.    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

138. Implementation and coordination responsibilities: The same arrangements that have been put in
    place for the first operation will apply for the proposed operation, including the following
    implementation and coordination mechanisms:

        The Steering Committee for the Municipal Solid Waste Sector DPL will continue to oversee loan
        coordination at the ministerial level.
        The National Commission for the PNDM, will be responsible for the coordination, review, and
        evaluation of the solid waste sector reform program and the PNDM. The National Commission is
        led by the Secretary of State in charge of Water and Environment and includes representatives of
        the MoF, MoI, SWE, the MAEG, and the FEC. The National Commission will in particular
        ensure progress reporting and schedule management, action documentation, inter ministerial
        coordination, and proactive corrective action on non-progress actions. The National Commission
        will also be responsible for communication with the Bank supervision team.


                                                     42
        The Program Management Unit established within the DGCL will be in charge of day-to-day
        management of the PNDM.

139. Supervision by the Bank: Supervision missions will allow the Bank to continue providing policy
    advice and technical assistance to the institutions involved in the implementation of the sector's
    program of reform. An ICR will be prepared six months after the closing date of the proposed
    operation. The closing date of the proposed date is June 30, 2011.

          D.    FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

140. Financial Management Diagnostics and Risk Rating: The Morocco's public finance system is
     governed by a well-developed legal and regulatory framework that provides assurance in terms of
     reliability and transparency. The Morocco system is based on the principle of segregation of
     responsibilities and separation of the roles between the payment authorizer (ordonnateur) and public
     accountant, and on the principles governing ex ante expenditure control and internal and external
     audits. Under the DPL instrument, used to execute the Second Municipal Solid Waste Sector
     Program, the Government financial management system including treasury and controls will be
     relied upon to channel the loan proceeds to the budget system and thereafter to the final
     beneficiaries. The overall fiduciary risk under this operation is rated as "Low" based on the review
     conducted during the preparation of the proposed DPL.10 The rating is due in large part to the steady
     and continued Government efforts and major reforms implemented to modernize and improve the
     efficiency and transparency of the public sector, including the public financial management (PFM)
     system.

141. In response to a Government request, the Bank prepared and issued a 2007 Country Financial
     Accountability Assessment (CFAA), following the 2003 CFAA. The experience gained by the Bank
     in Morocco and the key findings of the 2007 CFAA report reflected that Moroccan public finance
     system is governed by a well-developed legal and regulatory framework, and generally provides
     assurance in terms of reliability and transparency. Despite the low fiduciary risk identified by the
     CFAA, the report did recommend improvements in a number of areas; including: (i) reducing the
     delays to produce the year-end government financial statements and accounts, as well as reducing the
     time frame needed by the Court of Accounts, being the government external auditor, to audit the
     government financial statements; (ii) further simplification of the priori internal controls while
     continue the strengthening of the ex-post controls and of the internal audit already in place; and (iii)
     continuing the automation of the public financial system through further deployment of the
     management information system.

142. Looking forward, after the 2007 CFAA, the Government aimed at sustaining implementation
     progress in the PFM reforms agenda especially in areas with importance in the fiduciary context
     towards increased budget transparency. Progress in implementing the Public Administration Reform
     Program has been broadly on track, surpassing plans in certain areas while being slow in other areas.
     Hence, in the area of budget management, the Government has: (i) introduced budget flexibility
     norms that have facilitated transfers among resources among 30 ministries that represent above 90
     percent of non-wage expenditures; (ii) completed aggregate and sector Medium-Term Expenditure
     Frameworks (MTEFs) in 12 ministries, with generalization of the MTEF to the other ministries
     being in progress; (iii) introduced performance budgeting (with explicit performance indicators) in
     22 ministries, with extension to other ministries under way; and (iv) completed a study to reform
     control of public expenditure, which has led to the elimination of priori control duplications and the
     merger of the two directorates involved, thereby contributing to reducing paperwork and time by



10
  Among the background documents reviewed were the 2009 PEFA; The World Bank 2007 CFAA and the Audit
reports of the Central Bank of Morocco.
                                                     43
     about half and making public expenditure processing more efficient. The Government is already
     engaged in all of the above areas and intends to enhance budget transparency and anti-corruption
     policies, while improving accountability in delivering services, through the introduction of e-
     government and further simplification of procedures.

143. Another important achievement under the PFM reforms relates to the timely preparation and
     submission to the Parliament of the Annual Budget Execution Reports (ABER). Preparation delays
     have been significantly reduced during the last few years and all the overdue ABERs (those of 2003-
     2006) have been remitted to Parliament by the end of 2008. While the 2007 and 2008 ABERs were
     finalized and submitted to parliament by end of the FY 2009 rendering the accounts up to date.

144. Moreover, the recent diagnostic completed in 2009 under the Public Expenditure and Financial
     Accountability Framework (PEFA) allowed for a detailed assessment of the progress and
     achievements in the performance of the Moroccan public financial management system. The purpose
     of using the PEFA tool was to measure Morocco's PFM performance during the 2005-2007 period
     against international standards in five Public Financial Management (PFM) areas: budget credibility,
     budget comprehensiveness and transparency, predictability and control in budget execution, accounting
     recording and reporting, external scrutiny and audit, and also, donor practices regarding the predictability
     of international aid funds and use of national procurement procedures to manage them. The PEFA
     findings provide an overall positive assessment of the PFM system in Morocco. The result of the
     analysis contributed to the Government's reform process by providing information on the extent to
     which reforms are yielding improved performance. The results based on the PEFA ratings indicate
     that Morocco has an overall credible, comprehensive, and transparent budget.

145. The findings reflected that Substantial progress has been made in the regulation, administration, and
     management of taxes and customs duties. Fiscal obligations have been clearly codified and
     explained. However there is still a need to strengthen computer capability in the tax offices and at
     customs, and to upgrade the hardware in order to facilitate monitoring and control. Significant
     improvements were realized during the period reviewed in the implementation, frequency, and
     methods for internal audit. Complete, good quality budget execution reports are regularly produced;
     however while reduced in 2008, delays remain in the preparation of annual financial statements and
     accounting data categories for recording State assets and liabilities. The General Auditor's Office
     (Cour des Comptes) is fully engaged in its role as external auditor of the management and use of
     public funds. The frequency and scope of its audits are steadily increasing, follow-up of its
     recommendations still needs improvement.

146. There are nevertheless areas which require dedicated attention. These include: (i) improvement of
     the budget classification, since despite the level of detail, accuracy, and reliability, it does not yet
     allow for reliable direct tracking of program-related spending being financed under priority
     programs; (ii) progress in systematic recording of procurement complaints and the following on such
     complaints; (iii) strengthen internal audits as current practice leads to scattered information and limited
     transparency as the reports of the Inspector General (IGF) and the ministerial inspectors general (IGM)
     are not made public; and (iv) improvement of the external audit as the Court of Accounts' external audit
     reports are submitted for review with noticeable delays. Furthermore as of 2007 none of the Court's
     observations in its activity or audit reports seems to have led to any investigative hearings (auditions
     approfondies) before Parliament who has the authority to question the ministers or administrators
     concerned.

147. Funds Flow. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
     policy support. Once the loan is approved by the World Bank's board and becomes effective, the
     proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated release conditions as defined
     in the Development Policy Loan Agreement and in a single installment.



                                                       44
148. Morocco has had no safeguard assessment, related to the foreign exchange control environment at
     the Central bank, by the IMF. The Government budget is comprehensive, unified and subject to
     centralized treasury account. Cash flow and debt are well managed by the Treasury Department of
     the Ministry of Finance under generally satisfactory conditions. Moreover, the Central Bank is
     audited on yearly basis with the audit report being disclosed publicly. These audits and the auditor
     opinions did not reflect any weaknesses in the control environment and the auditor's opinions were
     issued with no qualifications.

149. To address the fiduciary risks in the foreign exchange control environment, Loan proceeds will be
     deposited in a government dedicated account at the Central Bank and the equivalent of the funds in
     local currency will be transferred to the Treasury current account being the government budget
     account. The Ministry of Finance will then furnish to the Bank a confirmation of this transfer and
     advising that the total sum of the loan has been received.

          E.    DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

150. The loan proceeds will be deposited by the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development
     (IBRD) in a dedicated account opened by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the Central
     Bank of Morocco (Bank Al Maghrib), upon submission of a signed withdrawal application. The
     Borrower should ensure that upon the deposit of loan proceeds into said account, an equivalent
     amount, in the local currency, is credited to the treasury current account at the Central Bank.

151. The Borrower will report, within a week, to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign
     currency account and credited to the budget management system. If the proceeds of the loan are used
     for ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the
     Borrower to promptly upon notice refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IBRD.
     Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The loan proceeds will be
     administered by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF).

                             Bank Account               at - CBM




152. Auditing. Although an audit of the use of the funds may not be required, IBRD reserves the right to
     ask for a transaction audit. This audit, when asked for, will cover the accuracy of the transactions of
     the dedicated account, including accuracy of exchange rate conversions; confirming that the
     dedicated account was used only for the purposes of the operation where no other amounts have been
     deposited into the account. Also the auditor will have to obtain confirmation from corresponding
     bank(s) involved in the funds flow regarding the transaction. The time period for submission of the
     audit report to the Bank is 6 months from the date a request for such audit is issued.

          F.    RISK AND RISK MITIGATION

153. The risk environment is substantially the same as for the 2009 operation, for which 3 main risks were
     identified:

154. Commitments to the reform and implementation capacity risks. The quality of the Bank-client
     dialogue during 2009-10 and progress made towards the prior actions for the second operation
                                              45
     indicate that reform commitment remains robust. However, the spotlight is moving onto
     implementation capacity as a potential risk to the achievement of the national solid waste
     management program's objectives. More specifically, implementation progress will depend on the
     systematization of procedures for the allocation of financial support to municipalities, the capacity of
     municipalities to manage investments and service outsourcing (and in particular the capacity of
     medium-sized and smaller municipalities), and the central government's monitoring arrangements.
     This potential risk is mitigated by Government's strong commitment to (i) scale up and mainstream
     the solid waste capacity building activities within the Government program to support
     decentralization at municipal level, and (ii) mobilize appropriate financial and human resources to
     support the management of the program at national and local levels.

155. Social acceptance risk, namely the risk that the reforms will be unacceptable to the general
     public and to wastepickers. So far the public profile of the solid waste reforms has been fairly low.
     However, there remains a risk of an adverse reaction to the transfer of collection service employees
     from the public to the private sector and to the future introduction of new sources of municipal
     revenue. Early signs indicate that pilot projects implemented so far for the re-employment of waste
     pickers are proving successful. This potential risk is mitigated through the Government's decision to
     create a specific line item within the national solid waste program's 2010 budget to expand these
     pilots and the mandatory requirement for operators to cover social aspects in future contracts.

156. The possibility of municipalities' resisting the solid waste reforms was identified as a minor
     risk for the 2009 operation initially, to be mitigated by the allocation of targeted financial support.
     However, concerns remain that the incremental cost of the required investments may prove too high
     for some municipalities. For example, the annualized payments from the Solid Waste Support
     Program to municipalities may not be enough to finance up-front capital investment in improved
     waste sites and the financial implications for medium-sized and smaller municipalities may prove
     particularly daunting. The magnitude of this potential risk is being addressed through the ongoing
     KFW funded study on institutional and financial aspects, and the government is fully committed to
     tailor its financial support to small and poor local governments if needed. In the longer term, the
     progressive shift of financial responsibility from government budgets to municipal taxpayers may
     weaken municipalities' commitment to improved solid waste management practices. This potential
     risk is mitigated by the Government's strong commitment to proceed with the envisaged municipal
     finance reforms. Efforts are underway from both cost reduction and revenue generation perspectives
     ranging from short to medium and long term time frames. Inter-municipal cooperation and
     regionalization of solid waste disposal facilities will also help especially small municipalities to take
     advantage of the significant economies of scale in waste management.

Kingdom of Morocco
Office of the Prime Minister

                                                                           November 15, 2010

Mr. Robert B. Zoellick
President of the World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, DC
U.S.A.

Subject: Letter of Development Policy related to the Municipal Solid Waste Sector in Morocco

Mr. President:

         I am pleased to reiterate herein the terms of the letter dated February 12, 2009, informing you of
the municipal solid waste sector reform program, one of the priorities of the Government of Morocco, as
well as the measures adopted to ensure its implementation with technical and financial assistance from the
World Bank and other donors.

        Indeed, the Government of Morocco has taken the initiative to outline and implement a program
based on clear and ambitious goals, with the aim of eliminating the lag noted in this sector relative to the
average in countries with a comparable level of economic and social development. This initiative is
based on the objective expressed on many occasions by His Majesty King Mohammed VI to ensure that
Morocco's environment is healthy and sustainable. This program, the preparatory phase of which was
launched in 2006, is aimed at improving governance in the waste sector, enhancing the financial
sustainability of municipal solid waste management, and incorporating the social and environmental
considerations into the planning and implementation of projects intended to upgrade the sector. The
specific objective is to improve the financial, environmental, and social performance of Morocco's
municipal solid waste sector.

        This program is designed and intended to meet the following needs, among others:

                 Achieving the professionalization of the sector, one of the strategic thrusts, with the aim
                 of enhancing the quality and efficiency of the service;

                 Clarifying rules and making actors accountable in order to promote the partnership
                 between the central government and local governments and establish a clear technical and
                 managerial frame of reference;

                 Establishing the framework for the reform program and setting forth targeted and
                 rigorous incentives to enable the State to provide effective support to the sector;

                 Reducing market risks and guaranteeing the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of the
                 service by improving, inter alia, public-private partnerships (PPPs) in this area, including
                 procurement procedures and documents and building the capacity of local governments
                 to better manage the private sector participation (PSP) process; and

                 Improving the environmental and social performance of the sector.


                                                     58
       The Ministries of the Environment and Interior are jointly supervising, coordinating, and
monitoring the implementation of this program.

    I.      OVERVIEW OF THE SITUATION IN THE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR
            AND MAIN THRUSTS OF THE PROGRAM


        In 2008, Morocco produced approximately 5 million metric tons of municipal solid waste per
year in urban areas and will produce up to 6.2 million metric tons by 2020. In 2008, only close to 70
percent of waste produced in urban centers was collected and less than 10 percent of the waste collected
was disposed of in sanitary landfills. A large percentage of this waste ended up in open dumpsites.

       The situation created by the existence of more than 3,500 waste pickers at open dumpsites, some
of whom are children, also made intervention by the public authorities urgent.

        Moreover, deficiencies in the management of this sector were largely attributable to institutional,
legal, managerial, and financial constraints, in particular:
                A deficient legal and institutional framework that impedes effective governance of the
                sector;
                Services that are not very cost effective and uncertainty surrounding the long-term
                financial viability of the sector; and
                An urgent need for integrated and modernized solid waste management systems in order
                to mitigate the economic, environmental, and social effects of the current systems.

To address these deficiencies, the Government has, since the launching of the sector reform program,
undertaken a series of actions aimed at developing and upgrading the municipal solid waste sector,
including:

  The publication in December 2006 of Law 28-00 on waste management. This law reflects the clear
 political will to improve waste management in general and solid waste management in particular, by:
                Affirming the primary responsibility of municipalities for municipal solid waste
                management;
                Introducing integrated solid waste management planning tools at the national, regional,
                and local levels;
                Imposing on municipalities the obligation to obtain the resources and infrastructure for
                waste disposal, treatment, recovery, and recycling; and
                Introducing a new cost recovery instrument for waste services, including the possibility
                of establishing a solid waste management (SWM) fee.

  The drafting in 2007 of a National Municipal Solid Waste Program [PNDM]. This program is aimed
 at upgrading municipal solid waste management by 2021. The total cost of the program is estimated at
 DH 37 billion (approximately US$4 billion) over a 15-year period and covers all segments of the
 chain-- from collection to treatment. More specifically, the program is aimed at assisting urban
 municipalities with:
                Professionalizing solid waste services;
                Improving access to collection services by increasing the percentage of waste collected in
                urban areas to 90 percent by 2015 and 100 percent by 2020;
                Eliminating the lag noted in the treatment of solid waste by disposing of all municipal
                solid waste in sanitary landfills by 2020 (one landfill at most per province) and increasing
                the recycling rate to 20 percent by 2015;

                                                    59
                Closing/rehabilitating 300 existing open dumpsites in parallel with the construction of
                new sanitary landfills; and
                Building awareness and providing training to the actors affected by the municipal solid
                waste problem.


                  The October 2007 government declaration placed the problem of solid waste
                  management, and in particular municipal solid waste treatment, among the
                  priorities requiring government action both in terms of assistance to local
                  governments and environmental protection and sustainable development. This
                  political will was reflected in the establishment in the 2007 budget law of an
                  earmarked account called the National Environment Fund [Fonds National pour la
                  Protection et la mise en valeur de l'Environnement]. Its "use of funds program"
                  [programme d'emploi] includes a line item pertaining to the "Contribution to the
                  National Municipal Solid Waste Program." An envelope of DH 300 million was
                  allocated for this purpose in 2008, with DH 100 million coming from the general
                  budget and DH 200 million, from the VAT program.

        At the same time, at the local government level, a commendable effort was made to improve the
        professionalization of municipal solid waste collection services. Most large and mid-sized towns,
        in particular Rabat, Casablanca, and Tangiers, have carried out projects to professionalize
        collection services. In 2008, as a result of work already done, approximately two-thirds of
        collection services were provided by private operators hired by municipalities through delegated
        management contracts [contrats de gestion déléguée]. Annual expenditure, at the national level,
        for collection and clean-up services by private operators in urban municipalities stood at
        approximately DH 1.2 billion in 2008.


    II. PROGRESS MADE WITH ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DPL
Since the start of the PNDM in 2008, significant progress has been registered, with the support of the
World Bank through the 2009 First Municipal Solid Waste Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL1) and
the second DPL, discussed in this Letter. This progress, the focus of which is governance issues in the
municipal solid waste sector, the sustainability of municipal solid waste management services, and
environmental and social issues, is described in the sections below.


    A. Governance of the Municipal Solid Waste Sector

    1. Promoting Consistency and Transparency in Government Actions in the Municipal Solid Waste
       Management Sector
In order to ensure the sectoral planning and coordination of reforms, the monitoring and evaluation of the
status of PNDM execution, and the status of the reform program as a whole, a National Commission for
the National Municipal Solid Waste Program (CN-PNDM) was established in January 2009.
This Commission outlined and adopted eligibility and allocation criteria for government subsidies, with
the aim of supporting solid waste management operations and investments in this sector, in the context of
State support for local governments to upgrade their municipal solid waste management systems and to
facilitate achievement of the objectives of Law 28-00.
    2. Progress Made with the Application of Law 28-00

In order to adhere to the principle of the deconcentration of waste management enshrined in Law 28-00
and establish a consistent technical frame of reference, two decrees adopted in January and July 2010,

                                                   60
respectively, set forth the procedures for elaborating a MSW provincial or prefectural master plan, along
with the administrative procedures and technical standards for MSW landfilling.

Based on the same approach, provincial or prefectural commissions responsible for the review and
validation of master plans were created in 17 prefectures and provinces (Tétouan, Mohammedia, Kénitra,
Chichaoua, Khouribga, Al Hoceima, Berkane, Essaouira, Tiznit, Taroudant, Taourirt and Jerada, Sidi Ifni,
Safi, Taounate, Oujda, and Larache).

    3. Improving the Transparency and Competitiveness of Private Sector Participation

In the context of application of Law 54-05 regarding delegated management, standard bidding documents
including model contracts for the delegated management of collection/street cleaning services and
disposal of waste were prepared. These bidding documents reflect international good practices in the
areas of procurement, balanced contractual relations, and consideration of social issues. These model
documents, which can be obtained on the website of the Official Gazette of Local Governments [Bulletin
officiel des Collectivités Locales] (www.bocl.gov.ma) and are permanently available on the website of the
State Secretariat for Water and Environment (www.minenv.gov.ma), were transmitted to local
governments for immediate application by means of a circular issued by the Ministry of Interior.

    4. Encouraging Public Involvement and Improving Local Decision Making

In recognition of the importance of communication in ensuring ownership and changes in the behavior of
the actors concerned, a national communication and public awareness program was developed, with a
budget allocation of DH 3 million being made in 2010 for implementation of this program.

    B. Sustainability of Solid Waste Management Services

    1. Providing Assistance to Local Governments to Improve the Financial Equilibrium of the Service

The problem of the financial sustainability of the waste management service is central to the reform
program. To this end, the Government has started to implement a plan targeting solid waste management
sustainability in the short, medium, and long term. This plan revolves around the following measures:

    (a) The Government has pledged to implement a targeted financial incentive mechanism intended to
        help municipalities cope, in the short term, with the additional expenses associated with the
        immediate requirements to be met under the PNDM. Consequently, adequate funding was
        allocated to PNDM financing, in the amount of DH 300 million in 2008, DH 400 million in 2009,
        DH 532 million in 2010. The direct contribution of the Ministry of Interior through the VAT
        fund should be added to this envelope.

    (b) Increasing the tax revenue of municipalities and thus their capacity to meet the cost of improved
    waste management

     As part of the reform of the local tax system (Law 47-06), the Government organized the
     municipal tax administration into three units (tax base, oversight, and collection), which should
     more likely ensure that municipalities gain a better understanding of the local tax potential, and
     thus improve productivity of the tax system in municipalities and their financial capacity.

     Moreover, it is especially important to note that the Local Tax Directorate of the General
     Treasury, which is tasked with collecting local taxes determined by the State (the municipal
     services tax, the housing tax, and business taxes), introduced modernization measures aimed at
     increasing the collection rate of these taxes. An effort to ensure the general application and use of
     modern data processing techniques (mass mailing, an increase in the number of available

                                                    61
         payment methods, and the possibility of direct deductions from bank accounts) has already helped
         increase collection rates, which currently stand at 80 percent of billed amounts and pertain to 66
         percent of taxpayers, thus contributing to the sharp increase in own resources for local
         governments, as illustrated by the increase in revenue generated from the municipal services tax,
         which jumped from DH 1.4 billion in 2008 to DH 3.4 billion in 2010 (projection).

     (c) A study on the financial sustainability of municipal waste management is under way. This study
     is expected to develop tools for the application of Article 23 of Law 28-00 on solid waste fees. More
     generally, this study seeks to identify ways to strengthen the capacity of municipalities to meet the
     costs associated with the modernization of waste management services. In light of the importance of
     this study, owing in particular to its financial and institutional implications, the various relevant
     departments will be involved in the validation of its findings and recommendations at all stages of the
     study, with a view to prompt application.

     (d) In order to help local governments mobilize additional funds from the international carbon
     market, the Fonds d'Equipement Communal [FEC] was selected as the coordination entity for the
     CDM program of activities in the solid waste sector. In this context, the FEC prepared an innovative
     program of activities for carbon finance. This program will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions
     through biogas capture in public landfills, and through flaring or recycling of this biogas to produce
     electric energy, while generating carbon credits that can be sold on the international market, under the
     Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The descriptive documents relating to the program of
     activities, the first CDM project for the Oum Azza landfill, and the CDM project for the Oujda
     landfill were:

      Developed in accordance with the procedures and modalities established by the CDM Executive
      Board;
      Approved by the Designated National Authority (DNA); and
      Published by the validator on the website of the United Nations Framework Convention on
      Climate Change.

     The validation process for the program of activities and projects for the CDM was launched in
     September 2010.

2.   Strengthening of the Technical Capacities of Local Governments to Improve Solid Waste
     Management

The Government mobilized national and international actors to implement a capacity-building program
for local governments.
In this context, training sessions on landfill management were organized with German Cooperation in
Tangiers and Tétouan.

A training program related to the environmental considerations was also launched in October 2010 with
German Cooperation (GTZ) by the department responsible for the environment. The first phase of this
three-year program (2011­2013) entails capacity building of local governments, enhancing the skills of
actors responsible for waste management, as well as the development of a national strategy for basic and
continuing training in environmental occupations in general, and integrated waste management in
particular. An international expert was hired by the GTZ to develop this program and draft a specific
action plan in consultation with all the relevant actors, particularly the local governments.

In addition, the PNDM Project Management Unit (PMU), which was established within the Ministry of
Interior (DEA), is responsible for identifying and programming projects, and for the monitoring, post
evaluation, and classification of these projects, taking into account eligibility criteria selected by the

                                                     62
Moroccan party and the World Bank, as well as financial sustainability mechanisms for local
governments and their associated groups.

The PMU assists local governments with the steps to prepare bidding documents for professionalizing the
management of their services, in particular the development of preliminary studies, consultation
regulations, and standard technical specifications. In 2010, the PMU provided technical support to the
authorities in Mehdia, Ouled Frej, and Bouznika, the Albay'A group in Nouacer, and the neighboring
municipalities of Imntanout, Taourirt, Chichaoua, Benslimane, Chefchaouen, Marrakech, Mohammedia,
Nador, Loualidia, Khemisset, Tiflet, Sidi Allal El Bahraoui, and Rommani.

With a view to providing assistance to the PMU and local governments, a bid for the recruitment of two
experts for the PMU and four experts for the local governments was launched in September 2010.
These programs supplement the multiyear training for trainers program launched by the Ministry of
Interior for local governments, to improve waste management services training in municipalities.

C.       Environmental and Social Considerations

1.      Upgrading and Operationalizing the EIA System at the National and Regional Levels
The Government has introduced a raft of preventive and corrective measures to mitigate the negative
effects on the environment and on socioeconomic development caused by current waste disposal
practices, namely:

      The publication of two decrees pertaining to (i) the responsibilities and functioning of the
      Environmental Impact Assessment National Committee and Regional Committees, and (ii) the
      methods for organizing and conducting the public survey related to projects requiring an EIA and
      its implementing order; and
      A joint circular issued in March 2009 by the Minister of Interior and the Secretary of State for
      Water and Environment to establish EIA regional committees, with signing authority delegated to
      the Wali. A total of 16 regional committees were established and are in operation. They are
      carrying out their responsibilities, particularly with respect to the review and approval of EIAs in
      their regions, for projects costing under DH 200 million.

2.       Improving the Environmental Performance in the Solid Waste Sector

The quantitative objectives of the PNDM for 2012--at least 30 percent of collected waste disposed of in
sanitary landfills and the closing of at least eight open dumpsites--are well on the way to being achieved
in 2010 and, in particular, open dumpsites have already been rehabilitated in the municipalities of Fez,
Tétouan, Oujda, Essaouira, Témara, El Jadida, Mohammedia, Benslimane, and Bouznika.

The improvement of the EIA system also facilitated the acceptance of several sanitary landfill projects. It
bears noting at this juncture that the improvement of this system provided benefits that went well beyond
the solid waste sector and contributed in particular to the preparation of the first World Bank-financed
project in Morocco based on the Use of Country System (Oum-Rbiaa sanitation project).

3.       Improving the Social Performance of the Solid Waste Sector

With a view to improving the social performance of the solid waste sector, the CN-PNDM defined and
adopted principles for the inclusion of social considerations, which extends to planning and decision-
making mechanisms, accountability of municipalities or groups of municipalities, accountability of
operators, a participatory approach, and awareness building and training related to the social aspects of
the PNDM.


                                                    63
The social integration of waste pickers is currently stipulated in agreements relating to the implementation
of the PNDM. In addition, clauses on the social aspects have been incorporated into contracts for landfill
projects in Agadir and Casablanca. Beneficiary waste pickers could number between 100 and 150 by
2010.

Drawing on the pilot experience of the Oum Azza landfill, whose waste pickers are benefiting from the
social inclusion initiative, similar initiatives are being developed in the municipalities of Tangiers,
Agadir, and Casablanca.


III.       PROGRESS MADE TO DATE UNDER THE DPL1 AND THE DPL2 AND
           PROSPECTS

The program has been successfully implemented and, in a number of cases, targets have even been
exceeded, judging by the level attained by the most important indicators, namely:

     Strong ownership by local governments of the PNDM objectives as 70 professionalization
     projects have been launched since 2008;
     Implementation of an incentive mechanism to support the process to modernize the municipal
     solid waste management system--DH 532 million in 2010. Some 77 local governments have
     received support since the launch of the PNDM;
     At the same time, the reform of the tax system led to a sharp increase in municipal tax revenues,
     from DH 1.4 billion in 2008 to DH 2.6 billion in 2010 for urban municipalities;
     An extremely positive impact on the market; service is currently being provided by private firms
     (collection/clean-up) to 60 percent of the urban population, with a marked improvement in
     service quality;
     Contracts signed for the construction of sanitary landfills cover over 50 percent of the urban
     population;
     A decentralized and operational EIA system, with 20 EIAs reviewed in Wilayas.

The Government is nevertheless cognizant of the fact that achievement of the final objectives of this
program is a long-haul endeavor, and remains fully committed to the attainment of these long-term
objectives. In order to meet the 2020 targets (see Section 1 above), the remaining areas in need of
strengthening are as follows:

           Consolidation of the achievements of the reform process at the national level through greater
           ownership, at the local level, in the areas of governance of the solid waste sector, the
           sustainability of this sector, and the inclusion of social and environmental considerations in
           MSWM projects;
           The sustainability of the achievements of the reform of the solid waste sector through
           communication and training in particular;
           The evaluation and improvement of the outcomes of the reform of the solid waste sector during
           the course of its implementation, while harmonizing it with the other works projects related to
           environmental protection;
           The introduction of new instruments to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector and
           improve financial management by local governments;
           The strengthening of the integrated municipal solid waste management approach through the
           development of waste sorting and valorization activities. This point was raised in particular
           during the consultation workshop on the Program, which was held in Morocco in September
           2010; and
           The strengthening of supervision, and oversight of quality and compliance with environmental
           and social standards.


                                                     64
In light of the foregoing and of the role played by the World Bank in the preparation and implementation
of the PNDM, the Government attaches the utmost importance to continued technical and financial
support from the World Bank for this Program, and to its role as a facilitator of support from other
donors. This assistance is also being requested beyond DPL2, the subject of this Development Policy
Letter for this Program.

I wish to express my gratitude to you for your support with the implementation of this important program
and for the interest shown by the World Bank in the development of this sector.

Very truly yours,

            ANNEX 2: THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM FOR THE REFORM
                    OF THE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR

1. Recognizing the urgent need for leadership and partnership in addressing the very serious issues in
   municipal solid waste management, the Government has begun to take vigorous actions toward the
   development and reform of the sector. Extensive consultations, conducted by a steering committee
   led by the Ministry of General Economic Affairs (Ministère des Affaires Economiques et Génerales ­
   MAEG) involving key stakeholders, i.e., Ministry of Economy and Finance - MoEF, MoI, and
   Secretariat of State in charge of Water and Environment -SWE, and supported by the Bank and other
   donors, have enabled the Government of Morocco (GoM) to initiate the development of a
   comprehensive municipal solid waste sector reform program. This consultation and dialogue over the
   last two years, with strong commitment and ownership of Moroccan stakeholders, has led to the
   elaboration of the program detailed in the sector development policy letter, and substantially outlined
   and discussed in the following paragraphs.

2. The Government initiated the solid waste reform program in 2006 with the enactment of the first
   Solid Waste Law 28-00 that established the fundamental principles and key rules that will govern
   the management of solid waste in Morocco. This formed the foundation for Moroccan policy for the
   sector with two key objectives: to establish integrated and affordable solid waste management
   systems and to mitigate negative impacts of the sector on public health and the environment. More
   specifically, this law (i) establishes the institutional framework for SWM; (ii) requires the
   development of solid waste master plans at the national, regional, and municipal level; (iii)
   establishes cost recovery principles, including the "polluter pays" principle and user fees
   (redevances); (iv) introduces sanitary landfills as the standard for final waste disposal and requiring
   regulations establishing landfill norms and standards; (v) introduces regulations for hazardous waste
   management; and (vi) establishes a system to monitor compliance with the law.

3. The Government also prepared and approved a national municipal solid waste management
   program (Programme National de Déchets Ménagers et Assimilés ­ PNDM). The PNDM is the
   result of strong inter-sectoral collaboration and dialogue between the key ministries concerned. A 15-
   year, 3-phase program launched in 2008, it sets out objectives for the modernization of SWM, in
   particular, expanding and professionalizing collection services, modernizing disposal practices and
   promoting recycling activities. It includes specific targets for the municipal waste sector, including:
   collection coverage increasing from 70 percent to 90 percent by 2021; 100 percent use of sanitary
   landfills in urban areas by 2021; the closure and/or rehabilitation of 300 open dumps; and sorting of
   20 percent of recyclable materials.

4. The overall reform program builds on the momentum gained through the introduction of the above
   two government actions. It focuses over the next four years on three areas of reform:

    (i)     Improving governance of the sector through additional legal, regulatory, and institutional
            measures designed to establish a clear framework for the sector, and eliminating overlap
            and/or gaps in the policy-making, regulatory, and operational structure;

    (ii)    Improving the sustainability of the sector through the introduction of financial mechanisms
            and incentives for municipalities to improve their SWM systems; and

    (iii)   Mainstreaming social and environmental considerations into the planning, implementation,
            and operations of solid waste services and investments.

                                                   66
REFORM AREA 1 ­ GOVERNANCE OF THE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR

5. Reform measures in this area are intended to address fragmentation and legacies that affect
   policymaking and effective implementation. Policy actions aim at (i) policy planning and
   coordination in the sector through the establishment of the National Commission (Commission
   Nationale ­ CN) as a policy and strategic planning coordination body for the PNDM; (ii) defining the
   eligibility and allocation criteria for government subsidies to support municipal SWM operations and
   investments in an equitable, transparent, and cost-effective manner; (iii) strengthening the regulatory
   framework through the enactment of executive regulations for SWM planning and for standard and
   norms for disposal facilities; (iv) improving competition, transparency, and accountability of SWM
   Private Sector Participation (PSP) schemes by improving the quality of standard bidding and
   contracting procedures and strengthening the capacity of respective local governments; and (v)
   developing appropriate communications and public awareness programs. Responsibility for the
   implementation of these reforms rests primarily with the MoI and the SWE, with the CN serving as
   the main coordination entity. Specific actions are presented below:

GoM actions program for reform area 1

    Establish a national coordination commission (CN-PNDM). The CN will be responsible for sector
    planning and reform coordination, as well as for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on
    implementation and results of the PNDM and the overall reform program. The CN will be chaired by
    the Secretary of State in charge of Water and Environment and will include stakeholders representing
    the MoI, MoEF, MAEG, and the Fonds d'Equipement Communal (FEC). The establishment of the
    CN-PNDM was announced by a circular letter issued by the Secretary of State in charge of Water and
    Environment and will meet at least twice a year.

    Defining the eligibility and         Box 1: Government target financial support to municipalities in
    allocation       criteria       for  upgrading their municipal solid waste systems
    government financial support for
                                         The Government has decided to support municipalities to upgrade their
    municipal SWM operations and         management of solid waste, in part to facilitate the objectives of Law 28-
    investments. The MoEF and the        00. The support is intended to be limited, in order to encourage
    SWE have prepared a draft policy     municipalities to develop their own resources, and temporary, to provide

   regulations. The GoM intends to
   enact, by end of 2010, the following regulations: (i) the elaboration of regional and local planning
   tools for solid waste management; (ii) administrative procedures and technical standards for waste
   treatment and landfilling; (iii) guidelines for the determination of solid waste fees (redevances des
   déchets); and (iv) modalities for monitoring and supervision of waste services at national, regional
   and municipal levels.

   Establish regulatory mechanisms governing local public services. GoM has initiated the amendment
   of the Charte Communale in order to introduce, among other changes, the concept of regulation of
   local public services, including solid waste management. The amended Charte will be enacted during
   2009 and will provide greater legitimacy to regulatory actions in the sector.

   Improving competition, transparency, and accountability of PSP schemes in SWM by improving
   standard bidding and contracting procedures. With the support of the Public-Private Infrastructure
   Advisory Facility (PPIAF), the Government is currently undertaking a study on PSP in MSWM that
   aims to recommend areas where improvements or adjustments need to be made in order to improve
   efficiency in the sector. The study will review existing PSP contracts and will benchmark the
   Moroccan PSP experience to other relevant experiences before suggesting areas of improvements in
   contract design, tender preparation and implementation, and contract management. The study will
   also propose options to improve transparency and accountability in PSP contract management by
   suggesting modalities to ensure greater participation from users/beneficiaries. GoM will validate
   proposed changes by end 2009 and incorporate them in preparing new standard contracting
   documents and procurement procedures starting in 2010.

   Public communications and awareness program: The Journée de Communications, held on July 9,
   2008, launched the Government's communication strategy with respect to the reform program. The
   strategy will continue to be developed and implemented over the course of the PNDM. Annual
   budget allocations will take place beginning in 2009 for the implementation of a national
   communication and public awareness program. In parallel, the GoM will implement a national
   benchmarking system that will constitute an additional incentive for municipalities to improve their
   performance in this sector.

REFORM AREA 2 ­ ENHANCING SUSTAINABILITY

6. The Government recognizes that sustainability of the municipal solid waste sector is critical.
   Sustainability factors include (i) short-, medium- and long-term financial sustainability, and (ii)
   improved municipal capacity to plan and manage SWM services; including regular monitoring and
   evaluation of sector performance.

7. Financial Sustainability: There are two main aspects to the Government's strategy to promote
   financial sustainability ­ improving municipal financial capacity to meet the financial requirements of
   modernizing the MSWM system and improving the cost effectiveness of services. In terms of
   improving municipal financial capacity, measures include: (i) in the short term, the provision of
   targeted subsidies to municipalities to cover the incremental costs due to the requirements of the
   PNDM; (ii) supporting municipalities in mobilizing additional funds through the international carbon
   market; and (iii) exploring new revenue sources and mechanisms for generating additional revenues
   such as the earmarking of local revenues and the creation of solid waste fees (redevances) in
   application of Law 28-00 and possible introduction of "eco-taxes" on packaging waste. In terms of
   improving the cost effectiveness of services, the Government intends to: (i) introduce incentives and
   tools to promote inter-municipal cooperation and regionalization of solid waste disposal facilities; this
   will help municipalities to take advantage of the significant economies of scale in waste management;
   and (ii) revise contracting documents and procedures for private sector participation in SWM.

8. In the case of smaller municipalities, contracting out for improved solid waste disposal may pose
   particular challenges as these have: (i) lower revenues from local taxes as a proportion of their
   volume of waste produced; (ii) are less able to realise technical economies of scale in waste handling;
   and (iii) have limited financial capacity to smooth out the gap between their up-front investment costs
   and the annualized, tonnage-based subsidy from the GoM. The regulations on the technical
   arrangements for waste disposal will therefore be indicative rather than obligatory during the first
   phase of the PNDM, allowing smaller towns to opt out. The Phase 1 (2008-2012) focuses on the
   larger towns and cities, which represent around 70 percent of national solid waste production in
   Morocco. A study on SWM arrangements in smaller towns is planned for 2009 with possible KFW
   funding. It is envisaged that DPL2 will pursue and deepen reforms among smaller towns to allow
   them to participate in the program. It is hoped that multi-town groupings will permit many smaller
   municipalities to realise technical and managerial economies of scale and equally benefit from the
   PNDM.

9. Improved municipal capacity to plan and manage SWM services: The Government program
   includes a multi-year capacity building program targeting local authorities and aiming at improving
   (i) managerial and technical capacity in SWM at the municipal level, (ii) elaboration, review and
   approval of environmental impact assessment of solid waste investment; (iii) contracting out solid
   waste services; and (iv) municipal financial management.

GoM actions program for reform area 2

    Government subsidies to support the implementation of the PNDM: GoM is committed to allocating
    financial resources to support municipalities in improving their municipal solid waste management
    systems, and to annually transfer all targeted subsidies committed to as part of the Budget Laws. As a
    prior action, the Moroccan Government has already credited MAD 100 million to the National
    Environment Fund (Fonds National de l'Environnement ­ FNE) under the 2008 budget as well as
    MAD 200 million as part of the Programme d'emploi de la TVA to provide financial support for
    municipalities through the PNDM. Additional transfers will be included for the upcoming four fiscal
    years (2009-2012) on a yearly basis.

    Supporting the municipalities to mobilize additional financial resources under the Clean
    Development Mechanism (CDM): The GoM is committed to supporting municipalities in the
                                                    69
    identification, preparation and negotiations of a CDM programmatic project in the solid waste sector.
    The FEC has been appointed by the Government as the coordinating agency responsible for
    developing a programmatic CDM project in parallel with the implementation of the PNDM.
    Additional resources provided by carbon finance could help cover part of the cost of municipal solid
    waste landfilling. Concurrently the CDM program will also contribute to international efforts to
    reduce carbon emissions and therefore contribute to the international community effort to mitigate
    climate change.

    Completion of a feasibility study on long-term financial sustainability: Based on Terms of
    Reference prepared and finalized in 2008, the GoM will conduct in 2009 a feasibility study for the
    implementation of identified tools/actions for mobilizing new revenue sources, such as the
    earmarking of local revenues; the creation of "eco-taxes" on packaging materials, and the
    establishment of users fee (redevances) in application of the Solid Waste Law 28-00. Validation and
    implementation of the recommendations and findings of the study will take place in 2009-2010.

    Strengthening the legal framework to promote inter-municipal cooperation GoM initiated in 2008
    the revision of the Charte Communale in order to provide formal legal status (personalité juridique)
    to groupings of municipalities and enabling them to act as special purpose vehicles. The adoption of
    the amended Charte communale by the Parliament took place in December 2008. This will help
    municipalities take advantage of the significant economies of scale in waste management.

    Implementation of a national capacity-building program in SWM: As a prior action, the
    Government will implement a multi-year training plan for local municipalities within the framework
    of the PNDM in order to address the lack of managerial, technical and financial management capacity
    at the municipal level. The program will be co-managed by the Ministry of Interior and the Secretariat
    of State in charge of Water and Environment. The Government has already mobilized national and
    international actors for the implementation of this program including the FEC, GTZ, JICA, AFD and
    PPIAF. A first series of capacity building and technical assistance has been launched in 2009 and
    should cover the first phase of PNDM covering the period 2009-2011


REFORM AREA 3: MAINSTREAMING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS

10. The GoM is committed to promoting environmentally and socially sound disposal facilities. Given
    the current situation in terms of final disposal and the huge potential social and environmental
    impacts, the primary focus of this aspect of the reform program is to (i) support the implementation of
    environmentally and socially sound disposal facilities; and (ii) improve the social and working
    conditions of wastepickers, whose livelihoods will be affected by closure of existing dumpsites.

11. The Government recognizes the need to upgrade the existing EIA system. The GoM is committed to
    removing the regulatory, administrative, technical, and managerial shortcomings of the current EIA
    system so that a harmonized EIA platform can facilitate direct investment and donor support and
    elevate Morocco's environmental image in the international arena. These shortcomings include: (i)
    absence of established criteria, guidelines and rules for reviewing EIAs, approving EIA reports, and
    including the EIA mitigating and monitoring measures in services and work contracts; (ii) incomplete
    standard TORs for preparing EIA reports for solid waste management, and lack of TORs for
    environmental audits for landfills; (iii) absence of procedures and modalities for integrating social
    concerns into the EIA process for projects in general and, for SWM projects in particular, those
    related to wastepickers; (iv) lack of technical staff, resources and operational manuals for local staff
    to review EIA reports, and (v) lack of monitoring and enforcement of EIA mitigating measures at the
    national and local levels.

12. The reform program also supports the international agenda on climate change. Morocco is
    committed to promoting projects and activities to reduce GHG emissions, with particular focus on the
                                                   70
   solid waste sector. The FEC, a government agency specialized in the funding of municipalities, has
   already been appointed to support the municipalities in promoting the CDM agenda in municipal
   solid waste, including: (i) to assist in developing, preparing and sustaining CDM projects in parallel
   with the implementation of the PNDM; and (ii) to assist in selling Certified Emission Reductions
   (CERs) under a programmatic approach under which the FEC will act as the coordinating entity of a
   nationwide CDM Programme of Activities. Because of the potential reduction in GHGs and the
   resulting stream of revenues that can be generated, CDM related activities contribute to mitigating
   short- and medium-term financial shortfalls in the sector.


GoM action program for reform area 3

13. The measures to be implemented under this reform area are presented below.


   Enactment of EIA-related decrees toward effective implementation of the EIA Law: As part of the
   reform program and as an indication of the Government's commitment to improving transparency in
   the EIA process, the Government is committed to enacting the decrees required in the EIA law,
   namely, (i) the responsibilities and operations of the national EIA committee and regional EIA
   committees, and (ii) procedures for EIA-related public consultations.

   Operationalize the EIA system as whole through: (i) the preparation of a comprehensive EIA
   operational manual detailing steps and procedures for EIA preparation, review and approval; and (ii)
   the provision of training and capacity building on EIA preparation and review. The Government will
   also (i) prepare model TORs for Environment and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) for sanitary
   landfills; (ii) prepare model TORs for environment and social audits (ESA) for the
   closure/rehabilitation of open dumpsites; and (iii) establish best-practice guidelines for including
   mitigation and monitoring measures in work and services contracts.

   Preparation and implementation of a multi-year plan (Phase 1 of the PNDM) focusing on
   municipal waste disposal: For the first phase of the PNDM (2008-2012), a detailed action plan has
   been prepared and adopted by the three concerned ministries (MoI, MoF and SWE) in order to help
   local authorities improve SWM, including the modernization of collection services; the construction
   of transfer stations and new sanitary landfills in eligible municipalities; the closure of 63 open
   dumpsites; and the preparation of seven regional master plans benefiting 52 municipalities and
   provinces.

   Preparation and implementation of a program to improve social performance of solid waste
   management: Implementation of this plan has been agreed based on the findings of Phase 1 of a
   poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) conducted during preparation of the present operation.
   The plan will include: (i) providing wastepickers access to health care; (ii) in-depth consultations by
   the municipalities with wastepickers and discussion of options for their reemployment, possibly by
   private SWM operators ; and (iii) involving local NGOs, through a call for proposals, which will
   work closely with wastepickers, ensuring that they receive appropriate health and hygiene services,
   assisting in their finding alternative employment, and monitoring the implementation and follow-up
   of the PSIA recommendations. As first steps in this regard, the CN-PNDM has adopted the key
   principles under which social aspects will be incorporated into the implementation of the PNDM, and
   two pilot social inclusion initiatives were launched in 2009.

(1) The two main shocks are A1. Key variables are at their historical averages; and A2. No policy change (constant primary balance).

(2) The other shocks are: B1. Real interest rate is at baseline plus one standard deviations; B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half
standard deviation; B3. Primary balance is at baseline minus one-half standard deviation; B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter
standard deviation shocks; B5. One-off 30 percent real depreciation in 2010; B6. Increase in "other debt-creating flows" in 2010 of 10
percent of GDP. Standard deviations for B1-B6 are calculated over the last ten years.
