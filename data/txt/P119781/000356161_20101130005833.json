development objective of the\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) program is to support the\n            Government of Morocco (GoM) in implementing its program of\n            reforms aimed at improving the financial, environmental and\n            social performance of the municipal solid waste sector in\n            Morocco. The first DPL supported the key foundations of the\n            Government's reform program, which established the\n            enabling environment for an integrated and affordable\n            municipal solid waste system. This second DPL supports\n            capitalizing on the momentum gained during the first\n            operation while deepening the reforms at the regional and\n            municipal levels. Support to the municipal solid waste\n            reform program is a key component. Second DPL will\n            contribute to the achievement of the Country Partnership\n            Strategy (CPS') second and third pillars: support to\n            the improvement in access to, and quality of services; and\n            sustainable development in a changing climate. In addition\n            the operation is fully supportive of the CPS cross cutting\n            theme of enhancing governance."}, "docdt": "2010-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
