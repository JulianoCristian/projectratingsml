Authority (THA) to meet the traffic\n            volume expected in the 1990s. The project will also provide\n            a more reliable and cost effective transport link for\n            neighboring landlocked countries, thus facilitating their\n            overseas trade activities. The project includes: (a) civil\n            works to expand the port container terminal, complete the\n            Ubungo and Kurasini inland container depots, pave the\n            lighterage wharf for container storage, construct a port\n            access road, complete second phase of general cargo terminal\n            rehabiliation and repair concrete piles and fenders; (b)\n            rehabilitation of the port's central workshop and\n            provision of technical assistance for training of mechanics;\n            (c) procurement of container and general cargo handling\n            equipment; and (d) management assistance and training for\n            middle and upper management. It also includes: (e) technical\n            assistance to Customs to introduce a simplified\n            documentation process, computerize customs processing and\n            train customs officers; (f) addition of a technical\n            assistance and training coordinator to the Project\n            Coordination Unit; (g) a development study to review the\n            options for future port capacity expansion; and (h)\n            consulting services for supervision of civil works and\n            detailed engineering."}, "docdt": "1990-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
