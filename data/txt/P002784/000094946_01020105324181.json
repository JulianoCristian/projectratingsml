sustainability is likely, and institutional development\n            impacts are substantial. Regardless of success, key lessons\n            convey that: 1) by and large, raising port services levels\n            to international standards, is not usually feasible within\n            the public sector framework. Therefore, it is essential that\n            an appropriate institutional framework involve private\n            sector participation, to sustain improvements to port\n            systems, by creating domestic competition, leading to\n            regional competition, and/or concession agreements, forcible\n            enough to obtain regulations protecting public interests,\n            but under an appropriate institutional framework; 2)\n            divestiture programs should be undertaken by institutions\n            not related to the enterprise undergoing restructuring,\n            while the privatization policy should be central to the\n            macroeconomic policy framework, to ensure an objective\n            approach to divestiture, and in turn, provide an appropriate\n            political backing to the process; 3) changing circumstances,\n            or project performance itself, may lead to unforeseen\n            negative results, such as waste of resources on components\n            with negligible impacts, but a flexible project design may\n            prevent, and/or facilitate such resources to more critical\n            investments; and, 4) given the superb project coordination,\n            the complexity of the project did not preclude success,\n            however, records management should be considered at project design."}, "docdt": "2000-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
