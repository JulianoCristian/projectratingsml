for preparation and\n            implementation of all urban water supply and sewerage\n            projects and for operation of the systems, to rehabilitate\n            and expand water supply facilities, to promote appropriate\n            sewerage and drainage technologies, to investigate\n            possibilities of sewage effluent reuse, to help define\n            policies and institutional arrangements, to update\n            information and prepare operation models, and to complete\n            information on water needs and sources in the rural areas.\n            The project will include the following components: (i) new\n            and rehabilitation of existing wells, chlorination units,\n            fluoride removal plants, one neutralization plant,\n            transmission pipes, reservoirs, distribution network, supply\n            for domestic connections including meters, and standpipes;\n            (ii) construction of office space; (iii) three expatriate\n            advisors, consultancy, and a technical training program;\n            (iv) studies for sewerage and drainage; and (v) an\n            institutional and policy study, investigation of the\n            maestrichtian aquifer, and an inventory of water needs and\n            resources for rural water supply."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
