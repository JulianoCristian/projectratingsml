                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed project is to promote the expansion of economic and environmentally friendly geothermal power generation in Indonesia,
                         and to reduce CO2 emission from the power system. The project will assist the GoI to prepare and implement its geothermal sector reform program designed to remove
                         the key policy and institutional barriers which presently prevent greater development of geothermal resources, and will assist in the transaction of geothermal power
                         investments.

                          The global environment objective of the project is to promote on-grid electricity from geothermal sources, reducing the need for coal-based generation capacity and
                         avoiding associated greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed project is expected to have a sizable immediate impact as well as sustained log-term benefits.

                         The Government of Indonesia (GoI) is making progress in developing its world's leading geothermal resources, which it has mainstreamed by making geothermal a forty percent
                         share of the Governments 10,000 MW accelerated power generation expansion program (Second Crash Program). Although the pace of the scale-up has been slow and behind
                         schedule, geothermal capacity in the country has increased by 220 MW (23% increase) since the inception of the project, with another 260 MW having achieved financial closure
                         (IBRD/CTF and JICA loans). Furthermore, the Government facilitated the signing of six (6) power purchase agreements in the public sector that will lead to over 450 MW of capacity,

                         if successfully developed. The key challenge now is for the Government to covert these piecemeal yet important successes into systemic solutions that will continue to develop the
                         full potential of its geothermal expansion program.

                         The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) have issued a number of decrees on pricing, , yet the approach remains piecemeal; requiring additional work before a
                         comprehensive policy can be implemented. Several geothermal fields are also under consideration by project to provide advisory services to carry out a demonstration transaction in
                         coordination with the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund (IIGF). The World Bank has also assisted PGE, the leading public sector geothermal developer kick-start what is the
                         largest geothermal scale-up in the world, with the approval of $300 million in loans from IBRD and the Clean Technology Fund (CTF). A grant of about $7 million from the
                         Government of New Zealand was secured for bolstering PGE's capacity to carry out the globally unprecedented geothermal investment program.

                         Given the high priority for geothermal development in Indonesia and the critical need for seeing through the reforms, the World Bank, in June, 2011, approved a request by the GoI to
                         extend the project's closing date by two years to June 30, 2013.
