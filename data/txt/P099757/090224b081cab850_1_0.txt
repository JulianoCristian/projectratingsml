                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed project is to promote the expansion of economic and environmentally friendly geothermal power generation in Indonesia,
                         and to reduce CO2 emission from the power system. The project will assist the GoI to prepare and implement its geothermal sector reform program designed to remove
                         the key policy and institutional barriers which presently prevent greater development of geothermal resources, and will assist in the transaction of geothermal power
                         investments.

                          The global environment objective of the project is to promote on-grid electricity from geothermal sources, reducing the need for coal-based generation capacity and
                         avoiding associated greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed project is expected to have a sizable immediate impact as well as sustained log-term benefits.

                         The project has supported development of regulations for improvement of enabling environment for geothermal development. However, the planned support to carry out investment
                         transactions was not implemented during the project life. Thus no reduction in CO2 emissions expected from these investment transactions has been or will be achieved

                         While the Government of Indonesia continues it efforts to streamline its policy and regulatory framework and provide incentives for expansion of geothermal power generation, it has
