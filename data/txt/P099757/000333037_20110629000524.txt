7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The development objective of the project is to promote the expansion of economic and environmentally
friendly geothermal power generation in Indonesia, and to reduce CO2 emission from the power system.
The project will assist the GoI to prepare and implement its geothermal sector reform program designed to
remove the key policy and institutional barriers which presently prevent greater development of geothermal
resources, and will assist in the transaction of geothermal power investments. The global environment
objective of the project is to promote on-grid electricity from geothermal sources, reducing the need for
coal-based generation capacity and avoiding associated greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed project
is expected to have a sizable immediate impact as well as sustained log-term benefits.
