                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed project is to promote the expansion of economic and environmentally friendly geothermal power generation in Indonesia,
                         and to reduce CO2 emission from the power system. The project will assist the GoI to prepare and implement its geothermal sector reform program designed to remove
                         the key policy and institutional barriers which presently prevent greater development of geothermal resources, and will assist in the transaction of geothermal power
                         investments.

                          The global environment objective of the project is to promote on-grid electricity from geothermal sources, reducing the need for coal-based generation capacity and
                         avoiding associated greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed project is expected to have a sizable immediate impact as well as sustained log-term benefits.

                         The project has achieved one very important milestone, namely that MEMR has issued a ministerial decree No. 22/2012 to provide a feed-in-tariff scheme for geothermal
                         development. In parallel, MEMR has drafted a revision of the Government Regulation No. 59/2007 regarding Geothermal Business Activities to make the tender process compatible
                         with the new feed-in-tariff scheme. The draft revised regulation has been under review by other concerned ministries. These steps are expected to lead to a more enabling policy
                         environment for geothermal development in Indonesia.

                         Due to the changed circumstances after the introduction of a feed-in-tariff policy for geothermal development, MEMR has decided to cancel a number of sub-components that are no
                         longer considered priorities. This means that the project will be unable to disburse the entire amount of the GEF grants before the current closing date of June 30, 2013.
