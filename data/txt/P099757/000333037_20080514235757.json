There are four components\n            to the project. The first component is the policy framework\n            for scaling-up the development of geothermal power. This\n            component will assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) in\n            developing and implementing an integrated set of policies\n            that will provide sufficient regulatory certainty, risk\n            mitigation, and economic incentives for increased public and\n            private investments toward developing geothermal power in\n            Indonesia. The second component is the transactions\n            management for mobilizing investments in geothermal power\n            generation. This component will assist the GoI, especially\n            the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), to\n            develop the capacity for planning and transacting geothermal\n            power developments in an efficient and transparent manner.\n            The third component is the geothermal sector technical\n            capacity building. This component will help address the\n            limited domestic technical capacity for handling most\n            geothermal related activities, and support the long-term\n            development prospects of the sector. Finally, the fourth\n            component is the project management assistance. This\n            component will provide the necessary technical consultant\n            support to the directorate of geothermal enterprise\n            supervision and ground water management, the executive\n            implementation unit, for the management and supervision of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2008-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
