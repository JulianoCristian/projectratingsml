The project will\n            assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to prepare and\n            implement its geothermal sector reform program designed to\n            remove the key policy and institutional barriers which\n            presently prevent greater development of geothermal\n            resources, and will assist in the transaction of geothermal\n            power investments. The extension is necessary to compensate\n            for initial delays in project implementation, and allow time\n            for the completion of high priority activities under the\n            following components: (i) component one: policy framework\n            for scaling up the development of geothermal power; and (ii)\n            component two: transaction management for mobilizing\n            investments in geothermal power generation. The recipient\n            has put in place a realistic action plan to ensure\n            completion of the project by the revised closing date. The\n            World Bank task team has reviewed the proposed action plan\n            and has found it to be satisfactory. The action plan and\n            implementation timeline are available in project files. This\n            will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
