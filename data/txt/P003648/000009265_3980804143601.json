(SSPII) will involve a reclamation project at the\n            Bailonggang to improve the water environment of the Huangpu\n            River, protect the water quality of the upper Huangpu water\n            supply intake, and speed up the development of Pudong New\n            Area. This supplemental statement of environmental impact\n            assessment came as a result of the changing of land\n            acquisition option for the sewerage treatment plant, which\n            may change the result from the original environmental\n            assessment done in 1995 (E127). Filling spoil left from the\n            reclamation project will be used to build the Bailonggang\n            embankment. To mitigate the impact of dust, spoil stockpiles\n            and roads will be regularly sprinkled with water. To reduce\n            noise from the vehicles for spoil transportation, roads and\n            bridges will be widened and harnessed to accelerate the\n            speed of transportation. During the construction period,\n            wastewater must be discharged into septic tank and then\n            carried away regularly by local sanitation department. Odor\n            generated from wastewater process will be mitigated by\n            laying sewerage discharge pipes, and utilizing land to plant\n            trees and conduct greenery projects. Compensation will be\n            arranged to tackle the economic loss of the fishermen and\n            farmers affected duirng the construction."}, "docdt": "1998-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
