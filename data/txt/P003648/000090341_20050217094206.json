The\n            lessons learned indicate that continuity and quality of key\n            personnel from both Bank and Borrower sides are important to\n            ensure success. Project Office should include personnel with\n            utility and environmental management skills, and emphasize\n            construction management expertise. With bold implementation\n            approaches, new technologies can be applied for improved\n            project effectiveness and efficiency. The usefulness of\n            public/private partnerships for wastewater operations,\n            possibly through Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) or concession\n            arrangements, is acknowledged for system improvements and\n            operational Efficiency. More emphasis on very large\n            International Competitive Bidding (ICB) turn-key contracts\n            in future similar projects may encourage foreign/local joint\n            venture firms to participate, with potentially stronger\n            construction management skills. Civil works contracts in\n            infrastructure projects in Shanghai do not attract any\n            interest internationally, even when contracts are packaged\n            in amounts exceeding $10.0 million. Local area sewer\n            networks and related connections should be included in\n            project scope, or otherwise legislated by government, to\n            ensure appropriate and timely utilization of trunk sewer\n            systems. Monitoring indicators are an important means of\n            assessing project achievements. Monitoring of project impact\n            should be closely coordinated among involved agencies, and\n            data shared to avoid duplicated efforts."}, "docdt": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
