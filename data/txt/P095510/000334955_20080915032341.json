{"cdata!": "The Environmental Sustainability\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) supports the Government of\n            Mexico's medium-term, outcome-based program to promote\n            sustainable development. The overarching objective of the\n            DPL operation is to balance socio-economic development with\n            environmental protection and improvement. The operation will\n            complement actions supported by the recently approved\n            climate change DPL and will further pursue the general\n            objectives of a previous Environment DPL Program, by\n            integrating environmental concerns in the sectoral policies\n            and programs of key development sectors: tourism, energy,\n            forestry, water, agriculture, and housing as prioritized by\n            the government of Mexico (GOM). The original Environment DPL\n            Program supported environmental mainstreaming in four of\n            these sectors (tourism, energy, forestry, and water); the\n            other two (agriculture and housing) have been included at\n            the GOM's request. Macroeconomic risks are associated\n            with effects on the Mexican economy of: (i) a sharper\n            slowdown of the US (and global) economy, decelerating growth\n            of non-oil exports and reducing the flow of workers'\n            remittances, (ii) higher levels of international commodity\n            and food prices leading to further pressures on domestic\n            inflation, (iii) increased uncertainty with respect to\n            credit conditions for the access of emerging markets to the\n            international capital markets, and (iv) declining oil\n            production. However, several factors are in place to reduce\n            these risks, including: a healthy financial system that has\n            begun to expand domestic credit as a share of GDP; more\n            dynamism in exports to non-US destinations; favorable terms\n            of trade with high oil prices; and the further consolidation\n            of prudent macroeconomic policies in both the fiscal and\n            monetary realms."}, "docdt": "2008-09-05T00:00:00Z"}
