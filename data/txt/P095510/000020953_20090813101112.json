It provides an analysis on the impact of the\n            adoption of fiscal instruments in environmental public\n            finances and the tax system in general. Such requirements\n            are analyzed in this study. It tries to provide elements for\n            discussion on the impacts of fiscal environmental taxes and\n            charges. The study brings international experiences into the\n            debate theory for the type of instruments to be used to\n            foster recovery and deterioration of ecosystems, and how\n            they should be allocated funds from the. The work was\n            divided into three chapters. In Chapter I the paper surveyed\n            the major environmental projects implemented since the\n            public finances, noting the changing context in the country\n            and the most significant results that have been achieved. In\n            Chapter II, as background to the analysis, the study gives\n            an assessment of approaches and experiences in the\n            application for special purpose tools of the environmental\n            tax, as well as to obtain a double dividend. Finally, in\n            Chapter III the paper presents a model to evaluate the main\n            impacts of implementation of an environmental tax and the\n            application model results that are estimated to levy a tax\n            on pesticides, and two variants of taxes on tires. Each\n            chapter integrates specific conclusions and finally provides\n            a summary of the main benefits of the study."}, "docdt": "2005-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
