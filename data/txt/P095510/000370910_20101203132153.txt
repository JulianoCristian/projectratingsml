1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1. A. Sector Background at Appraisal

1. This Environmental Sustainability DPL, the third in a series of policy lending
operations to support environmental management in Mexico, built on environmental
mainstreaming efforts and reforms initiated under the two previous operations
(Environment Structural Adjustment Loan ­ EnvSAL I and Second Programmatic
Environment Development Policy Loan II ­ EnvDPL II).1 The DPL continued integration
of environment and sustainability concerns into energy, tourism, water, and forestry ­
sectors with established environmental agendas ­ and also reinforced environmental
components in two new sectors: housing and agriculture. Although the Environmental
Sustainability DPL continued activities initiated under EnvDPL II, the 24-month rule
mandated that a new operation been launched in order to continue the operation in
accordance with World Bank policies. 2

2. At the time of appraisal of the Environment DPL series, Mexico faced significant
pressures on its natural environment, resulting from decades of rapid industrialization and
expansion of transportation, agriculture, and livestock production. The GOM was aware
of the environmental challenges facing the country, as well as the economic
consequences of failing to take action to ensure environmental sustainability. In response
to these challenges, the Government formulated an environmental sustainability agenda
outlined in the 2007-2012 National Development Plan (NDP).3 This agenda seeks to
mainstream environment into the development planning process in order to promote
sustainable production and consumption, prevent environmental degradation, and to
ensure long-term development opportunities. The NDP recognizes that all elements that
compose the natural environment must be managed in an integrated manner.
Consequently, the NDP includes strategies for environmental components including
water, forest, climate change, biodiversity, solid waste, and cross-cutting environmental
sustainability policy instruments.

3. In addition to the environmental sustainability component, the NDP outlined an
extensive reform program focusing on the additional strategic pillars of security and the
rule of law, competitiveness, equality of opportunity, and effective democracy. 4 The
Plan's environmental sustainability pillar stressed the important contribution of
environment to competitiveness and social development, as well as affirming the

  The Environment Structural Adjustment Loan (EnvSAL I ­ P074539) and the Second Programmatic
Environment Development Policy Loan (EnvDPL II ­ P079748) were approved in August 2002 and
September 2005, and closed in December 2003 and January 2006, respectively.

  World Bank operational guidelines specify that once 24 months have lapsed between Board approval of
operations, a new project must be initiated. This was the case with the environmental DPLs in Mexico.

importance of mainstreaming sustainability principles into sectoral policies. Mexico saw
the need to mainstream environment into key productive sectors in order to:
        (i)    Use Mexico's richly endowed natural environment as a source of
               competitive advantage to meet the demands of more selective and
               lucrative markets; and
        (ii)   Conduct interventions to mitigate the negative impacts of environmental
               degradation, including climate change and threats to human health,
               productivity, and competitiveness.

4. Because environmental degradation impacts human health, economic activities, and
social welfare, considering the environment in key economic sectors is critical to
ensuring long-term, sustainable economic growth. As Mexico recognized, ensuring that
productive use of natural resources will be possible into the future serves as a
complement to sound macroeconomic policies in ensuring long-run economic growth.

1.1.B. Macroeconomic Context at Appraisal

5. From 2004-2007, the Mexican economy grew at a rate of 3.8 percent of GDP. The
global economic expansion that occurred during this period contributed to countrywide
growth as exports increased at double-digit annual average growth rates. Enhanced price
stability contributed to a healthy expansion of domestic demand as a result of improved
purchasing power of wages and salaries and an expansion of domestic credit and
consumer lending (see Table 1).

6. At the time of loan approval, the Bank team determined that Mexico fully met the
policy requirement of OP 8.60 for a sound macroeconomic framework. Mexico had
maintained solid macroeconomic policies that had succeeded in moderating output
volatility and creating robust economic growth. The country had a consistent set of
macroeconomic policies, including monetary policy within an inflation targeting
framework, a flexible exchange rate, a balanced budget fiscal policy and public debt
management.

   7. However, the Mexican public sector remained heavily dependent on oil revenue,
   which in 2007 represented 35 percent of total public sector revenue, whereas non-oil tax
   revenue remained at a modest 10 percent of GDP. Oil production had dropped from a
   high of about 3.4 million barrels per day in 2004 to about 3.1 million barrels per day in
   2007, and to nearly 2.8 million barrels per day preceding the loan. Known reserves of oil
   were estimated to produce in the order of 10 years of production and Mexico was the
   only major oil producer to have suffered a dramatic decline (halving) of known reserves
   in recent decades.5

   1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

   8. This loan supported the GOM's medium-term, outcome-based strategy to promote
   sustainable development. The overarching objective of the program was to balance
   socioeconomic development with environmental protection across sectors.

   9. As mentioned, this operation was originally envisioned as the third phase of the
   Environment Policy Lending Program, which included the Environmental SAL I and
   Environment DPL II. However, the preparation of the new loan was delayed due to the
   change of the Mexican Administration that took place in 2006. Only in mid-2007 did the
   Government request the Bank to prepare a new operation that would continue to support
   the GOM's sustainable development program. Given that more than two years had
   passed between Board approval of Environment DPL II and the expected approval of this
   operation, this loan was processed as a self-standing DPL, according to Bank policy.

   10. Regardless of the processing requirements, this DPL was designed to continue
   supporting government policy reforms aimed at strengthening environmental
   sustainability measures in the four sectors (energy, water, tourism, and forestry) of the
   previous two operations. In addition, two new policy areas ­ agriculture and housing ­
   were included in this operation at the GOM's request, since these sectors had recently
   begun to integrate environmental concerns into relevant policies. The inclusion of these
   two new areas marked an important step in broadening the multi-sector dialog led by the
   Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT). In addition to building
   on preceding DPL operations (EnvSAL I, and EnvDPL II), this DPL complemented the
   Climate Change DPL, which was prepared in parallel to the Environmental Sustainability
   DPL. Achievement of the loan's objectives can be assessed using the following key
   outcome indicators:

   issues, as well as priority areas for continuation that emerged under the Environmental
   DPL Program.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The program objectives remained unchanged.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

12. This DPL supported economic and social goals in priority sectors by recognizing
concrete activities to mainstream environment sustainability in six priority areas as
explained below:

Enhancing competiveness and sustainability in the tourism sector

13. Tourism has been one of the main drivers of economic growth in Mexico; tourism
generates approximately 8 percent of the country's GDP and over 5 percent of paid jobs
nationwide.6 Moreover, the tourism industry also provides relatively high-paying jobs,
with high average annual earnings relative to the national average and contributes to
regional development. Recognizing the importance of tourism for development, the
GOM adopted Agenda 217 for Mexican Tourism as a framework for action to promote
sustainable tourism.

14. The integration of Agenda 21 in tourism was spearheaded by SECTUR and
SEMARNAT and aimed to facilitate collaboration between federal, state and municipal
level governments, tourism business owners, academia, NGOs and local communities, to
improve tourism activities and living conditions in and around tourist destinations. In
order to support the implementation of Agenda 21 at the local level, the GOM developed
a system of tourism sustainability indicators, serving as a diagnostic tool to measure and
monitor the conditions ­ environmental, socioeconomic, seasonal factors, and supply and
demand for tourism­ of each tourist destination, and to aid in decision making relating to
sustainable tourism development. Based on information obtained from the indicators of
sustainable tourism development, GOM also identified priority areas for action according
to the type of destination. Institutional capacity building for tourism organizations was
part of this operation, as was identifying and building Mexico's comparative advantage
and brand in sustainable and ecotourism.

Improving performance in the energy sector

15. Although energy production only accounts for 2.6 percent of GDP and 7.9 percent of
all exports, it is a critical component of Mexico's economy. In 2007 oil revenues made

7
   Agenda 21 is a comprehensive blueprint of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by
organizations of the UN, governments, and major groups in every area in which humans impact the
environment. GOM's Agenda 21 for Mexican Tourism aims to promote tourism development while
ensuring environmental protection, with a strong focus on ensuring that local actors ate the municipal level
are actively engaged in sustainable tourism development.


                                                     5
up almost 40 percent of the national budget.8 However, the long-term sustainability of
PEMEX's revenue stream, which since 2004 had benefited greatly from high oil prices, is
being threatened by the gradual depletion of its proven hydrocarbon reserves and by the
lack of investment and technological advances, most notably in off-shore exploration.
Mexico's oil company, PEMEX ­as well as the national electricity companies­face
serious challenges including high costs of production, the need to replace old and
inefficient generation and production equipment, and the need to improve the overall
performance and quality of service and products. High and/or regressive subsidies (in
electricity and fuels) do not provide economic incentives for adopting sustainability
measures.

16. Despite recent progress in improving environmental performance in the energy
sector, Mexico still faces a number of challenges. The energy sector is a leading source of
air, water, and soil pollution, with poor fuel quality playing a major role in the
continuously high emissions from transport in Mexico. A diagnostic analysis of PEMEX
released by SENER in April 2008 stated that, despite recent efforts to reduce green house
gas emissions, sulfur oxide (SOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions increased by 10
percent in 2007 as result of gas flaring. Furthermore, although PEMEX lowered its water
consumption by 20 percent from 2001 to 2006, only 11 percent of water consumed was
recycled, putting pressure on hydrological resources and critical water basins located in
Mexico's northern and central regions.9

17. In addition, at the time of appraisal there were still about 1,000 hectares and 147 dam
sites that needed to be remediated due to hydrocarbon spills and other waste
contamination resulting from well perforation. Low quality fuels produced by PEMEX,
as well as subsidies applied to diesel and gasoline, continue to contribute significantly to
carbon emissions generated by the transport sector. Although the GOM's interventions
succeeded in reducing air pollution in various urban areas, in 2005 air quality remained
unsatisfactory more than 80 percent of the time in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, 33
percent of the time in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area, and 27 percent of the time in
the Monterrey Metropolitan Area.10 A study supported by the PHRD preparation grant,
assessing the costs of environmental degradation, found that ambient air pollution
accounted for approximately 2,800 premature deaths per year.11 Furthermore, 3,800
premature deaths were estimated to occur annually due to indoor air pollution stemming
from the use of solid fuels for cooking; fatalities from indoor air pollution primarily
affect children in poor rural communities.

   PEMEX consumed a total of 228 million cubic meters per year of water (81 percent supplied from fresh
water resources) and recycled only 11 percent of this amount (equivalent to the consumption of a city with
a population of 340,000 inhabitants).

18. PEMEX developed and Environmental Protection Strategy during the loan period.
PEMEX estimated that an investment of about US$7 billion would be needed to finance
the actions associated with the strategy's environmental objectives, including
improvements in fuel quality (such as those supported under the Program for Clean Fuel
Production) and operational activities across all segments of the industry.12 PEMEX's
Environmental Protection Strategy was the first to establish a conceptual framework for
incorporating environmental sustainability into the business planning and investments
decisions.

Streamlining the Energy Sector Program

19. During the same period as this operation, the GOM approved and began
implementing its 2007-2012 Energy Sector Program, which addressed the environmental
impacts of the energy sector by incorporating sustainability considerations into the
sector's highest decision- making levels and policies, aligned with the National
Development Plan's environmental sustainability pillar. Furthermore, the program
targeted increases in the share of renewable energy capacity in power generation
(specifically, from geothermal, wind, and solar power). The target of increasing the
renewable energy from 2 percent of the portfolio in 2006 to 4 percent by the end of 2009
was achieved. The Energy Sector Program is expected to increase energy savings
(measured in GWh) by at least 50 percent from the 2006 baseline, although evaluation
has been complicated by a change in measurement procedures.

20. The DPL also recognized the continued implementation of the GOM's ambitious
energy efficiency program, which seeks to double energy savings in electricity
consumption by 2012 (from 2006 levels). To achieve these targets, the 2007-2012
Energy Sector Program proposes the following:

           (i)     To design and implement policies and financial mechanisms to accelerate
                     adoption of energy efficient technologies in both the public and private
                     sectors;

           (ii)    To optimize energy supply and consumption in public facilities;

           (iii)   To improve coordination among the public and private sectors, and civil
                     society in order to promote energy efficiency;

           (iv)    To support the reduction of energy consumption in residential buildings;

           (v)     To promote efficient energy generation through auto-generation and
                     cogeneration schemes;

           (vi)    To strengthen the regulatory framework for cogeneration schemes, among
                     others.

Enhancing sustainability and pro-poor growth through forestry

21. Mexico's forests cover close to 30 percent of the country's land area (30.5 million
hectares of temperate forest and 26.5 million hectares of tropical forest).13 An additional
40 percent of the territory including xerophytic vegetation (58.5 million hectares) is
managed by the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR). Production in the forestry
sector contributes accounts for about 1.4 percent of GDP,14 and generates over 100,000
permanent jobs that pay salaries about three to four times higher than most jobs in the
agricultural sector.15

22. Although an estimated 38 percent of Mexico's total forested area has commercial
potential (21.6 million hectares)16, only around 15 percent (8.5 million hectares) of the
area was managed under approved sustainable management plans at the time of loan
approval. In addition to the lack of sustainably managed forests, deforestation and
degradation pose a threat to Mexico's forested areas. The lack of incentives for
landowners to sustainably manage forests, combined with weak institutions, lead to the
continued loss of forest cover.
23.
24. Over 80 percent of Mexico's forests are owned by indigenous communities and
ejidos17, and it is estimated that of the 12 to13 million people that live in forest areas
about 5 million are indigenous people. Ensuring the sustainability of Mexico's forests is
crucial to improving the livelihoods of poor rural populations, remedying environmental
degradation through soil and water conservation, mitigating climate change, expanding
sustainable tourism, and developing competitive timber and non-timber products for
domestic and international markets.

CONAFOR and ProÁrbol

25. Effectively managing the nation's forests has become a priority for the GOM. In
2001, CONAFOR was created by presidential decree to promote the sector's productive,

de inversión en bosques tropicales.

   Merino et al (2008) ). The biggest participation of the forestry sector in the national GDP in the decade
considered occurred in 2000 (1.6 percent), after this year the participation has been constantly reduced until
reaching 1.39 percent in 2005.

   The Agrarian Reform Ministry, via Mexican Presidential declarations created the communities
communal farms, today known as "Ejidos", as a means of providing land to the poor farmers of Mexico
(peons/campesinos). The creation of Ejidos was reflected in the 1917 Mexican Constitution. The Mexican
Agrarian Law in February 26, 1992 foresees, in its transitory article 8th (at the end of the law), the ability
of the "ejido" to decide not to continue to be an "ejido" by choosing a dis-incorporation process.

conservation, and restoration activities. Since 2001, the Mexican government has
substantially increased forest subsidy programs that assist communities in developing
forest management plans, reforestation activities (commercial plantation and forest
restoration), use of non-timber forest products, and, payments for environmental services,
among other activities. With updated management plans, communities continue to be
legal timber producers, and can access benefits such as payments for environmental
services, certified wood prices, etc. Mexico's Payment for environmental Services
Program designated 1.3 million hectares of forested lands for protection as watersheds,
carbon sequestration, biodiversity, agro-forestry systems, and other environmental
services.

26. The ProÁrbol Program is aimed at consolidating different federal support
mechanisms to improve participatory forest management, especially in 101 of the poorest
municipalities. ProÁrbol is managed by CONAFOR, which issues grants on a
competitive basis to organizations or individuals for improving forest planning, forest
protection, reforestation, soil conservation and development of commercial wood
processing. The program currently encompasses 22 states and over 700 communities (80
percent of which are composed of indigenous peoples).

27. Despite the advances in sustainable forestry management mentioned above, capacity-
building programs such as the Forest Resources Conservation and Sustainable
Management Project (PROCYMAF) did not have significant capacity and received the
smallest amounts of CONAFOR's total funding. PROCYMAF, for example, allocated
only about 1 percent of total CONAFOR funding in the six poorest forested states, while
funding for the Payment for Environmental Services Program accounted for 8 percent of
total government forestry funding between 2000 and 2007.

28. Considering these capacity challenges, this DPL recognized CONAFOR's efforts in
increasing community access to information and financial services, promoting improved
forestry management, classifying new areas for legal timber production, and promoting
the protection of critical watersheds.

Securing sustainable access to water

29. Mexico's water resources are currently under significant stress, and water may
become a constraint on expansion and productivity in many sectors. Although water
extraction represents 16 percent of natural resources used at the national level, this figure
is above 57 percent in the country's northern regions and around 154 percent in the
Mexico City Valley.18 Over-extraction of groundwater has increased in recent decades.
By 2006 the 104 aquifers that provided almost 60 percent of total groundwater extraction
were being exploited beyond capacity. Water quality has also deteriorated, partly from
the lack of wastewater treatment, with only 24 percent of wastewater being treated in
2006. Water quality is also affected by water discharges from municipalities, industries


18
  According to the United Nations, severe water stress occurs when extraction is equal to more than 40
percent of availability. CONAGUA, Estadísticas del Agua en México 2007.


                                                    9
and the tourism sector, as well as diffuse pollution from agriculture and livestock
production.
Capacity building for CONAGUA

30. As part of the GOM's efforts to manage these challenges, CONAGUA developed the
2007-2012 National Water Program in line with the 2030 vision of sustainable human
development. Concurrently, a 2004 change in the legal framework restructured key
functions of CONAGUA at the water basin level. The mandate to decentralize the
functions of CONAGUA to the River Basin Agencies (Organismos de Cuenca) is one of
the major reforms in the amended law. In addition to the River Basin Agencies, an
amendment to the National Water Law granted the River Basin Councils (Consejos de
Cuenca) authority in the administration of the Water Financial System (SFA- Sistema
Financiero de Agua), which the law mandated but did not fully develop.19 At the time of
the loan approval, 25 Basin Councils were responsible for formulating and agreeing on
activities to improve water resources management and on the need for water
infrastructure in their respective basins.20 According to the amended Law, the Basin
Councils were expected to supervise, together with CONAGUA, the work of the
aforementioned Basin Agencies.

Sustainable agricultural productivity for economic growth and poverty reduction

31. Mexico's public spending in agriculture and rural development is high compared to
the Latin America and Caribbean average and to that of other middle income countries
(MICs). In 2006, total federal spending on rural development programs was
approximately US$14.3 billion, or 7.8 percent of total federal spending. Despite large
budget allocations, agricultural growth and productivity have been lagging since the
1980s, relative to the Mexican economy as a whole, and to other MICs and major
regional competitors.

32. While national agriculture performance has been relatively weak, regional
performance has been heterogeneous. In the northern States, irrigated lands produced
yields similar to US productivity levels. Conversely, the productivity of the small-scale,
rain-fed agriculture of the South (where 86 percent of the farmers reside), has been
stagnant. Long-standing structural problems such as land conflicts, poor infrastructure
and services, and continued limited access to education and health services have limited
rural economic growth. In addition, the rural poor have not been incorporated into other
productive sectors in Mexico, with migration, mainly to the US, serving as the only
alternative for this population. Migration has contributed to a reduction in the labor force
and further declines in productivity.

33. As Mexican agriculture struggles to be competitive, it also struggles to integrate
principles of environmental sustainability into primary production as well as into

19
   The exact role of the basin level institutions in the SFA remained to be defined through the regulations of
the amended National Water Law.
20
   The territory covered by some basin agencies (such as the Lerma Basin) covers up to five states, while on
the other hand some states (such as Sonora) include territory covered by up to five basin agencies.


                                                     10
agribusiness. Rapid intensification and expansion of irrigated agriculture in the north has
resulted in overexploitation of water resources, especially groundwater, creating a further
decline in water availability. Over-extraction is a problem in 16 percent of the 653
aquifers in Mexico.

34. Agriculture is also a primary source of carbon emissions, due to use of internal
combustion engines for machinery and electricity generation for heating and cooling. On
the other hand, small scale farmers are key players in sustainable resource management
since small scale farmers cultivate an estimated 83 percent of areas with natural resources
(SRA, 2008). Of all forests in Mexico, and around 90 percent of lands in protected areas
are community owned.

35. The agriculture sector was added to the environmental policy program in this
operation, demonstrating SEMARNAT's increased capacity to conduct a strong policy
dialogue with a sector in which the impacts on the environment and water resources are
significant. SEMARNAT and SAGARPA have agreed on a mainstreaming agenda,
which supports the integration of environmental considerations in the agriculture sector,
focusing on improving sustainability in agriculture.

Expanding access to sustainable housing

36. The housing sector in Mexico has experienced a major expansion. Between 2001
and 2007 the number of loans for housing and housing improvements almost tripled,
from 293,000 in 2001 to 883,433 in 2007. Although housing loans were still dominated
by the public sector, private funding increased its share gradually from 1 percent to 13
percent during the same period. The mortgage portfolio as a percentage of GDP grew
from 5.5 in 2001 to 11 percent in 2007.

37. The lack of orderly expansion of cities, partially driven by residential expansion, has
contributed to unmanaged use of natural resources, especially water and forestry, in some
cases leading to unsustainable sprawl. In many cities, rapid housing development
surpassed the ability to adequately provide basic infrastructure and services, such as
water, sanitation, public transport, energy, and solid waste management.

38. In 2006, Mexican cities generated 36.1 million tons of solid waste, but the country
achieved important results in the creation of new sanitary landfills. In 2006, 55 percent
of the total solid waste generated was disposed in sanitary landfills and the remaining 45
percent was either disposed in other "controlled zones" (11 percent) or open dumps (34
percent). Mexican cities generated 242 million cubic meters of water waste in 2006, of
which 85 percent was collected by sewerage systems, although only 30.8 percent was
treated.

Green guidelines and comprehensive legislation

39. CONAVI (formerly CONAFOVI) prepared and published three sets of "Green
Guidelines" for the (i) design and incorporation of green spaces into housing



                                            11
developments, (ii) efficient use of energy, and (iii) efficient use of water resources in
housing developments. In 2006, Congress approved a new Housing Law which provided
a more comprehensive institutional setting for the sector and mandated for the first time
the environmental sustainability of the housing sector.21 In particular, the law mandated
that the housing policy incorporate environmental considerations and an efficient use of
resources, fostering programs that foster planned urban development while incorporating
other relevant sectors such as environment, transport, and finance in the policy
discussions. The Environmental Sustainability DPL supported the development and
approval of cross-sector guidelines for incorporating environmentally sustainable
practices into new housing developments financed under the federal subsidy program.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

The government's policy program remained unchanged.

1.6 Other significant changes

40. On October 2, 2008, the Board of Directors approved the originally agreed-upon
Environmental Sustainability Development Policy Loan (DPL) of US$300.75 million to
the United Mexican States. Shortly thereafter, global financial conditions deteriorated
substantially, leading to severe limitations on financing for developing countries and a
sharp rise in emerging market spreads. In light of these major economic and financial
challenges, the Mexican government requested supplemental financing for the above-
mentioned DPL for the amount of US$401 million.

41. The global economic environment dramatically changed the scenario of economic
growth, public finances, and the external financing requirements of the public sector
relative to those that the government presented in its 2009 budget proposal in early
September at the time the DPL operation was negotiated.

42. A cyclical downturn had already been observed as of the beginning of 2008, with
economic growth in the first half of the year slowing to 2.7 percent. In early October, the
Mexican government adjusted its GDP growth estimate to 2.0 percent for 2008 and 0.5-
1.5 percent for 2009, down from 2.4 and 3.0 percent, respectively. By the end of 2009
economic decline of GDP reached more than 6 percent.

43. This situation was aggravated by the global financial turmoil that led to a sharp
tightening of financing conditions. The EMBI Global spread for Mexico peaked at 627
basis points in October before returning to about 400 basis points in early November.
Sharply increased spreads on corporate bonds and reduced access to external finance are
having an adverse impact on investment and business expansion plans.

44. Tightening of access to external financing was accompanied by high volatility on the
foreign exchange market and a sharp depreciation of the peso with respect to the US
dollar. Corporate exposure to foreign exchange derivatives heightened the volatility on

21

                                                12
the foreign exchange market as firms had to meet margin calls and closed out losses from
their foreign exchange derivative exposure. The initial lack of disclosure of corporate
foreign exchange positions contributed to a temporary freeze on the domestic corporate
bond market disabling firms to roll-over commercial paper.

45. In light of these changes, the government of Mexico requested multilateral agencies
to expand their role in supporting its programs and policies, including those supported by
the DPL operation. This included a higher level of disbursements under Bank-financed
operations throughout the last quarter of 2008 and an enhanced assistance program for
the FY09-FYI0 period focusing on the need to maintain a robust social safety net. The
proposed Supplemental Financing for the Environmental Sustainability DPL met Bank
requirements for Supplemental Financing under OP 8.60, as follows:

   (a) The government was seeking supplemental financing because foreign financing
       had become exceedingly costly, and global bond markets effectively closed, even
       for investment grade emerging market countries like Mexico. It was also not able
       to secure alternative financing from other sources in the short-term at a reasonable
       cost, as the cost of borrowing even in local markets had increased substantially.

   (b) Mexico's sovereign credit risk, as measured by the JP Morgan-Chase Emerging
       Markets Bond Index Global (EMBIG), fluctuated in the range of 390 to 450 basis
       points throughout the first half of November, double the level observed on
       average in August.

   (c) The time available was too short to process a further freestanding Bank operation.
       The use of the Supplemental Financing option enabled the Bank to deliver timely
       program support to respond to the financial needs of the government of Mexico
       given the tightening of credit markets.

46. In spite of the crisis, the borrower continued to be committed to the program and the
implementing agencies had demonstrated competence in carrying out the planned
activities. The Mexican government had been at the forefront of developing countries in
promoting a strong environmental policy agenda, and was implementing the DPL in a
satisfactory manner, with both the commitment and the capacity to continue doing so.
The government's policy program, as described in the Program Document for the
Environmental Sustainability DPL that the Board approved on October 2, 2008, remained
unchanged. That said, the unanticipated gap in financing - in terms of particularly costly
and difficult financing conditions currently facing world economies ­ constrained the
government's activities in a variety of areas, including the environmental reform
program. As a response to the Mexican Government's request, a Supplemental Financial
was approved by the Board on December 18, 2009 in a total amount of US$ 401 million.
This was simply additional resources and the policies related issues remained exactly the
same, with no new safeguards being triggered.

   2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

   2.2.A Strong Government Commitment

   48. This DPL was successfully implemented due to strong ownership by the GOM and
   the institutional support of both the Finance Ministry (SHCP) and the Ministry of
   Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT). Both agencies provided
   coordination and oversight from the outset and encouraged active participation of the
   sector ministries and agencies involved in the Program.

   2.2.B Building on the experiences and lessons learnt of the First and Second
   Environmental Structural Adjustment Loan.


                                                      15
49. The Administration that took office in 2006 requested the Bank's assistance in
preparing a follow up operation to the Environmental DPL II in mid 2007 to build on the
reforms initiated and implemented in the first two stages. Based on the positive
experiences of EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II, the self-standing Environmental Sustainability
Development Policy Loan incorporated areas supported in those operations: (i)
integrating environmental and sustainability considerations in the energy agenda; (ii)
increasing appropriate financing for sustainable forestry; (iii) increasing water use
efficiency and reducing water pollution; and (iv) integrating environmental sustainability
considerations into the tourism sector agenda. The Environmental DPL II therefore
helped ensure continuity and follow-though in the Bank's partnership with the GOM on
environmental sustainability and resource management issues.

2.2.C. Difficulties encountered in DPL design and processing

50. As mentioned, because of the transition in administrations in Mexico (2006-2007), 24
months passed before approving extensions, and the second DPL was designed as a
stand-alone operation. Originally, the operation was intended to have a focus on climate
change, which had become a main priority of the Mexican Government. However,
considering the urgency of climate change, the new administration decided to carry out a
separate operation focusing only on climate change, which is a separate currently active
operation. Hence this DPL continued work of previous mainstreaming efforts, with two
new sectors, agriculture and housing, added at the Government's request. Although these
sectors are of paramount importance to poverty reduction, social equality, and growth, as
well as environmental sustainability, the addition of these sectors increased the
complexity of the operation.

51. Finally the global financial crisis of 2008-09 affected Mexico significantly, leading
the Mexican Government to request additional funding. Although the team was
eventually able to incorporate all government requests, sector coordination became more
difficult. Finally, because of the need for quick disbursement, the DPL was based only on
previously agreed-upon actions that, despite their relevance, limited flexibility and the
overall long-term impacts expected from this type of operation. This highlights an
example of where a programmatic approach might be useful. It is important to mention
that this DPL did not benefit from a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which
allows the Bank to provide technical assistance towards critical activities. The MOU is a
useful tool that should be standard procedure in DPL operations.

2.2.D. The challenge of adopting sustainability policy as a cross-cutting element in
sector development.

52. Environmental sustainability is one of the five pillars incorporated into the National
Development Plan, but also needs to be integrated into all areas and not treated as a
stand-alone issue. To support this aim under the DPL, it was necessary to overcome
traditional development paradigms and adopt sustainability as a cross-cutting priority.




                                            16
This approach required the adoption of key sustainability principles in each sector
involved and the selection of specific actions contributing to this end.

2.2.E. Difficulties of inter-sectoral coordination
53. The cross-cutting sustainability approach demands close coordination among
different sectors to achieve common goals. While all parties agreed to this goal in
principle, the institutional structure of the public sector in Mexico made coordination
difficult. To overcome this, resources from the PHRD were used to carry out basic
studies under the guidance of SEMARNAT. Inter-sectoral working groups were
established and positive results were achieved, such as the creation of an environmental
mainstreaming office in the SEMARNAT. Importantly, the PHRD gave the sectors an
opportunity to analyze environmental issues from a broader perspective and to set up the
basis for sector coordination. The PHRD helped to strengthen SEMARNAT's leadership
and to improve coordination among sectors. Technical assistance provided by the Bank
team during preparation and execution of studies financed with PHRD funding also
helped to bring sectors together. However, this process deteriorated slightly as
implementation progressed, indicating the need for greater coordination and resources to
achieve results in a complex institutional environment.

2.2. E. Impact of the economic crisis

54. In the first quarter of 2008 economic growth slowed down to 2.7 percent. In early
October, the Mexican government adjusted its GDP growth estimate to 2.0 percent for
2008 and 0.5-1.5 percent for 2009, down from 2.4 and 3.0 percent, respectively. By the
end of 2009 economic decline of GDP reached more than 6 percent.

55. This situation was aggravated by the global financial turmoil that led to a sharp
tightening of financing availability. Sharply increased spreads on corporate bonds and
reduced access to external finance adversely impacted investment and business expansion
plans.

56. With respect to the DPL, the economic downturn posed a threat to completion of all
objectives, as government financing was diverted elsewhere. This situation was addressed
by the supplemental financing requested by the government of Mexico for this DPL
operation. Thus, it was possible to allow a higher level of disbursements under Bank-
financed operations throughout the last quarter of 2008 and an enhanced assistance
program for the FY09-FY10 period focusing on the need to maintain a robust social
safety net through the Supplemental Financing for the Environmental Sustainability DPL.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a) M&E Design: A set of outcome indicators for measuring progress were defined
during the preparation of this loan. These indicators were selected in agreement with
Government counterparts and there was an effort to reflect results in a quantitative
manner. The selected indicators are also a sub-set of the Government's official indicators
for the 2007-2012 National Development Plan. SEMARNAT was in charge of overall
M&E for the loan and for collecting the appropriate data to follow the indicators, with


                                            17
each of the sectoral ministries and agencies involved in the operation (SECTUR, SENER,
CONAFOR, CONAGUA, SAGARPA, and CONAVi) responsible for reporting progress
on each of the loan's components. The Bank and the Government recognized the
importance of establishing a baseline to better access impact and target values were
established for the selected indicators for this operation.

(b) M&E Implementation: Data availability for all indicators was adequate and timely
provided by the Government counterparts. A workshop was held in April 2010, after the
operation's closing date, in which key governmental stakeholders and the Bank Task
Team assessed the status of the operation's outcome indicators. This workshop also
provided an opportunity to share experiences and reflect on lessons learned from the DPL
Program.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any)

57. Although this is not a programmatic operation, Bank support to Mexico in these key
sectors remains strong, with other operations such as the new Water and Climate DPLs
continuing to build on the strong dialog and reforms initiated during the environmental
sustainability DPL.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

58. The operation defined a set of 16 outcome indicators with clear quantitative targets
for the six sectors (tourism, energy, forestry, water, agriculture and housing). All targets
where achieved at a 100 percent level or even surpassed, with the exception of the
indicator related to energy efficiency, in which the methodology for calculation was
revised and the comparison to the previously established baseline was not feasible (see
indicators table on pages iii-vii). Section 3.2 below provides a more detailed description
of the results achieved and the development objectives.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

59. The policies supported by this loan have been important in strengthening the
environmental sustainability pillar of the NDP by ensuring that environment was
considered as both a cross-cutting and a stand-alone issue. In addition to supporting the
country's current development priorities, this DPL's objectives and design were fully
consistent with the Bank country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2008-2013, which is
structured around the same five pillars as the National Development Plan. The CPS refers
to the DPL operation as supporting the environmental pillar's objectives; therefore there
is a close alignment between the goals or expected outcomes of both the CPS and DPL.
Three of the results expected during the CPS's implementation period are consistent with
the DPL's expected outcomes (increased energy generation from renewable sources,
increased number of hectares under sustainable forest management, and increased
coverage of municipal wastewater treatment).

60. Analytical work carried out under the EnvSAL and EnvDPL II was important in
selecting the sectors to focus on in the Environmental Sustainability DPL. Analytical


                                             18
work was carried out by a multidisciplinary team made up of 12 specialists in
environment, environmental engineering, environmental economics, environmental
policy, water resources management, energy, forestry, and operations provided useful
technical guidance and drew on extensive background analyses.

61. With regard to higher-level objectives, the project had significant positive impacts on
environment and natural resources management in line with Millennium Development
Goal #7 and Mexico's overall approach to development.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

62. This operation's main achievements to date include, inter alia:
    · Continued support to strengthen inter-institutional coordination mechanisms
       among participating agencies especially through the Oficina de Transversalidad
       (see below);
    · The inclusion of two new sectors (agriculture and housing) with significant
       actions in mainstreaming environmental sustainability in their policies and
       programs;
    · The approval of a Law for Sustainable Forestry and corresponding regulation, and
       the approval of two laws and regulations that well improve efficiency for the
       Energy Sector.

63. The relevant policy actions and specific achievements with respect to mainstreaming
environmental concerns for each of the six sectors are as follows:

64. Tourism: Based on the positive contributions of local Agenda 21 action plans for
the tourism sector, this operation recognized SECTUR's efforts in promoting the
development of Agenda 21 Action Plans in 17 new tourism destinations, thereby
increasing the number of tourist destinations that adopted such plans, from 55 in 2006 to
72 in 2008. In addition, during the period of this operation, the monitoring of tourism
sustainability indicators of Agenda 21 actions plans was applied in 110 tourism
destinations, representing an increase of 45 destinations when compared to the 2006
baseline (35 destinations). The priority areas for investments were: i) adequate waste
management (sanitary landfills and recycling), ii) promotion of environmental
management in business, and iii) land use planning. In addition to new destinations,
existing indicator systems were updated in key tourist destinations.

65. Other actions included: (i) A 20 percent increase in the number of tourist facilities
such as hotels, restaurants, botanical gardens, zoos, dolphin aquariums, sports clubs, and
golf courses with Certificación de la Calidad Ambiental Turística developed by
SECTUR and PROFEPA in municipal jurisdictions; and (ii) adoption of a unified
sustainable tourism strategy to strengthen the competitiveness of the sector both in the
short and long term. After participation in the program, 72 hotels went on to secure at




                                            19
least one category of the "green globe" certification, an internationally accepted standard
for environmental sustainability of the travel, tourism and hospitality industry.22

66. Additionally, as part of GOM's efforts to promote sustainable nature tourism and
diversify its tourism offerings, a Strategic Plan for Nature Tourism was presented by
SECTUR in collaboration with SEMARNAT, Ministry of Economy, SAGARPA,
SEDESOL, Commission for Development of Indigenous People, National Commission
for natural protected areas (CONANP), FONATUR, Mexican Council for Tourism
Promotion (Consejo de Promoción Turística de Mexico) and CONAFOR in November
2006. This plan provided the basis for preparation of a National Strategy for Sustainable
Tourism Development and Recreation in Natural Protected Areas in Mexico, presented in
September 2007 by SECTUR, in collaboration with SEMARNAT and CONANP.

67. Within the framework of the National Tourism Strategy, SECTUR has been
collaborating with SEMARNAT for the development of ecological land use plans in key
tourism destinations, including the Gulf of California, the Gulf of Mexico and the Baja
California Peninsula.

68. Energy: A major achievement under this operation was the congressional approval
of an energy reform package in October 2008. The package included two key pieces of
legislation: a law to promote the efficient use of energy23 and a law to promote the use of
renewable energy sources.24 These laws lay out an important framework for a significant
shift in energy policy in Mexico towards a focus on greater efficiency in the use of
energy and sustainability on energy production, providing a strong regulatory basis for
including renewable energy sources in the electricity generation mix, including from
independent power producers.

69. This energy sector reform established a new methodology for calculating electricity
savings, excluding the transport efficiency data, which was included in the previous
calculation and it is not related to electricity efficiency. The current data according to the
new methodology is of savings of 20,040 GigaWatt-hours for CY 2009. During loan
preparation the target was set at 23,585 GigaWatt-hours using the previous methodology.
Since the new method of calculation excludes the transport sector, and data on how many
GigaWatt-hours are created by transport is not available, it is difficult to ascertain the
quantitative energy savings attributable to this project.

70. On the positive side, the new system should allow for better monitoring in the future.
The new energy efficiency law also established a national information system on energy
efficiency (Subsistema Nacional de Información), which allows for more consistent data
collection and analyses. The system is set to register, organize, update and disseminate
information about energy consumption, its end-uses, sectors that use this energy, distinct

criteria, certification categories and auditing procedures.

geographical regions using energy, reasons for use, and specific indicators for energy
efficiency. Furthermore, SENER maintains the goal of increasing savings by 50%
compared with 2006 levels, suggesting that further reductions are likely to continue in the
future.

71. In the 2007-2012 Energy Sector Program, the GOM has set a target to increase the
aggregated capacity share of geothermal, wind, and solar based generation from 2 percent
in 2006 to 6 percent by 2012. By end of CY 2009, the share of renewable energy capacity
was 3.71 percent, mainly from geothermal and wind sources. The government is now
projecting a 7.6 percent increase in renewable energy capacity by 2012.

72. During the loan period, PEMEX adopted a Environmental Protection Strategy, which
proposed to implement specific projects between 2007 and 2012 that aim to (i) reduce
emissions of sulfur oxide (SOx) by 30 percent and carbon dioxide (CO2) by 18 percent,
(ii) decrease fresh water consumption by 13 percent; and (iii) eliminate historic
environmental degradation (sites contaminated by hydrocarbon spills or hazardous waste
disposal) by 59 percent. By the end of 2009, the consumption of freshwater by the oil
industry was reduced by 3.1 percent and the sulfur oxide emissions were reduced by 16
percent.25 This strategy established for the first time a conceptual framework for
incorporating environmental sustainability considerations into the business planning
process and investments decisions of PEMEX.

73. Forestry: During the loan period, the Bank provided technical assistance to revise
and update the Forest Fund. The fund finances sustainable forest management operations
and payments for local owners to maintain forest ecosystems as a way of protecting local
watersheds and ensuring the services provided by them. By the end of 2009, 15 million
hectares of forests under sustainable forest management operations were financed by the
Mexican Forest Fund. During the same period, the Payment for Environmental Services
Program expanded to 2.27 million hectares of forest land, encompassing payments to
4,699 titleholders in the 32 Mexican States. The protection of critical watersheds has
important cross-sector implications for water supply and agricultural activities.

74. These activities were made possible by (i) an increase in CONAFOR's budget for
forestry programs, and (ii) an increased availability of loans for sustainable forestry
management with guarantees provided by CONAFOR. One key element in reducing
deforestation and forest degradation is CONAFOR's national forest sector development
program, ProÁrbol, which promotes sustainable forest management and conservation
activities, and was made possible by additional funding to CONAFOR.

75. Additionally, a poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of current and potential
financial instruments for the forestry sector was conducted as part of the operation. This
analysis presented policy options to increase the poor's access to community forest
services under the ProÁrbol program. The DPL operation recognized CONAFOR's pro-
poor programs and actions to improve social and economic equality through improved
access to forest resources. Technical assistance was offered to 400 communities and

ejidos in order to update or prepare Sustainable Management Plans for SEMARNAT's
approval. Additionally, the government has promoted the creation of Community Forest
Enterprises (CFEs) that are the Mexican model of community forest management to
address organizational weaknesses, social capital growth, and improved ecosystem
management in the ejidos.

76. Legal activities, such as the implementation of the General Law for Sustainable
Forestry Development, enacted in 2003, and associated regulations that created
consultation mechanisms and improved ProÁrbol's operational rules were also included.
As a result of these policies, the capacities of vulnerable groups, such as indigenous
peoples and ejidatarios, to understand and exercise their rights under the new legal
framework was strengthened.

77. Water: By end of 2009, 40.7 percent of the flow collected in sewerage networks at
the municipal level was treated, representing a 4.6 percentage points increase in
municipal and industry treatment of wastewater in comparison to the 2006 baseline (36.1
percent). The efficiency of water operators serving localities with 20,000 or more
inhabitants also increased by 6.1 percentage points over the same period. Modernized
infrastructure was established in 598,000 hectares of irrigation districts to improve water
efficiency. Although Mexico's water quality problems remain serious, these actions have
contributed to further Mexico's water agenda by promoting quantitative and qualitative
gains in water pollution reduction and water use efficiency.

78. Additionally, as part of the Environmental Sustainability DPL wastewater discharge
fees for municipalities and industries were included in the 2008 Federal Rights Law. This
law provided that discharge fees would be used to finance approved Municipalities and
industries' wastewater action plans. The action plans included wastewater treatment,
changes in production processes, and discharge control. Operating rules for eight of
CONAGUA's ongoing programs in irrigation and drainage, and water supply and
sanitation were also formalized. These modifications provided specific requirements for
accessing financial resources, including mandates for improved water use, reduction in
water loss, and improvements in water measurement.

79. Under the DPL, guidelines for the planning and implementation of small local
flagship projects were developed in a decentralized participatory manner with
implementation planned over a five-year timeframe. These flagship projects were
designed to demonstrate how decentralized water resource management can work, and to
show solutions to problems of allocation, contamination, and overexploitation, as well as
to improving the economic, social, and health outcomes.

80. Agriculture: The main impacts in agriculture include 161,625 hectares of pastoral
lands converted to improved land management practices (reforestation, managed natural
regeneration, restoration of degraded areas, etc), and 73,350 hectares under "zero tillage
farming systems", with important impacts on soil and water conservation.




                                            22
81. SEMARNAT and SAGARPA also signed an agreement to implement joint actions
aiming to reduce the negative environmental impacts of agricultural practices in the
municipalities within the Mexican Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, which
encompasses three states in the Yucatan Peninsula (Campeche, Quintana Roo and
Yucatan) and Chiapas, focusing on limiting agriculture expansion into new areas and
promoting sustainable management of natural resources. Although these initiatives are
limited in scope and population coverage, they are first steps in reversing a sector policy
that has not been very effective in promoting sustainable development and reducing
poverty.

82. Housing: The Environmental Sustainability operation recognized the development
and approval of cross-sector guidelines for incorporating environmentally sustainable
practices into new housing developments financed under the federal subsidy program. 26
To promote sustainable growth in the sector, the subsidy program's guidelines determine
that those housing units that incorporate certain sustainability criteria will be eligible for
a 20 percent higher subsidy from the federal government. To define and measure this
"sustainability criteria" CONAVI issued in February 2008 the Criteria and Indicators for
Sustainable Housing Developments prepared jointly by CONAVI, SEMARNAT,
SENER, CONAGUA, SEDESOL, and twelve other institutions. These criteria set the
basic standards for housing construction for:

        (i)     Land use, and site locations and characteristics
        (ii)    Energy consumption
        (iii)   Water resources, and

        (iv)    Solid waste management.



83. These sustainability criteria27 were prepared by an inter-sectoral working group,
including the environmental (SEMARNAT), water (CONAGUA), energy (SENER) and
housing (CONAVI) agencies. Despite the fact that the adoption of these criteria is
voluntary, by end of CY 2009, 105,104 new homes received the 20 percent subsidy and
were being constructed following established sustainability criteria, including energy
efficiency and water conservation measures.

84. Since construction standards are a municipal responsibility, CONAVI's programs aim
to build consensus and promote best-practice among both local governments and
developers; however these standards are voluntary and are not enforced. Linking the
criteria to an additional subsidy, however, is expected to create the necessary incentives
for developers.

85. Overall assessment: The contributions to mainstreaming environmental concerns
into development programs have been clearly positive. However, the DPL structure and
limitations to prior actions and constraints on supervision were challenging at times. It
also is not easy to demonstrate in the short-term the combined contribution of sector
reforms towards environmental improvements. In this regard it is also important to
recognize that Bank operations represent a small share of Mexico's overall development
financing and therefore it is difficult to demonstrate a causal linkage between policy
actions and outcomes that may be the result from other actions.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

86. The DPL achieved all of its goals as demonstrated by outcome indicators, making it
feasible to achieve the operation's development objectives following the best-practice
principles:

87. Ownership: The DPL was in response to a GOM request to support specific
programs and areas that reflected national priorities. SHCP and SEMARNAT provided
constant leadership and oversight from the outset and ensured the active participation of
the sectoral line agencies involved in the DPL.

88. A coordinated accountability framework was established: The loan was based on
a coherent framework of previous actions and expected outcomes that were based on the
GOM's program. An operational policy matrix was prepared with this aim including
indicative triggers for the preparation of the loan, prior actions for Board approval and
expected program outcomes based on the government's program. Moreover, some
mechanisms establish under the DPL II to promote cross-sectoral coordination continue
to operate, such as the Inter-sectoral Committee for Projects for Emissions Reductions
and Capture of Green House Gases and the energy sector Technical 21 Advisory Team
that comprises Mexican experts in environment and energy policy issues.

89. Selection of relevant sectors: The DPL included sectors selected in the
programmatic Environment SAL I and Environment DPL II with the support of a
multidisciplinary team. The outcomes achieved have proven that these sectors are critical
to improve environmental policies in key areas of development. This DPL builds on these
outcomes and contributes to further mainstreaming of environmental policies in selected
priority sectors. The new sectors added are relevant for the Mexican development agenda
and to promote environmental sustainability.

90. Participatory approach: A PSIA for the water sector, perhaps the most challenging
of all, was prepared to inform this DPL including consultation with main stakeholders.
Tourism, Agriculture and Forestry programs also incorporate some type of consultation
with main beneficiaries.

91. Accountability framework customized to country circumstances: The DPL is
fully aligned with the sustainable development goals included in the 2007-2012 National



                                              24
Development Plan which aims to strengthen environmental mainstreaming into key
economic sectors.

92. Transparent progress reviews: The proposed one-tranche operation is timed to the
country's budget cycle, with timing agreed in discussions with SHCP based on the
current review of the operation's prior actions.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

93. The provisions of OP8.60 apply to the Environmental Sustainability DPL and the
operation is expected to have a significantly positive poverty and social impact. In
general, improvements in environmental sustainability are expected to benefit the poor
and other groups under the scope of the project.

94. To inform the DPL dialogue during preparation, Poverty and Social Impact
Assessments (PSIAs) were prepared for the water sector, given its likely distributional
impacts (see Annex 4). The rationale for focusing PSIAs on this sector includes their
importance to the GOM's development agenda, and the impacts that this agenda will
have on poor stakeholders.

95. The measures under the DPL include activities that are expected to have positive
poverty impacts:

96. Tourism sector: The implementation of Agenda 21 in 35 tourism sites offers several
important social benefits, including: (i) promoting the participation of local communities
in tourism-related activities, which will enable residents to have a more significant voice
in tourism activities in their communities; (ii) the Local Agenda 21 committees made up
of local residents provide a means for sustained citizen engagement and create a
mechanism through which authorities and developers can be held accountable if citizens'
interests are ignored.

97. Energy sector: Policy reforms supported by the loan will help to ensure access to
safe and clean energy and related services, especially for the poor. Reducing pollution
from energy will reduce costs to human health, especially respiratory diseases and the
economic losses associated with such health programs.28

98. Forestry sector: Resource allocations and rights in the forestry sector have tended to
skewed in favor of larger, private landowners. Under this operation, increased budgeting
for CONAFOR's pro-poor programs provided greater access to financing and technical



28
  According to a survey conducted by the INE, the average annual total cost of the treatment of frequent
respiratory diseases in Mexico City ranges between MXN 13,565 (asthma) and MXN 8,641 (bronchitis).



                                                    25
assistance, specifically targeting ejidos and indigenous communities, to promote more
socially equitable management of forest resources.

99. Water sector: Reforms under the DPL aimed at increasing water use efficiency and
reducing water pollution contribute to better access to clean water and improved health
outcomes among the poorest segments of the population. Complementary activities
under the flagship projects (proyectos emblemáticos) recognized by this operation helped
to improve planning practices and integrated sub-basin/basin management plans with the
participation of all relevant stakeholders.

100. Agriculture sector: Activities recognized by the DPL sought to protect the
livelihoods of small farmers and indigenous communities in the forested areas of the
Mexican Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. This operation assisted the GOM in
developing a large scale joint initiative in agriculture for ecosystem preservation.
Representatives from SEMARNAT and SAGARPA, as well as other agriculture and
environmental stakeholders, developed and signed an agricultural sustainability agenda to
promote the sustainable management of natural resources within low-productivity areas
of the Mexico Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (CBMM). This joint agenda increased
the number of farmers following the environmental procedures set out in the Operating
Rules. SEMARNAT and SAGARPA's commitment to more effectively coordinate their
environment-related policies was an important first step in addressing the sector's
environmental challenges, as environmental concerns had not been systematically
incorporated in sectoral reforms in the past. Furthermore, since the joint agenda
addressed poverty and productivity, the operation also helped ensure that poor farmers
benefit from these programs. Legal measures to establish limits on agricultural land
expansion by agro-businesses and regulations to prevent land use conversion help to
ensure the security of poor, small-scale farmers.

101. Housing sector: The actions recognized by the DPL in the housing sector
supported increased access to housing for the poor. The loan also helped to incorporate
financial incentives for voluntary compliance with environmental guidelines for new
home construction financed under the federal subsidy program. These incentives have
been offered to low-income perspective homeowners and affordable housing developers.
In 2007, the government program begun to provide loans and credit-linked subsidies for
housing acquisition and improvement to citizens earning between 1 and 5 MW (around
US$1,800 and US$9,000 per year). For housing developers of developments geared to
low-income clients (under 4 MW), the program supported a 20 percent larger government
subsidy for new developments that met sustainability criteria. The government sponsored
subsidy and voluntary compliance programs reduced the risk that the increased costs of
compliance would make it difficult for the poor to access the final product.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

102. This DPL contributed to the institutional strengthening efforts by creating an
unprecedented level of dialogue and information exchange between different sectors on
environmental issues, especially through the creation of a new office for environmental
mainstreaming in the environment ministry.

103. SEMARNAT created an environmental mainstreaming office, the Oficina de
Transversalidad, responsible for establishing and following indicators used to monitor
the Ministry's joint agendas with other line ministries. This office played a key role in
overseeing M&E implementation and the experience gained by SEMARNAT during the
project execution was crucial to enhance its role in the promotion of environment
sustainability as a cross-sector activity. In terms of environmental mainstreaming, the
creation of the office for mainstreaming was a major accomplishment in that is served to
elevate the environment ministry to a level of importance on par with other line ministries
related to important economic activities in Mexico.

104. Another important institutional change was the long-awaited incorporation of the
agriculture sector in environmental sustainability efforts. This DPL marks an important
first step in what will be a fruitful partnership between agricultural and environmental
sectors in Mexico. Such collaboration will ensure that Mexican agriculture grows in a
way that is both economically and environmentally sound.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Low

105. The risk to development outcome is low because of the following reasons:

   a. The DPL has achieved all its objectives and has been able to mainstream
      environmental sustainability as a key factor in all the sectors involved.

   b. The DPL benefited from strong government ownership of the reforms and the
      GOM is fully committed to its medium-term sustainable development goals.

   c. The recent reforms adopted in the energy, water, and housing sectors and the
      expansion of programs targeting poor producers in the forestry and agriculture
      sectors will also support sustainable development.

   d. Multi-sector coordination has ensured a broader discussion of the issues and
      promoted buy-in with respect to strategy proposals and instruments from the
      sectors.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory


                                            27
106. The DPL benefited from studies, experiences, and lessons learned from the
EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II. Discussions and consultations conducted for preparation of
the National Development Plan also contributed to define priorities and key action areas.
A core team with ample experience working in Mexico and experienced in the design of
environmental DPLs, helped to design the operation. For the preparation of the DPL,
three preparation missions were conducted, comprising specialists in environment,
economics, water, energy, urban planning, financial management, and operations. Bank
specialists in other sectors under the DPL provided additional support. The team provided
strong technical guidance during preparation of the operation, included an adequate level
of expertise, and drew on extensive background analyses to provide advice to the
Government.

107. This DPL also took into account recommendations from the Second
Environmental Performance Review for Mexico carried out by the OECD. This study
provided an independent assessment of the country's environmental challenges,
particularly the need to integrate environmental concerns into economic and social
policy. This recommendation and the defined sector environmental priorities were fully
consistent with the objectives of the DPL.

108. The PHRD grant also supported two workshops with various government
institutions to review lessons learned from the EnvDPL Program and how best to build on
the lessons in the design of the proposed operation. The team provided technical support
in preparation of terms of reference and the review of various studies conducted under the
PHRD grant.

109. Positive aspects of Bank performance at appraisal include:
   · Well-designed coordination mechanisms to address the difficulties associated
      with the complex institutional structure of agencies involved. Concrete actions
      feasible to produce results were selected for the key sectors incorporated in the
      DPL.
   · A focus on monitoring and evaluation including a monitoring framework
      including baselines as well as concrete, measurable indicators closely linked with
      the actions supported by the operation. As a result, the policy matrix was
      designed with a limited number of outcome indicators closely linked to the
      supported policy actions.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
   Rating: Satisfactory

110. The Bank team maintained a continuous dialogue with the client to evaluate
progress in carrying out Program reforms and to continue to provide technical support,
although no official supervision missions were conducted after loan disbursement. Bank
procedures for supervision of a DPL were not completely followed as prescribed. In
spite of this, the team maintained a close partnership with SEMARNAT and supported its
efforts to coordinate all sectors involved to ensure achievement of all the DPL's goals.


                                           28
After closing the operation, the Bank and SEMARNAT organized a workshop to review
results and discuss lessons learned during the program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
   Rating: Satisfactory

111. As Quality at Entry was rated satisfactory and Quality of Supervision rated
satisfactory, the overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. As explained above,
official supervision could have been better, and prior actions limitations constrained the
team in some areas. However, the policy dialogue was strong and promoted commitment
to policy reforms under the Environmental Sustainability DPL, warranting the
satisfactory rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
   Rating: Satisfactory

112. The Government demonstrated ownership and commitment to policies promoted
under the DPL, ensuring that levels of human and budgetary resources were adequate to
ensure institutional capacity. The operation was included in its National Development
Plan (NDP) 2007-2012 and annual reports of implementation of the NDP, published each
September, included information to measure progress on the loan's work in assuring
environmental sustainability.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: Satisfactory

113. SHCP and SEMARNAT provided constant leadership and oversight from the
outset and ensured the active participation of the sectoral line agencies involved in the
DPL. SEMARNAT was responsible for coordinating actions among other concerned
agencies. SEMARNAT played a critical role providing guidance and support to ensure
compliance with agreed policy reforms.

114. Sectoral ministries and agencies involved in this operation, including SHCP,
SAGARPA, SEMARNAT, SENER, SECTUR, CONAFOR, CONAVI, and CONAGUA,
were responsible for implementation of the proposed components of the operation and for
reporting progress. All of these agencies complied with outcome indicators established
for measuring the operations' achievement of development objectives agreed during
preparation.

115. SEMARNAT was also in charge of overall monitoring and evaluation for the loan
and for collecting the appropriate data to follow the indicators with each of the line
ministries and agencies involved in the operation and played a key role in overseeing
M&E implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance


                                            29
   Rating: Satisfactory

116. The GOM, particularly SHCP and SEMARNAT, participated actively in the
preparation of the EnvDPL, facilitated and coordinated actions with responsible agencies,
closely followed the policy matrix, reported to the Bank on progress and helped to
organize a closing workshop to collect the views of participants.

117. Several publications prepared by SEMARNAT will help to demonstrate the
positive impact of policies promoted under the DPL and further mainstream
environmental sustainability across sectors.


6. Lessons Learned

118. Comprehensive mainstreaming of environmental sustainability. The adoption of
environmental sustainability as a cross-cutting priority faces many challenges.
Maintaining the importance of environment as an entity itself, while also mainstreaming
environmental concerns into all sectors, required delicate intervention and coordination
between many stakeholders. This approach required the adoption of key sustainability
principles in each sector involved and the selection of specific actions contributing to this
end.

119. Long-term approach is required. The DPL achieved all its goals and achieved
positive contributions to policy reforms and programs in all sector included. However, it
is important to recognize that despite progress achieved, continuous capacity building and
support will be needed to ensure that environment remains a priority into the future.
Therefore in the case of environment a programmatic approach is recommended. It is a
good sign, however, that the Bank has been able to establish a positive dialog with the
Mexican government that will help to ensure sustainability. Moreover, several Bank
operations in the sectors included will also contribute to continued environmental
mainstreaming.

120. Inter-institutional coordination is key. The complex institutional framework of the
operation required substantial efforts on the part of participating entities underwent
learning and adapted significant behavioral changes. The commitment of all sectors and
the leadership of SEMARNAT and SHCP helped to establish a successful coordination
process which provided opportunity for knowledge sharing among the different sectors.

121. Budgetary support to inter-institutional coordination is necessary. As mentioned,
the Japan Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) provided important
resources (over US$350, 000) that allowed for the development of key analytical work
and stakeholder participation in the EnvDPL and provided a positive incentive for
mainstreaming environmental concerns in key economic sectors. This demonstrates that
additional resources, such as those provided by the PHRD, can provide technical
assistance to strengthen coordination among key stakeholders. This is an important
option for overcoming coordination constrains. However, this DPL did not benefit from



                                             30
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), in which the Bank commits to support a series
of advisory and analytical activities linked to the DPLs' main objectives. Because an
MOU creates clarity and allows for more flexibility, this tool should be considered as an
integral component of future DPLs.

122. Need for incentives for participation. Under Mexico's fiscal policy, loans do not
increase aggregate fiscal resources available to the environment and other sectoral
agencies since the fiscal envelope is defined by the binding primary fiscal surplus targets.
This represents a limitation to participation since some sectors perceive this type of
operation as a burden rather than an incentive. A positive aspect is that to comply with
the loan agreement, the GOM ensures that levels of human and budgetary resources are
adequate to ensure institutional capacity. Some sectors perceive this as an opportunity to
promote policies and programs that otherwise would have a limited budget allocation and
ensure the sustainability of priority activities. Again, an MOU could be useful in this
regard to outline additional activities that could be used to leverage participation.

123. Bank's value added in technical assistance and past experience. The GOM has
enough resources to finance reforms for the environment sector and the Bank's financial
contribution represents a minimum share of available resources. The request for Bank
support has underscored the added value of the operation both in terms of technical
assistance provided and the institutionalization of spaces for inter-sectoral cooperation
and dialogue. Bank expertise from operations in other countries can also help ensure that
best practices are used and south-south cooperation is implemented where possible.
Technical Assistance Loans (TAL) linked to the DPL operations represent an option to
overcome some of the constraints of inter-sectoral coordination mentioned above, and
can facilitate providing support in a timely manner.

124. Importance of strong and committed local champions. To ensure that inter-
institutional coordination efforts are sustained it is essential that an entity take a leading
role in overseeing these efforts, particularly as participating entities undergo an initial
learning process and define their functions within inter-sector working groups. SHCP and
SEMARNAT assumed this coordinating role, helping to ensure success.

125. Importance of measurable and specific indicators. Clearly-defined baseline and
target values to monitor progress and evaluate outcomes, as well as a relevant set of
measurable and meaningful outcome indicators, are essential for a results driven process.
In the case of the Environment DPL Program the indicators system were detailed and
ambitious. In the case of this operation six prior actions were established and a
meaningful set of indicators was defined for the key selected sectors in the project, thus
facilitating monitoring.

126. Supervision. Because the period between approval and disbursement of this single
tranche operation was only two months only one formal supervision mission was
conducted and an ISR was not produced. Nonetheless, the team ensured that all previous
actions were met, supporting SEMARNAT in its role as inter-sectoral coordinator and
providing analytical support to the sectors in the operation. The difficulties in



                                             31
supervision and encouraging participation created by the DPL structure should be kept in
mind in project evaluation: in the case of DPLs, the Bank does not have a direct
involvement in actions implemented and the project financing usually represents a small
share of Government Program overall financing.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

127. The Ministry of Environmental and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) reviewed
the draft ICR and provided comments on 17 June 2010 (See Annex 5). The agency
agreed with the report's findings. In addition, the Secretariat noted that the DPL
strengthened national actions and capacities related to environmental management, which
allowed Mexico to continue its effective leadership role in the United Nations climate
negotiation processes.

128. The Ministry commended new Bank policies, which in contrast to the previous
structural adjustment process allow for a more programmatic approach that allows the
country to participate in designing and tailoring appropriate development policies.
SEMARNAT noted that this structure was particularly helpful in allowing the partnership
with the Bank on environmental mainstreaming to continue through the change in the
administration in Mexico. The results achieved in the Environmental Sustainability DPL
were especially commendable considering that the new administration with many new
officials implemented policy changes or continued efforts begun in the previous
administration in a timely manner. The Secretariat also wished to especially emphasize
the financial support from PHDR that made possible 11 highly useful studies related to
the six focus areas for mainstreaming under the loan.

Annex 3. Summary of Stakeholder Workshop

An in-depth follow-up of this Environmental Policy Lending Program took place through
workshops held after the closing of each operation, in which key government
stakeholders and the Bank Task Team assessed the status of the operation's outcomes
indicators as well as the target values for the next operation (as in the case of the two first
operations, Environmental SAL I and Environment DPL II). These workshops provided
an opportunity to reflect on the impacts in each sector and helped indentify lessons that
could be applied to improve design and implementation arrangements for future
operations.

The key results and lessons learned from the Environmental SAL I and Environment
DPL II operations were discussed in a workshop held in Mexico City on February 12,
2008. The results of this workshop were summarized in the ICR prepared for the two
operations (Report No: ICR0000737).

In the case of the current operation, the Environmental Sustainability DPL, a workshop
was held on April 12-15, 2010 in Mexico City. All six sectors involved in the operation
participated discussed the a first draft of this ICR report, providing inputs on the
indicators table, main results of the operation, and lessons learned, which are reflected
throughout this report. This participatory approach was commended by the client.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
(Will be provided by Borrower)

The following comments on the draft ICR were provided by SEMARNAT on 17 June
2010:

·   Para fortalecer la construcción de la política ambiental del Gobierno federal, una de
    cuyas características centrales es la de ser necesariamente de carácter transversal, en
    el año 2002 se aprovechó el apoyo del Banco Mundial a las políticas de desarrollo
    para estructurar nuevas operaciones relacionadas con el apoyo a políticas de
    desarrollo sustentable.

·   Así, se diseñó el Programa (Environment Structural Adjustment Loan (EnvSAL, por
    sus siglas en inglés), comprendido en tres operaciones, EnvSAL I, EnvDPL II y
    EnvDPL III, cuyo objetivo fue apoyar los esfuerzos del gobierno para balancear el
    desarrollo socioeconómico con la protección y el mejoramiento del ambiente en
    varios sectores de la administración pública federal.

·   En el marco de ese Programa, se firmó el crédito del Banco Mundial de octubre de
    2008, por un financiamiento de 300.75 millones de dólares al Gobierno Mexicano,
    para desarrollar el programa "Desarrollo de Políticas para la Sustentabilidad
    Ambiental" (DPL III).

·   La crisis económica iniciada a finales de 2007 afectó a la economía mexicana,
    particularmente por la caída de las exportaciones hacia los Estados Unidos, y a las
    finanzas públicas, por lo cual fue necesario ampliar el monto de la operación original.
    Así, el financiamiento suplementario para el DPL se incrementó en 401 millones de
    dólares.

·   El objetivo general del programa fue el diseño, instrumentación y evaluación de
    políticas públicas y acciones de transversalidad e integración con los sectores de
    turismo, energía, forestal, agua, agricultura y vivienda.

·   En dicho préstamo se adoptaron los siguientes indicadores los cuales fueron
    evaluados directamente por cada una de las dependencias involucradas (SECTUR,
    SENER, CONAFOR, CONAGUA, SAGARPA y CONAVI)

       Turismo: Integrar las consideraciones ambientales en la continuidad de la agenda
       del sector del turismo

        Energía: Integrar las consideraciones ambientales en la continuidad de la agenda
       del sector de energía

        Forestal: Aumento de la ayuda para la sustentabilidad forestal


                                             35
           Agua: Aumentar la eficiencia del uso del agua y reducir la contaminación de
           agua

           Agricultura: Integración de las consideraciones ambientales en la agenda del
           sector agricultura

           Vivienda: Integración de las guías transversales que incorporen prácticas
           ambientales en la agenda del sector vivienda

·   La operación de DPL apoyó el desarrollo y la aprobación de las pautas
    intersectoriales para incorporar ambientalmente las prácticas de desarrollo
    sustentable. Una de las prioridades principales de la SEMARNAT ha sido apoyar la
    política de transversalidad con los sectores de Gobierno involucrados directamente
    con el medio ambiente y los recursos naturales. El resultado ha sido la integración
    intergubernamental, que para esta tercera etapa (ENVDPL III) y con los resultados
    anteriores pensamos que el mecanismo legal y regulador establecido bajo ENVDPL II
    a través de la promulgación de leyes y regulaciones proporcionan una base para
    asegurar la continuidad de las políticas y el plan del programa que fija la formulación
    de las estrategias medioambientales del sector, fortaleciendo la base para la
    continuidad de las políticas.

·   La operación de referencia se realizó en el contexto de un nuevo gobierno federal, por
    ello, además de los objetivos de fortalecimiento de las políticas transversales para el
    manejo y aprovechamiento sustentable de los recursos naturales y del medio
    ambiente, se otorgó nueva prioridad al tema de cambio climático.

·   Es importante resaltar que el Gobierno federal valora los cambios en el enfoque de los
    préstamos del Banco Mundial. La transformación de los créditos fundados en el
    enfoque de ajuste estructural fueron sustituidos por los de desarrollo de políticas, los
    cuales son más adecuados para apoyar a los gobiernos para el diseño, realización y
    fortalecimiento de sus políticas de desarrollo soberanas, lo cual permite una
    definición de prioridades en función de los compromisos de gobierno y de las
    características y circunstancias de cada país.

·   Por ejemplo, en el caso del crédito de referencia fue posible adecuar la cooperación
    del banco a las prioridades de un nuevo gobierno bajo los mismos criterios generales
    del programa diseñado con el Banco.
