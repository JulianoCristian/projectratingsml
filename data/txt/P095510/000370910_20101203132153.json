Loan for Mexico were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the adoption of\n            environmental sustainability as a cross-cutting priority\n            faces many challenges. Maintaining the importance of\n            environment as an entity itself, while also mainstreaming\n            environmental concerns into all sectors, require delicate\n            intervention and coordination between many stakeholders.\n            This approach required the adoption of key sustainability\n            principles in each sector involved and the selection of\n            specific actions contributing to this end. Under\n            Mexico's fiscal policy, loans do not increase aggregate\n            fiscal resources available to the environment and other\n            sectoral agencies since the fiscal envelope is defined by\n            the binding primary fiscal surplus targets. This represents\n            a limitation to participation since some sectors perceive\n            this type of operation as a burden rather than an incentive.\n            To ensure that inter-institutional coordination efforts are\n            sustained it is essential that an entity take a leading role\n            in overseeing these efforts, particularly as participating\n            entities undergo an initial learning process and define\n            their functions within inter-sector working groups.\n            Clearly-defined baseline and target values to monitor\n            progress and evaluate outcomes, as well as a relevant set of\n            measurable and meaningful outcome indicators, are essential\n            for a results driven process."}, "docdt": "2010-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
