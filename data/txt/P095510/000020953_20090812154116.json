The objective was to\n            analyze the implications for sustainable development issues\n            as diverse as water management, development of financial\n            instruments for the sound management of forest resources,\n            strategies for development of tourism with sustainability,\n            tax incentives for proper utilization of natural resources\n            and environmental protection. To meet the social needs of\n            the population, to promote the growth of the economy and\n            also to incorporate into development policy the\n            preservation, protection and rational utilization of\n            ecosystems and the environment requires the integration of\n            sustainability into public policy building. Faced with\n            environmental degradation and destruction and degradation of\n            natural resources, the alternative is not extreme\n            conservation and implementation of legal constraints.\n            Rather, exercise of authority simply is not enough in a\n            society characterized by deep inequalities and deprivation\n            for large groups of people. Therefore, the federal\n            government has promoted the mainstreaming in public policies\n            to build a situation which has great impact on natural\n            resources and the environment."}, "docdt": "2008-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
