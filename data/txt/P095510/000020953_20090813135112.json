consider promotion of policies adopted within institutional\n            and legal frameworks.

The study demonstrated\n            that in the last two decades the tourism industry in Mexico\n            has grown significantly to become one of the largest in the\n            world. This growth is due in large part to the development\n            approach infrastructure that has been used, which is\n            strictly aligned with market demand within the national and\n            international tourist scene."}, "docdt": "2005-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
