It unveiled innovative\n            strategies for energy efficiency, power generation,\n            transportation, forestry, and land use. Mexico has emerged\n            as a global leader in the climate change arena and the\n            Development Policy Loan was the first operation of its kind\n            for the World Bank. Carbon generation in the Mexican economy\n            has been cut by 5 percent since 1993, and more than 100\n            projects to cut greenhouse gas emissions, including wind\n            energy, urban transport, and waste management, have been\n            launched. Mexico ranks twelfth in the world for greenhouse\n            gas emissions and second in Latin America after Brazil.\n            Climate models developed by various researchers predicted\n            that Mexico will suffer disproportionate effects from\n            climate change including more frequent floods and drought.\n            Climate change was also expected to reduce rainfall levels\n            in Mexico. Climate change strategies already have been\n            developed under the partnership of Bank. Mexico is a model\n            among developed and developing countries on climate change\n            and ranks fourth in the world in terms of per capita\n            greenhouse gas emission trends in energy, transport,\n            residential and industrial sectors, overall greenhouse gas\n            emissions and climate policy."}, "docdt": "2008-10-13T08:20:05Z"}
