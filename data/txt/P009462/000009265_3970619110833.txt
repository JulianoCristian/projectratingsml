IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION NOTE
LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS TRANSPORT AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Cr. 2263-BD)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Note (ICN) for the Liquefied Petroleum Gas
Transport and Distribution Project, for which Credit 2263-BD in the amount of SDR 49.8 million
(US$67.2 million equivalent) was approved on June 11, 1991. The Development Credit
Agreement and Project Agreements were signed on June 21, 1991. The credit became effective,
after three extensions, on September 30, 1992.
The credit closed on June 30, 1996, without the project being implemented. Till closing,
a total of SDR 603,325.530 (US$838,434.25 equivalent) was disbursed for meeting the cost of
consultancy of Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited.  On August 7, 1996, the
undisbursed balance of SDR 49,196,674 (US$70.6 million equivalent) was cancelled.  The
Canadian International Development Agency had been expected to provide SDR 1.4 million
(US$1.9 million equivalent) for technical assistance components of the project, but an agreement
for this cofinancing was never finalized.
The ICN was prepared by Mr. A.S.M. Bashirul Huq of Bangladesh Resident Mission
(SAIBG). It was reviewed by Messrs. Per Ljung (Chief, Energy and Project Finance Division)
and Fakhruddin Ahmed (Acting Director/Project Advisor), Country Department 1, South Asia
Region.
This ICN was prepared on the basis of materials in the project files and discussions with
the two agencies responsible for implementing the project (Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company
Limited and Liquefied Petroleum Gas Limited) as well as officials of Petrobangla and
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation.

1I.    Background
1.    This is an Implementation Completion Note (ICN) for the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)
Transport and Distribution Project for which the Board approved a credit of SDR 49.8 million (US$62.7
million equivalent) on June 11, 1991. The Credit and Project Agreements were signed on June 21, 1991.
Credit effectiveness was extended three times to enable the Government to meet the conditions of
effectiveness. It was declared effective on September 30, 1992 after a year's delay, and with a waiver to
a condition of effectiveness.
III.   Project Objective
2.     The main project objective was to assist Bangladesh in carrying out an economic and least-cost
household and commercial energy supply strategy through the substitution of LPG for kerosene and
commercial fuelwood. The project was designed to assist in (a) reducing the foreign exchange drain
from oil imports; (b) alleviating bio-mass energy shortages and promoting social equity between the
country's eastern region and the less developed western zone; (c) establishing LPG prices in accord with
economic efficiency and financial viability principles; (d) developing a suitable institutional framework
for efficient LPG development and operations; (e) promoting an environmentally and operationally safe
petroleum industry; and (f) facilitating private sector involvement in LPG transport and distribution.
IV.   Project Description
3.     The LPG Transport and Distribution Project was intrinsically linked to the implementation of a
project approved in 1985, i.e., Second Gas Development Project (SGDP, Cr. 1586-BD) which provided,
inter alia for construction of the north-south pipeline, and drilling of nine gas wells. The SGDP project
also included financing for the upstream facilities for (a) gas dehydration and hence recovery of LPG and
condensate by-products; and (b) pipeline transport and fractionation of these liquids at the Ashuganj
central products terminal, as well as on-site at Kailashtilla on a small scale. The LPG Transport and
Distribution Project (Cr. 2263-BD) was designed to support the downstream transport, and distribution of
LPG in cylinders (bottled gas) that was to be produced from the northern gas fields of Bangladesh
starting from FY94. Two implementing agencies were designated for the following project components:



2
Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited (RPGCL) for LPG transport:
(a)    construction of storage facilities for LPG and condensates, and acquisition of related
equipment and spare parts, at the Ashuganj NGL fractionation plant;
(b)    construction of an LPG-dedicated pipeline from Ashuganj to Elenga (about 165 km);
(c)    directional drilling works for about four river crossings for the LPG pipeline;
Liquefied Petroleum Gas Limited (LPGL) for LPG bottling:
(d)    construction of LPG bottling plants and storage facilities at Elenga and Kailashtilla;
(e)    acquisition of cylinders, valves and regulators for the Elenga and Kailashtilla bottling
plants;
(f)   rehabilitation of the LPG bottling plant at Chittagong; and
(c)    acquisition of related equipment with spare parts for (d) and (f) above.
4.    The project's technical assistance (TA) component included construction implementation
supervision for both RPGCL and LPGL, as well as project support, capacity building and policy
development.  Project support and capacity building TA was intended to include (a) intensive
management and operations assistance and training for RPGCL and LPGL; (b) for RPGCL the following
studies: (i) feasibility study for incremental natural gas liquids (NGL) processing and distribution; (ii) a
technical, economic and financial assessment of compressed natural gas development options and
preparation of a commercialization strategy; and (c) for LPGL, the following activities: (i) preparation
of detailed LPG market development plan; and (ii) establishment of a program to enhance the role of
Bangladeshi women in the retail distribution of LPG cylinders and stoves, and to train marketing/sales
agents in the development and promotion of energy efficient cooking stoves; and (iii) a technical
assessment of cracking surplus naptha to produce LPG. For the policy development TA, RPGCL and
LPGL were to prepare a full assessment of petroleum sector environmental and operational safety
standards and practices, with a view to identifying urgently required equipment as well as regulatory and
institutional reform.
V.    Evaluation of Project Objectives
5.    The objectives of the project were clear but somewhat ambitious. Project design took advantage
of lessons and experience gained from the two earlier lending operations in the gas sector (viz.,
Bakhrabad Gas Development Project, Credit 1091-BD and SGDP, Credit 1586-BD). Under the Energy
Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC, Credit 1999-BD), it was agreed that new capital investments would be
focused on the priority projects under an agreed Priority Investment Program (PIP). The project was a
part of the PIP and long-term development plan agreed and monitored annually with Government of
Bangladesh (GOB), Petrobangla and Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC). The project's TA
component included the provision of a management and operations assistance team beyond the normal
training provided by the equipment contract and monitored by the supplier. No equipment was to be
cofinanced, and ESAC sectoral reforms were to be reinforced in the project. The Staff Appraisal Report
estimated a financial internal rate of return of 35.3% for RPGCL and 18.9% for LPGL, while the
economic rate of return for the project was estimated at 20%. However, the high expectation of



3
production of 100,000 mtpy of LPG and a higher quantity of NGL may have been too optimistic. At
present, the feasibility of a new investment in the gas sector is being studied, and initial findings indicate
that the gas volume from which LPG would be extracted would have to be increased substantially to
make a project viable. Further study on this subject is underway.
6.    The Staff Appraisal Report identified the main project risk to be implementation delays,
particularly related to procurement. Because of the linkage of the SGDP Project (para 3) in building the
Ashunganj plant for use by the follow-on LPG Project, the award of the contract for the Ashuganj plant
under SGDP was made a condition of credit effectiveness for the LPG Project. As discussed in para 12
below, GOB requested a waiver of this condition to permit implementation to begin on other project
components. Because GOB was pursuing a self-financed procurement plan for the Ashuganj plant in all
earnest and had initiated negotiations with the lowest bidder, the credit was declared effective in
September 1992, and it was IDA's expectation that award would be made within a reasonable time.
However, due to protracted procurement procedures which occurred afterwards, the contract was never
awarded.
VI.   Beneficiaries of the Project
7.    The two project beneficiaries were the RPGCL and LPGL, which are wholly owned subsidiaries
of Petrobangla and BPC respectively. Under the project, RPGCL was the beneficiary for the Ashuganj
storage facilities and the pipeline from Ashuganj to Elenga. LPGL was the beneficiary for the storage
facilities and LPG bottling plants at Kailashtilla and Elenga, cylinders and retail filling units. The two
entities were also the beneficiaries for the project's implementation supervision and other TA
components, as applicable.
8.    For upstream functions, Sylhet Gas Fields Limited would own and operate NGL recovery
facilities as part of its responsibilities to produce pipeline quality gas. Petrobangla decided that one
Petrobangla operating company (OC) should assume the responsibility for transporting and fractionating
NGL, which otherwise would be divided between three different OCs, i. e., Sylhet Gas Fields Limited,
Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited and the Bangladesh Gas Fields Company
Limited. A single OC responsible for NGLs was essential because it was estimated that Petrobangla
could be producing up to about 100,000 mtpy of LPG and a higher quantity of condensate as more gas
was produced.  Centralized accountability, quality control and monitoring of operational and
environmental safety would be facilitated. Further, only one transfer price within Petrobangla would be
required, compared to three internal transfer prices if NGL operations were spread over the existing OCs.
This approach would support the ESAC institutional reform objective of organizing the operations of the
various Petrobangla OCs along functional lines.
VII.  Implementation Experience and Results
9.    The project had a promising start in 1992 when RPGCL initiated the appointment of consultants
for the feasibility study of the Ashuganj-Elenga LPG pipeline. The consultants commenced their work in
earnest and completed the design of the pipeline and also the bid documents. LPGL also acquired and
developed land, and constructed office buildings at Elenga and Kailashtilla for the bottling plants.
10.   The LPG Project depended on the completion of RPGCL's NGL fractionation facility at
Ashuganj for which financing was provided under SGDP (para 6). The Ashuganj plant was intended to
separate LPG (propane and butane) from NGL coming from the Kailashtilla gas fields. However, the
contract was never awarded, and the SGDP project closed in December 1993 without construction of the



4
Ashuganj plant. Thus no LPG was available for transportation and distribution under the LPG Project, and
it closed without being implemented.
11.   Credit effectiveness for the LPG Project was extended three times to enable GOB to award the
contract for the Ashuganj plant under SGDP. At the time of Board presentation of the LPG Project in
June 1991, the award of the contract for the Ashuganj plant seemed imminent as bid evaluation was
competed. However, when Petrobangla/PIU submitted the bid evaluation report and the draft contract for
the Ashuganj plant for the final clearance, GOB rejected the draft agreement on the grounds that a NGL
fractionation plant was not within the scope of the government's project documents and that there was not
enough competition since only two bidders responded to the tender. At IDA's request, GOB agreed to
reconsider its decision, but while GOB was reconsidering its action, the period of bid validity expired.
Subsequently the contractor proposed for the contract award increased its prices, and this action was not
acceptable to IDA. GOB then considered the option of awarding the contract to the second lowest bidder,
but given the large price difference, it was decided to re-tender the plant using its own funds.
12.   After GOB had initiated its self-funded procurement, it requested IDA in September 1992 to
declare the credit effective to enable GOB to initiate implementation of selected items which were
considered to be unaffected by the Ashuganj plant delays (para 6). These components accounted for
about 55% of the credit and included (a) urgent repair and rehabilitation work of the existing LPG
bottling and storage facilities at Chittagong; (b) phased replacement and supply expansion of LPG
cylinders, valves and regulators; and (c) NGL gas storage facilities at Ashuganj to enable the testing of
the Kailashtilla turbo-expander and Rashidpur dehydration plants constructed under SGDP. IDA agreed
to declare the credit effective, but disbursements for the Ashuganj-Elenga LPG pipeline and the LPG
bottling plants at Kailashtilla and Elenga were made conditional to the award of contract for the
Ashuganj plant.
13.   Even though the credit was declared effective in September 1992, implementation progress of
the components described above did not proceed as envisaged, except for the rehabilitation of the LPG
bottling plant at Chittagong for which selection of consultants was initiated. As a result of the unusual
implementation delays and LPGL's hesitance to proceed with procurement in light of uncertainty of
progress on the Ashuganj plant, the phased replacement of LPG cylinders, valves and regulators was
delayed initially. Also, enough cylinders had been purchased by LPGL under the Refinery Modification
Project (Credit 1 749-BD) to meet immediate requirements. Because of the policy changes making LPG
and LPG cylinders importable by the private sector, a question arose as to the rationale of IDA support
for LPG bottling/marketing by a public sector company. The construction of storage facilities for NGL
could not proceed because of the uncertainty with regard to the funding of the Ashuganj plant.
14.   In early 1993, GOB abandoned its efforts to procure the plant with its own funds when the
selected firm did not appear too keen to complete contract negotiations, and kept introducing
unreasonable conditions. One of the reasons for its hesitance was the risks of doing business with GOB
in the absence of support from an international financier. In May 1993, GOB approached IDA for
support, but IDA advised GOB to seek financing from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
(OECF) or other sources. However, other financing did not materialize. From a practical point of view,
it was considered unwise to build the LPG pipeline from Ashuganj to Elenga and the bottling plants
without the Ashuganj fractionation plant.



5
15.   In January 1996, GOB requested IDA for a one-year extension of the credit. No further initiative
was taken by the beneficiary companies for implementing the other components of the project until late
in May 1996, when LPGL sent in a tender document to IDA for approval to invite proposals for
appointment of consultants for rehabilitation of the bottling plant at Chittagong. However, based on the
long delays and non-performance during the four years the project was active, IDA declined both
requests and the project closed on June 30, 1996.
VIII. Performance of the IDA
16.   IDA's extensive experience in the gas sector of other countries as well as in the previous two gas
projects in Bangladesh helped the Borrower identify and prepare the project. Had it been implemented,
the project would have provided a least-cost household fuel derived from the country's LPG-rich natural
gas to replace commercial bio-mass fuel and imported kerosene oil, and thereby reducing deforestation
and improving environmental pollution. It would also have contributed to a valued addition to the LPG
content of the natural gas. However, the fate of the LPG Project was sealed when IDA waived the
condition of effectiveness for the award of the contract for the Ashuganj plant under SGDP. The reasons
given by GOB for requesting the waiver were valid (para 12), but given the history of protracted
procurement actions in Bangladesh, IDA should have been more pessimistic in its expectation that the
award of the contract would be awarded without further delays. In retrospect, IDA should not have
waived this crucial condition of effectiveness. Standing firm on the requirement for award of the
contract under SGDP might have encouraged GOB/Petrobangla to act more diligently in dealing with the
procurement matters which seriously impacted both the SGDP and LPG Projects.
17.    Following effectiveness, several IDA missions had useful discussions with officials of GOB and
the implementing agencies. However, realizing that without the construction of the Ashuganj plant, the
LPG Project would not achieve its objectives, the missions discussed the merits of restructuring the
project to include the Ashuganj plant for production of LPG from the NGL obtained from the Kailashtilla
facilities. However, these attempts did not come to fruition and the project was allowed to close on
schedule--without being implemented, and without restructuring. In retrospect, once it was clear that the
contract would not be awarded, and that restructuring was considered not plausible, IDA might have
moved more quickly to close the project rather than let it languish in problem project status until closure.
IX.   Performance of the Borrower
18.    Managerial and technical weaknesses of the Borrower emerged as the main reason for the non-
implementation of the project. GOB's procurement procedures being overly complex also proved to be
the major impediment in the implementation of the project. Petrobangla/GOB were unable to complete
the procurement for the Ashuganj plant under SGDP (Cr. 1586-BD), which was to be the source of LPG
for transport and distribution envisaged under the project. However, both RPGCL and LPGL showed
seriousness in implementation of the project. RPGCL had appointed consultants for the feasibility study
and design of the Ashuganj-Elenga LPG pipeline. The consultants completed the study and prepared the
design and the bid document for the pipeline. LPGL acquired and developed land and constructed office
buildings at both Elenga and Kailashtilla. At Kailashtilla, RPGCL is now setting up a small-scale NGL
fractionation plant for producing 5,000 mtpy of LPG using a part of the NGL from the Kailashtilla
molecular sieve turbo-expander plant, and LPGI is constructing storage facilities and a bottling plant at a
nearby location for bottling the LPG a.d marketing it in the Sylhet area. Compliance with major
covenants during the project life was satisfactory.



6
X.    Assessment of Outcome
19.    Because the project closed without being implemented, there was no possibility of achieving the
desired outcomes. The only part of the project that was implemented was the feasibility study for the
165-km Ashuganj-Elenga LPG pipeline, its design, and preparation of the bid document. If a future
project includes this pipeline, the results of the consultancy work will be useful.
XI.    Lessons Learned
20.    The key lessons learned from the project are the following.
(a)    One major lesson learned from the failure of this project to be implemented is the strong
inter-dependencies among sequential investments (often financed under different
projects) which have the potential of causing unsatisfactory outcomes in a ripple effect if
the implementation of an earlier project fails entirely or is significantly delayed. Future
investments in the sector must factor in the institutional capabilities of the gas sector
entities, and design projects with realistic implementation schedules in accordance with
the country's absorptive capacity.
(b)    Protracted procurement actions under the SGDP seriously impacted the implementation
of the LPG Project. The Implementation Completion Report for SGDP (January 22,
1997, No. 16257) identified a lesson to be learned regarding procurement, with emphasis
on mandating advance procurement decisions. Had this lesson been learned in time, the
outcome of the LPG Project might have been more succesful.
(c)    Because project investment operations are generally inherited by the OCs, project
implementation should be left to them. Also, the financial power of the OCs should be
raised adequately so that they have the authority to independently process procurement
of goods and services without going for the approval of Petrobangla/GOB.
