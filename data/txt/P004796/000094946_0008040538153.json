Throughout the project, the Bank maintained\n            good relations with the Government and the Borrower. Overall\n            borrower performance is rated satisfactory. The following\n            lessons could be learned from the project's\n            implementation. Actions on land acquisition and construction\n            permits must be taken early on during project preparation\n            and should be completed as much as possible in the early\n            stage of project implementation to avoid or minimize\n            implementation delays. In this case, where there were many\n            project components, waiting to complete all land acquisition\n            would hinder the project from starting. Realistic\n            implementation schedules should be prepared at project\n            appraisal by taking into full consideration all potential\n            risk factors (such as land acquisition, necessary government\n            approvals, procurement process, etc.) that could affect\n            project implementation. To achieve successful and smooth\n            corporatization and or restructuring, adequate attention\n            should be given to ensure that all stakeholders including\n            employee unions participate in the process actively from the\n            very beginning, and that they fully understand the process,\n            and their concerns are properly addressed during the process."}, "docdt": "2000-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
