to improve and expand the distribution system of the\n            Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) in order to meet\n            the expected rapid increase in demand; (b) to sustain the\n            efficiency of MEA's operations in the face of a rapid\n            increase in the scope and complexity of its business; (c) to\n            strengthen the utility's financial and management\n            information systems; (d) to investigate opportunities for\n            privatization of some of MEA's activities; (e) to\n            incorporate increased levels of safety and environmental\n            acceptability in the utility's design and operation\n            practices; and (f) to introduce demand-side management\n            including the promotion of electricity energy efficiency in\n            the Thai power sector. The project has two major components.\n            The first one, distribution system improvement and\n            expansion, comprises: (a) construction of subtransmission\n            and distribution facilities; and (b) consulting studies\n            regarding: (i) formulation of strategies for privatization\n            of some of MEA's activities, (ii) design and\n            implementation of subsystems in the integrated financial and\n            management information system; and (iii) environmental and\n            safety considerations in system design. The second\n            component, promotion of electricity energy efficiency,\n            includes the Five Year Demand Side Management Master Plan."}, "docdt": "1993-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
