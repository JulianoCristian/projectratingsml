Recipient            Central African Republic
Implementing Agency  Ministry of Planning, Economics and International Cooperation
Amount               SDR 4.8 million (US$7.9 million equivalent)
Terms                Grant
Tranching            One tranche
Description          A one tranche development policy operation, the Economic Management and
                     Governance Reform Grant (EMGRG) supports the implementation of the
                     CAR's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The proposed grant focuses on two
                     main policy areas: (i) strengthening public finance management; and (ii)
                     improving public sector and economic governance. This operation directly
                     supports two pillars of the PRSP: (i) promoting good governance and the rule
                     of law (pillar 2); and (ii) rebuilding and diversifying the economy (pillar 3). In
                     addition, it will assist the Government in attaining some of the HIPC
                     Completion Point triggers and will provide much needed external resources to
                     ensure timely payment of public sector salaries and external debt service.
Benefits             Reforms supported by EMGRG will contribute to improve the efficiency and
                     transparency of government operations and improve public sector and
                     economic governance. In particular it is expected to: (i) establish more
                     transparent accounting system and timely and reliable budget reporting; (ii)
                     improve domestic revenue mobilization capacity; (iii) improve the visibility of
                     government's governance efforts; and (iv) set the stage for a competitive
                     environment in the forestry and the downstream oil sector.
Risks                The EMGRG has significant security, political, sustainability,
                     macroeconomic, and institutional capacity risks. This reflects the country's
                     fragile security and political situation, the risks associated with low
                     government revenue, and weak financial controls. As in many conflict affected
                     countries, deterioration in the security situation constitutes an important source
                     of risk for the operation. Likewise, a reversal in the political stabilization
                     process, together with a weakening of ownership over the key measures
                     agreed with the Government, could undermine the development objectives of
                     the operation. To mitigate these risks, the Government has expressed
                     ownership and has demonstrated a real commitment to reforms through the
                     prior actions already carried out to start implementing its reforms program,
                     and the definition of the follow on measures targeting critical areas of
                     economic management and governance. To reduce the risk of weak
                     institutional capacity, the operation focuses on sustaining government reforms
                     that have started generating positive results and on a limited number of reform
                     areas. Although this operation is designed as a one-year-stand-alone budget
                     support, possible follow-up measures have been identified taking into
                     consideration the need for continuity in the reform program.

  INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION PROGRAM
        DOCUMENT FOR AN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND
                       GOVERNANCE REFORM GRANT
                  TO THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC



                        I.   INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

1.         This Program Document presents a proposed Economic Management and
Governance Reform Grant (EMGRG) for the Central African Republic (CAR) in
the amount of SDR 4.8 million (US$7.9 million equivalent). This is the second
Development Policy Operation (DPO) aimed at supporting the Government of the CAR,
after its successful reengagement with the donor community in 2006. The proposed Grant
will be a one-tranche operation supporting the 2008 budget.

2.         The operation supports the implementation of the country's PRSP. The full
PRSP describes the government's comprehensive strategy for accelerating economic
growth and reducing poverty for 2008-2010. The PRSP shares the broad goals and
pillars of the interim strategy for 2006-2008: (i) restoring security and consolidating
peace; (ii) promoting good governance and the rule of law; (iii) rebuilding and
diversifying the economy; and (iv) developing human capital. It was adopted by the
Government in June 2007 and presented to the donor community and civil society in
September 2007.

3.         The proposed Grant would support the second and third pillars of the
PRSP. The economic reform program aims to further strengthen budget reporting and
public sector and economic governance. The fiscal effort will be supported by policies
aimed at improving the accounting system and budget execution reporting and
government's revenue mobilization capacity as well as treasury control over government
resources. Structural reforms directed at rebuilding the economy aim to: (i) strengthen
governance and anti-corruption efforts; and (ii) establish a legal and regulatory
framework conducive to the development of a competitive oil and environmentally
sustainable forestry sector.

4.         The Grant is aligned with the objectives of the Joint Interim Strategy Note
(JISN), which outlines support by the World Bank and the African Development
Bank (AfDB) for an 18 month period, covering FY07-08. The JISN supports the
Government in its efforts to spur economic recovery and help strengthen public sector
governance spanning public finance management, both from the expenditure and revenue
perspectives; economic governance in key sectors such as management of natural
resources; public administration; and public sector governance.

5.         Proceeds of the proposed Grant would also provide continued support to
consolidate the reforms initiated by the Government with the support of the previous
operation the "Reengagement and Institution Building Support Program Grant"
(RIBSUP; FY07). Implementation over the course of RIBSUP has supported progress in


                                            1

a number of priority reform areas. These include: (i) the strengthening of Treasury
operations; (ii) the adoption of a unified payroll management system for civil and
military personnel; (iii) improving tax and customs administration; (iv) redressing state-
owned utility companies performance; (v) strengthening the state's capacity to fight
corruption; and (vi) enhancing transparency and improved legal and regulatory
framework to strengthen the credibility of the State, in particular with regard to natural
resources and telecommunications.

6.       The proposed Grant is part of an overall package of World Bank support
which has as its objective: (i) deepening public financial management reforms; (ii)
strengthening the government's governance efforts aimed at enhancing transparency and
accountability in the public sector, forestry and oil sector. In addition, it will assist the
Government in attaining some of the HIPC Completion Point triggers and will provide
much needed external resources to ensure timely payment of public sector salaries and
external debt service. In particular, it is supported by components of a US$6.8 million
grant from the Low Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) Trust Fund, approved in
October 2006, to provide, among other areas, capacity-building and technical assistance
to enhance governance and economic management systems (EGEMAS). A planned new
LICUS grant (FY08), would provide continued support to public finance management
and governance in key sectors, including the oil sector. It will complement donors'
support for CAR's program, in particular the efforts of the IMF, the European
Commission (EC) and other bilateral partners.

7.       The     EMGRG        has    significant    security,  political,    sustainability,
macroeconomic, and institutional capacity risks. This reflects the country's fragile
security and political situation, the risks associated with low government revenue, and
weak financial controls. As in many conflict affected countries, deterioration in the
security situation constitutes an important source of risk for the operation. Likewise, a
reversal in the political stabilization process, together with a weakening of ownership
over the key measures agreed with the Government, could undermine the development
objectives of the operation. To mitigate these risks, the Government has expressed
ownership and has demonstrated a real commitment to reforms through the prior actions
already carried out to start implementing its reforms program, and the definition of the
follow on measures targeting critical areas of economic management and governance. To
reduce the risk of weak institutional capacity, the operation focuses on sustaining
government reforms that have started generating positive results and on a limited number
of reform areas. Although this operation is designed as a one-year-stand-alone budget
support, possible follow-up measures have been identified taking into consideration the

                                             PROGRAM


8.       CAR has experienced sustained periods of political instability and internal
conflict, resulting in weak governance and poor socio-economic outcomes. This



                                              2

instability, particularly since 1980, has significantly eroded the country's infrastructure
and private sector, resulting in steadily declining living standards. It is estimated that the
contraction of activities since the mid-1990s led to the disappearance of two-thirds of
formal sector enterprises and a collapse of agricultural exports. Real GDP per capita fell
from US$495 in 1990 to under US$300 over 1994-2002, but since 2004 the economy has
started a period of modest recovery, with real per capita income rising to an estimated
US$386 in 2007, although this partly reflects the falling value of the US dollar vis-à-vis
the euro and the CFA franc.1 Average annual real GDP rose on average by a mere 0.6
percent between 2002 and 2007, reflecting a steep fall in real GDP of 7.6 percent in 2003.
However, economic growth has accelerated since 2006, with real growth of 4 percent in
2006, and 4.2 percent in 2007. According to household survey data, 67.2 percent of the
population lived below the poverty line in 2003, with poverty particularly widespread in
rural areas, at 71.7 percent.

                         A. POLITICAL AND SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS

9.          The holding of multiparty elections in 1993 was followed by a decade of
ethnic instability and political tension, with army mutinies in 1996-1997 and a failed
military coup in 2001. In 2003, a military insurgency headed by General François
Bozizé came to power and established a transitional Government. Subsequently, the
Government organized a political process including (i) the organization of a national
dialogue in September 2003, bringing together all the political parties and civil society
organizations; (ii) the adoption via a referendum of a constitution in December 2004; and
(iii) the holding of legislative and presidential elections in March and May 2005.

10.         Mr. Bozizé was elected president after a run-off contest and a new
Government was formed in July 2005. These successful elections provided an
opportunity for the Government to initiate security sector reforms. However, the
implementation of the roadmap for sustained reconciliation and the strengthening of the
democratization process are constrained by limited resources. The CAR still lacks
defense and security forces capable of ensuring security within the country, largely
reflecting an ageing army and a shortage of financial resources in the face of large needs.

11.         Despite a general improvement of the security situation and political
stability, the current security situation remains precarious. Banditry remains an
important concern in certain rural regions, particularly the Bangui-Cameroon corridor.
The Government is faced with an armed rebellion, based in the northern part of the
country and with rear bases in neighboring countries, seeking to destabilize the country.
Acts of violence have been reported in a recent Human Rights Watch report which
documented significant abuses (including forced displacement and extra-judicial
killings), particularly in the northern part of the country.




1A large part of the rise in real GDP per capita in 2002-2006 reflects exchange rate fluctuations between
the CFAF franc, which is tied to the euro, and the US dollar. Thus, in local currency, CAR's per capita in
2006 was CFAF 186,003, which was lower than in 2002, when it was CFAF 187,798. It is only in 2007 that
per capita, at CFAF 194,459, exceeded the level of five years earlier.



                                                     3

12.       In addition to rebel activity in the northwest, security in the northeast of
the country has also been undermined by spillovers of the conflict in Darfur and
Chad. The regional environment remains marked by conflict --the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Chad, and Darfur in Sudan--and aggravates the difficulties encountered by the
defense and security forces. It is estimated that some 291,000 people in CAR have fled
from their homes because of violence, 212,000 of who are internally displaced, while an
estimated 79,000 have crossed borders into Chad, Cameroon, and Sudan. An additional
flow of refugees to the CAR are people escaping violence in Sudan's South Darfur
region. The recent UN decision to deploy a peacekeeping force in the Darfur region of
Sudan and in the border area with Chad should help improve the overall security
situation.

13.       The CAR has explicitly requested support for security reforms and has
embarked on a series of initiatives in the security sector aided by donors. Efforts to
restore security are supported by the United Nations Office for Consolidation of the
Peace in Central Africa (BONUCA), France, and the regional forces, Forces
Multinationale de la CEMAC (FOMUC), composed of forces from CEMAC member
countries, that are financed by the EC. Since 2001, BONUCA has been supporting the
government's efforts to consolidate peace and national reconciliation, strengthen
democratic institutions and facilitate the international political support for national
reconstruction and economic recovery. BONUCA has also focused on reinforcing
cooperation between the UN and CEMAC with a view to facilitating and strengthening
initiatives aimed at addressing trans-border insecurity. With French assistance the
Government has prepared a white paper on the restructuring, training, and equipping of
defense forces. UNDP has provided support for the fight against the proliferation of small
arms and co-financed the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants. In
addition, the Government has signed peace accords with the UFDR and FDPC rebel
movements in 2007, and it has committed itself to undertaking a political round table to
reinforce dialogue between the opposition and the ruling party.

                      B. RECENT MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE


14.       Economic performance has been uneven over the past decade, with widely
fluctuating annual changes to economic output (Figures 1-2). Since the political
transition in March 2003, economic recovery has been gaining momentum, with real
GDP growth rising from 1 percent in 2004 to 4 percent in 2006 and an estimated 4.2
percent in 2007. Real GDP per capita, which averaged minus 1.2 percent over 2003-
2007, did see positive growth rates since 2005. In terms of sectoral economic growth, the
economic recovery since 2004 has been driven by developments in the mining and
forestry sectors. The contribution of the primary sector has been uneven and variable. In
2006 it is estimated that the primary sector represented 57 percent of economic output,
with the secondary sector accounting for 16 percent, and the remainder being the tertiary
sector. Only in 2006 was the contribution of the primary sector significant and positive,
contributing by 2.7 percentage points to overall growth.

15.      Since mid-2005, the CAR has made significant progress in strengthening
macroeconomic stability and has implemented macroeconomic and structural policies
under the IMF's PRGF-supported program approved in December 2006 that have
generally been satisfactory.2 The second review of the program is expected to be
considered by the IMF's Executive Board in June 2008 (see Annex 7). Inflation has
remained low, averaging 2.5 percent, in part reflecting the regional monetary
arrangements and monetary policy of the regional central bank BEAC. Annual average
inflation rose to 6.7 percent in 2006, reflecting an adjustment of petroleum prices, an
increase in indirect taxes, and higher food prices due to the level of instability in the
countryside. However, inflation fell significantly in 2007, to an estimated 0.9 percent.
Despite strong export growth and a significant rise in official transfers, the current-
account deficit in 2007 rose to 4.4 percent of GDP, up from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2006.
As timber and diamonds account for 85 percent of exports, developments in these two
products largely determine export performance.3

16.      Public expenditure remains low by Sub-Saharan African standards, at 11.8
percent of GDP in 2007, and is insufficient to meet the CAR's needs for human and
physical investments. Public expenditure declined in 2007, with the brunt of adjustment
falling on capital expenditure, which declined to CFAF 29.4 billion in 2007, down from
CFAF 37.7 billion in 2006, reflecting lower external financing. Investment has averaged
7.7 percent of GDP in 2003-07. In particular, private investment is low, averaging 4.9
percent of GDP in 2003-07, and is low, even by Sub Saharan Africa standards, although
it has been rising in the last two years, reaching 6.2 percent of GDP in 2007. Public
expenditure is constrained by low domestic revenue mobilization and limited donor
support. Over recent years, the government's fiscal objectives have been achieved


2 In December 2006 the CAR's PRGF was approved by the IMF for an amount equivalent to about
US$56.4 million to support the Government's economic program into 2009.
3Wood product exports account for nearly half of merchandise exports.



                                                   5

through tight control over expenditures, which is necessary to mitigate the impact of the
unpredictability of programmed aid inflows. These outcomes emphasize the need for
enhancing efforts to mobilize domestic revenue and improve modalities of aid delivery.
Realistically, room for fiscal space will continue to remain small without a significant
increase in external assistance.

17.       Tax revenue is among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, at a mere 7.3
percent of GDP in 2007. As a percentage of GDP, tax revenue has increased only
modestly over 2004-07, rising by a mere 0.1 percentage points over this period and
falling over 2006-07. Low levels of tax revenue make it difficult for the Government to
gain fiscal maneuvering space.

18.       Total revenue fluctuates considerably from year to year depending on
grant disbursements made by the donor community (Figure 3). Although total
revenue as a percentage of GDP averaged 14.1 percent in 2003-07, this average hides
significant fluctuations. In 2006, total revenue rose to 22.8 percent of GDP, up from 12.3
percent in 2005, before falling to an estimated 14.3 percent in 2007. The large rise in total
revenue in 2006 is to a large extent attributable to multilateral budget support intended to
provide financing for the Government to repay outstanding multilateral arrears.

19.       Following the reengagement with the donor community, the CAR has
arguably broken the vicious circle of poor fiscal performance and has posted fiscal
surpluses as a result of external assistance. The fiscal surplus (including grants)
amounted to 9 percent of GDP in 2006 and 1.6 percent of GDP in 2007; excluding grants
the CAR posted fiscal deficits of 4.4 percent of GDP and 5.5 of GDP percent over the
same period. The Government has made considerable efforts to repay arrears in 2006-07.
The repayment of large outstanding arrears to multilateral donors, which was essential for
reengagement with the donor community, and the repayment of a fraction of domestic
arrears, led to an overall reduction of arrears equivalent to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2006.
External arrears fell by a further 1 percent of GDP in 2007, while domestic arrears
declined by 0.3 percent of GDP.


                                                  6

20.        Despite posting fiscal surpluses, the fiscal position of the Government is
constrained by the need to repay large outstanding arrears, including overdue
salaries. Domestic arrears amount to an estimated 13.4 percent of GDP in 2007 and
constitute an important economic and political challenge for the Government. Largely
due to political and economic instability over 2001-2004, the CAR accumulated
payments arrears to nearly all its creditors, both external and domestic, including unpaid
salary arrears to both civilians and the military and to private suppliers. The accumulation
of domestic arrears act as an important barrier to private-sector led growth.

21.        For years the timely payment of public sector salaries has been an issue in
the CAR. Most recently, a delay in the payment of salaries in December 2007 led to
demonstrations and a public sector strike which led to a change in Government in January
2008. The payment of six months of overdue salary arrears, accumulated since the regime
change in 2003, remains an important political and social issue.4 Without additional
donor support, it is unlikely that the Government will be able to make progress on these
fronts. To date, the Government has not been in a position to repay overdue salary
arrears.

22.        Net ODA flows have fluctuated significantly in recent years, but have not
trended upwards. Total grants surged in 2006 and reached US$192.7 million due to
significant external support for arrears clearance,. In 2007 they returned to a level
estimated at US$54.5 million. As Figure 4 reveals, net ODA flows have been
significantly below total grants, reflecting significant debt obligations even after reaching
the HIPC decision point. The inability of the CAR to mobilize significant external
resources remains a cause for concern.



4 There is also pressure from public sector employees calling for a rise in salaries.

23.        The CAR reached HIPC Decision Point in September 2007, following the
completion of the Poverty Reduction Strategy and a satisfactory macroeconomic
performance under the PRGF program.5 The reduction of the CAR's NPV of debt-to-
exports ratio from 470 percent in 2006 to 150 percent would require HIPC debt relief of
US$583 million in NPV terms. This implies a common reduction factor of 68 percent.
Based on proportional burden sharing, multilateral debt relief would amount to US$365
million and bilateral and commercial debt relief to US$218 million.6 Upon reaching the
HIPC completion point, the CAR would also qualify for relief under the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI), which is estimated to reduce the NPV of debt owed to IDA, the
IMF, and the African Development Bank by approximately US$110 million (in end-2006
NPV terms).



               C. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND FINANCING REQUIREMENT

24.        Real GDP is expected to average 5 percent in the medium-term (2008-2010)
under the CAR's PRGF-supported program with the IMF (Table 1). If achieved, this
would be higher than the growth rates observed in 2006-07. This scenario presupposes
decisive domestic reforms to increase private sector investment and assumes higher
consumption due to regular payment of civil servants' wages and employment gains in
industrial and service (telecommunications) service sectors, and improvement in rural
incomes linked to intensified diamond and cotton activities. In addition, there will be


5 The CAR's public- and publicly-guaranteed external debt was estimated at US$1.1 billion in nominal
terms as of end-December 2006, equivalent to about US$ 856 million in NPV terms and 470 percent of
exports of goods and services. Multilateral debt accounted for 63 percent of the total debt, bilateral
creditors accounted for 32 percent, with the remainder of the external debt stock accounted for by
commercial creditors.
6Both figures are expressed in end-2006 NPV terms.



                                                     8

increasing external assistance to finance public investment in infrastructure, and
increasing credit to the private sector. Gross investment is projected to rise from 9.2 of
GDP in 2007 to 10.5 percent of GDP by 2010.

25.      The government's PRSP for 2008-2010 presents two medium-term growth
scenarios that depart from the latest projections under the PRGF-supported
program. Under the prudent scenario of the PRSP, real GDP growth is only 3.8 percent
in 2008, 4 percent in 2009 and 3.9 percent in 2010. This scenario assumes lower
projected growth in the food-producing sector than the latest projections under the PRGF.
It assumes that: (i) external assistance is not mobilized and spent quickly; (ii) security
problems persist; and (iii) major projects financed by private investors do not go ahead as
planned. Alternatively, in the dynamic scenario average annual GDP rises sharply as a
result of a dramatic rise in investment. Annual real GDP growth nearly doubles to 8.5
percent in 2008, accelerating to 9.7 percent in 2009 and to 11.4 percent in 2010, as
investment rises from 10 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2010. The assumptions of this
scenario are: (i) improved commodity prices and dollar exchange rate; (ii) consolidation
of economic stability, peace and security throughout the country; (iii) restoration of
confidence among private investors; and (iv) increased external assistance and an upturn
in external demand. Given capacity constraints, both human and institutional, it is
unlikely that investment could rise in line with the assumptions of the dynamic scenario.
The dynamic scenario also assumes external assistance of US$1.5 billion over the 2008-
2010 period, which is considerably higher than the sum pledged during the donor
roundtable held in Brussels in October 20077.

26.      Given the considerable fiscal challenges faced by the CAR, one of the
anchors of the macroeconomic program are domestic primary surplus targets. The
domestic primary balance is projected to remain positive throughout the 2008-10 period,
increasing from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2010. Due to a
sustained increase in expenditures to support the growth and poverty reducing policy of
the Government, it will remain below the 1.1 percent of GDP attained in 2007 (Table 1).

   27.         It is projected that policy changes will raise tax revenue from 7.3 percent of
   GDP in 2007 to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2008, while the medium-term fiscal strategy
   aims to raise tax revenue to 9.9 percent of GDP in 2010 (Table 1). The government's
   strategy is to broaden the tax base, eliminate tax exemptions, improve taxation of the
   forestry sector, intensify audits of large taxpayers, improve customs revenue collection
   and rationalize taxes in the petroleum. In particular, the Government aims to: (i) update
   the tax and customs database on the basis of results of the national taxpayers survey; (ii)
   transfer customs revenue directly to accounts held in the BEAC; (iii) install a networked
   system between the tax and customs directorates and the pre-inspection company
   operating in the CAR; and (iv) redeploy Treasury agents to all line ministries generating
   revenue to ensure that such revenue is transferred to Treasury accounts. However, even
   with these efforts, tax revenue will remain very low by Sub-Saharan Africa standards and
   will act as an important constraint on the government's ability to finance public
   investment and social sector spending.

28.       Total expenditure is projected to rise to 15.3 percent of GDP in 2008 and to
continue to increase over the same period to reach 16.3 percent of GDP in 2010.
Domestic arrears, including salary, pensions, and supplier arrears, are expected to
continue to decline.

29.       The government's strategy also aims at a reduction of the cost of repaying
domestic debt. At present the CAR is using lines of credit and credit facilities with
commercial banks that carry high annual interest rate charges, in excess of 15 percent.
The government's debt service to commercial banks amount approximately US$10
million for 2008. Not only are interest payments high, but the government's ability to
manage liquidity is also affected negatively as commercial banks deduct due debt
payments directly from government accounts held in commercial banks.

30.       To further improve domestic debt management, the government's program
includes the option to issue regional bonds to repay domestic bank debt.8 However,
the terms and volumes the CAR may raise on regional bond markets are uncertain, would
remain subject to roll-over risk, and still imply relatively significant interest burdens
compared to concessional external financing. The Government is therefore continuing to
seek concessional external financing to help it in reducing its domestic debt, clearing
arrears, and creating needed fiscal space.

31.       In the interim, the Government has implemented several measures to
improve liquidity management. It has adopted measures to reduce the number of
government accounts by closing inactive Treasury accounts held in commercial banks. In
addition, the Government plans to review active accounts held in commercial banks, with
the aim of reducing their number and rationalizing domestic borrowing policies. In
parallel, the Government is in the process of setting rules to enhance treasury control over
government resources, especially through measures aiming to reduce automatic offsetting
mechanisms by which several institutions automatically deduct funds from government
accounts, including the pre-inspection company at the Port of Douala.




8Bond issuance will not exceed 3 percent of GDP and could reach approximately US$60 million for 2008.
A minimum of arrears clearance would be established by the Fund program in the absence of access to the
financial market.

32.        On the external front, the medium-term outlook is expected to remain
largely unchanged. The current-account deficit is expected to rise somewhat, from a
projected 4.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 6 percent of GDP in 2010. Export growth is
projected to be fueled by developments in the timber sector, and a continued recovery of
the diamond and cotton sector. The deficit on the services account is forecast to remain

high as a result of import-related services and high transport costs caused by poor
infrastructure. The income account will also remain in deficit as the Government resumes
interest payments on its external debt. Despite rising surplus on the current transfers as
donors assistance resume, deficits on both these accounts would not be offset.

33.         External debt service obligations will be a significant source of outflows.
Although the CAR reached the HIPC Decision Point in September 2007, the debt service
actually paid by the country is expected to substantially increase even during the interim
period.9 This is a result of the reengagement of the CAR with the international financial
community, and also reflects a modest common reduction factor and frontloading of
interim HIPC debt relief in 2007. The CAR is expected to pay nearly US$29 million a
year in debt service during the interim period, assumed to be 2008-2009 (Table 3). In the
case of the Bank, these payments are estimated to average US$6 million for the next two
years. Debt service payments are expected to fall to approximately US$16 million after
the CAR attains HIPC Completion Point and to about US$10 million after MDRI debt
relief. This is in contrast to the situation prior to re-engagement with the donor
community, when the country made virtually no debt service payments, except to the
IMF.

34.         Significant fiscal challenges highlight the need for increased and
predictable budget support from donors. In 2007 budget support from various donors
(World Bank, EC, AfDB, France, and China) helped the Government to stay current with
salary payments and external debt payment obligations. In contrast to 2007, no budget
support was disbursed in the first quarter of 2008, and since January 2008 the
Government has been facing recurrent cash shortages and experienced difficulties to stay
current on its external debt service. Several obligations towards the Bank and the African
Development Bank (AfDB) could only be serviced with delay. Budget support, from the
AfDB, World Bank and the EC, is projected to decline in 2008, from US$45.3 million in

9 The CAR's public- and publicly-guaranteed external debt was estimated at US$1.1 billion in nominal
terms as of end-December 2006, equivalent to about US$ 856 million in NPV terms and 470 percent of
exports of goods and services. Multilateral debt accounted for 63 percent of the total debt, bilateral
creditors accounted for 32 percent, with the remainder of the external debt stock accounted for by
commercial creditors. HIPC debt relief is estimated at US$538 million in end-December 2006 NPV terms.

2007 to US$26.8 million.10 The waning external support, before attaining the HIPC
completion point, forces the Government to focus on day-to-day cash management and
severely constrains the government's ability to show tangible progress from the re-
engagement with the donor community.

35.         The analysis of CAR's debt situation reinforces the need for concessional
financing and increased external financial support of the international community
along with improved economic performance. The external low-income country debt
sustainability analysis (LIC DSA) done in 2007 shows that the CAR is in debt distress
under the assumption that it reaches the floating completion point at end-2009. Key
external debt indicators in the initial years are significantly above the policy-dependent
thresholds, particularly the NPV of external debt-to-export ratio. Although these ratios
decline gradually over time under the baseline scenario of the LIC DSA, the stress tests
indicate that debt indicators are sensitive to GDP growth rates lower than assumed in the
baseline scenario and the terms of new borrowing. These vulnerabilities underscore the
importance of a stable socio-political environment and sound policies to support a
sustained improvement in economic performance. The DSA highlights the need for a
strong fiscal performance if the CAR is to meet its debt service obligations and clear
outstanding arrears.

                                             D. POVERTY OUTLOOK

36.         Household survey data, collected with the support of the UNDP, estimate
that 67.2 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 2003.11 The

10The IMF calculated budget support for 2007 at US$27.6 million, as they exclude debt relief in the
calculation. If debt relief is included, then budget support for 2007 rises to US$45.3 million.
11 This is based on a monetary definition of poverty, where the national poverty line is equal to
CFAF156,079 (US$312) per year per adult equivalent.



                                                            14

national average hides important differences, with poverty particularly widespread in
rural areas, at 71.7 percent, which accounts for 62 percent of the population. Poverty rates
are highest in regions in which armed conflict has been most violent and lowest in the
capital, which has the best social infrastructure and highest economic activity. Since the
survey was conducted, the Government estimates that national poverty declined to 64.4
percent in 2006. According to the Poverty Participatory Analysis (2007)12, the three main
causes of poverty are (i) poor governance, with the main complaint being the abuse of
power by state officials; (ii) problems associated with insecurity or lack of peace, which
are connected to recent conflicts13, but also reflect a deterioration in economic
opportunities that have led to the proliferation of urban banditry and extortion at road
blocks, even in areas not directly affected by violent conflict; and (iii) low incomes.
These concerns are reflected in the government's PRSP.

37.       Social indicators place the CAR among the least developed countries of the
world (Table 4). The 2007/2008 UNDP Human Development Report ranks the CAR
near the bottom of its Human Development Index (171st out of 177 countries). This trend
is reflected in several health indicators: life expectancy has fallen from 44.8 years in 2000
to 43.7 years in 2005; the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, at 6.2 percent for the 15-49 age
group in 2005, is high although considerably below the double-digit rates found in a
number of southern African countries; maternal and infant mortality rates have increased
over time.     Current policies aim to refurbish sanitation infrastructure, increase the
availability and quality of basic health care, reduce infant and maternal mortality, and
fight diseases (including malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS).                   Some encouraging
results have already been recorded. For example, the immunization program has led to a
surge in the overall national immunization rate for DPT3 to 80 percent, despite security
problems.

38.       The situation in the education sector is also bleak. Over a prolonged period,
disinvestment has taken place, resulting in the cancellation of school years, shortages in
human resources due to inadequate recruitment and salaries, a glaring lack of material
resources, and a serious deterioration in education efficiency indicators. In 2004/05, one
child out of four had never attended school, only 31 percent of children enrolled in
primary school completed primary education and repetition rate is high; only 62 percent
of those who completed primary education when they were young are literate today
(compared with 70 percent on average in other African countries). With donors'
assistance, the Government has prepared an education status report to identify constraints
for the reconstruction of the education system. It is now developing a strategy, including
quantifying and allocating the resources required, with a view to achieving the goal of
primary education for all.14



12The qualitative Participatory Poverty Analysis (PPA) undertaken in early 2007 aimed to gather public
opinion on perceptions of poverty.
13Years of conflict have displaced a large proportion of the rural population and destroyed important
economic and social infrastructure.
14With regards to health, the Government validated a policy instrument, the Plan Pluriannuel Complet du
Programme Elargi de Vaccination      en RCA 2007-2011 (PPAC), which aims to expand the level of
vaccination among infants in all districts. In education, the Government developed the "Plan National

             1/ Population figures refer to the region, not the average.

39.        Other social indicators are also very low. Only 7.6 percent of the population
uses electricity as a source of lighting. Finally, gender disparities are high, and the CAR
is ranked only 153 out of 177 countries in 2007 in terms of the gender-specific human
development index.

40.        As a result of these trends, the CAR is unlikely to achieve its MDGs by
2015. The public sector's contribution to the provision of basic social services is limited
and inequitable, which adds to the vulnerability of the poor population, while the private
sector is not equipped to fill the gaps in the provision of these basic social services.15 In
its PRSP, the Government estimated the incidence of poverty over 2006-2010 under two
scenarios. Under the prudent scenario, national poverty will decline only modestly, from
an estimated 64.4 percent in 2006 to 61.3 percent in 2010. The dynamic scenario projects
a much steeper fall in poverty, to 56.8 percent, as a result of higher economic growth and


d'Action de l'Education Pour Tous" in 2003. The Ministry of Education with support from the World Bank
and the Pôle de Dakar (UNESCO) elaborated an Education Country Status Report (CSR) in March 2007. A
sector-wide (including education, vocational training and literacy) financial simulation model is being
finalized for elaborating a credible scenario of long-term development of the education sector (2006-2020).

15 For example, the poorest 20 percent of households benefit from only 8 percent of public expenditure on
primary education; implicit subsidies for public utilities (water and electricity) are not pro-poor; in addition,
while private and/or community education provision has increased sharply in the last few years, the quality
is generally poor and more than 40 percent of teachers are community teachers, untrained and hired directly
by families.



                                                                    16

a steep rise in public expenditure for the social sectors, infrastructure, and rural
development. However, the underlying macroeconomic assumptions of this scenario are
unlikely to be met in practice.

                    E. THE GOVERNMENT PRS AND REFORM AGENDA

41.       The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was adopted by
Government in June 2007 and presented to donors in September 2007. This first full
PRSP builds on the interim poverty reduction strategy (I-PRSP) discussed by the Boards
of the Fund and the Bank in 2001 and the interim 18-month strategy, the Economic and
Social Policy Framework (ESPF), covering 2006-2008 and adopted in November 2006.
The I-PRSP was prepared before a deep political and economic crisis confronted the
CAR in 2003. In 2005 the Government prepared an 18-month transitional strategy to lay
out its reform plans and guide its economic policy dialogue with development partners
during the critical period of re-engagement with multilateral donors.

42.       A number of specialized committees and technical groups have led the
PRSP process since its inception, and preparation for the PRSP included substantial
consultations with all stakeholders in CAR society. Over the past two and half years,
consultations have been set up centrally, regionally, and locally in seven regions, and the
participatory approach was comprehensive and integrated community preferences for
public policy interventions. The participatory approach used different methods at various
stages, such as regional workshops, quantitative and qualitative surveys of poverty
perceptions, and the use of media to reach more distant audiences to organize round
tables and gather wide-ranging opinions. In 2005 workshops took place in each of CAR's
six regions; development partners discussed drafts of the strategy and the process enabled
all stakeholders to help identify priorities and set PRSP strategic goals.

43.       The PRSP provides a detailed description of the determinants of poverty
and the profile of the poor based on the qualitative and quantitative poverty
analyses developed with the support of some key donors (World Bank and UNDP).
Although inequality is high, it is below the sub-Saharan African average. Qualitative
poverty analysis identified three priority areas for public intervention to reduce poverty:
(i) poor governance, (ii) insecurity and lack of peace, and (iii) low income and lack of
money circulating at local levels. The PRSP lays the groundwork for future diagnostic
work in these areas. Currently, a household survey is being carried out (Enquete QUIBB)
to update quantitative poverty analysis and it is expected that the Government will use the
findings of the survey to fine-tune sector-specific poverty diagnostics and policies into
sector analysis.

44.       As recognized in the PRSP, preserving macro-financial stability is crucial.
In the two macroeconomic scenarios developed in the PRSP ("prudent" and "dynamic"
scenarios), maintenance of fiscal sustainability and preserving low inflation environment
are the common objectives. The objectives of fiscal and monetary policy, embodied in
the PRGF-supported program, will support implementation of the PRSP, through
increasing domestic revenues, supporting higher spending in priority areas while keeping
inflation at its current low levels. Reducing exemptions and broadening tax base, and



                                              17

diligent implementation of modernization strategies for the internal revenue service, and
customs will be important for increasing revenue mobilization. Finally, the PRS
recognizes the potential for more revenue from natural resources (notably forestry and
mining). Full transparency in monitoring and reporting in this area--through publishing
the report of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) administrator in the
case of the mining sector--would contribute to realizing such a potential.

45.        The PRSP has four strategic pillars: (i) restore security, consolidate peace
and prevent conflict; (ii) promote good governance and the rule of law; (iii) rebuild
and diversify the economy; and (iv) develop human capital. After emerging from
almost a decade of political instability, armed-conflict, and poor government
effectiveness, the priority challenges are to restore peace and security, rebuild
institutions, improve social and basic infrastructure service delivery, and restore
confidence between the State and the population, these being critical pre-conditions for
growth and poverty reduction. The Government has made considerable effort to increase
spending in key sectors and the 2008 budget is better aligned with the country's
priorities. Infrastructure, defense and security, health, and education as individual item
have the highest share of the 2008 budget and increased significantly compared with the
2007 budget.16 However, room for fiscal space is small without a significant increase in
external assistance.


                    III. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S
                                                    PROGRAM

                      A. LINK TO JOINT INTERIM STRATEGY NOTE (JISN)

46.      The Joint Interim Strategy Note (JISN), which was presented to the Board of
Executive Directors in March 2007, outlines support to the CAR planned by the
World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB) for 18 months (FY07-08).
The over-arching goal of the JISN is to help the CAR recover from a long period of
instability and begin laying the foundations for sustained, shared growth over the medium
term. Key features of the JISN include helping the CAR: (i) resolve its arrears to the two
institutions, and to multilateral development partners more generally, in order to restore
substantial external support to the country; (ii) begin benefiting from debt relief through
access to the HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief (MDRI) initiatives as early as possible;
and (iii) address urgent needs on the ground, notably by rebuilding minimal effectiveness
of the Government to set and execute policy and deliver services.

47.      The JISN supports a key government objective, which is to spur economic
recovery and help strengthen public sector governance spanning public finance
management, both from the expenditure and revenue perspectives, economic governance



16As a share of the budget: Defense and security (11,58 percent); Infrastructure (12,7 percent); Education
(8,8 percent); Health (8 percent). Increase compared with 2007: Defense (59,1 percent); Equipment (28,8
percent); Health (8,6 percent); Education (4.5 percent)



                                                    18

in key sectors such as telecommunications, forestry, and mining, public administration,
and public sector governance.

48.     The JISN explicitly identifies budget support as a key aid modality, fostering
ownership, alignment with the country's development program, and domestic
accountability. Budget support for a country like the CAR is critical to ensure that the
Government has the financial maneuvering space to implementing a policy reform
package that aims to reduce fiduciary risk and enhance transparency and governance, in
order to mobilize the external donor community to step up aid commitments. It is also
critical for a country that in the past has shown difficulties in staying current on external
debt servicing--failure to pay external debt on a timely fashion can jeopardize the
reengagement process and thus lead to a suspension of donor programs, with deleterious
effects for the country's poverty and growth objectives, as set out in the PRSP. The JISN
calls for a rationalization of donor support, including a move towards co-financing or
joint operations aiming to engage the authorities at regular intervals during the budget
cycle on key development issues. In this regard, the Bank and AfDB and other donors
have increasingly endorsed government programs and strategies, using harmonized aid
modalities and relying on government processes and systems.

                         B. LINK WITH BANK GROUP OPERATIONS

49.     Reengagement and Institution-Building Support Program. The EMGRG
builds on the achievements of the Reengagement and Institution-Building Support
Program which closed on November 30, 2007. This operation set the stage for
meaningful reengagement of the donor community and assisted the CAR in its economic
and social recovery underpinned by the government's Economic and Social Policy
Framework (ESPF). It was the first IDA financing operation in the CAR since the
country went into arrears in 2001. It supported the government program focusing on: (i)
the development of key public finance to help raise domestic revenue; (ii) the
strengthening of Treasury's control over expenditures, and (iii) payroll management
system and timely payment of public wages. To increase the tax base, particular attention
was given to improving the business climate and promoting private investment in key
sectors such as mining, forestry, and telecommunications.

50.     Low-Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) Trust Fund. Since 2004 three
projects, financed from the LICUS Trust Fund, totaling US$13.2 million, have supported
technical assistance capacity building, the PRSP process, reforms in Public Finance
Management, forestry, mining, public administration and civil service reforms, and social
service delivery. In particular, the LICUS II TF has allowed for carrying out: (i) the audit
of the Treasury, (ii) the audit of the mining sector, (iii) tax and customs administration
reforms including the audit of the fiscal system in the forestry sector, the reconciliation of
the VAT base between the BEAC and customs, and (iv) the creation of a unified payroll
management system. A recently approved LICUS project supported the implementation
of social services by protecting salary payments of civil servants in education and health
during a period of severe cash constraints in March-April 2008 until further external
resources could be mobilized. A proposed LICUS III would sustain technical assistance
to help achieve the EMGRG objectives. The LICUS III would support the



                                              19

implementation of the HIPC triggers related to the modernization of the public
administration, the implementation of the EITI, and the revision of the mining code.
Annex 6 provides details of the activities financed by LICUS Trust Funds that are
relevant to and related to this budget support operation.

51.     CEMAC Transport and Transit Facilitation project. This project aims to
secure access to landlocked countries, enhance regional integration and increase trade in
the CEMAC countries. It consists of three sub-components: (i) roads and rail investment;
(ii) investment in facilitation, inter-modal platforms and port efficiency; and (iii) support
to customs reforms and institutional support to policy improvements. CAR Component of
the project funded by IDA (US$ 24 million) mainly consists of a contribution to the
paving of the Douala-Bangui link, as well as support to road maintenance, customs
reform, and transport policy design.

52.     In addition to its direct link to the DPO I and LICUS Trust Funded
activities, the proposed Grant is integrated into the Bank's overall portfolio (Annex
5) including investment projects, and economic and sector work (ESW). IFC is involved
in activities aiming to improve the business environment, in particular (i) the preparation
of technical assistance and financing for operationalizing the one-stop shop with the
objectives of reducing the costs and procedures of opening and registering a business in
the CAR. IFC's activities are planned to start in the course of 2008 and (ii) support to
small-scale enterprises.

                      C. RELATION WITH IMF AND OTHER DONORS

53.       A limited number of key donors are active in the CAR. The EC, the IMF,
France and the UNDP are providing support in a number of areas, including public
finance management, justice sector reforms, and governance, among others.

54.       The proposed operation has been elaborated with close consultation and
coordination with the donor community active in the CAR. In particular, the AfDB
has decided to prepare its budget support operation based on the same government reform
program, the implementation of which would start with the World Bank support. The
AfDB participated in a joint-mission with the Bank in February 2008 to agree with the
Government on the same set of policy measures. The prior actions of the two-tranche
AfDB operation will be taken from the common matrix and supervision of the reform
program by both institutions will be done in a coordinated fashion. There also has been
extensive consultation with the donor community, in particular the EC, France, the IMF
and the UNDP, to ensure that there is coordination and harmonization among donor's
reform programs. The EC is providing sector and general budget support, and the general
budget support operation is currently in the design phase and alignment with the program
supported by the Bank and the AfDB is under consideration.

55.     The IMF Executive Board approved a PRGF in December 2006, supporting the
goal of economic recovery and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The core objectives
of the program are: (i) enhancing public resource mobilization and efficiency of
spending; (ii) increasing the financial sector's contribution to growth and enhancing the



                                             20

effectiveness of monetary policy; and (iii) improving the business and investment
environment. The periodic assessment of CAR's macroeconomic performance by the
Fund serves as a key input for dialogue on policies related to macroeconomic stability
and for ensuring timely payment of salaries and external debt servicing. The second
review is expected to be discussed by the IMF's Board in June 2008.

56.     The AfDB has been actively providing budget support to the Government of the
CAR to implement the country's 2007-2008 Economic Report Support Program (ERSP).
Aside from the current harmonization of support to the government program, the AfDB is
providing technical assistance in the area of debt and data management, as well as
developing capacities to design, implement, and monitor investment projects. Finally,
AfDB supports the finalizing of the procurement reforms, including the preparation of a
new Code and its operationalization.

57.       EC AREMIF (Appui a la Reforme du Ministère des Finances)project. This
project supports: (i) the upgrade of the budget and accounting nomenclatures and the
production of the new Chart of Account; (ii) the strengthening of the internal control
system (Directorate of Financial Control and the General Inspectorate of the State - IGF),
(iii) reforms in customs departments, in particular the computerization of customs
database and the strengthening of the capacity of customs agents. EC technical assistance
is also providing support to the Ministry of Finance in the design of an action plan for
customs, including the one-stop shop in Douala; and (iv) reforms in justice, in particular
the drafting of the sector strategy, the strengthening of various units and the ministry's
personnel, and the improvements of prisoners' conditions.

58.       EC Forestry Projects. The EC supports the forestry sector in CAR through
regional conservation programs. The Central Africa Forest Ecosystems (ECOFAC) which
started in the early 1990s aims at ensuring, in the long term, the preservation and
sustainable management of natural resources in the Congo Basin area. The EC also
supports a regional wildlife conservation program that focuses on endemic species such
as gorillas and elephant. The objective of the EC/WWF project, which will be effective in
April 2008, is to reduce poverty among the indigenous people living around and within
the Dzanga-Sangha protected area.

59.       UNDP. In public expenditure management, the UNDP has launched as series of
training aiming to strengthen budget preparation, especially the capacity of staff in the
Ministry of Planning and other line ministries (education, public works, health,
agriculture) to design a medium-term expenditure planning (MTEF) in line with the
PRSP objectives. In the area of tax administration, the UNDP is financing a
comprehensive tax-survey to identify potential taxpayers and reforms in public
administration and civil service. The UNDP also has active programs in the areas of
governance and justice, as well as public administration reform. In the area of
governance, the UNDP will finance technical assistance to support the Government in its
efforts to finalize an anticorruption strategy as well as for operationalizing the asset
disclosure program and planned procurement reforms.

60.      France has a number of long-term experts working in the Ministry of Finance
(ARCAGE project) providing technical assistance to the budget and the treasury
directorate staff. In particular, France is supporting the computerization of the Directorate
of Budget and the Treasury, and the rolling out of the Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) at the central level, which will help produce the budget
execution reports. As of December 2007, the computerization of the Treasury is
completed and that of the Directorate of the Budget is being finalized. Staffs of both
directorates are in the process of entering relevant data to produce the annual treasury
balance and budget execution reports for 2007. In forestry, the objective of the PARPAF
project is to help the forestry administration in the preparation of Forest Management
Plans for sustainable harvesting within the area allocated to logging permits. The project
whose second phase started in 2006 for a 4 year period, aims at setting the stage for
sustainable forest management in the productive forest, in a way that can perpetuate the
economic as well as the ecological functions of forests ecosystems.

61.      GTZ. The German cooperation, providing ongoing support to the forest,
focuses on the protection of biodiversity and forest ecosystems in the Dzangha ­Sangha
reserve located in the western part of the country, on the Congo Brazzaville border. It
also helps to fund a participatory forest management project and to pilot a community
development project in Lobaye in the south and Ouham in the North of the country.

                              D. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

62.      Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA). The CFAA was finalized in
October 2007. This report identified a series of deficiencies and shortcomings in the
CAR's public financial management and includes a global action plan of
recommendations on the legal and institutional framework, budget and expenditures
management, and customs and tax administration. The PEFA exercise (FY08), which is
under way, is an integrated monitoring framework that allows measurement of the
country PFM performance over time. Pinpointing strengths and weaknesses in financial
accountability arrangements in the public sector, the framework helps the Government
and donors identify priorities for reform and support both the exercise of the donors'
fiduciary responsibilities and the achievement of broader development objectives. The
exercise also facilitates harmonization of the dialogue between the Government and the
donor community around a common framework in line with the Paris Declaration, which
measures the PFM performance and contributes to reducing transaction costs for donors.
The public finance management policy areas included in the EMGRG are those identified
as critical by the CFAA and the PEFA including better control of the Treasury over
government operations and resources through, inter alia, a drastic reduction of accounts
held in commercial banks and the systematization of non-tax revenue collection at the
level of ministries; tax and customs administration efforts; effort towards comprehensive
accounting and reporting of government operations.

63.      Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS). The recently completed
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS; FY07) report examines the constraints to
regional and international trade integration. It identifies the dire situation of the country's



                                              22

public finances as one of the significant problems that affect the country's
competitiveness through its impact on infrastructure. The continued deterioration in the
social sectors has likewise led to an erosion of the CAR's human capital, compromising
the situation for future generations. The EMGRG explicitly focuses on the need to
improve capacity of the Government to mobilize domestic revenue, through improved tax
administration. Among the findings of the report which are relevant to this operation are
those concerning the forestry sector. The DTIS recommends a thorough review of the
pricing of permits, as current pricing does not reflect regional best practice.

64.        Debt Management Performance Assessment (DEMPA). The CAR is among
the first countries selected for this debt management technical assistance. It is a technical
assistance which aims to strengthen capacity and institutions to manage government debt
in an effective and sustainable manner, by assessing performance through a
comprehensive set of performance indicators spanning the full range of government debt
management functions, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. When finished, the
DEMPA exercise, will provide a baseline of debt management performance indicators,
on which the country's future debt management performance will be assessed. It will
prove a valuable tool in assisting the Government to improve its debt management
capacity, which is particularly important in a country which has fallen into external debt
arrears.

65.        Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP). A CPIP was completed in April
2006, which includes an assessment of the country's public procurement system and
proposes an action plan to improve and align procurement processes with internationally-
recognized standards.17 Actions recommended in the CPIP include the adoption of a new
procurement code with regulations for standard bidding documents and guides, and the
establishment of new procurement institutions. The EMGRG would support the
government's efforts to operationalize the new procurement procedures, notably the
establishment of the Direction Générale des Marchés and the Agence de Regulation and
the decentralization of procurement processes to four key ministries, once the new
procurement code is passed by the National Assembly.

66.        Anti-corruption surveys and reports. Since 2005 the UNDP has been actively
supporting the Government of the CAR in its efforts to fight corruption. In this regard,
and in collaboration with Transparency International, it published (i) a report on the
findings of a household and company survey on the perception and causes of corruption;
and (ii) a study on corruption.18 The survey found that among private sector managers,
corruption is considered the second most pressing development priority, after security
concerns, and is a top development priority among households. The corruption study
analyzed the level of corruption, its causes and consequences, and made a series of
recommendations. Among the factors identified as contributing to the existing level of

17
  CAR's procurement system had last been assessed in February 2003, with financing from the EU. This
earlier assessment had recommended the need for significant reforms given the extent of the problems
uncovered. A draft procurement code was prepared, but was not adopted as many institutions, including the
Ministry of Equipment and Transport, believed it was not adapted to national circumstances.

entrepreneurs (Decembre 2005),; Etude Sur le Système Nationale d'Integrité (December 2006).



                                                  23

corruption was the absence of a national anti-corruption strategy, as well as political and
institutional instability, generalized poverty, and a culture of tolerance vis-à-vis
corruption. Among the recommendations made by the study is the ratification of the UN
Convention against Corruption, (UNCAC), something which was done in October 2006.
The program of reforms supported by the EMGRG will support the implementation of
some of the key recommendations of the report, including the development of an
anticorruption strategy and measures aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability,
in line with the country's commitments under UNCAC.

67.     Forestry sector assessment. The Government carried out a forestry sector
assessment in 2004 to update information in the forestry sector and understand the poor
performance of the sector. This study recommended the need for ensuring that all permits
are associated with management plans, transparent allocation of permits, and the adoption
of new regulations aiming at promoting the sustainable management of productive
through the PEA which is now being incorporated in the new forestry Code. Another
study was launched in 2007 and is being finalized to assess the efficiency of the tax
collection system, compliance of private operators with the national tax regulations, the
distribution of revenues from the sector to all relevant entities including communities and
their use. The initial findings of that study suggest that there is room for improvement to
ensure transparency and competition in the system of allocation of timber harvesting
rights. Likewise, the tax collection and management systems could be improved. The
reform program supported by the EMRGR will help the Government to address issues in
tax collection in the sector.

68.     To develop analytical inputs on the environmental aspects and policy
recommendations for a potential environment and natural resource management policy
reform program, the Bank will work with the Government, development partners and
civil society organizations to prepare a Country Environmental Analysis (CEA). The
CEA will consist of three elements, focusing on (i) the costs and principle sources of
environmental degradation, (ii) institutional capacity for environmental management, and
(iii) priority sectors in which to strengthen policies, build institutions and invest for
sustainable growth. The priority sectors to be addressed in the CEA will be identified by
the Government in collaboration with development partners and civil society stakeholders
from among a variety of environmental management challenges.

                                    E. LESSONS LEARNED

69.       Reforms under the 2006 DPO helped support fiscal sustainability, in
particular due to efficient expenditure controls. Institutional and governance reforms
take time and require sustained dialogue and longer time to be implemented. Such
reforms include the revision of the regulatory framework in key sectors such as mining
and forestry as well as telecommunications. Similarly, reforms addressing the settlement
of cross-liabilities between the State and the public utility companies and limiting non-
technical losses have not resulted in substantial improvement.

70.       Lessons from the DPO I also indicate that this type of instrument is
effective in addressing a broad range of issues critical for government effectiveness,



                                              24

rebuilding institutions in a post-conflict environment, and setting the stage for
medium-term reforms. However, it also revealed that due to weak institutions, there are
practical difficulties in post-conflict countries to carry out complex reform programs.
Therefore, operations should be sharply focused and sequenced with a reasonable
milestone framework to allow for key progress. Focus should be shifted gradually from
institution- building and support to the legal and regulatory frameworks to reforms
supporting effective policy implementation. Therefore, the need for particular attention to
poverty alleviation and growth components of post-conflict programs can only be
medium-term objectives of a DPO.

71.       In the reengagement process, post-conflict countries often lack resources
due to weak revenue mobilization capacity and competing key demands which
range from security reinforcement, reconstruction program, salary payment to
social needs and debt services. Reforms need to be backed-up by pre identified sources
of financing to maximize the chance for full success. With regards the DPO I, the reasons
for the delay in implementing some of the reforms were partly the result of insufficient
financing. The same reason can also often lead to the weak effectiveness of institutions
created or strengthened under a program.


                     IV.    THE PROPOSED GRANT OPERATION

                               A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

72.       Development objectives. The proposed EMGRG supports implementation of
the CAR's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper in two key areas: (i) strengthening public
finance management; and (ii) improving public sector and economic governance,
understood as policies aimed at fighting corruption and enhancing transparency, as well
as reinforcing the regulatory environment in the forestry and oil. Building on the
government's achievements under RIBSUP, this new reform program will directly
support two pillars of the PRSP: (i) promoting good governance and the rule of law
(pillar 2); and (ii) rebuilding and diversifying the economy (pillar 3). The proposed
operation will support pillar 3 by strengthening the legal and regulatory framework of
two key sectors that are critical for sustaining high economic growth in the CAR: the
forestry sector, which is the second largest source of exports, and the petroleum products
sub-sector, the latter being an important input for many industries. It will also assist the
Government in working toward some of the HIPC Completion Point triggers, especially
with regards to public financial management.

73.       Benefits. This one-tranche Bank financing supports the GoCAR to implement
key policy actions in line with the PRSP objectives to improve public finances,
governance, and the regulatory framework for key sectors. Reforms supported by the
grant will thus contribute to strengthening the institutional infrastructure needed to
improve the public sector's capacity to carry out its role more effectively. In particular
the implementation of this reform program is expected to: (i) start improving the
alignment of the national budget with the PRSP objectives and establishing more
transparent and reliable fiscal reporting; (ii) improve tax revenue mobilization capacity,
reduce revenue leakages from the Treasury and enhance liquidity management; (iii)


                                             25

strengthen transparency and accountability; and (iv) establish a competitive environment
in the oil and forestry sectors. The funds provided under the EMGRG will prove critical
funds to ensure that the Government stays current on its payment obligations and to
prevent the accumulation of new salary arrears. In addition, the proposed reform program
is expected to lead to improvements in PFM and governance that should enhance the
credibility of the government's program and thus help attract more donor support, and in
particular budget support.

74.       Prior actions. The World Bank is supporting the Government in its efforts to
implement its public finance and governance reform program, following assurances that
it is committed to carry on with the implementation of these reforms. Box 1 provides a
summary of the prior actions that the Government has already undertaken to implement
the program supported by this grant operation.

                              Box 1: Prior Actions for this Grant Operation


A. Improve the Efficiency of Public Finance Management

Prior action 1: A presidential decree has been issued to enforce new budget execution procedures, including
modalities, procedures and accountabilities for the implementation of the state budget, and nomination of
key staff in the General Directorates of Budget and Treasury.

Prior action 2: The Ministry of Finance has adopted by decision (Arrêté) a new accounting classification,
after extensive consultations with civil society and donors.

Prior action 3: The Ministry of Finance has requested by an official letter that 51 government accounts held
in commercial banks considered inactive, dormant, or settled be closed immediately and that the balance on
said accounts be transferred to a designated treasury account.

Prior action 4: The Ministry of Finance has redeployed by decision (Arrêté) 7 treasury agents to each of the
Recipient's line ministries generating revenues, including the ministries of Youth, Defense, Interior and
Public Security, Commerce, Education, Civil Service and Health, to facilitate the reporting of their
respective revenues in the Recipient's government accounts.

Prior action 5: The Ministry of Finance has adopted by decision (Arrêté), the ASYCUDA computerized
information system to produce pre clearance documents for imports entering the Recipient's territory
through the Port of Douala (Cameroon), so that it be compatible with the one used at the Recipient's central
services in Bangui.

B. Strengthening Public Sector and Economic Governance

Prior action 6: A presidential decree has been issued creating a permanent anti-corruption oversight
committee, Comité National de Lutte contre la Corruption, within the Prime Minister's office. The decree
specifies the composition of the committee and its responsibilities, including the design of an anti-
corruption strategy and oversight of the various public entities involved in the fight against corruption.

Prior action 7: The Government has strengthened fiscal compliance with national fiscal regulations in the
forestry sector and exercised of its legal remedies including: (i) cancellation of exploitation permits of two
new firms having failed to pay entry fees when due; and (ii) identifying all active forestry operators with
overdue fiscal obligations, and notifying each operator of the deadline for payment of the overdue amounts.

Prior action 8: The Ministry of Forestry has by public notice suspended the issuance of new permits, until
the CAR's forestry code has been enacted, and this has been posted on the government's website and
widely disseminated to the public.

Prior action 9: The Government has enacted a law creating the new petroleum regulatory body (Agence de
Stabilisation et de Régulation des Prix et des Produits Pétroliers), adopted its governing documents
(statuts), and nominated the General Manager, Chairman of the Board of Directors and other key staff.

Prior action 10: A contract has been signed between the petroleum regulatory agency (Agence de
Stabilisation et de Régulation des Prix et des Produits Pétrolier) and an independent pre-inspection agency
of international reputation, which will be responsible for controlling the quality of imported oil products.

                            Box 2. Good Practice Principles on Conditionality


Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership

·   The PRSP was approved in 2007 following extensive participation and consultations and has been
    implemented since then.
·   The country has had a positive policy reform track record.
·   The Bank has had extensive discussions with the authorities on policy options and the Government has
    designed the reforms according to its needs, notably in PFM and governance.
·   Bank involvement in the oil sector has responded to the government's demands, reflecting the need for
    advice after significant petroleum sector reforms.



Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework

·   The accountability framework (e.g., policy matrix) for measuring progress under the government
    program has been agreed with development partners, and is fully aligned with the AfDB.
·   The operation has been discussed with donors in the country providing budget support and the
    monitoring an evaluation system may benefit other donors aiming to participate in the medium term in
    budget support.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances

·   The budget support operation focuses on measures to address immediate bottlenecks in public resource
    management and governance, as part of a broader government reform strategy. They closely reflect
    urgent priorities in economic management and avoid areas of political sensitivity such as privatization.
·   The Government has expressed its policy intentions and many of the policy reforms have already been
    initiated.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement

·   Prior actions and conditions focus on critical actions to assure early improvement in the management
    of public finance management and governance. All of these have already been undertaken by the
    authorities.
·   Prior actions for the forestry sector in particular represent the government's response to recent
    international concerns over transparency in the attribution of timber permits.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support

·   The country's domestic accountability and M&E cycle is not yet established and grounded in a regular
    process.
·   Two reviews (one formal and one informal) are planned that promote results focus taking into account
    the limited indicators available in the country and the short period available to have visible impacts (1
    year).



                                            B. POLICY AREAS

75.        Annex 2 summarizes a set of policy measures taken prior to the Board
presentation of this operation and lays out follow-on measures under the Bank-supported



                                                     28

government program. The actions are organized under two broad policy areas ­ public
finance management and public sector and economic governance.

Public Finance Management

Background and issues in public expenditure management

76.       Public expenditure management in CAR had been weak because: (i) the
annual budgeting process did not allocate sufficient resources on the basis of strategic
objectives, (ii) budget execution had been affected by several exceptional procedures and
weak internal control; (iii) no reliable accounting system had been used and several
operations had not been accounted properly; and (iv) no reliable budget reporting existed.
Both the recent CFAA and PEFA reports have highlighted continued weaknesses in
PFM, and both make recommendations which have formed the basis of the government's
own public finance reform program.19

77.       As part of the reengagement of the Bank in the CAR, the DPO I ­ the
predecessor operation - has assisted the Government in public finance management
reforms. It has been instrumental in setting the stage for a modern legal framework for
the budget, including the adoption of an organic Law and the establishment of a
consultation mechanism with line ministries and the civil society during budget
preparation. New budget classifications were also used for the 2008 budget. In addition,
under the supervision of a Treasury Committee, the number of exceptional procedures
had been reduced. Cash advances have been more closely monitored and issuance of
Treasury checks has been limited to cash-backed checks. Similarly, unforeseen
expenditures in goods and services have been controlled strictly with the creation of a
line item not exceeding 10 percent of goods and services.

78.       The predecessor operation also had as one of its objectives the settlement of
mounting arrears between public utility companies (electricity, water, and
telecommunications) and the State, and the regular payment of utility and tax bills.
The inability of the State to pay its bills is caused by insufficient budget provision for
utility consumption and has affected the financial situation of public utility companies as
well as the quality and quantity of service delivery. Small progress has been achieved
under this item: arrears to public utility companies remain high and neither the
Government nor the public utility companies had been able to pay their respective bills
on a regular basis.

79.       Several areas need continued reforms, particularly budget management
and Treasury operations, as evidenced by the first findings of the PEFA, the CFAA
and the audit of the Treasury. These inputs point to: (i) the lack of forward looking
approach of the budget and more precisely the absence of a Medium-Term Expenditure


19The draft version of the PEFA, dated January 2008, provides a comprehensive assessment of public
finance management in the CAR. It covers the: (i) credibility of the budget; (ii) transparency and
completeness of the budget; (iii) budget preparation on the basis of national policies; (iv0 the predictability
and control of budget execution; (iv) accounting and budget reporting; and (viii) surveillance and external
controls.



                                                    29

Framework, including the absence of adequate budget provisions for public utility20; (ii)
weak control of the Treasury over government resources, including revenues generated at
the level of ministries/departments and government accounts in commercial banks; and
(iii) the lack of transparent and comprehensive reporting of government operations both
at the level of the Directorate of Budget and the Treasury.

80.         The Government plans to produce timely and reliable budget reports. As a
pre condition for the production of such reports, the Government has issued a
presidential decree to enforce new budget execution procedures, including modalities,
procedures, and accountabilities for the implementation of the state budget, and
nomination of key staff in the General Directorates of the Budget and Treasury. The new
budget execution procedures draw from the CFAA and technical assistance from donors.
It aims to simplify and reduce the number of steps to be taken to process expenditures.
Among its main features are the autonomy and the reduction of the number of
interventions of the Financial Commitment Control. It also improves the legal framework
governing the role of the officials to authorize payments. In addition, staff nomination of
key at the level of the Directorate of budget and the Treasury will ensure proper
functioning of the new dispositions and celerity in budget processing.

81.         The Government plans to include budget provisions for arrears to public
utilities. Given the importance of the electricity, water, and telecommunications sector
for the private sector and the population, there is a need to address the stock of arrears
and government utility bill payment which are critical for improving the financial
performance and service delivery of the companies concerned. The reduction of arrears
will be informed by the audit of domestic arrears for 2005-07.

82.         Key next steps include:

     ·      Production of timely quarterly budget execution reports from commitment to
     authorization for health, education, equipment/infrastructure, and agriculture
     ministries. As of February 2007, the computerization of the Directorate of Budget is
     being completed and staffs are finalizing the upload of the 2007-data in the system to
     produce the 2007-administrative accounts while starting to input data for 2008. The
     Government is expected to produce quarterly budget execution reports for key
     ministries from March 2008 onwards.

     ·      Submission of the 2008 Execution Law to the Parliament. The above step will
     lead to the production of the 2008 annual budget execution report and the submission
     of the 2008 Execution Law to the National Assembly for the first time in CAR.

     ·      Inclusion of a budget line in the 2009 budget for payment of government arrears
     to ENERCA, SODECA, SOCATEL. In addition, an action plan addressing chronic
     government arrears and ensuring utility bill payment with measures to be
     implemented during the course of 2008 will be produced by a Committee under the


20This operation will not address budget preparation. The UNDP is already supporting Government in its
effort to establish a MTEF and its operationalization in the 2009 budget.

    lead of the Minister of Finance with representatives from public utility companies and
    line ministries involved. The target is to reduce by 10 percent the overall outstanding
    stock of arrears, compared to the level at end-2007. The Fund program will support a
    timetable to repay the arrears over 10 years.

83.       The Government has also adopted several measures to improve the
efficiency and transparency of the accounting system. These reforms strengthen the
accounting system, and improve the treasury's control over government's operations and
its reporting capacity. Immediate actions under this operation include: (i) the adoption of
a new accounting classification; and (ii) the closure of inactive accounts in BEAC and
commercial banks.

84.       The Minister of Finance has adopted by decision (Arrete) a new accounting
classification, finalized after extensive consultations with civil society and donors. The
new accounting nomenclature, which will ensure comprehensive accounting of
government operations, has been finalized and validated by the authorities after extensive
consultations with civil society and donors. A first draft had been produced and presented
to a broader audience (civil society, donors) in the third week of February. The new
accounting nomenclature will allow for adjustments to the new budget classification if
necessary to account for all government operations.

85.     The Minister of Finance has requested by an official letter that 51 government
accounts held in commercial banks considered inactive, dormant, or settled be closed
immediately and that the balance on said accounts be transferred to a designated
treasury account. This operation supports the government's initiative to reduce the
number of government accounts in commercial banks. The control by the Treasury of
these accounts is often poor, thereby undermining liquidity management and the
comprehensiveness of the accounting of government operations and reporting. A number
of accounts had been identified by the technical assistance of the Fund and the audit of
the Treasury financed by a LICUS TF to determine the final number of accounts, their
nature and dates of closure. As of end March 2008, 51 accounts in commercial banks
have been closed, and the balances transferred to a treasury account.

86.        Key next steps include:

    ·     Propose a list of accounts to be closed and transfer of their respective balance
    to a Treasury account under the control of the Directorate of the Treasury within a
    defined time line based on an audit by IGF of existing government bank accounts held
    in commercial banks followed by an independent review/audit of accounts with
    negative balance. Closing government accounts held in commercial banks, in
    addition to the 51 already closed, will require an audit and a processing schedule
    which will vary according to the nature of the accounts. Future measures are: (i) the
    audit of accounts in commercial banks, the results of which are to be reviewed by an
    independent auditor for accounts with negative balance; (ii) the production of list of
    accounts to be transferred to a Treasury account; and (iii) the production of a list of
    accounts to be closed within a defined period. Such actions would contribute to the




                                             31

    comprehensiveness of the accounting system and ensure transparency of government
    operations reporting.

    ·     Audit of the 2005-07 domestic arrears vetted by the authorities. The
    Government validated recently an audit of the 1998-2004 arrears and a corresponding
    settlement plan. New debt and arrears have been accumulated between 2004 and 2007
    including 6-month salary arrears. In order to account for the operations between 2004
    and 2007 in government operations and start implementing a settlement plan, the
    authorities need to validate the 2005-07 period arrears. The Government will conduct
    an audit of the 2005-07 arrears by the IGF to be vetted by the authorities.

    ·     Production of the 2008 government accounts. With the computerization of the
    Treasury and Budget operations and the new accounting classifications, the
    Government plans to produce the 2008 government accounts for the first time. While
    the data for 2008 will be uploaded on a regular basis, a unit will be created within the
    Treasury to consolidate and input the relevant data for the 2007 operations.

Background and issues in domestic revenue mobilization

87.       Averaging 7 percent of GDP over the last decade, CAR's domestic revenue is
among the lowest in the world due to small tax base, and weak revenue mobilization
capacity, including lack of adequate equipment. In particular, customs administration was
affected by corruption and resources and revenues collected by line ministries have not
been fully controlled by the Treasury. In an attempt to revamp the customs system, the
authorities abolished the customs office in the fall of 2006 and created a new one which
was approved by the IMF later in the same year and the Government has contracted a
private operator to run a pre clearance office. Under an EC technical assistance, the
Government also completed the networking of the customs offices between CAR
customs in Douala and Bangui with ASYCUDA, the automated system for customs data.

88.       Under the predecessor operation, the Government (i) completed an audit of the
performance of the pre-clearance system in Douala to assess its performance. The main
recommendation of the audit pointed to the need to establish final clearance of imports in
Douala or in Bangui, and to secure the transit system from Douala to Bangui; and (ii)
launched a comprehensive national survey to identify potential taxpayers and to increase
the tax base. The Government also made progress in capturing revenue generated and
declared by line ministries which increased from CFAF4 billion to CFAF13-14 billion
between 2005 and 2007. Finally, the Auditor General (Inspection Générale de l'Etat)
and the General Inspectorate of the State (Inspection Générale des Finances) conducted
audits (i) to identify additional sources of revenues at the level of these entities and (ii) to
define the share of revenues collected by these ministries that should be retained at their
level to finance specific activities.

89.       Key institutional distortions negatively affect the CAR's ability to mobilize
domestic revenue: (i) the existing pre clearance office, run by a private operator, uses a
different database system to issue the required pre clearance documents. Such a
duplication increases the risk of corruption as the database system in Bangui is not linked



                                              32

to the system in Douala, thereby reducing the authorities' ability to trace and value goods
adequately; (ii) customs receipts are transferred to commercial banks rather than central
bank government accounts, thereby adversely affecting the cash management of the
Treasury, as commercial banks automatically offset domestic debt services directly with
government resources at their disposal; and (iii) submissions of revenue generated at the
level of line ministries are made without proper accounting procedures and direct control
of treasury agents.

90.       This reform program supports government actions to improve domestic
revenue mobilization capacity. Immediate measures supported under the grant include
(i) the redeployment of treasury agents to all line ministries generating revenue, and (ii)
the use of ASYCUDA for all customs transactions. This measure complements recent
initiatives to increase tax revenues, namely capacity building for customs agents and the
computerization of the customs database by the European Commission and the start of a
initiative jointly funded by the EC and IDA at a regional level to secure a more cost
effective transit regime on the corridor between Douala and Bangui.

91.       The Minister of Finance has redeployed by decision (Arrete) 7 treasury agents
to each of the Recipient's line ministries generating revenues, including the ministries of
Youth, Defense, Interior and Public Security, Commerce, Education, Civil Service and
Health, to facilitate the reporting of their respective revenues in the Recipient's
government accounts. In December 2007 the Government had already started the process
of redeployment of Treasury agents to the ministries of Finance, Planning, Public Works,
Mining and Energy, Justice, and Communications. To systematize capturing of non-tax
revenues at the level of line ministries, the Minister of Finance has redeployed seven
treasury agents to additional seven line ministries. The redeployment of Treasury agents
in 2008 means that all line ministries generating revenues are now covered. These
reforms will also help use adequate accounting system to incorporate the global amount
of these revenues in the government accounts.

92.       The Minister of Finance has adopted by decision (Arrete), the ASYCUDA
computerized information system to produce pre clearance documents for imports
entering the Recipient's territory through the Port of Douala (Cameroon), so that it be
compatible with the one used at the Recipient's central services in Bangui. The
recommendations of the recently completed audit of the pre clearance office in Douala
point to the need to revise the process, especially to use a single system linking the
offices in Douala and Bangui to improve the traceability of imported goods as well as
that of the value declared by importers. Data submitted through ASYCUDA in Douala
has now been locked in a networked system between Douala and Bangui, which will
reduce the risk of corruption, thereby strenghtening the control of the customs office in
Bangui.

93.       Key next steps include:

    ·     Transfer of customs revenue to account held in BEAC. Customs receipts both
    from the pre clearance system and the final declaration in Bangui are deposited at
    commercial banks. The Government will replace this system with a direct transfer of



                                            33

    customs receipts to the Central Bank in Douala and Bangui. Such a measure will
    provide the Treasury with full control on government resources and improve cash
    management. Treasury agents will be posted in Douala and will be in charge of
    depositing at the BEAC customs receipts from the pre clearance system.

    ·    Install networked systems between the tax and customs directorates and the pre
    inspection company. The connection of ASYCUDA between the customs offices in
    Douala and Bangui has been completed recently and offers opportunity to better track
    movements of imported goods. In order to further improve data management and the
    tracking and predictability of import and export tax receipts, the program proposes
    the connection of the pre inspection company BIVAC with the customs offices to
    complete the networking of all entities involved in trading across borders.

    ·    Update the tax and customs database based on the results of the 2007 national
    surveys. The Government would use the results of the survey to identify potential
    taxpayers to update the taxpayer database under SYSTEMIF (tax administration) and
    ASYCUDA (customs), with the aim of increasing the tax base.


Public Sector and Economic Governance

Background and issues for anti-corruption

94.      CAR ranks well below the average of Sub-Saharan Africa in all of the World
Bank Institute's governance indicators, particularly those measuring government
effectiveness and rule of law, where the CAR ranks in the bottom 10 percent worldwide.
As a signatory to the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the Government has
committed to implement a wide-range of reforms aimed at strengthening transparency
and accountability, and it is expected that these will eventually translate into
improvements in the CAR's governance indicators, which the Government is monitoring
closely.

95.      Under the predecessor operation, the Government was successful in
revamping a set of institutions including: (i) an operational branch of the judiciary, the
"Tribunal de Grande Instance" to better monitor the processing of filed cases, (ii) the
Pôle Financier du Tribunal de Grande Instance de Bangui (it is a special section of the
tribunal created in July 2005, with a mandate to investigate fiscal, financial, and customs
fraud, as well as trafficking of influence), (iii) the Agence Nationale d'Investigation
Financière (ANIF), created in September 2007 to investigate money laundering and
terrorism. These measures have led to a significant increase in the number of cases of
suspected corruption under investigation, over 287 individuals since 2006, and in the
number of penalties imposed. It has also allowed the strengthening of the accountability
of the Executive through asset disclosure of the Prime Minister and cabinet members at
entry and exit.

96.      The effectiveness of some of these anti-corruption entities has been
hampered by a number of factors. In particular, the absence of a well identified anti-
corruption interlocutor and coordinator or reform champion within the Government,


                                             34

helps explain in part the delays in producing an anti-corruption strategy and in
operationalizing new agencies aimed at fighting corruption. In this regard, a temporary
committee, the Comité de Réflexion sur la Corruption (CRC) was established in 2005,
with the aim of devising an anticorruption strategy until a permanent anti-corruption
institution was created. This committee, which is no longer operational, suffered from a
number of shortcomings which made its functioning ineffective. Among these
shortcomings was the decision to exclude the Ministry of Justice, civil society and key
private sector representatives as committee members, as well as the decision to have the
CRC chaired by a line ministry. Given the sensitivity of anti-corruption reforms, there
was unwillingness among line ministries to assume responsibility for championing
reforms. Experience from other countries suggests that anti-corruption efforts work best
when championed and sanctioned by the President or Prime Minister.

97.       The Government is strengthening the formulation, coordination and
monitoring of anti-corruption policies. The Recipient has established by a presidential
decree a permanent anti-corruption oversight committee, Comité National de Lutte
contre la Corruption, within the Prime Minister's office.          The decree specifies the
composition of the committee and its responsibilities, including the design of an anti-
corruption strategy and oversight of the various public entities involved in the fight
against corruption. The committee has a broad mandate to formulate, coordinate and
monitor anti-corruption efforts, which will provide the CAR with an improved
framework and oversight mechanism to strengthen governance and to increase the
visibility of these efforts. The new committee is responsible for implementing,
monitoring and overseeing the other anti-corruption measures envisaged by the
Government.

98.       Key next steps include:

    ·     Production and dissemination of an anti-corruption strategy.            Combating
    corruption requires an approach that addresses the many causes, facets and structural
    issues that give rise to corruption. It also requires courage, leadership, and a long-
    term commitment by a variety of anticorruption actors. Political leaders, champions
    amongst public servants, civil society, media, academics, the private sector and
    international organizations all play important roles in addressing corruption. The
    newly created committee, which also has representatives from business groups and
    civil society, would be responsible for elaborating and disseminating a national
    strategy to fight corruption. In this regard, the UNDP, together with Transparency
    International, have already carried out household and firm corruption perception
    surveys.

    ·     Production and dissemination of an annual program of activities of the
    Committee and the production of an annual report summarizing the efforts of the
    Government to be presented to the National Assembly. This measure aims to
    strengthen the government's medium-term strategy and ensure that it focuses on
    concrete, actionable activities. It also aims to ensure that the committee is accountable
    to both the Government and National Assembly, and that its efforts are summarized
    in a widely disseminated report that is publicly available. This will allow feedback



                                               35

   from the general public, civil society, and the donor community, for moving the
   reform agenda forward. In addition, it will give a higher level of visibility to the
   government's concerted anti-corruption efforts, which engage a wide number of
   agencies and institutions.

   ·     Issue a decree concerning asset disclosure by government members, including
   sanctions and verification mechanism; specify a standard format and guidelines for
   submission. The Government took an important step in 2007, when it enforced the
   provisions of the Constitution, particularly Article 44 with regard to the declaration of
   assets by the Prime Minister and other cabinet members. However, no law or decree
   stipulates the form in which the declaration must be made. In practice, this has
   translated into a great deal of variability in terms of what assets were included in the
   declarations and the level of details provided. In addition, although the Constitution
   specifies that the declaration must be presented to the Constitutional Court within 60
   days of assuming power, in practice there are no sanctions for not meeting this
   deadline or for not submitting a declaration. In order to strengthen these lacunae in
   the existing framework it is critical to ensure that the declaration of assets helps to
   improve the accountability of high level government officials by issuing a decree
   governing asset disclosure, specifying who must declare assets, the form and content
   of the disclosure, the sanctions for not abiding by the deadline or for failing to submit,
   and ensuring that the declarations are open to scrutiny by making them publicly
   available, as per Article 44      of the Constitution. A standard format for asset
   disclosure, as outlined in the decree, will need to be used when submitting the
   declarations. To ensure success, it is contemplated that a workshop will be held to
   explain the new dispositions and ensure correct filling of the asset disclosure form.

   ·     Increase transparency in the area of publicly available information. One of the
   prior actions of the RIBSUP operation was the publication in the government's
   website of a (i) summary of all mining agreements containing the key clauses
   (including financial and tax related terms and conditions, duration and amounts
   received as signature bonuses and equity shares; and (ii) documents evidencing the
   transfer of the amounts received (as bonuses or equity shares) in the public accounts,
   as well as an indication of how the funds were used. Over the next year, the
   Government intends to extend the information included in its website to include: (i)
   mining and forestry concessions; (ii) Treasury reports; (iii) annual and quarterly
   budget reports; (iv) budget laws; (v) annual reports of the anticorruption committee;
   (vi) new mining, forestry and procurement codes, and (vii) customs revenue
   collection on a quarterly basis and disclosure of customs performance indicators,
   which is spelled out in the covenant of the CEMAC TTF project.

Background and issues in procurement

99.      A thorough review of the procurement process, including the legal and
regulatory aspects, was finalized by the Government in 2006 and a final study was
produced, the Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP). Based on the conclusions of this
study, the Government is in the process of implementing an action plan to strengthen the
legal and regulatory framework to operationalize the main recommendations of the



                                             36

procurement strategy in CAR. The World Bank and AfDB have started financing experts
who have as their mission: (i) to provide technical assistance to the CAR's working group
reviewing national procurement practice and its legal and regulatory framework. The
objective of this review is to identify the weaknesses and strengths of procurement and
establish an action plan of reform priorities; (ii) finalize a new procurement Code; and
(iii) start its implementation. Satisfactory implementation of the new Code is one of the
sub-components of the public finance management HIPC Completion Point trigger.

100.       The Government plans to improve the clarity and efficiency of public
procurement processes. During the course of 2008, the Government plans to take
measures aimed at operationalizing the new institutions created by the procurement code,
once it is adopted by the National Assembly. These include: (i) nomination of members
of the new Direction Générale des Marchés (the General Directorate of Procurement)
and the Agence de Régulation de Passation des Marchés (the Regulatory Agency of
Procurement); (ii) production of manuals of procedure and standard bidding documents;
(iii) operationalization the procurement departments within four key ministries
(education, health, agriculture and infrastructure); and (iv) compliance review with new
procurement procedures via a post-procurement review (PPR).

101.       Key next steps include:

     ·     Nomination of members of the new Direction Générale des Marchés (DGM)
     and the Agence de Régulation de Passation des Marchés (ADM). A fundamental
     aspect of the new procurement code is the creation of the DGM and the ADM. The
     DGM will be a separate direction within the Ministry of Finance, involved with
     overall oversight of the procurement process. The ADM will be responsible for
     regulating the procurement process, as well as the entity which will deal with disputes
     and complaints regarding the bidding process. It will be responsible for modifications
     and amendments to procurement rules and regulations, and will produce annual audit
     reports on new tenders.

     ·     Production of manuals of procedures and standard bidding documents. The
     purpose of the manual is to familiarize employees in the DGM and the ADM with the
     new purchasing practices with regard to the goals, benefits and policies as well as
     what the department expects with regard to performance and conduct. It will provide
     an overall description of the department's purchasing program, which represents the
     minimum requirements for departments to obtain and maintain any type of
     purchasing authority. It addresses the statutes, regulations, policies, procedures and
     best practices applicable to all facets of statewide purchasing authority. Likewise, the
     preparation of standard bidding documents aims to ensure that new bids are submitted
     as per the requirements of the new procurement code. Both aspects are part of the
     process of implementing the new procurement rules and regulations.

     ·     Operationalize the procurement departments within four key ministries
     (education, health, agriculture, and public works). The new procurement code calls
     for the decentralization of procurement, including the invitation to tender function
     and the controls over the bidding process, to be carried out by line ministries. This



                                               37

    measure aims to start the operationalization of this policy in four key ministries which
    have the largest number of tenders.

    ·     Review compliance with new procurement procedures via a post-procurement
    review (PPR). This review aims to ensure that the new institutions that have been put
    in place are staffed and functioning adequately in line with the new procurement
    code.

Background and issues for the forestry sector

102.      Improving transparency in the management of natural resources has been an
important government priority, both in mining and forestry. Significant progress has been
made by CAR in mining under the predecessor operation with the start of the
implementation of steps leading to the EITI, the revision of the mining Code, and the
completion of the audits of signatures bonuses, equity and their use since 2004. Mining
will not be addressed under this one-year operation as most of these activities are already
HIPC triggers, and if completed within one year would be a significant achievement.

103.      Governance effort has also been reflected in work started under the predecessor
operation to revise a new forestry code that ensures that timber harvesting rights are
allocated on the basis of market mechanisms and that forestry taxes are collected as per
rules and regulations. The new Code, which is being finalized and is expected to be
passed by the National Assembly later this year during the April-June 2008 session, has
been revised in order to: (i) modernize and strengthen the dispositions pertaining to the
preparation and implementation of forestry management plans; (ii) revise criteria for
attribution of harvesting permits; (iii) tighten tax reporting and collection arrangements;
(iv) improve arrangements for sharing forestry revenue with forestry communities; and
(v) enhance the feasibility of small-scale forestry and community access to forest
markets, thereby ensuring sustainable resource use.

104.      A government review of the fiscal obligations of firms operating in the sector
highlighted two issues: (i) two new firms in the sector that were awarded permits in
December 2007 did not comply with the national regulations and law which obligate new
firms to pay the equivalent of 3 years of annual flat fees within 14 days following the
notification of awarding of contract. Penalty as spelled out in the official texts is the
immediate withdrawal of the permits of any defaulting firms, and (ii) some already active
firms were not current on tax payment (VAT) and other fiscal obligations. For active
firms failing to pay taxes, there is a moratorium of three months granted by the
Government, beyond which penalty should be enforced.

105.      The Government is committed to improving compliance with forestry laws
and regulations. Prior actions completed under this operation include: (i) actions to
initiate due process for firms not complying with national fiscal regulations; and (ii) and
the suspension of issuance of new permits before the draft forestry code is enacted.

106.      The Recipient has strengthened fiscal compliance with national fiscal
regulations in the forestry sector and exercised of its legal remedies including: (i)



                                              38

cancellation of exploitation permits of two new firms having failed to pay entry fees when
due; and (ii) identifying all active forestry operators with overdue fiscal obligations, and
notifying each operator of the deadline for payment of the overdue amounts. In February
2008 the Government cancelled the two permits awarded in December 2007, in strict
compliance with national regulations which have provisions for not complying with fiscal
obligations. In addition, the Ministry of Forestry has also sent a letter to each active firm
with taxes and fees payment overdue, notifying the operator of the deadline for payment
of the overdue amounts. As of March 25, 2008, all overdue VAT payments have been
made and commitment has been obtained from private operators for other tax and fee
payments to settling all tax obligations.

107.      The Minister of Forestry has suspended the issuance of new permits, until the
CAR's forestry code has been enacted, by public notice, posted on the government's
website and widely disseminated to the public. Through a public notice the Government
has suspended the issuance of new forestry permits until the adoption of the new forestry
code, which has been posted on the government's website and been widely disseminated
to the public. This measure will ensure that new permits will be granted according to
international practice including sustainable and community-based forestry management.

108.      Key next steps include:

    ·       Address VAT cross-liabilities between the State and operators and re-
    establish regular payment of all fiscal obligations to be paid by operators. As a result
    of overdue value-added tax (VAT) refunds, it is at present difficult to establish
    whether forestry operators are paying taxes due to the State, as they are in effect only
    paying the net value, subtracting tax refunds owed by the State. A first step to solve
    this situation is to determine the cross-liabilities between the State and operators in
    the forestry sector through an audit of the IGF. Once the level of cross-liabilities is
    known, it is important to re-establish a regular payment of VAT refunds on the part of
    the State, in compliance with existing laws and regulations, and to ensure that forestry
    operators pay due taxes. Another measure regarding the current fiscal dispositions
    concerns the redress of tax payments due to Communes by private operators with a
    gap of approximately CFAF 138 million. The Government will follow up in a
    subsequent phase and remedies will be exercised to re establish regular and full
    payment of all fiscal obligations due by private operators. As of the second week of
    March 2008, the Government already obtained commitment from active operating
    firms to settle all pending fiscal obligations, demonstrating its capacity to maintain
    dialogue with the private sector. This measure complements the HIPC trigger, which
    requires making publicly available the amount of government proceeds from the
    sector, their use, including the revenue sharing between the central Government, the
    communes, and communities.

Background and issues for the oil sector

109.      The proposed EMGRG aims to address governance issues in the oil sector,
a sector not covered in the earlier budget support operation. The Government has
started reforms in the oil sector with the enactment of a new Law in the first half of 2007,



                                              39

which touches upon several domains, including imports, storage, distribution, and pricing
of petroleum products, with an emphasis on opening the market to competition (see Box
3). With the liberalization of the downstream petroleum sector, a new firm in charge of
the storage of oil products ­ SOCASP - was officially created.21 In addition, a new
regulatory body has been created, the Agence de Stabilisation et de Régulation des Prix
des Produits Pétroliers, whose role is to ensure that existing as well as new actors
entering the market meet the standards required to operate in this trade, to ensure full
compliance with the national regulation and ensure adequate control quality of oil
products. A financing mechanism has already been identified, embedded within the
pricing formula of oil products, to make sure that the regulatory agency is self-financing.

110.        The operation proposes supporting government measures aimed at
strengthening the regulatory framework in the oil sector through (i) the
strengthening of the newly created regulatory agency; and (ii) ensuring the quality of
imported petroleum products throughout the value chain.

111.        The Recipient has enacted a law creating the new petroleum regulatory body
(Agence de Stabilisation et de Régulation des Prix et des Produits Pétroliers) and
adopted its governing documents (statuts) by decree, nominating the General Manager,
Chairman of the Board of Directors and other key staff. Until such time as market forces
will freely set prices on an import parity basis, the market will need to be monitored and
regulated at first, to secure operators and consumers alike, from any form of abuse or
collusion. Adequate staffing and capacity building of the staff at the regulatory agency
will (i) make it fully operational; (ii) ensure that new firms entering the market meet all
required criteria to operate in CAR as per the new Law and sector regulations, (iii) enable
it to ensure adequate market monitoring, proper regulation and enforcement of pertinent
rules regarding petroleum products specifications, safe transport and handling; and (iv)
secure much needed tax revenue flows.

the local private sector a 9 percent stake.

                                      Box 3: Oil Sector Restructuring

An institutional crisis erupted between the Government and the then sole petroleum importer and main
supplier (TOTAL Centrafrique) in the spring of 2007. The crisis was triggered by several endogenous and
exogenous factors, including the sudden increase in petroleum prices worldwide and the related increase in
transport and financial services costs. A new Law was adopted by the Parliament to restructure the
downstream petroleum sector and the company in charge of oil imports, storage and distribution, SOGAL.
The new Law includes dispositions to grant the majority of the shares to the State while providing room for
new entrants in the sector. The creation of a Regulatory Agency is included in the new Law to supervise the
sector and ensure that it becomes open, fair, transparent, and eventually competitive. Finally, it also
provides an opportunity to reach an understanding on pricing issues and implement reforms to generate a
more sustained and predictable stream of fiscal revenues to the Treasury. The expected fiscal revenue
would be derived from improved operational efficiency and enhanced competition, cost-cutting as well as
an improved tax base. The parties involved requested the Bank's assistance to help mitigate the crisis. The
Bank responded with a fact-finding mission in July-August 2007 which was complemented by another
review mission in December 2007.

Several issues have been raised by both government representatives and importers regarding tax and duty
arrears and the structure of the pricing formula (the rationale for CIF cargoes from loading ports in North
West Europe instead of closer references in the Mediterranean, the oversize ships used leading to costly
freight and insurance, demurrages costs built in the pricing formula, whereas they should be the exception
and not the rule, and finally open access to the documents pertaining to the transactions executed in 2006
and 2007 - Bills of lading - to use them as a learning tool for improving a new pricing structure). The Bank
played a facilitating role during the negotiations scheduled in two stages: (i) first, the settlement of terms
according to the new institutional and legal framework created by the April-2007 Law and its
implementation through well designed and drafted legislation, adapted to present market conditions; (ii) the
determination of the pricing formula through an interim approach and leading to the preparation of a more
permanent pricing structure. The performance of the new pricing structure is to be re-examined on a yearly
basis, three month before the end of the "River season" to allow for any corrective action to take place the
following year. The Committee reached a number of agreements on several items including switching to
the FOB-Mediterranean reference point instead of the CIF-North West Europe reference point.

As of February 2008, several transport and transit issues are still pending, until pertinent documentation is
provided by importers such as bills of lading for 2006-2007, justification of higher transit and other charges
in DRC, and the settlement of all taxes and duties cross-liabilities during the first half of 2008. Meanwhile
an agreement has been reached between the State and current operators regarding the stakeholders'
participation in the new oil company, SOCASP: the State now holds 51 percent share, TOTAL
Centrafrique opted for 25 percent and the position of Deputy Directorship on the Board of SOCASP, with
responsibilities that include broad technical assistance and the import and monitoring of all aviation fuels
(Jet A1 and Avgas for smaller planes) for which it is internationally qualified and insured; another private
operator (Tradex of Cameroun) has a 10 percent stake and three other private entities have 3 percent each.
Finally, both parties agreed officially through an official note to withdraw any legal disputes in the hands of
the Court following the constitution of SOCASP and the compensation of SOGAL's shareholders and
assets, which amount to $US2.5 million.



112.       A contract has been signed between the petroleum regulatory agency (Agence
de Stabilisation et de Régulation des Prix et des Produits Pétrolier) and an independent
pre-inspection agency of international reputation, which will be responsible for
controlling the quality of imported oil products. This measure aims to ensure high quality
petroleum product imports, by establishing a contractual relationship with an inspection
company that is properly staffed and equipped to test the quality of all petroleum
products imported into the CAR.




                                                      41

113.      Key next steps are to establish new downstream petroleum sector
legislation in conformity with international best practice. This measure aims to ensure
that existing national legislation is brought into conformity with international best
practice to protect the interest of both the Government and the private sector, including
consumers. In this regard, the World Bank will provide technical assistance, through the
LICUS III Trust Fund, to ensure that this objective is met.


                        V. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                             A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

114.      The actions supported by the grant are expected to have significant positive
poverty and social impacts. Joint World Bank and IMF staff assessments of the CAR's
PRSP have emphasized the need for the poverty strategy to be more explicit on key
priorities and budgetary allocations. They also recommended a strengthening of its
monitoring and evaluation system. To achieve faster poverty reduction and progress
towards the MDGs, this development policy operation focuses on public expenditure
management that will better link the PRSP to the budget and enhance public expenditure
efficiency. Improved fiscal reporting should make it easier to scrutinize the extent to
which voted budget allocations and actual public expenditures are in line with the PRSP
objectives. In this sense, the public finance measures included in the EMGRG will make
it easier to track public expenditures in order to ensure that there is increasing actual
expenditures in key priority sectors, including health and education, in line with the
PRSP.

115.      As spelled out in the PRSP, corruption and poor governance are perceived
to be the top causes of poverty. The EMGRG proposes measures aimed at supporting
the government's efforts to fight corruption, improve procurement processes, and
enhance transparency and accountability. It will help ensure that domestic and external
resources are used effectively, minimizing fungibility, and state capture. In addition, the
oil and forestry reforms are expected to ensure regular flows of tax revenues to the
Government and reduce capture by vested interests. Finally, customs reforms are
expected to increase not only resource availability, but also the amount of tax revenues
paid without increasing the burden on the poor. Taken together, these measures should
improve the distributional properties of state activity, benefiting the poor segments of
society through better services without raising tax burdens.

                               B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

116.      The proposed grant focuses primarily on institutional reforms, with limited
environmental implications. Oil sector reforms are expected to lead to strengthened
enforcement of legislation in the petroleum sector, and to stricter compliance with quality
and operational standards, with no expected negative consequences for the environment.
Further, the Bank will support the strengthening of the Regulatory Agency through an
upcoming LICUS grant to address a range of issues, including environmental
management in the petroleum sector.



                                             42

117.      Reforms in the forestry sector are expected to have positive environmental
consequences.      These reforms aim to strengthen the government's oversight of the
forestry permit processes. The moratorium on issuing new licenses will ensure that
future permits will fall under an improved new Forest Code reflecting international best
practice, including the use of international observers and inclusive forestry management.
It will also balance community access and commercial use of forest resources for revenue
generation, in line with PRSP objectives. The Government is finalizing the new Forest
Code with assistance from donors, including the Bank, and it is expected to pass the
National Assembly during the April-June 2008 session. The impact on revenue and
illegal logging of the short delay in attributing remaining permits is not expected to be
significant.

118.      The forest sector reforms build on good information on forest management
issues in the CAR, and draw on the long-term engagement of development partners,
including significant support for institutional strengthening. Since 2005, timber
exports have been monitored on behalf of the Government by an independent body with
the mandate to ensure compliance with operational requirements from logging sites to
export points, and to fight against illegal logging. Specific activities include inspection of
waybills for transportation of timber products, mill entry and exit books, and the cross-
checking of species and volumes of timber exported with the collection of equivalent
export taxes. The independent monitoring contract also has a capacity building
component for both the forestry and customs administrations that promotes knowledge
transfer to local staff.

119.       Building on the results of the forest sector assistance provided by AFD through
the PARPAF project, which helped establish a forest Geographic Information System
(GIS), forest administration capacity has also been strengthened through an agreement
signed in 2007 between the Government and the World Resources Institute (WRI),
funded by USAID through the Central Africa Regional Environmental Program
(CARPE). Under this contract, WRI is helping the forest administration in mapping
logging areas, protected areas, as well as hunting and safari zones, with field inspections
being conducted in logging areas by a special unit of the forest administration. Specific
attention is being paid to the monitoring of logging activities and the enforcement of
forest management plans. The system allows the forest administration to compare timber
harvests with the results of forests inventories, monitor skid trails and logging roads, and
check compliance with other management requirements in order to ensure sustainable
management of forest.

120.      Under current regulations, local populations are consulted prior to the award of
timber harvesting rights to a private operator. The company selected is required to
organize a consultative meeting with neighboring communities so that local people can
express their concerns about traditional forest rights and uses, and indicate their needs for
basic socio-economic infrastructure such as classrooms, heath centers, water points and
roads. Weaknesses in the existing system, which include the need to better ensure
effective compensation and adequate representation of indigenous people, will be
addressed in the new Forest Code.




                                              43

121.      Enforcement of existing tax obligations, including the payment of community
fees, will help ensure the equitable use of natural resource wealth and will strengthen the
resource base of forestry communities. The audit of the fiscal system will also provide
further recommendations on the distribution of the revenue from the forest sector if
applicable and will shed light on any distortions, if any, to help the Government adopt
correction measures. The Bank, in collaboration with other development partners, will
support further analytical work on environmental management through a Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA) which is under preparation to help the Government
establish the regulatory, administrative, and technical capacity to identify, mitigate, and
monitor environmental issues in a sustainable manner.

                 C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

122.      Implementation entity. The Ministry of Planning, Economics and International
Cooperation will be responsible for monitoring the reforms under the proposed operation,
as set out in the Letter of Policy Development, as well as for reporting progress and
coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. This ministry was
the unit responsible for coordination and implementation of the activities and reforms
under RIBSUP (DPO I).

123.      Program monitoring and evaluation. With a relatively weak national
monitoring system and a single tranche operation, the review and the goals of the
program will be largely based on relevant and easy-to-monitor indicators. Monitoring and
evaluation arrangements will rely on Government with the aim of strengthening
government capacity and institutions. CAR has designed a M&E architecture to follow
up on the PRSP implementation which covers the whole budget cycle, from planning to
execution. Building on this architecture, the EMGRG promotes a M&E institutional
framework for this operation's reforms and activities, for at least two key reasons: (i) to
ensure quality and timely information, and (ii) to start involving the civil society in the
accountability systems. In this regards, an implementation oversight committee, with the
mandate to monitor implementation of policies of the EMGRG is in place, with
representatives from all line ministries and directorates involved, as well representatives
from the regulatory agency in the petroleum sector.

124.      In parallel, collaborative monitoring has progressed among donors with the
government's support especially in public finance management, public sector and
economic governance, and all HIPC-related areas including public administration,
mining, forestry and transparency and the fight against corruption. The Bank and AfDB
have organized joint missions and AfDB will provide budget support in mid-2008 on the
basis of the same policy matrix that is presented in this document. The EC is also
considering aligning the policy matrix of its budget support with that of this operation.

                                  D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

125.      Although much remains to be done, in recent years PFM standards have
improved. Budget implementation and cash management are an objective which is at the
core of the operation. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment completed in



                                            44

FY08 helped assess fiduciary risks associated with budget support and deepened the
dialogue between donors and the Government on PFM issues. The CFAA developed a
joint donor-Government understanding of the main strengths and weaknesses of the PFM
system and has identified a list of prioritized recommendations based on the capacity of
the Government to implement these measures. This operation also takes into account the
results of a Treasury audit and the PEFA which are to be completed shortly. The
preliminary findings point to systematic underlying problems, as well as more punctual
shortcomings that are being addressed in this operation. The Bank will be engaged in a
very close dialogue with the Government to agree on necessary remedial actions that
insure integrity of public funds.

126.      The latest IMF safeguards assessment of the Bank of the Central African
States (BEAC), the regional central bank of which the CAR is a member, was made
in 2004. It found that BEAC had implemented a number of measures to strengthen its
safeguards framework since the 2001 assessment.

                                     E. DISBURSEMENT

127.      A single-tranche of SDR 4.8 million (US $7.9 million equivalent) will be
disbursed upon grant effectiveness. `The proposed grant will follow the Bank's
disbursement procedures for development policy operations. Once the operation is
approved by the Board and the Financing Agreement becomes effective, the proceeds of
the grant will be deposited by IDA in an account designated by the Recipient and
acceptable to the central bank , the Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale (BEAC) at the
request of the Recipient. The Borrower shall ensure that upon deposit of the grant into
said account, an equivalent amount is credited in the Recipient's budget management
system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The Recipient will report to the Bank on the
amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to the budget
management system. If the proceeds of the grant are used for ineligible purposes as
defined in the Financing Grant Agreement, IDA will require, promptly upon notice from
IDA, the Recipient to refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA.
Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration
of this grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.

                              F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

128.      The EMGRG has country, macroeconomic institutional capacity, and fiduciary
risks. These risks reflect the country's fragile security and political situation, as well as
risks associated with low government revenue and weak financial controls.

129.      Security risk. As in many conflict affected countries, deterioration in the
security situation constitutes an importance source of risk for the operation. In particular,
the deteriorating regional situation, whether in Sudan (Darfur) or in Chad would leave the
CAR at risk. A positive recent development has been the decision by the UN Security
Council in September 2007 to establish in Chad and the CAR, in concert with the EC, a
multidimensional presence intended to help create the security conditions conducive to a
voluntary, secure, and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons. These



                                              45

security risks are exogenous and their mitigation falls largely outside the scope of the
operation.

130.      Political and sustainability risks. The recent history of political instability and
its post-conflict status leave the CAR also highly vulnerable to internal political
instability. The political situation remains fragile, as evidenced by the civil service strike
in January 2008, following the delay in paying civil servants salaries. The reform
program supported by the grant could falter as a result of policy reversals and slippages
or delays in key reforms, which could adversely affect the ability of the Government to
carry out poverty reducing priorities identified in the PRSP and undermine the
sustainability of the program. External resources by donors to some degree mitigate the
risks as they support sustained service delivery by Government. As further a mitigating
factor, the Government has expressed ownership and has demonstrated commitment to
reforms through the prior actions already carried out, and the definition of the follow on
measures. In this regard, the strong commitment to attain the HIPC Completion Point as
soon as possible also serves as an anchor of the reform program

131.      Macroeconomic risk. The country's macroeconomic performance represents a
risk. The success of the grant will depend critically on CAR's adherence to a medium-
term macroeconomic framework elaborated jointly with the Fund and the Bank. Risks
such as fiscal slippages, inability to stay current on wage bill payment and external debt
servicing, or a deterioration of the external environment, could weaken the operation.
These risks can be mitigated through a combination of fiscal prudence, a prerequisite of
the PRGF, and with inflows of donor funding. Close economic monitoring and policy by
the Fund, coupled with the Bank, can help guide the authorities on macroeconomic
management in the face of weak revenue mobilization, slow export growth, or terms of
trade shocks. The macroeconomic risk of falling back into arrears would be lowered as a
result of budget support from the Bank and other donors. Full debt-service payment to
IDA could be compromised if the CAR does not reach its HIPC Completion Point by
2009 and if aid flows remain insufficient or decline. To mitigate this risk, the Bank and
the Fund must continue to provide guidance to the Government and coordinate aid
support from the donor community.

132.      Vested interest risk. Benefiting from government instability, vested interests
have in the past exploited weaknesses in the governance framework and appropriated
natural resources to their advantage. This risk is reduced through strong up-front reform
measures in natural resource management and by tackling areas for reform with strong
vested economic interests (e.g. monopoly for petroleum imports). These areas are also
subject to a continuous policy dialogue under the HIPC process with technical assistance
from the donor community.

133.      Institutional capacity risk. A significant risk is weak institutional capacity and
delays that could arise from these capacity constraints. Despite achievements in terms of
building up capacity in CTPS-PAS, Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Planning,
Economics and International Cooperation, major constraints to the implementation of
reforms remain due to weak institutional capacity to prepare, implement, and oversee
reforms. Risk of limited implementation capacity is mitigated by (i) sustaining reforms



                                              46

that have started generating positive results and in which the country already has
developed stronger capacity such as in public finance management and governance; (ii)
concentrating on a limited number of themes/areas; (iii) ensuring that the most difficult
reforms are taken up-front; and (iv) donor harmonization which reduces the number of
activities to be implemented by the Government and help target efficiently the focus of
technical assistance. For this operation, technical assistance under the envisaged
Development Policy Operation, particularly assistance financed from LICUS Trust
Funds, with the additional funding from UNDP will help implement the reform program.
The Bank will coordinate with CAR's development partners to enhance synergy and
improve the efficiency of the DPO.

134.      Fiduciary risk. As the recently completed CFAA revealed, financial controls
in the CAR are weak although improvements in fiduciary standards has been a central
objective of the program and continued assistance in the areas of public finance
management under DPO I. The proposed EMGRG will continue to sustain improvement
in budget implementation. Since this operation is designed as a one-year stand-alone
operation, based on prior actions and subsequent follow on measures, IDA can adjust
subsequent operations to the pace of implementation and satisfactory usage of previous
grants by the Government.

135.      The foreign exchange system is under the control of the Bank of the
Central African States (BEAC), the regional central bank which manages the CFA
franc currency of Central Africa Francophone countries The latest IMF safeguards
assessment of BEAC, of which the CAR is a member, was made in 2004. It found that
BEAC had implemented a number of measures to strengthen its safeguards framework
since the 2001 assessment. These are improvement in the external audit process,
enhancement of the transparency of the financial statements, and strengthening of internal
audit function.

Mr. Robert B. ZOELLICK
President of the World Bank Group
1818 H Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20433
U.S.A.




Dear Mr. President,

        1.      I am honored to transmit to you the Letter of Development Policy from the
Government of the Central African Republic, in support of the request submitted to your
institution for a Grant in the amount of US$7.9 million.

        2.      The economic recovery begun in the past two years (2006-2007) thanks to the
reforms undertaken by the Government is still progressing, but at a slow pace. Considerable
attention has been paid to the management of public finances, but the results remain limited. The
economic and social environment, already fragile in this post-conflict recovery phase, is
suffering the effects of exogenous shocks such as the soaring price of oil and the depreciation of
the U.S. dollar. In light of these trends, fears of a resurgence of inflation are growing; this is
evidenced primarily by a steady rise in the prices of staples since the first half of 2007, and by
the shrinking purchasing power, already low, of the most underprivileged and vulnerable
segments of the population. The financial context is one in which the internal capacity to absorb
these shocks is extremely limited. The tax base is very small, and external resource mobilization
is insufficient compared with the development assistance received by other countries in post-
conflict situations. In these circumstances, the State cannot ensure the servicing of the debt with
a view to achieving the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries' Debt Initiative decision point or meet
the country's reconstruction needs, let alone undertake a support program for its least privileged
groups.

        3.      The Grant we are requesting, in the form of a second contribution to the program
of reengagement and strengthening of State institutions, is intended to help clear the way on two


                                                 48

fronts: i) Greater mobilization of assistance from the international community, and ii)
Consolidation of the capacity of State institutions to appropriately implement the economic and
social policy defined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). At this time, the country
needs consistent support to start implementation of its PRSP in a context marked by economic
and social fragility.

       4.      Regarding the mobilization of international aid, the funds we request will help to
cover a part of our financing requirement for the second year of implementation of the program
supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The second review of the
program, currently underway, is satisfactory. The Government's particular emphasis on
achieving the triggers serves as assurance that the Enhanced HIPC Initiative decision point, the
ultimate path to substantial easement of our debt-service obligations, will be reached as quickly
as possible.

       5.      As regards the strengthening of our institutions, the structural measures supported
by your Grant will focus on important points of governance, in particular the management of
public finances and natural resources, in order to best support the reconstruction of our country.
These measures will complement the progress already made, thanks especially to the World
Bank's assistance through the implementation of LICUS 1 and 2. Their execution will moreover
be facilitated by the increased mobilization of technical assistance for economic and financial
management institutions through LICUS 3, and by the support of the African Development
Bank, the European Union and France.

       6.      Your institution has noted that several prior measures have been taken; a large
part of the relevant documentation has already been submitted, and makes clear our
determination to grapple energetically with the challenges before us.

       7.      We venture to express the hope that examination of this dossier will prompt
favorable consideration by the World Bank Group.



                                             Yours sincerely,

            LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY OF THE
             GOVERNMENT OF THE CENTRAL AFRICAN
                              REPUBLIC FOR 2008-2010


INTRODUCTION

8.      In the context of the reengagement of the international community, the Central African
Republic has benefited from the support of its main development partners; the latter have
demonstrated their solidarity by means of the clearing of multilateral arrears, agreement on a
program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) over the period 2007-
2009 and the rescheduling of the debt owed to bilateral creditors who are members of the Paris
Club.

9.      The support of these donors has made it possible to finalize the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) for 2008-2010, the government's frame of reference for the
reconstruction of the country and the consolidation of sustained economic growth with a view to
effectively combating poverty. This paper is the expression of the Central African Republic's
will to undertake the reforms that are essential in setting itself on the path to development. It has
been prepared on a participatory basis, with the involvement of all strata of the national
population as well as domestic and foreign partners.

10.     In point of fact, the PRSP is based on four pillars: i) Restoration of security,
consolidation of peace and prevention of conflicts; ii) Promotion of good governance and of the
constitutional State; iii) Reconstruction and diversification of the economy, and iv) Development
of human capital by means of improved access for the people to basic social services, chiefly
education and health care, with a view to reducing infant, juvenile and maternal mortality, and
combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

11.     The program supported by the Poverty Reduction Facility agreed with the International
Monetary Fund forms a component of the implementation of the PRSP, and concentrates
essentially on improving the management of public finances in order to increase the credibility of
the budgetary policy. The satisfactory execution of the PRGF helped the country to reach, in
September 2007, the decision point of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, thereby enabling the CAR
to benefit from interim relief of 90 percent of its multilateral debt service, with effect from
January 14, 2008. This relief will enable the CAR to ensure regular servicing of its debt, and also
to benefit from fresh concessionary lending by the development banks. In addition, we have
requested our official creditors to commit to maintaining positive net transfers so as to ensure
equitable treatment of all creditors together with the financial viability of the program.

12.     The second review of the PRGF, which has just been completed, is satisfactory and
demonstrates that the Government is committed to pursuing implementation of the reforms. The
results obtained confirm an upturn in the country's economic and financial situation. The
economy improved between 2006 and 2007, marked by the consolidation of social stability, the



                                                 52

progressive return of sustained economic growth and control of inflation. Real GDP grew from 4
percent in 2006 to 4.2 percent in 2007, while inflation fell from 6.6 percent in 2006 to 1.6
percent in 2007. This economic recovery, which gathered momentum in the past two years
thanks to the reforms undertaken by the Government, has also been reflected in a progressive
rehabilitation of public finances.

13.     Budgetary support for the government's program of reforms is provided in order to
deepen these reforms in specific fields, such as improvement of the management of public
finances and natural resources, together with other aspects of governance. In this connection
such support contributes to the improvement of governance (pillar ii) of the PRSP) and also
prepares the way for the diversification and growth of production (pillar iii) of the PRSP),
through provisions aimed at reassuring investors in the forestry and hydrocarbon sectors.

14.     In the fields selected, the priorities are to set appropriate foundations and strengthen the
State's capacity to pursue national reconstruction, while at the same time restoring confidence. In
order to send a strong signal, this restoration is based on the immediate adoption of a package of
measures, prior to the submission to the IDA board of the grant proposal which, if approved,
would result in the grant being disbursed in one single tranche.

MACROECONOMIC AND BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK

15.     The assumptions underlying the draft Finance Law for 2008 are based on the economic
prospects for 2008 and on the accomplishments noted at the performance midpoint of the 2007
budget.

16.     In 2008 economic prospects will depend on continued, resolute consolidation of
sociopolitical stability, including the progressive return of security to the interior of the country;
on macroeconomic stability, through the strengthening of economic operators' confidence,
recovery of raw materials prices, and stabilization of the price of oil; on pursuit of the reforms
undertaken by the Government with the support of its development partners; on commencement
of reconstruction of basic infrastructure; and on the consolidation of relations with the
international financial institutions following the Brussels Round Table of 2007.

17.     The orientation of economic policy toward poverty reduction and the consolidation of
sustained economic growth require, among other things, the sufficient mobilization of budgetary
resources. Implementation of this policy will make it possible to obtain an economic growth rate
of 4.8 percent in 2008, with an investment rate of 11.2 percent and a tax burden of 11.0 percent.
This level of growth would be sustained by the recovery of primary-sector activities, with a
growth of around 24.2 percent, due to the start of major works in 2008. The growth rate of the
tertiary sector would be 4 percent in 2008.

18.     In this context, GDP at current prices is estimated at CFAF 877.6 billion for 2008. This
level would be achieved thanks to: i) The support for cotton production, deriving from the
establishment of the new cotton company backed by financing from the French Development
Agency; ii) The heightened productivity of the forestry companies in conjunction with the
reassignment of old permits and the intensification of the activities of the SCAD, SEFCA and



                                                  53

SCAF companies; iii) The entry into operation of the AURAFRIC company; iv) The resumption
of major road-building projects (the road from Bouar to Garoua-Boulai; the rehabilitation of
Bangui's streets); v) The continued expansion of telephone coverage into the country's interior;
and vi) The ongoing reforms in the public-finances sphere.

19.     Regarding revenues, the forecasts of tax receipts for 2008 are based on those of 2006 and
2007 finance laws, coupled with spontaneous developments plus the implementation of a set of
administrative structural measures, all of which point to an estimated CFAF 98.5 billion in own
resources. To this must be added the external financial support received.

20.     The structural measures relate to the administration of the State corporations and
authorities (Régies). At the level of the Directorate General of Taxes, the efforts observed in
2006 and 2007 must be consolidated and improved through emphasis on the following: i)
Broadening of the tax base for VAT by eliminating the exemptions from VAT (with the
exception of transactions performed by agencies operating on external financing), making
taxpayers taxed at the minimum rate also liable for VAT and trading tax (patente) on the basis of
their turnover, and making VAT collection at source a general practice; ii) Intensification of
targeted checks including checks of stocks; iii) Reporting of leases believed to be fictitious, and
iv) Systematic verification of logging shipments to Douala (Cameroon).

21.     To the impact of these measures must also be added the effect on the tax base of the
economic activities referred to above: i) The establishment of the new cotton company thanks to
assistance from the French Development Agency; ii) The resumption of operations by
URAMINES-CAR and AURAFRIQUE; iii) The impact of regular payment of wages and
salaries on consumption; and iv) The expansion of forestry activities of the new companies.

22.     At the level of the Directorate General of Customs, the improvements will be apparent in:
i) The higher customs duties on timber; ii) The strengthening of the capacity of the Single
Window (Guichet Unique) in its role of ensuring the security of import flows; iii) The
strengthening of the border teams for tracking imports from the border into the interior of the
country; iv) The resumption of control at the container port; v) Continuation of the adoption and
utilization of the ASYCUDA++ computerized information system; vi) The encouragement of the
consequent resumption of river traffic; vii) Ongoing implementation of the reforms; viii) The
efficient application of the taxation of oil, which tends to neutralize the effect of the negative
TUPP on government revenues; ix) The upward adjustment of the rate of export duty for timber,
diamonds and gold nuggets; and x) The application of excise duty at customs points on wine in
bulk, ethyl alcohol and tobacco.

23.     With regard to the Directorate General of the Treasury, the Directorate of Collection and
Prosecution will consolidate the progress already achieved by means of: i) Broadening the
collection base in the ministries in order to improve collection of minor revenue items; ii)
Mobilizing counterpart funds to the Japanese grants for financing the expenditures of the Health,
Education and Agriculture sectors, and iii) Mobilizing funds deriving from the reassessment of
the telecommunications fee.




                                                54

24.     The contribution of external resources to investment expenditures has risen from CFAF
27.8 billion in 2007 to CFAF 31.4 billion in 2008; it is made up entirely of subsidies for capital
projects, in an amount of CFAF 31.4 billion. This increase in external financing is explained by
the carrying forward into 2008 of the large-scale road projects begun behind schedule in 2007,
and by the projects in the electricity and water sectors. Moreover the activities planned using
external financing are predominantly in the social sectors.

25.     As regards expenditure, government expenditures have risen by 10 percent compared
with 2007, going up from the CFAF 136.8 billion in 2007 to CFAF 150.9 billion. The rigidity
factors play a significant part here, specifically the requirement to meet community rules which
do not permit the budget deficit to exceed 3 percent of GDP. The context is not favorable for
achieving this objective in light of the volume of the debt service obligation, which remains
considerable (31.5 percent of own resources), and the new expenditure items to be covered.

THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM OF REFORMS

26.     With the aim of consolidating economic growth and improving the social environment,
the Government will implement measures designed to improve the management of the public
finances and of governance.

Regarding budget performance and reporting

27.     To improve performance and reporting for the 2008 budget, which has been adopted
using the new budget nomenclature, the Government has put in place a new and efficient
procedure for managing public expenditure, and has appointed officials in the directorates
general with responsibility for the budget and public funds. It intends to follow through with
reporting by means of a quarterly report on budget performance (from commitment to
authorization of expenditures, in at least four key ministries: Infrastructure, Education, Health
and Agriculture), followed by submission of the 2008 Settlement Law to Parliament, which is
one of the fundamental objectives of the program. The strengthening operations envisaged by
LICUS III will make it possible to fully integrate the expenditures into the budget chain in order
to finalize an administrative account and proceed to the drafting of the 2008 Settlement Law.

28.     To strengthen the accounting system and improve the reporting of Treasury operations,
the Government immediately closed inactive and settled accounts held in commercial banks. It
has also finalized the new Treasury accounting nomenclature and posted treasury agents in all
departments generating minor receipts.

29.     In addition to the immediate closing of settled or inactive accounts, the reform program
proposes to audit accounts that are still active in commercial banks. These accounts will be
categorized according to their nature, closure dates and balances. In addition, an independent
audit will review these accounts and make a check audit of those showing deficits to be cleared
by the Government, all with a view to proposing a modality and a final action plan for closure
and rehabilitation of the government's accounts with the commercial banks.




                                                 55

30.     To enhance the State's credibility, we intend to prepare the government accounts for
2008, since this constitutes a vital step toward demonstrable transparency in the management of
public funds. Beyond the introduction of the new accounting nomenclature and the integration of
all the menus of the revenue-generating departments, the work to be done in order to fully
implement this measure consists of: (i) Integrating all the categories of accounts not covered in
the public accounts and which have been identified during the Treasury audit, and (ii) Adjusting
the new nomenclature to incorporate these accounts. Furthermore, the Government intends to
have the IGF perform an audit of internal debts for the years 2005 through 2007, so as to
establish an opening balance for 2008. The trust fund (LICUS III) includes modules to set up the
training courses needed, and to enable treasury agents to carry out this work.

Regarding revenue

31.     The Government is committed to improving its tax and customs administration. It has
accordingly decided to use ASYCUDA++ for issuance of certificates in respect of payment and
receipts for imports, brought in principally through the port of Douala in Cameroon.

32.     Customs revenues collected in the port of Douala after pre-clearance are paid into a
commercial bank in Douala, which then transfers them to the commercial banks in Bangui. This
reduces the amount of liquid funds available to the State, owing to the automatic fees charged by
the commercial banks in the offsetting procedures for collecting the State's debts; the
commercial banks also charge very high interest rates. The Government undertakes to transfer
the customs revenues to the BEAC, and to put into effect a strategy for reducing and
consolidating the debt to the commercial banks.

33.     With UNDP financing, the Government is currently completing an exhaustive survey of
taxpayers throughout the entire country. Basing itself on the findings of this survey, the budget
support program proposes to update the information in the Directorate of Taxes and Customs'
database and to bring the taxpayers thus identified under the current tax system. In order to
harmonize the data on foreign trade transactions and ensure their traceability, the program
proposes that a computerized link be established between the inspection company and the offices
administering taxes and customs. It is the government's intention that this activity be financed by
LICUS II.

Regarding improvement of the public sector and of governance

34.     To strengthen the formulation, coordination and monitoring of government policies to
combat corruption and to promote optimal natural resource management, we have established a
permanent and operational anti-corruption committee within the Prime Minister's office.

35.     The efforts to eliminate corruption will be intensified with the setting up of the above-
mentioned committee, which will be tasked with: (i) Designing a national anti-corruption
strategy; (ii) Drawing up an annual program of anti-corruption actions to be carried out by the
Government, and (iii) Production, publication and dissemination to the public-at-large of an
annual report detailing what the Government is doing in this field. The purpose of these
measures is to strengthen and coordinate the government's efforts and to increase transparency



                                                 56

and visibility in this key area. The make-up of the committee would include technical specialists
from the key ministries, together with representatives of employers and of civil society. The
members of the Government deposited their declarations of assets and liabilities with the
Constitutional Court in 2007, as required by Law 44 pertaining to the Constitution of December
24, 2004. However, since the law does not prescribe a standard format for the declaration, these
declarations have not been harmonized. Similarly, although the declarations have to be deposited
with the Constitutional Court 60 days before taking office, the law does not specify any penalty
for failure to do so. It would be important to strengthen the value of the declaration of assets and
liabilities by: (i) Fixing a standard format for it; (ii) Providing practical instructions for filling out
the declaration; and (iii) Setting penalties for delays or false statements, specifying the form and
content of the declaration, and any transitional or temporary requirements, among other things.
In this connection, it has been agreed with the Government that a presidential decree concerning
the declaration of assets and liabilities is necessary to strengthen this transparency measure. The
Government will be assisted by UNDP for the implementation of this measure.

36.      A strategy for procurement in the CAR was prepared in 2006 with technical assistance
from the World Bank. A revised draft code is ready and a legal expert has been hired to finalize
it. Another procurement expert from the African Development Bank will be working on the
practical application of the procurement strategy. Once the new code has been adopted by the
National Assembly, the next stages in bringing the reforms into operation will be: (i)
Appointment of the new members of the Directorate General of Procurement and of the
Regulatory Agency; (ii) Production of the manuals of procedures and determination of the
standard formats to be used; and (iii) Bringing into operation of the procurement units in the four
key ministries (Infrastructure, Education, Health and Agriculture) and production of an annual
report at the end of the fiscal year.

37.      The Ministry of Finance's website (http://www.finances-rcagouv.com) does not presently
include documents that have been uploaded to it, which lessens the value of the site. In an effort
to increase transparency and give greater visibility to the reforms of the State, it has been agreed
to increase the information available in the public domain by uploading the following
documents: (i) Mining and logging concessions; (ii) Treasury reports; (iii) Quarterly and annual
budget performance reports; (iv) Finance Law; (v) Annual reports of the Anti-Corruption
Committee; (vi) Anti-corruption strategy; (vii) New Procurement Codes, Forestry Code and
Mining Code; (viii) Constitution and United Nations Convention on Corruption; and (ix) Forms
and instructions for filling out the declaration of assets and liabilities. LICUS II will contribute
toward the financing of this measure.

38.      To strengthen governance in the forestry sector, the Government has produced a list of
companies that have failed to comply with the payment schedules for forestry taxes and has
suspended the granting of any new forestry permits until the new Forestry Code is promulgated.
The reason for these actions is that a review of the legal and regulatory requirements pertaining
to the forestry sector and of the situation of the companies holding logging licenses has revealed
that certain companies are not in good standing vis-à-vis the Government. Two particular
categories of cases have been noted: (i) Existing companies that are behind in paying the taxes
due to the State and have three months in which to pay these taxes if the State decides to grant a
moratorium, and (ii) New companies that have not met their fiscal obligations (equivalent to



                                                   57

three months' lease payments) within the time limit specified in the respective decrees (14 days
after promulgation of the decree). Current legislation stipulates that in the latter case the permits
must be withdrawn. We have proposed that these rules be strictly applied.

39.     Within the framework of the HIPC initiative, and with the aim of confirming the
objective of rational and sustainable management of forest resources, in 2006 the Government
undertook to review the Forestry Code in order to render the regulations more readable and
improve transparency and competition in the granting of logging permits. Nevertheless, some
permits have been granted following calls for bids put out in the course of 2007 on the basis of
decisions (arêtes) 003/MEFCPE/DIRCAB/DGEFCP/ DIAF of January and March 2007,
respectively.   The Government has suspended the granting of any new permits until the
promulgation of the new Forestry code.

40.     To improve governance in the downstream hydrocarbons sector, the Government has
enacted a law creating the new petroleum regulatory body and appointing the members of the
new agency responsible for regulating the structure of petroleum product prices.

41.     The regulatory agency's role is to regulate the oil and gas market in order to: (i) Control
the quality of the operators involved in the market by means of the criteria laid down in the
regulatory texts; (ii) Control product quality; (iii) Regulate competition in the oil and gas market
in the CAR, and (iv) Establish a price structure that is consistent with international prices and
permits the State to generate a level of revenue that is adequate in light of the sector's activities.
The budgetary support program suggests that for the agency to be effective its personnel should
be nominated in accordance with the established organizational chart and should perform the
functions assigned to them. A financing mechanism has been identified by the Government for
the agency's operation and the World Bank will offer technical assistance for strengthening its
capacity.

42.     In order to ensure the quality of petroleum products imported into the CAR we have
signed a contract with a firm of international repute to perform on-the-spot inspections and
controls of said products. The Government has committed itself to bringing the legislation
governing the downstream petroleum sector into conformity with international practice, in
accordance with terms satisfactory to the World Bank. To this end the World Bank will make
available to the Government the expertise that will enable accomplishment of this objective.

               RESULTS EXPECTED

43.     The results expected from this program, which we plan on extending over the medium
term, are in the first place better coordination and harmonization of the development partners'
actions around the government's main priorities, as described in the PRSP. We are also aiming at
a marked improvement in the management of public finances in all fields, not only in the
budgetary and accounting spheres but also as regards accountability. We attach particular
importance to improved management of public finances through sound performance of the 2008
budget and the preparation of a fundamental reform of the civil service, which we view as an
essential component of our program of economic and social reforms. Regarding governance, we
expect an improvement in the business climate, which should spur an increase in private



                                                  58

investment, both domestic and foreign, especially in the forestry sector which could become a
real axis of development in the future. Finally, as regards management of public resources ­ both
financial and natural ­ we are aiming at a significant improvement, in governance in general as
well as in transparency, particularly with regard to taxation.

CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM

44.     The program will be executed by the existing structures, which have demonstrated their
capability in the management of past programs --especially the two post-conflict programs
supported by the IMF. The CTP-PAS is a notable example. These programs are run by an
interministerial steering committee made up of the ministers involved in the implementation of
the program, including the Minister of State for Mines and Energy, the Minister of Water and
Forest Resources, the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Infrastructure, the Minister of Transport
and Civil Aviation, the Minister of Finance and the Budget, and the Minister of State for
Planning, Economy and International Cooperation, who serves as chairman. The Steering
Committee defines the strategic orientations of the works to be executed by the program's two
management structures, who report back to it periodically by means of reports detailing the
status of implementation of the program. These reports, once approved, are made available to the
donors, including the World Bank.

               CONCLUSION

45.     The Government of the Central African Republic takes this opportunity to reiterate its
commitment to efficient implementation of the program described in this Letter of Development
Policy, over the next three years. It is convinced that competent and satisfactory execution of this
program will contribute to the revival of the national economy, on a sound and sustainable basis
and with a view to reducing poverty. Against the backdrop of the reforms already undertaken,
and in light of the objectives fixed in this program and the results obtained during the course of
the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), which are most
encouraging, the Government of the CAR invites you to give favorable consideration to its
request of April 14, 2008, for a Grant of an amount equivalent to about US$7.9 million,
representing significant budgetary support for the financing of the implementation of the
reforms. We also hope to receive supplementary financing in the near future, through a
contribution by the AfDB that could be declared effective in June 2008. Finally, we very much
hope to reach the Enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point at the earliest possible date, since
our external debt is unsustainable.

RIBSUP          US$82 million re-engagement budget support operation. US$75 million were used to pay arrears and debt servicing
(DPO I)         and US$7 million was used for budget support. The operation supported reforms in: (i) public finance management;
FY07            (ii) state-owned enterprises; (iii) governance; and (iv) natural resource management. On public finance management,
                (i) significant progress has been made on the expenditure front with tighter monitoring of cash advances, the
                creation of a line-item not exceeding 10 percent for unforeseen expenditures, the adoption of a decree for the reform
                of public expenditure procedures. However, the preparation of the new budget nomenclature is proceeding slowly,
                which compromises its readiness for the 2008 budget; (ii) with respect to revenue mobilization, the Treasury has
                been incorporating in the public account the amount of revenues captured by all line ministries and agencies at a
                percentage set by the Minister of Finance. The audit of the pre-clearance office in Douala (Guichet Unique) was
                completed. Based on the main recommendations of the report, the authorities are drafting an action plan that will
                form the basis of the main reforms underpinning the revamping of the Guichet Unique. The survey of tax payers at
                the national level will start in the last quarter of 2007, with financing from UNDP. Subsequent to this phase, the
                Bank will finance the registration of taxpayers in the SYSTEMIF and ASYCUDA systems of the tax and customs
                departments through LICUS II. LICUS II will also finance the reconciliation of the tax base between the customs
                and the BEAC to improve tracking and predictability of receipts. The state-owned enterprise component was
                delayed: settlement of the 2007 tax and utility bills between utility companies (electricity, water, and telephone) and
                the administration is hindered by lack of cash at the level of the Treasury, and poor management of cross-liabilities.

Multisectoral   US$17 million project approved in FY02 and restructured in FY07. The objectives of the Project are to assist the
HIV/AIDS        Recipient to contribute to: (a) urgent needs in the fight against HIV, such as access to prevention, treatment, and
Project         impact mitigation services; (b) urgent social needs, such as prevention of malaria, increased access to water supply
FY07            and improved primary education. The Project supports four key areas: (i) the National Program against HIV-AIDS
                Component; (ii) Support to Emergency Health Needs Component; (iii) Support to Emergency Needs in the
                Education Sector Component; and (iv) Support to Financial Management and Procurement.

Emergency       US$18 million investment project which aims to increase access to infrastructure and urban services in Bangui. The
Urban           project will rapidly rehabilitate, restore, improve and expand sustainable access to basic infrastructure services for
Infrastructure  the population of the most deprived districts of Bangui. The achievement of this objective would support GoCAR's
FY07            efforts to demonstrate visible and tangible improvements in the lives o f its citizens that are critical for sustaining
                social and political stability in the country.

CEMAC           US$201 million regional investment project including Cameroon CAR and Chad, part of a US $ 700 million donor
Transport       effort which aims to secure access to landlocked countries, enhance regional integration and increase trade in the
Transit         CEMAC countries. It consists of three sub-components: (i) roads and rail investment; (ii) investment in facilitation,
Facilitation    inter-modal platforms and port efficiency; and (iii) support to customs reforms and institutional support to policy
FY07            improvements.
                CAR Component of the project funded by IDA (US$ 24 million ) mainly consists of (i) a contribution to the paving
                of the Douala-Bangui link, as well as support to road maintenance, customs reform, and transport policy design

CEMAC Africa    US$45 million regional investment project which in the first phase will cover Cameroon, CAR and Chad. It aims to
Backbone        support population, businesses and Governments across the Central African region to have access to quality and
FY09            affordable ICT services by lowering the cost of international broadband capacity, and extending reach the of
                backbone networks. It is also expected to improve government efficiency and transparency through the development
                of eGovernment applications.

LICUS I         US$4 million Trust Fund. The overarching objectives of LICUS I was to recreate and strengthen the government's
FY04            technical capacity for public finance management and to support the provision of social and economic services to
                the population. The first phase of LICUS I provided immediate support for revenue collection and for reducing fraud
                and corruption in revenue administration. In a second phase, the grant further deepened PFM reforms, promoted
                governance and financial transparency and supported the provision of economic and social services with quick and
                visible impacts.

LICUS II        US$6.4 million Trust Fund. LICUS II built on the achievements of the first grant for public finance management and
FY07            governance and consists of four components: (i) Enhancing Governance and Economic Management Systems; (ii)
                Mining Sector Assessment; (iii) Community-Driven Development II Social Sectors; (iv) Interim Support to
                HIV/AIDS Treatment.

LICUS III      US$2 million Trust Fund. The Enhancing Governance and Economic Management Systems (EGEMAS II) provides
FY08           technical assistance to deepen reforms in public administration and to enhance governance and the country business
               environment, especially with regard to oil and mining regulatory reform.

LICUS          US$2 million. The Social Service Delivery Grant secured short-term, just-in-time support to protect social service
Emergency      workers' salaries in the period March-April 2008 until further external resources can be realistically mobilized.

Poverty Report Preparation of a poverty report for CAR, based on urban and rural household surveys. The report provided
FY07           quantitative analysis as well as a review of available qualitative evidence on a range of topics: poverty profile and
               determinants of poverty, income sources, education and health services, basic infrastructure.

CFAFA          The CFAFA was finalized in October 2007. This report identified a series of deficiencies and shortcomings in the
FY07           CAR's public financial management and includes a global action plan of recommendations on the legal and
               institutional framework, budget and expenditures management, and customs and tax administration. A short-
               medium-term action plan has been discussed with the Government of the CAR, focusing on the following areas: (i)
               policy measures to strengthen budget formulation and preparation, budget execution and reporting; (ii) reforms to
               further rationalize treasury operations; and (iii) the capacity of the Government to mobilize revenue

CPIP           A CPIP was completed in April 2006, providing an assessment of the country's public procurement system and
FY07           proposes an action plan to improve and align procurement processes with internationally-recognized standards.22
               Actions recommended in the CPIP include the adoption of a new procurement code with regulations for standard
               bidding documents and guides, and the establishment of new procurement institutions. The EMGRG proposes to
               support the government's efforts to operationalize the new procurement procedures, notably the establishment of the
               Direction Général des Marchés and the Agence de Regulation and the decentralization of procurement processes to
               four key ministries, once the new procurement code is passed by the National Assembly. To assess the effectiveness
               of the government's efforts, this operation proposes the conduct of a post-procurement review.

DTIS           The report examines the constraints to regional and international trade integration. It identifies the dire situation of
FY08           the country's public finances as one of the significant problems that affects the country's competitiveness. Low
               levels of revenue and investment has led to a situation of poor infrastructure, which makes trade particularly
               difficult. The continued deterioration in the social sectors has likewise led to an erosion of the CAR's human capital.
               The EMGRG explicitly focuses on the need to improve the capacity of the Government to mobilize domestic
               revenue, through improved tax administration. Among the findings of the report which are relevant to this operation
               are those concerning the forestry sector. The DTIS recommends a thorough review of the pricing of permits, as
               current pricing does not reflect regional best practice. It welcomes recent efforts made by the Government to harvest
               resources in a more sustainable manner, as this will raise economic growth and poverty reduction in the medium-
               turn.

PEFA           The PEFA exercise is an integrated monitoring framework that allows measurement of the country PFM
FY08           performance over time. The information provided by this framework also contributes to the government reform
               process by determining which reforms are yielding improved performance and by increasing the ability to identify
               and learn from reform success. It acts as a framework for pinpointing strengths and weaknesses in financial
               accountability arrangements in the public sector, thereby helping the Government and donors to identify priorities
               for reform and supports both the exercise of the donors' fiduciary responsibilities and the achievement of broader
               development objectives.

DEMPA          The CAR is among the first countries selected for this debt management technical assistance (FY08), which aims to
FY08           strengthen capacity and institutions to manage government debt in an effective and sustainable manner, by assessing
               performance through a comprehensive set of performance indicators spanning the full range of government debt
               management functions, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. When finished, the DEMPA exercise (FY08), will
               provide a baseline of debt management performance indicators, on which the country's future debt management
               performance will be assessed. It will be a valuable tool in assisting the Government improves its debt management
               capacity, which is particularly important in a country which in the past has fallen into external debt arrears.

                                 Annex 6: LICUS Trust Funds


1.      In general, implementation of activities funded by the first LICUS grant has been
satisfactory, albeit challenging. Major obstacles included: (i) the absence of government
services that could play the role of executing agencies; (ii) weak government capacity to
supervise activity implementation; and (iii) the low level of the Bank's presence in the
country. It was therefore decided to subcontract management to UNDP. Implementation
was initially very slow until 2005, following the assignment of a Bank resident economist
to Bangui. Results are reported below for each activity.

LICUS I

2.      Deterring corruption and tax evasion in revenue mobilization (US$159,500).
The objective of this activity was to increase revenue collection by reducing tax evasion
and corruption. The goal was to catch a number of corrupt individuals and give them
exemplary punishment, thereby deterring corruption practices. A unit (CEMIFI) was set
up to fight corruption and tax evasion and its members were nominated on October 22,
2004, and renewed thereafter. The LICUS grant financed communications equipment and
vehicles for the unit; the equipment was delivered in March 2005, while vehicles and
other equipment were delivered in July 2005. The unit is now operational and has been
reporting monthly to the Minister of Finance on progress on its task. The work of the unit
has contributed to government revenue collection, and on one occasion, it helped to
recover an amount of CFAF450 million, which could have been lost without its efforts.
Effectiveness of the unit is under assessment, and next steps will defined in agreement
with the Bank

3.      Capacity building in the Treasury department (US$68,000). On the basis of
reports of staff visits to treasury departments in Cameroon and Benin, the Minister of
Finance set up a government task team on budget and accounting reform. This team has
been instrumental in (i) the organization of a workshop in August 2005 on the status of
the budget and accounting reform, whose objective was to build consensus amongst civil
servants as to the need for and the principles of reform; and (ii) the preparation of new
laws on Public Finance, which have been presented to Parliament in 2006. Finally,
reports have been prepared on the reorganization of the treasury department and the
upgrading of the treasury accounting system that will help to strengthen public finance
management systems, notably as regards budget execution and cash management.

4.      Census of Domestic Arrears (US$70,000).             A consultant was recruited to
support the government commission set up to carry out a census of government domestic
arrears. The final report, prepared after full consultation with key stakeholders proposed
that the resolution of the domestic debt problem will require: (i) an exhaustive census of
the domestic debt, (ii) the verification and validation of the domestic debt and finally (iii)
the adoption of a clearance strategy. Subsequently, IDA and the Government have agreed
that the verification and validation of the stock of debt should be undertaken by a
competitively selected international auditor in line with international standards.



                                             80

5.      Control of government personnel and payroll (US$77,500). The objective was
to establish effective control over the number of civil servants and the payroll, which the
Government of CAR considered as a major and strategic reform. In support of the work
done with UNDP funding since 2001, LICUS resources were used to fund two
consultants, with the objective of setting up an integrated and computerized system for
civil service career and payroll management. An interim system has been operational
since January 2007. However, the completion of the above reform will need increased
financial resources, which were provided under LICUS II.

6.      Leadership seminars (US$252,380). Two seminars were organized in November
2004 and December 2005 respectively. The first seminar brought together leaders in the
political sphere and in the civil society and aimed at sensitizing them as to their
responsibilities in fostering a peaceful and nonviolent transition, with a view to seizing
the opportunities that would come from successful elections, notably the return of the
donor community to support the country in overcoming its financial crisis and in
addressing its development challenges. The key output was an agreed Code of conduct
that was endorsed and signed by major political leaders, which is seen as having been
instrumental in assuring the peaceful preparation and completion of delicate legislative
and presidential elections in March and May 2005. The December 2005 seminar targeted
the same category of participants, but focused on how to implement reforms through a
Rapid Results Initiative, in the areas of revenue collection and delivery of social services.

7.      PRSP finalization (US$964,940; Bank-executed): With the advent of newly-
elected institutions in March and May 2005, government priorities changed and the
dynamics of reengagement with the donor community gathered steam to the point that, in
July 2005, the CAR country team decided, together with the Government, that the
residual first LICUS allocation in an amount of US$718,640 should be used to fund
enhanced technical assistance to the country on PRSP finalization. Specifically, experts
have been hired to advise the Government in the following areas: (i) strategic planning,
monitoring and evaluation, (ii) macroeconomic analysis and programming, and (iii) the
PRSP participation process. These consultants began their assignments in May 2005, and
as a result, the pace of PRSP preparation substantially accelerated, particularly with
respect to participation and monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, in addition to his
PRSP activities, the M&E advisor has been instrumental in helping the authorities to
prepare a multi-sector matrix which sets forth key policy actions to be undertaken over
the next 12-24 months. This matrix has served as the basis of the government's
Declaration of Economic and Social Policy that will underpin their request for
international support of arrears clearance and donor reengagement.

LICUS II

8.        Enhancing Governance and Economic Management system-EGEMAS
(US$2.7 million) and Mining Sector Assessment (US$450,000). LICUS II was
approved in October 2006, before the negotiation and approval of the DPO.
Implementation of the LICUS II has been slow in the beginning, because the Bank CAR
team and the CAR public administration staff were all totally absorbed by the
reengagement progress. The LICUS II grant was the first Bank project to be executed by



                                             81

a government unit, after country reengagement with the Bank. The Bank needed to build
capacity in the executing unit, before the latter could operate at performing level. The
learning curve and the technical capacity at the executing agency have reached a high
level so that the remaining activities are going to be implemented very rapidly. However,
LICUS II implementation had been accelerated during the second semester of 2007.
Currently several activities are under way or completed: (i) upgrading the government's
revenue collection system; (ii) capacity building in the treasury department to carry out
an audit of domestic arrears and design a clearance strategy; (iii) civil servant
management and payroll control to operationalize an integrated computerized system
between the Ministry of Public Administration and the Ministry of Finance; (iv)
improving the public procurement system; (v) mining sector assessment; (vi) review of
the tax and legal systems of the forestry sector; and (vii) building government technical
capacity to manage programs and projects..

LICUS Emergency Operation

9.        Social Service Delivery Grant (US$2,000,000). The main purpose of this grant
was to secure short-term, just-in-time support to protect social service workers' salaries
in the period March-April 2008 until further external resources could be realistically
mobilized. The immediate objective of the grant was to avoid a disruption of social
service delivery at this critical time. Non-payment of salaries as a result of other payment
obligations could have triggered internal unrest, broadened the civil service strike, and
hardened the position of unions regarding the payment schedule for past salary arrears as
pre-condition for resuming work.



Proposed LICUS III

Public Finance Management and Governance Support

10.       Enhance revenue collection (US$250,000). This component aims (i) to build
technical capacity in the tax department and (ii) to upgrade the management of the
taxpayers register. Implementation of these activities will build on the progress achieved
by prior efforts of rehabilitation of the tax and customs administration in the context of
LICUS I and II, and from other donors, and notably UNDP, the European Union and
France. LICUS I funded an initiative to deter corruption and tax evasion in revenue
mobilization, while LICUS II resources are being used to (i) to harmonize and establish a
link between customs (ASYCUDA) and tax (SYSTEMIF) databases, and (ii) to study the
import/exports tax base by reconciling Central Bank and Customs databases. Since the
transitional period, CAR has benefited from the support of the donor community in its
process to reform the tax and customs administration. In particular, the European Union
is currently providing a long-term support to CAR, notably aimed at revamping the
customs department. IDA, the IMF, UNDP and France have also provided support in
terms of diagnostic studies and short interventions to enhance revenue collection
institutions.




                                             82

11.       Improve budget preparation, execution and reporting (US$625,000). The
objective of this component is to provide sustained TA to the Ministry of Finance and the
Court of Accounts in order to enhance the management of public expenditures, as well as
the budget execution reporting. In the end, this should be reflected in: (i) the timely and
sound preparation of the budget law, (ii) an adequate monitoring and comprehensive
supervision of treasury operations; (iii) the preparation of budget execution reports; and
finally (iv) the timely review of government financial reports by the Court of accounts
and preparation of the budget execution law (loi de reglement), before its transmission to
the Parliament. The Bank's support of policy reforms in this area was designed in the
context of the DPO I, as well as at the occasion of the identification of HIPC completion
point triggers. The following reforms were initiated in the context of the DPO I: (i) the
audit of the treasury department operations for 2006, (ii) stringent monitoring of
government cash advances, (iii) integration of all government revenues, in the treasury
system, and finally (iv) the upgrading of the budget and accounting nomenclatures.
LICUS II resources were used in the implementation of the DPO I reforms and by end-
2007 progress was satisfactory, and the impact in the handling of the government
expenditures is positive. It is worth mentioning that the EMGRG aims to move forward
the above agenda to substantially revamp and upgrade the country public finance
management system.

12.       Public Administration Management reforms (US$350,000). Support from
UNDP and the Bank (with LICUS I resources) over the period 2001-2005 contributed in
carrying out a thorough diagnostic of the public administration sector. The component
objective is to support (i) the preparation of a new organic framework for civil service
based on the organizational audits which is consistent with PRSP objectives, and (ii) the
adoption of new rules and regulations for the civil servants, with compensation and
performance assessment systems. The new organic framework will build on
organizational audits which will be launched very soon under UNDP and LICUS II
funding, and will feature new employment nomenclatures, a new organizational set up as
well as required set of skills for each employment position. The new organic framework
will also encompass an integrated computerized system to manage the civil servants that
will have the following features (i) clear TORs for each employment position, (ii) an
adequate computer software, (iii) revised manuals of procedures, (iv) on-site training of
users, and (v) the commissioning of the new organic framework. The new rules and
regulations refer to the statute of civil servants, the remuneration scale, and the
management structure of the civil servants management.

13.       Reform and modernize the oil and energy sector (US$250,000). The
Government has recently launched a reform of the oil sector, aiming to ensure adequate
storage, distribution and pricing of petroleum products and to guarantee quality product
supplies as well as country strategic oil reserves. On the other hand, the oil business
should be a fiscal revenue source commensurate with the size of the activity and its
importance to the economy. In this context, the Government has enacted a new Law in
the first semester of 2007 that seeks to address most of the above-mentioned aspects. The
objectives of the government's reform are (i) to develop a stable market through open and
fair competition between operators by diversifying its supply base from procurement and
transport of product to handling, storage, and distribution; (ii) to generate a regular and


                                            83

steady stream of fiscal revenue to the State budget while ensuring supply at affordable
prices; and (iii) to secure the country's strategic reserve of petroleum products. In order
to reach these objectives, the Government intends to launch a range of structural reforms
as follows: (i) the strengthening of institutions involved in the management of the oil
sector, and primarily the staffing of the newly-created regulatory agency, (ii) the revision
and completion of the pricing structure in the oil sector; (iii) the revision of the sector
legislation. This LICUS III component will provide resources to fund the technical
assistance needed to carry out these reforms, building on earlier Bank support that helped
settle a dispute between the Government and Total, the only private firm operating in the
oil sector.

14.       Deepen reforms in the mining sector (US$500,000). The Bank has been at the
forefront in helping CAR improve governance and transparency standards in the
management of national resources, and in particular in the mining and forestry sectors,
through the LICUS II and the DPO program. The LICUS II funded an assessment of the
mining sector; in this context, an international firm was recently recruited and is currently
in the field to carry out a thorough assessment of the mining sector. The analysis will
provide a useful sector diagnostics and will help the Government, the donor community
and the private sector on how to promote and support business in this strategic area.
LICUS II will also fund consultation of stakeholders in the mining sectors so that they
can provide their input in the upgrading of the regulatory. The objective of this
component is to recruit experts that will help to design standard investment agreements in
the mining sector and to revise the mining code.

           Central African Republic--Assessment Letter to the World Bank
                                       April 23, 2008

This IMF staff note assesses macroeconomic developments and prospects for the Central
African Republic based on information through the fourth quarter of 2007. The most
recent staff report on the first review under the PRGF arrangement was discussed by the
Fund's Executive Board on September 28, 2007 (Country Report No. 08/16, available at
http://www.imf.org). Program performance has continued to be satisfactory and
discussions for the second PRGF review were concluded, ad referendum, in March 2008.
The staff report supporting the authorities' request for completion of the second review is
being prepared and Board consideration is tentatively scheduled for June 13, 2008.

Recent developments

Performance under the current PRGF-supported program has been generally
satisfactory, taking account of the difficult external environment. Overall, the main
objectives of the authorities' program for 2007 were achieved, with a moderate increase
in economic growth, an improved revenue effort, and some progress in structural
policies. Regarding the fiscal accounts, the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio met the program
target and reached its highest level in a number of years (although it remains among the
lowest in developing countries). On the expenditure side, the authorities followed prudent
policies and the program target for the domestic primary fiscal surplus was met. Social
expenditures were in line with the program, but the performance criteria on wages and
commercial bank credit to the Government were not observed, the latter mainly due to
shortfalls in exceptional financing relative to program projections.

Most of the structural policy measures under the PRGF were implemented,
although some with a delay. These measures were directed at enhancing budget
management through improved revenue administration and public expenditure
management. The authorities are committed to implement an automatic petroleum price
adjustment mechanism (delayed structural performance criterion) to pass on changes in
world market prices and obtain higher revenues from petroleum taxation over the
medium term.

Outlook and program for 2008

The authorities' program aims to build a firm foundation for accelerating private
sector-led growth and alleviating poverty. In this regard, the main objectives are to
further consolidate the fiscal situation to reduce the overhang of debt and open room to
support growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing social policies. Raising the revenue-to-
GDP ratio is critical in this respect. Expanding the comprehensiveness of the budget, and
improving public financial and debt management are also important. The macroeconomic
anchor of the program is the domestic primary fiscal balance.

In March 2008, the staff reached understandings, ad referendum, with the
authorities on the second review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF). The objectives for 2008 are to achieve the following goals: real GDP growth of
5 percent to allow for continued progress toward reaching the Millennium Development
Goals; moderate inflation at less than 3 percent on average; further fiscal consolidation to
reduce the overhang of domestic debt and open room to support growth-enhancing and
poverty-reducing social policies; increase credit to the private sector; make external debt
more sustainable; and regularize relations with the remaining external creditors that have
not yet participated in the enhanced initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC).

The program objectives aim at further fiscal consolidation in a difficult external
environment. The target for the domestic primary fiscal surplus is set at 0.3 percent of
GDP, which will require an increase in the domestic revenue-GDP ratio of ½ percent of
GDP to support the budget's expenditure program. An increase in domestic petroleum
product excises in June 2008 to generate additional revenues of 0.3 percent of GDP in
2008 is an important element toward reaching the revenue objective. The program
provides for a significant repayment of domestic expenditure arrears and a reduction in
expensive government borrowing from commercial banks.

Structural reforms aim at improving revenue administration and building capacity
in public financial and debt management. Program conditionality focuses on
increasing audits and enforcing collections; implementing a government financial
management information system; the introduction of a Treasury Single Account; and
enabling the debt management department to produce debt sustainability scenarios.

Major risks to the program are (i) shortfalls in revenues; (ii) difficulties in
implementing petroleum product price increases; and (iii) delays in and/or lower
volumes of foreign aid. Over the medium term, substantially higher aid inflows would
be needed to meet the authorities' goals for growth and poverty reduction. Also, given a
relatively weak administrative capacity, the smooth implementation of the program will
depend on well-coordinated technical assistance to build administrative and institutional
capacity.

Relations with the IMF

The Executive Board approved a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement in December 2006 with access equivalent to 65 percent of quota. The
PRGF arrangement is designed to support the authorities' efforts, as defined in their
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was adopted by the Government on
June 30, 2007 after extensive consultations with the major stakeholders.



The authorities have requested an augmentation of access under the PRGF
arrangement equivalent to 15 percent of quota (SDR 8.3 million) to help adjust to
the external shock of higher oil prices. Executive Board consideration of the

authorities' request for augmentation and the second review of the PRGF program is
conditional upon implementing the agreed automatic adjustment mechanism for
petroleum prices. Completion of the review will require waivers from the Executive
Board for the nonobservance of structural and quantitative performance criteria on the
basis of the corrective actions taken.

The C.A.R. reached the decision point under the enhanced HIPC initiative in
September 2007, and benefited from interim HIPC assistance from the Fund in the
amount of SDR 3.467 million starting in January 2008. The authorities are working on
implementing the triggers to reach the HIPC completion point.
