The borrower was the Government of Turkey\n            (GOT). The Bank also finances this project by participating\n            in two commercially syndicated co-financing operations - a\n            Eurodollar loan and Japanese Yen loan. As the project was\n            never carried out, except for some consultant studies, the\n            loan was closed on November 23, 1993--about thirteen months\n            ahead of the original closing date of December 31, 1994--and\n            the undisbursed balance of US$188.3 million was canceled.\n            The objectives were to assist the GOT to maximize use of\n            indigenous energy resources by developing hydroelectric\n            generating facilities at Kayraktepe on the Goksu River in\n            south-central Turkey and to provide flood protection to the\n            city of Silifke and 5,000 hectares of adjacent irrigated\n            agricultural land. An unstated but evident objective was to\n            improve the selection process for power projects by the\n            adoption and implementation of an appropriate\n            technical/economic methodology. Lessons learned from this\n            project are as follows: this PCN confirms the importance at\n            appraisal of the Banks ensuring that: (i) the power project\n            is grounded on a proper economic justification, including a\n            sound demand forecast and a least-cost exercise; (ii) a\n            detailed implementation plan is included in the Staff\n            Appraisal Report (SAR), including observance, where\n            applicable, of existing norms for resettlement and\n            environmental protection; and (iii) the agency most\n            concerned with implementation has a larger stake in the\n            completed project."}, "docdt": "1995-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
