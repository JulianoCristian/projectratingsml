hydropower\n            station on the Goksu river in Southern Turkey. The plant\n            will generate around 990 GWh per year of electric energy, it\n            will also help protect the rich Silifke plain and the city\n            of Silifke from possible floods. In addition the project\n            will provide technical assistance to DSI (State Hydraulic\n            Authority) in cost accounting, and to MENR (Ministry of\n            Energy and Natural Resources) in carrying out a national\n            ranking of hydroelectric resources."}, "docdt": "1986-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
