                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The US$ 2.1 million Additional Financing (AF) was approved by the Board of the Bank on May 4, 2010 and became effective on November 11, 2010. The closing date is December
                         31, 2011. The first disbursement took place in January 2011. The AF is sought to consolidate the positive results of the US$ 6.5m original project (2004-2009) and to support
                         improvement in the health sector. The main activities included building residences for health staff in remote areas in order to attract skilled staff and to improve service delivery;
                         rehabilitating and equipping health centers, including the National Center of Endemic Diseases (the department responsible for the malaria and HIV/AIDS Programs); and training and
                         capacity development of the Ministry of Health.

                         The AF had a slow start with the disbursement schedule registering three months delay due mainly to delays to complying with effectiveness conditions and with the forming of a new
                         government following the legislative elections of August 2010. Disbursement rate currently stands at 24 percent, and project activities will not be completed by the closing date. The
                         remaining activities include construction and rehabilitation of health centers, purchase of vehicles and hospital equipment, and technical assistance to develop the Health Information
