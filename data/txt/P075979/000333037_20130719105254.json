outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was modest, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: improved donor\n            coordination in the health sector would have been desirable.\n            However, there are no clear signs that this lack of\n            coordination was costly since the targets were met and\n            exceeded. Overall, the education sector performed better\n            than the health sector in terms of implementation, even\n            though both equally suffered institutional instability,\n            including frequent changes of the Ministers, high attrition\n            rate and limited capacity. The use of a fiduciary agency for\n            project management was critical for successful\n            implementation by country institutions. Project\n            Administrative and Fiduciary Agency, or AFAP's role in\n            project implementation went far beyond fiduciary management;\n            it also acted as a technical assistant to the health and\n            education ministries in various aspects of project\n            execution, particularly by supporting the development of\n            terms of reference, contributing to technical discussions,\n            and training staff on monitoring and evaluation. In\n            addition, in a context of frequent ministerial change and\n            associated staffing instability, AFAP played a significant\n            role in maintaining dialogue within government and with its\n            external partners. By its experience and reputation, AFAP is\n            well placed to become a government agency for project\n            management. Having one project for the two social sectors in\n            a small country promoted relative economies of scale for the\n            fiduciary and procurement functions of the project, as well\n            as for Bank supervision."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
