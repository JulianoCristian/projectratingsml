                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Social Sector Support Project draws to a close on December 31, 2012. This is the last ISR. The original project was approved on May 18, 2004 and became effective on
                         December 15, 2004. The original financing was 6.5m US$ (5.0m IDA credit and 1.5m IDA grant) for health, education and HIV/AIDS. The original closing date was June 30, 2009,
                         which was extended twice. The first extension to June 30, 2010 to allow for conclusion of the construction program; and the second extension to December 31, 2011, to
                         accommodate an Additional Financing (AF) for the health sector.

                         By the end of the implementation period of the Original Financing, all funds had been disbursed and the PDO was deemed satisfactory. An Additional Financing (AF) was then
                         prepared only for the health sector to consolidate the gains obtained with the Original Financing, while support to the education sector was pursued through the Global Partnership for
                         Education (GPE) Fund. The US$ 2.1 million AF was approved by the Board of the Bank on May 4, 2010 and became effective on November 11, 2010.

                         The Original Financing aimed at increasing access and equity of rural population to health services; improving the quality of those services; and contributing to support the national
                         program to fight HIV/AIDS and malaria. They included rehabilitation, construction and equipment of health centers in the districts to increase coverage; strengthening institutional
                         capacity of the Ministry of Health and training of health staff in order to improve quality of services; and institutional support to the National Programs to Fight HIV/AIDS and Malaria
                         and provision of condoms, and some drugs and testing kits for HIV and malaria. The Original Financing also included Community-Driven Initiatives (CDI) promoted by NGOs.

                         A set of PDO indicators was selected to measure progress. Progress in access to quality services would be measured through: (i) the immunization rate for measles; (ii) proportion of
                         pregnant women receiving antenatal care; and (iii) proportion of births attended by skilled birth attendants. Progress on HIV and Malaria would be measured through: (iv) HIV
                         prevalence among pregnant women; (v) correct knowledge of forms of HIV transmission among women; (and) incidence of malaria in children less than five years old. Success of
                         CDI would be assessed by looking at the proportion of CDI that were successfully implemented.

                         The main objective of the AF was to consolidate the gains achieved and to ensure sustainability of Original Financing interventions through institutional strengthening of health
                         institutions at the central and local levels. Thus, main activities included building residences for health staff in remote areas in order to attract skilled staff and to improve service
                         delivery; continue the program of rehabilitation, expansion and equipment of health centers, including the National Center for Endemic Diseases (CNE) (the government Department
                         responsible for malaria and HIV/AIDS programs); and training and capacity development of the Ministry of Health. The AF also continued to support CDI promoted by NGOs in the
                         area of health.

                         The first disbursement of the AF took place in January 2011. On December 28, 2011, the closing date of the AF was extended to December 31, 2012. The extension of the closing
                         date followed a request from the government to allow mainly for completion of construction and rehabilitation of health centers, purchase of vehicles and hospital equipment, and
                         technical assistance to develop the Health Information System (HIS). At the time of the extension processing, the disbursement rate was at a mere 24 percent. Since then,
                         disbursement has accelerated steadily, and as of November 30, 2012, the disbursement rate was at 90.5 percent. All agreed activities under the Procurement Plan (PP) have been
                         launched, the bidding process concluded and contracts awarded. With the current commitments, disbursement is expected to reach 100 percent by the closing date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This is a Project that was designed to be flexible in terms of implementation. Project activities are agreed upon between the Client and the Bank team for every calendar year, through
                         an Annual Action Plan (AAP). Once approved, the AAP is implemented. For most of the project life, assessment of implementation of the AAP was Satisfactory or Moderately
                         Satisfactory, because most of the activities were completed on time as agreed.

                         For the AF, the last mission to Sao Tome and Principe (September 21-28, 2012) took stock of implementation progress, and reviewed the AAP and the Procurement Plan with the
                         MoH and AFAP (the Administrative and Fiduciary Agency). Both documents were updated taking into account the status of project implementation. One key finding of the mission
                         was that all activities agreed in the AP had been launched. The mission discussed with the government team potential risks of delays in the delivery of project activities. The parts
                         found that the biggest risk was associated with the conclusion of the works of CNE. They also agreed that preventive measures should be taken to avoid materialization of that risk.

                         Following the mission, AFAP and the MoH set up a tight monitoring process that included bi-weekly meetings with the construction company and site visits that resulted in
                         accelerated progress in the implementation of the works. As a result, the work of CNE was delivered as expected on December 21, 2012.

                         The other activities in the AP have all been finalized. The ambulances for the health districts have been delivered on December 8, 2012. The residences for health staff in Cantagalo
                         and in the Island of Principe have also been delivered. The consultancy work to finalize the Health Information System has been concluded.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
