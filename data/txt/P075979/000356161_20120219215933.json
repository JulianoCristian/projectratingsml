Additional Financing for the Social Sector Support Project\n            is to improve the delivery of basic health services, with a\n            focus on greater and equitable access, better quality and\n            improved local governance of services. The Additional\n            Financing (AF) in the amount of SDR1.4 (US$2.1 million\n            equivalent) was approved by the Board on May 4, 2010 and\n            became effective on November 11, 2010 with the closing date\n            set for December 31, 2011. The AF was sought to provide\n            additional resources to scale up the original project\n            activities and to implement two additional activities. The\n            extension of the closing date will allow the Ministry of\n            Health (MoH) to complete the remaining activities, namely 1)\n            the construction and rehabilitation of health centers; 2)\n            purchase of vehicles and hospital equipment; and 3)\n            technical assistance to complete the health information\n            system and human resources strategy."}, "docdt": "2011-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
