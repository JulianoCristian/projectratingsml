                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The US$ 2.1 million Additional Financing (AF) was approved by the Board of the Bank on May 4, 2010 and became effective on November 11, 2010. The AF was sought to
                         consolidate the positive results of the US$ 6.5m original project (2004-2009) and to support improvement in the health sector. The main activities included building residences for
                         health staff in remote areas in order to attract skilled staff and to improve service delivery; rehabilitating and equipping health centers, including the National Center of Endemic
                         Diseases (the department responsible for malaria and HIV/AIDS Programs); and training and capacity development of the Ministry of Health.

                         The first disbursement took place in January 2011. The original closing date was December 31, 2011. On December 28, 2011, the closing date was extended to December 31, 2012.
                         The extension followed a request from the government to allow mainly for completion of construction and rehabilitation of health centers, purchase of vehicles and hospital
                         equipment, and technical assistance to develop the Health Information System (HIS) and Human Resources Strategy. At the time of the extension processing, the disbursement rate
                         was at a mere 24 percent. Since the extension was awarded, disbursement has accelerated and now stands at 54 percent. All agreed activities under the procurement plan have

                         been launched, the bidding process concluded and contracts awarded or about to be awarded. With the current commitments, if the pace of implementation is sustained
                         disbursement is expected to reach 100 percent by the closing date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The last mission to Sao Tome and Principe (June 1-8, 2012) discussed the Annual Action Plan (AAP) and Procurement Plan (PP) with the MoH and AFAP (the Administrative and
                         Fiduciary Agency). Both documents were updated taking into account the status of project implementation. One key finding of the mission was that the remaining project funds will not
                         suffice to implement all the originally planned activities due to higher actual costs of some activities compared to the planned costs. As a result, the MoH proposed the suspension of
                         one activity (purchase of hospital equipments) because the government will use its own budget for that purpose. The mission agreed with the proposal and the PP was accordingly
                         updated.
