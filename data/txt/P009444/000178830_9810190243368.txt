INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR A
FIFTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation for a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for SDR 23.8 mil-
lion (the equivalent of US$25.0 million), on standard IDA terms to help
finance a Fifth Technical Assistance Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.      An economic report entitled "Bangladesh: Recent Economic Trends and
Medium-Term Development Issues," (Report No. 4277-BD, dated March 4, 1983)
has been distributed to the Executive Directors.
3.      Bangladesh, which became independent in 1972 under very difficult
circumstances, is a country with very high population density and widespread
poverty (annual income per head averages about US$140 at present). The
economy, dominated by agriculture, remains acutely vulnerable to disruption
by both natural and external factors. Considerable progress has been made in
increasing the availability of irrigation and other inputs, but foodgrain
production remains heavily dependent on weather conditions and falls short of
total needs. The uncertainties of foodgrain availability complicate fiscal
management due to the need to manage public foodgrain stocks and often impose
an additional strain on the balance of payments.
4.      The economy is also characterized by very low savings, reflecting the
low level of incomes, and by a very large structural external payments gap.
Domestic savings account for only a small fraction of investment (which has
averaged around 16% of GDP in recent years). Export earnings cover less than
30% of the import bill, and over 60% of merchandise exports are accounted for
by raw jute and jute goods. The resource gap of around 15% of GDP is
financed by workers' remittances, which have risen rapidly to over 5% of GDP
in recent years, and by foreign assistance of around 10% of GDP per year.
The capacity for imports can be sharply affected by a combination of factors
which are beyond the control of the Government and whose disruptive effect on
the economy is amplified by the heavy dependence of the Government's revenue
base on import duties and sales taxes (together accounting for 60% of tax
revenues).



-2-
5.      In spite of these problems, the late 1970s were a period of political
stability and economic consolidation and provided an opportunity to plan for
longer-term development. GDP growth of close to 6% p.a. from FY75 to FY80
was accompanied by rising public investment, financed by a substantial real
increase in aid disbursements. A combination of adverse domestic and exter-
nal events during FY81 and FY82 disrupted the momentum of development.  The
corrective actions taken in FY83 have, however, been reasonably successful in
stabilizing the short-term external and budgetary situation and, despite the
severe limits on available resources, there are prospects for renewed modest
economic growth.
Recent Economic Developments
6.      From FY80 to FY82, a sharp diecline in export prices of raw jute and
jute products and of major non-traditional exports, combined with rising
import prices (especially for petroleum) to cause a decline of over 30% in
Bangladesh's terms of trade. At the same time, external aid inflows, which
had risen steadily until FY80, declined in FY81; they recovered in FY82, but
only to 4% above FY79 flows in real terms. Prolonged drought adversely
affected the FY82 and FY83 crops. The shortfall in FY82 foodgrain production
(0.4 million tons or 3% below FY81 levels) led to high food prices and a
substantial run-down of public sector foodgrain stocks to well below the
level considered sufficient for food security. Substantial commercial
foodgrain imports were required, imposing further strain on the balance of
payments, while reduced agricultural production and incomes depressed demand
and activity in other sectors.
7.      During FY81, the Government attempted to cope with the intensifying
external resource constraint by resorting to short-term commercial
borrowings, short-term deposits from and currency swaps with other central
banks, some run-down of reserves, and! assistance from the IMF under an
Extended Financing Facility (EFF) arrangement concluded in December 1980.
However, the EFF arrangement was suspended in July 1981, as the Government
incurred a large bank-financed budget deficit and credit ceilings agreed with
the IMF could not be met. In FY82 the Government sought to contain import
growth through a variety of measures, including a substantial depreciation of
the Taka by 22% against the US dollar. Nevertheless, despite an increase in
workers' remittances, from $210 million in FY80 to over $400 million in FY82,
and further short-term borrowing, foreign exchange reserves declined to about
US$120 million (equivalent to about two weeks' iniports) by the end of FY82.
8.      The deterioration in the trade and aid climate also had a major
adverse impact on public finances during FY81 ancl FY82.  Government receipts
of local counterpart funds were reduced as a result of declining commodity
aid flows, as were its receipts from import duties and sales taxes. These
problems were exacerbated by inadequate financial planning and by poor finan-
cial performance of public enterprises, due to low levels of efficiency and
delays in increasing sales prices. A budget deficit of Tk 5 billion (2.5% of
GNP) emerged in FY81, even though the Annual Development Program (ADP) was



-3-
cut back by 12% in the second half of FY81. Despite a similar cutback in the
FY82 ADP, recourse to substantial bank financing was avoided only because of
a run-down of public food stocks following poor harvests. Nevertheless, a
sharp rise in foodgrain prices in mid-FY82, combined with the inflationary
pressures caused by exchange rate depreciation and a rapid expansion of
domestic liquidity in late FY81, resulted in a 15% rise in the consumer
prices during FY82.
9.      The Government introduced a wide range of austerity measures with its
FY83 budget (in July 1982), designed to adjust the economy to the serious
resource constraints. Development expenditure plans for FY83 were reduced by
nearly 20%, in line with expected resource availabilities, and the increase
in recurrent expenditures was limited to 14%, only slightly above the
forecast inflation level. The Government also introduced new tax measures
designed to yield about 0.5% of GDP in FY83. In addition, a number of sub-
stantial subsidy and pricing adjustments were made to reduce consumption,
protect investments and to improve the financial performance of public sector
enterprises and utilities. Taken together, the tax, pricing and subsidy
reduction measures amounted to an impressive 2.5% of GDP. Measures were also
taken to improve balance of payments management, including a further 11%
depreciation of the exchange rate during FY83, higher import duty rates,
financing the import of more commodities through the Wage Earners' Scheme,l/
abolition of selected export duties and improvements in export financing.
IMF assistance to Bangladesh was resumed under a Stand-by Arrangement in
March 1983.
10.     While these measures were effective in helping to restore short-term
economic stability, their effect, combined with depressed private sector
demand following poor harvests during 1982, resulted in low GDP growth (2.4%)
in FY83, following a 1.5% decline in FY82. The budgetary situation in FY83
was satisfactory, due to resource mobilization efforts, the depreciation of
the Taka which largely offset the negative budgetary impact of reduced import
volumes, further foodgrain sales, and increased commodity aid disbursements.
The balance of payments was helped by a recovery in aid levels, better terms
of trade resulting from lower petroleum and food import prices, depressed
import volumes, and a further growth of remittances to around US$600 million.
Foreign exchange reserves increased to US$340 million, representing about six
weeks import equivalent, by the end of FY83. Following good winter crops,
foodgrain production for FY83 reached a record 15.1 million tons and infla-
tionary pressures eased. While the short-term outlook has improved, the
resource constraints remain severe, calling for a continuation of cautious
macro-economic policies and consistent efforts to strengthen the productive
sectors to permit improved resource mobilization.
1/ Under the Wage Earners Scheme (WES), foreign exchange earnings
remitted by Bangladeshi workers abroad are sold in auction to importers
requiring foreign exchange.



-4-
Development Planning and Policy Issues
11.     The Second Five-Year Plan for FY81--85 accords highest priority to
(i) reducing population growth from the present rate 2.6% p.a., (ii) achiev-
ing foodgrain self-sufficiency, (iii) eliminating mass illiteracy, and (iv)
accelerating domestic energy developmLent.  IDA has assisted the Government in
preparing the Medium-Term Foodgrain P'roduction Plan (MTFPP) which aims at
increasing foodgraln production to 20 million tons. Foodgrain self-
sufficiency could be achieved by the end of the decade with appropriate
producer incentive3, resources to provide needed inputs to farmers, and an
expanded role for the private sector in the prov:Lsion and servicing of modern
agricultural implements and inputs. Given Bangladesh's high illiteracy rate
(74%), the Plan's emphasis on primary education is well founded, but the goal
of achieving universal primary education by 1985 is unattainable in view of
resource and managerial constraints. Prospects for achieving the objectives
of edtucational expansion and improved foodgrain availability would be
improved by success in reducing the population growth rate; this will require
more determined efforts than have been made thus far, especially with regard
to birth control efforts which have suffered from poor implementation and
have had only limited success. The Government has recently taken steps to
coordinate its birth control activities and to strengthen training programs
for field staff. A medium-term implementation plan for the population sector
is currently being prepared with Bank assistance.
12.     There is an urgent need to develop the ccuntry's energy resources,
particularly natural gas, since imported petroleum at present pre-empts about
three quarters of merchandise export earnings. Ongoing and planned invest-
ments in the energy sector are designed to increase the production, distribu-
tion and utilization of natural gas as a substitute for imported fuel,
including studies aimed at determining the potential for future investments
in gas-based export industries. The recentLy approved Petroleum Exploration
Promotion Project will assist the Government to appraise more fully the
country's gas reserves, determine the optimal pace of exploitation, and help
renew the interest of foreign oil companies to resume the search for oil.
Since the required investments are likely to be capital-intensive and lumpy,
they would need to be properly planned under a phased priority program.  The
Government has been slow to recognize this need, but is now endeavoring (writh
IDA and ADB assistance) to formulate an appropriate energy sector investment
program. The implementation of appropriate energy conservation measures and
the setting of energy prices at economically efficient levels will also be
critical.
13.     There is an urgent need to address directly the growing problems of
rural poverty and unemployment. Fifty percent of the rural population is
functionally landless, and the employment situation has deteriorated sig-
nificantly since the 1970s with only 70% of new entrants to the labor force
finding gainful employment. Increased foodgrain production alone will not
suffice to resolve the unemployment and income problems, in view of the large



-5-
projected growth of the work force. Measures must be taken simultaneously,
therefore, to develop other sectors, such as fisheries, livestock, forestry
and non-foodgrain crops, and to strengthen the industrial sector -- espe-
cially small-scale and cottage industries -- so that incomes generated in one
sub-sector will generate effective demand for the output of others.
14.     Studies of the industrial sector have highlighted the distorting
effects of existing trade and industrial policies on resource allocation in
the sector. An ongoing program of studies is expected to lead to a medium-
term program of actions to be implemented -- including modifications in the
existing tariff structure, domestic indirect taxation, investment incentives,
export policies, and the mechanisms for industrial promotion and planning.
The Government's New Industrial Policy, announced in 1982, provides for a
greater role of the private sector in economic development. Many of the key
elements of this policy are already being implemented, including the divest-
ment of major segments of the jute and textile industries to the private
sector.
15.     The Government has revised the Second Five-Year Plan in the light of
the sharp deterioration of the external environment, and its recent Annual
Development Programs (ADPs) have reflected more realistic assessments of
likely resource availability. A "core program" of projects amounting to
around 75% of the ADP has been identified to ensure that high-priority
activities are not disrupted by possible further adjustments to changing
circumstances. This approach has already helped project implementation
during FY83, but it should be recognized that the investment program is
extremely small in relation to the total needs of the economy. As external
assistance will continue to be constrained, there is an urgent need for a
sustained and intensive domestic resource mobilization effort, consistent
with the initiative taken in the FY83 budget to raise tax revenues, reduce
subsidies and improve the financial performance of public enterprises. In
the medium term, the tax base will have to be broadened to reduce its present
dependence on import duties, thereby improving the elasticity of the tax
system. In addition, private savings should be stimulated through
appropriate interest rate policies and improvements in the banking and credit
system.
16.     Realization of the Government-s objectives will also require improve-
ments in development administration. There is a critical need to strengthen
the capacity for policy formulation and project implementation, streamline
administrative procedures, and improve decision making processes.
Recognizing that local government bodies can play an effective role in the
development effort, the Government has decided to decentralize a number of
planning and administrative functions to the Thana (Sub-District) level.
Accordingly, sub-district administrations are being reorganized and
strengthened to enable them to take on most development activities at the
local level. The implementation and impact of this policy will need to be
closely monitored.



--6-
External Debt
17.     Since most of Bangladesh's borrowings have been on highly conces-
sional terms, servicing external medium- and long-term (M&LT) debts has not
been a major problem in the past, but will become a heavier burLen in the
next few years as debts incurred in the first years after independence are
increasingly falling due for repayment. Total service payments on external
public M&LT debt are expected to rise from 6.8% of export earnings (goods and
services, including workers- remittances) in FY82 to 11.8% in FY84 and 13.7%
in FY86. The Bank Group's share of Bangladesh's debt servicing obligations
will remain modest over this period, rising slowly from 9.7% of the total in
FY83 to 10.9% in FY86. The Bank Group-s share of total debt outstanding and
undisbursed is projected to increase from 30.4% in FY82 to 36.3% in FY86.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
18.     Bangladesh became a member of the Bank and IDA in 1972.  Initially,
Bank Group operations in Bangladesh concentrated on the reactivation of
eleven credits, amounting to US$146.2 million, madle originally to Pakistan
before 1971; in addition, a consolidation loan (US$54.9 million) and credit
(US$31.04 million) to cover liabilities arising from projects located in
Bangladesh and completed prior to independence were approved in 1974. As of
September 30, 1983, 72 new credits have been approved, totaling US$2,400.64
million; of these, US$862.03 million have been for import credits (eleven
imports program credits and two fertilizer imports credits). Annex II con--
tains a summary statement of IDA credits and disbursements as of
September 30, 1983. On June 18, 1976, Bangladesh became a member of the IFC,
and two investments (for a shipbuilding company and an investment promotion
company) have been approved.
19.     The focus of IDA assistance in recent years has been on agriculture
(22 of the projects approved as of September 30, 1.983, and two fertilizer
import credits). This is consistent with the country's needs and the
Government's priorities. Particular emphasis continues to be placed on
projects that provide agricultural inputs, including fertilizer, fertilizer
transport, irrigation, improved seeds, extension, and credit and storage
facilities. In addition to agricultural projects, emphasis is also being
placed upon complementary infrastructural projects in sectors which
facilitate agricultural development or which reduce bottlenecks constraining
the economy's overall performance. In the power sector, for example, IDA is
assisting in rural electrification and elimination of shortages of generation
capacity and distribution facilities which have beben a major impediment to
utilization of existing industrial capacity. Assistance for developing
telecommunications is designed to improve the efficiency of a wide-range of
economic and social activities.



-7-
20.     Industry has been the main beneficiary of the eleven imports program
credits approved to date. Given the need for substantial net transfers of
resources and the persistent structural imbalance and weakness of the
economy, program lending will continue to be an important component of IDA
operations in Bangladesh. The indlustrial sector has also benefited from two
fertilizer production projects, a jute industry rehabilitation project,
several DFC and small-scale industry projects and two IFC investments.
21.     The enormity of Bangladesh's population problem makes this an
extremely high priority sector as well, limited only by its absorptive
capacity. IDA has made two credits available in support of GOB's population
program, which is now making some progress. Improved education and
availability of trained manpower are also crucial, and lending in this field
has emphasized agricultural, technical and vocational training, and primary
education.
22.     Disbursement of the imports program credits has proceeded
satisfactorily. Project disbursements have lagged behind expectations, owing
largely to delays in the release of local funds, approval of contracts,
employment of consultants, and appointment of staff. Underlying these delays
were serious constraints that included a shortage of qualified staff, over-
centralized bureaucratic procedures and organizational deficiencies. IDA
and GOB have given increased attention to regular monitoring and supervision
in order to identify and resolve potential problems. IDA is providing assis-
tance both under specific projects and under technical assistance credits to
improve planning, project preparation and implementation capabilities.
23.     In view of Bangladesh's difficult foreign exchange position and
savings/investment gap, IDA credits should continue to cover all foreign
exchange costs and a portion of local currency expenditures.
PART III - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
24.     Although Bangladesh has made considerable progress in recent years,
its limited resource base, the extreme poverty of its rapidly expanding
population, its underdeveloped physical and social infrastructure, and the
vulnerability of the economy to climatic setbacks as well as external shocks,
make the process of development extremely difficult. A particular constraint
is the shortage of skilled manpower and the limited capacity of institutions
throughout the public sector. The Government has had practically to rebuild
the national administration anew since independence, and this has been a slow
and difficult task. The capacity of institutions to manage their affairs
efficiently remains limited, and t:his constraint is recognized by the
Government. The process of strengthening Bangladesh's development
administration is bound to be a long one. In the meantime, there remains a
continuing need for technical assistance (TA) in pre-investment planning,
project preparation and implementation, in the formulation of economic and



-8-
sector policies and programs, and in institution building, including
training.  In recognition of this need, bi:Lateral as well as multilateral
agencies, including IDA, attach considerable importance to technical
assistance.
25.     Bangladesh receives TA from a wide variety of sources.  Although data
deficiencies and definitional problems make it difficult to estimate the
overall level of TA, the Operations Evaluation Department (OED), in their
study "Review of 3ank Technical Assistance to Bangladesh" (Report No. 423),
dated December 23, 1982, estimated that within the last few years total T'A
amounted to about US$140 million per annum. Technical assistance represented
about 12% of the flow of development aid to Bangladesh from all sources in
FY82. At present, TA is being financed by over 62 aid agencies, spread over
some 500 projects. The majority of ithese projects is financed by the Asian
Development Bank 'ADB), Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the
Netherlands, United Kingdom, the United States, and the UN system including
IDA.
26.     While technical assistance provided by other donors is substantial,
most of the bilateral TA is tied and, even taking into account multilateral
sources, insufficient to meet all of the country's requirements for such
assistance. IDA has therefore made available additional foreign exchange
for TA activities in cases where financing was riot readily available from
other sources on appropriate terms, or where IDA financing permitted more
flexible and expeditious preparation of projects suitable for consideration
by external aid agencies.
27.     IDA today is the single largest source of technical assistance to
Bangladesh. In addition to direct financing provided either as TA components
of investment projects or in the form of "free standing" TA credits, IDA has
provided substantial assistance which has been f-inanced from its own opera-
tional budget. In the course of normal lending operations, IDA staff, both
from the Headquarters and the Resident Mission, have helped Government agen-
cies in project preparation and implementation. IDA has also provided an
agricultural advisor under the non-reimbursable technical assistance arrange-
ment and has also served as executing agency for UNDP-financed TA projects.
IDA's economic and sector work has contributed significantly to the formula-
tion of economic development policies and programs. It should also be noted
that the Business Management and Public Administration Projects (Cr. 1318-BD
and Cr. 1349-BD, respectively) are specifically aimed at strengthening the
institutional capacity of Bangladesh's public and private sector enterprises
and its overall development administration.
28.     The largest TA financing provided by IDA has been in the form of TA
components of IDA financed investment projects. Since 1972, 46 such projects
have included TA components which amounted to about US$107 million. In
recent years, TA components of projects averaged about US$20 million per
year.   Such components usually include completion of final engineering,
construction supervision and implementation services, and training. IDA has



-9-
provided Bangladesh with four "free standing" TA credits amounting to US$37.5
million equivalent. All four credits have been fully committed. A number of
further technical assistance activities have been identified and agreed in
principle with the Government (see paragraph 34 and Annex V) and there is
urgent need for the funding which the proposed credit will provide.
29.     IDA's lending for TA has proven to be a useful source of finance for
a broad range of TA activities. The "free-standing" TA credits have helped
to generate or advance the implementation of at least 21 IDA projects with
credit amounts totaling over US$621 million. The OED report, referred to
earlier, has confirmed that IDA's lending for TA has made a significant
contribution to the preparation of high priority development projects and in
strengthening IDA-s project pipeline in Bangladesh. This type of assistance
is essential to allow Bangladesh to undertake its immediate development
programs. However, the OED report has also pointed out a number of weaknes-
ses associated both with "free-standing" TA credits as well as those provided
in conjunction with particular prcject investments. The major area where TA
has been relatively less successful is institutional development. Many of
the TA components reviewed by OED were concerned with project preparation and
implementation and did not make any specific provision for strengthening the
capacity of the recipient agency. This is partly explained by the fact that
Bangladesh, following independence, had to concentrate its efforts on its
more immediate requirements of project preparation and implementation.
30.     The OED report pointed out a number of problems which have weakened
the effectiveness and impact of TA. Recipient agencies have been, at times,
slow to recognize and accept the need for external assistance. TA is fre-
quently perceived as a requirement of the donor and little or no genuine
commitment is given by the agency concerned. In addition, because TA is
often only a small component of a much larger investment project, insuffi-
cient time is spent on its proper design, particularly in the provision of
counterpart staffing arrangements, use of local consultants and arrangement
of support services. These factors, together with lengthy government
bureaucratic procedures, have sometimes caused considerable delays in the
recruitment of consultants. Also, the performance of consultants has not
always matched expectations; donor as well as local supervision has sometimes
been inadequate, cost overruns have occurred and in the case of studies,
follow up has not always been adequate.
31.     Bangladesh will continue to require substantial technical assistance
to meet its immediate development needs in project preparation and
implementation. However, as discussed below, the proposed Fifth Technical
Assistance credit, while providing such assistance, will also place greater
emphasis on the training and institution building aspects in the design of TA
subprojects (see paragraph 34). Measures will also be adopted to further
improve the efficiency of TA management and coordination.



-1,0-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.     With the build-up of a pipelinie of potential technical assistance
subprojects which now exceeds the commitmen: authority available under the
existing TA Credits, the Government during the Spring of 1982, requested that
consideration be given to the preparation of a Fifth Technical Assistance
Credit. Preparation of the proposed project: took place during supervision
missions of the existing TA credits in June and November. Negotiations for
the proposed credit were held in Decermber 1983. The Government of Bangladesh
was represented by a delegation led by Mr. Q. S. Alam, Joint Secretary of the
External Resources Division, Ministry of Finance and Planning.  Attached as
Annex III is a supplementary project dlata sheet.
Project Objectives and Description
33.     The objectives of the proposed Fifth Technical Assistance Credit are:
(a) to provide foreign exchange for TA required for project preparation and
implementation and for studies required for the f'ormulation of economic and
sector policies; (b) to assist in improving the capacity of Government agen-
cies to prepare and implement development projects; (c) to improve the
management and coordination of TA withnin Governmetnt agencies; and (d) to
encourage the strengthening of the local consulting industry.
34.     The proposed project would finance high priority technical assistance
and training subprojects. Individual subprojects, which would be subject to
IDA approval, would be selected on the basis of priorities established in the
Government's economic development plans for the next few years (Section 3.01
and Schedule I of the draft DCA). A large number of the subprojects, as in
the case of earlier TA projects, would be designed to supplement the
Government's capacity in project preparation and implementation or to under-
take individual studies needed for economic policy and plan formulation.
However, greater emphasis than in the past will be placed on strengthening
the institutional capacity of Government agencies to enable them to undertake
such tasks in the future. Annex V gives a list of potential subprojects that
may be financed under the proposed credit. The primary objective of about
one third of these are institution building and staff training. Consultants-
terms of reference for most of the remaining subprojects would emphasize
training of counterpart staff. Where appropriate, joint ventures between
foreign firms and the local consulting industry or research institutions
would be encouraged. The Government would also 'be encouraged to develop a
more systematic training program for the staff of agencies responsible for
planning, project preparation and implementation.
Organization and Administration of TA
35.     The three organizations which normally deal with TA in Bangladesh
are the Planning Commission, the External Resource Division (ERD) of the
Ministry of Finance and Planning, and the relevant line ministry or agency



-11-
executing the project. The Planning Commission is responsible for appraising
the TA and assuring that it conforms to the national development plan. ERD
has the primary responsibility for liaison with foreign aid donors. Besides
initiating the request) the line ministry or agency has responsibility for
recruiting consultants providing counterpart staff and logistics support,
undertaking supervision, and utilizing the results of the TA.
36.     The procedures for approving TA in Bangladesh are, in general, part
of the process for approving investment projects. New investment projects
originating with a line agency are referred to the parent ministry for
approval in the first instance, which in most cases submits the project for
approval to the Planning Commission. A standard Project Proforma (PP) is
used for this purpose. While the PP includes some information about TA
components, it is primarily designed to ensure that the overall project
conforms with the investment priorities and programs in the five-year plan,
that it can be justified in financial and economic terms and that adequate
provision has been made in the budget for the project's costs.
37.     Technical assistance received from the ADB, IDA, UNDP and multi-
lateral sources is coordinated by different desks in the ERD. While this
arrangement has been useful to ensure smooth processing of individual TA
received from each of the different sources, this no longer appears to be an
effective system for coordination among Government agencies, given the number
of donors and size of TA involved. Furthermore, it makes it difficult to
develop a cadre of staff who are capable of advising line agencies on TA
project design, methods of contracting consulting services, and management of
TA projects. Although the Government has recently created a TA Coordination
Cell (TACC) within ERD and UNDP has provided computer expertise and equipment
for this cell, no clear decision has been taken with regards to the scope of
its functions and its mode of operation. Therefore, during negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the Government, by December 31, 1984, would
review the existing institutional arrangements (including the role of TACC)
in the field of TA and adopt measures, to be agreed between Government and
IDA, aimed at improving the coordination, management, and effective utiliza-
tion of TA (Section 4.06 of the draft DCA).
Project Implementation
38.     ERD would have overall responsibility for the coordination and
implementation of the proposed project. This would include reviewing
requests from line ministries and operating agencies for use of TA funds and
forwarding to IDA those suitable for financing under the proposed credit.
ERD would also monitor the subprojects and assist in providing advice to
implementing agencies about contracting consulting services, and related
equipment and disbursement procedures. ERD would provide periodic overall
status reports on the progress of the project. Within ERD, a Project
Director has been designated to coordinate administration of the IDA TA
credits. He is supported by two assistant project coordinators.



-12-
39.     The execution of the individual subprojects would be the respon-
sibility of the concerned line ministries or operating agencies. They would
select, employ and direct the consultants and services required to undertake
the agreed terms of reference of the subprojects. The line ministries or
agencies would also be responsible for supervising the work of the consult-
ants and keeping account of expenditures. After an official subproject
approval by Government and IDA, an agency would submit a withdrawal applica-
tion directly to IDA for reimbursement. During the course of the subproject,
the executing agency would submit brief quarterly reports to ERD covering
progress, problems encountered and status of disbursements.
40.     The Government would provide an agreed list of information in seeking
IDA's approval of a subproject (Section 4.03 of the draft DCA). The consult-
ants would be employed in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by tle World Bank Borrowers asd by the World Bank as Executing
Agency" published in August 1981. IThe terms of reference and consultant
contracts with the Government would be subject to agreement between the
Government and IDA (Section 4.02 of the draft DCA). Consultants' terms of
reference would emphasize the importance of training local staff and specify
training requirements so as to reduce the need for TA in the long term. IDA
would retain the right to withdraw its agreemeni: to finance a particular
subproject if a consultant's contract has not come into effect within six
months of IDA approval of a subproject (Section 5.01(b) of the draft DCA).
41.     During the implementation of previous TA projects, progress has been
made in the streamlining of TA processing. A standard TA request format is
being used and guidelines for contracting of consultants services, including
a standardized contract, have been developed.  T'he guidelines, howevrer, need
some revisions particularly with respect to the formula used in the evalua-
tion of technical and price proposals and regulations concerning the use of
local consultants. ERD has also undertaken a st:udy to standardize consu:Ltant
contract conditions, but the recommendations of the study need to be final-
ized and promulgated. During negotiations assurances were obtained that by
June 30, 1984, the Government would establish arnd implement standard proce-
dures for the negotiation of consultants' contracts, including, inter aliLa,
the adoption of uniform contracts for the appointment of individual consult-
ants and consulting firms (Section 4.07 of the draft DCA).
Local Consultant Industry
42.     A survey of local firms was completed in January 1981 and a con-
ference was organized by ERD in Septiember 1981 for local consultants and
government officials to promote the development of the local profession.
Under the ongoing TA credits, IDA has been financing a number of local con-
sultants both as lead firms and in joint venture' with foreign firms. During
negotiations, IDA obtained assurances that by September 30, 1984, Government
will prepare a program to strengthen the local consulting industry and submit
it to IDA for comment and thereafter promptly implement it (Section 4.08 of
the draft DCA). Such a program might include such activities as conferences,



-13-
newsletters, consultants registry and training seminars. The Government may
also utilize part of the proceeds of the proposed credit, on terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to IDA, to meet the cost of staff training and expatriate
technical assistance for selected local consulting firms (para l(d) of
Schedule 1 of the draft DCA).
The Proposed Credit Amount
43.     The proposed credit of SDR 23.8 million (US$25 million equivalent)
would finance subprojects for which consultants- contracts will have to be
signed within the next 18 to 24 months and for which funding from other
sources may not be available on appropriate terms. In estimating the TA
funding requirements UNDP's current resource constraints have been taken into
account. It is estimated that in line with previous TA credits the consult-
ant rates under the proposed project will average about IJS$9,000 per
expatriate professional manmonth. 1/ Local professional manmonth rates are
expected to average about Taka 30,000 (US$1,250). For each subproject the
Government would normally provide counterpart staff, office space, supplies,
ground transport and secretarial services. These are estimated to account
for 10-15% of subproject costs. A Government commitment to make this con-
tribution would be a condition of IDA's approval of each subproject.
Disbursements and Procurement
44.     The proceeds of the proposed credit would be disbursed against 100%
of the costs of consultants, whether foreign or local, excluding taxes and
duties. Government agencies would not normally be considered eligible to be
treated as consultants, except for research agencies such as the Bangladesh
Institute for Development Studies or Government-supported universities.
Disbursements would also be made against 100% of the cost of training
programs. In addition 100% of foreign expenditures or 100% of local expendi-
tures (ex-factory) for equipment and materials required for the carrying out
of the approved studies and procured directly by the Government or its agen-
cies would be financed (Section 2.02 of the draft DCA). Equipment valued
over US$75,000 equivalent would be procured by international competitive
bidding. Small contracts estimated to cost less than US$75,000 equivalent
and not exceeding US$1,500,000 equivalent in the aggregate would be let
through normal Government procedures which are acceptable to IDA (Section
3.03 of the draft DCA).
1/ Manmonth rate includes salary, overhead costs, profit and post
adjustment.



-14-
Accounts and Auditing
45.     The TA recipient agencies would establish and maintain accounts for
each approved subproject and submit withdrawal applications directly to IDA.
The Project Director would maintain a consolidated account for the project.
These accounts and supporting records would be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA and audit reports wouLd be submitted to IDA not
later than six months after the end of each fiscal year (Section 4.05(c) of
the DCA).
Monitoring and Evaluation
46.     The Project Director in ERD would be responsible for monitoring the
subprojects by collecting, reviewing and evaluating infcrmation regarding
their preparation and implementation. Quarterly progress reports would be
forwarded to IDA. The Project Director would also be responsible for prepar-
ing the final Project Completion Report at the end of the project to evaluate
its results.
Benefits and Risks
47.     As the previous TA credits have already shown, a major benefit of the
proposed project would be the development of a pipeline of projects poten-
tially suitable for financing by IDA and/or other external aid agencies and
the enhancement of Government's ability to implement such projects.  This, in
turn, would help Bangladesh make more effective use of domestic and external
resources for the development of its economy. The proposed project would
also assist in upgrading the overall capabilities of the line ministries and
operating agencies involved in project preparation and implementation and
general economic management.  The domestic consulting industry would also be
strengthened, thus reducing dependence on expatrfiate consultants and
specialists.
48.     There are no special risks associated with the proposed project.  For
individual project preparation subprojects, there is the risk that develop-
ment policies and priorities could change while a project preparation study
is underway. While in some cases this may be inevitable due to possible
changes in economic circumstances, such risks will be minimized by IDA satis-
fying itself that studies are in support of priority projects in the
Government's investment program. There is also risk that subprojects may not
adequately address institution building objectives. This risk will be sig-
nificantly reduced by ensuring, prior to IDA's approval of a subproject, that
to the extent practicable subprojects are designed to encourage institution
building and that the concerned ministries or executing agencies are com-
mitted to their institution building objectives. As in the past, the project
will require close supervision and heavier IDA st:aff time than usually allo-
cated for projects.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic
of Bangladesh and IDA and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement of IDA are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
50.     Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
51.     I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

FIFTH TECHNICAI, ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Progress of Previous Technical Assistance Credits to Bangladesh
Summaries of the allocations and disbursements for the subprojects
are presented in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4. The following provides a summary of
progress of the four technical assistance credits provided to Bangladesh in
the past.
First Technical Assistance Credit 409-BD
The first TA credit (409-BD for US$4.0 million) was signed on
June 20, 1973. Use of the credit was initially slow and disappointing,
reflecting in part disagreements between the Planning Commission and the line
ministries concerning their respective roles in project preparation, and a
reluctance on the part of some Government officials to use external technical
assistance. When requests for financing studies were received, their
progress was impeded by slow Government procedures for selection of consult-
ants and negotiating of consultants' contracts. Progress accelerated begin-
ning in 1975 when Government officials appeared to become more willing to
suggest subproiects for financing and improved procedures were introduced
reducing somewhat the number of approvals required for consultants' con-
tracts. By December 1976, almost the whole of the US$4 million credit was
committed. The credit was completed by December 31, 1979. The Proiect
Completion Report (February 28, 1980) indicated that the subprojects financed
under this credit played a very significant role in assisting preparation and
implementation of high priority projects and in strengthening IDA's project
pipeline in Bangladesh. Currently, the subprojects have led to or supported
nine IDA-financed proiects amounting to US$204.0 million. The PCR also noted
that while the project had contributed to some strengthening of Bangladesh's
project preparation and implementation capacity, progress in institutional
building were bound to be slow. Table 1 shows a list of projects financed
under this Credit and amounts allocated to each.

Second Technical Assistance Credit 622-BD
The second TA Credit (622-BD) for US$7.5 million was signed on
April 8, 1976. The rate of commitments improved but difficulties were
experienced as a result of slow negotiation and approval of contracts.  With
the appointment of a Project Coordinator (as agreed subsequently under the
third TA credit) follow-up on disbursements has improved and the credit was
closed on June 30, 1981. As with the first TA credit, the Project Completion
Report noted that most of the credits resources were directed towards project
preparation work and that subprojects led to or supported nine IDA financed
projects amounting to US$252.0 million. The report also noted that while
only a few subprojects had as their primary obiective the development of the
agencies capacity, more difficulties tended to be encountered in the execu-
tion of this type of project than with project: preparation work. Table 2
lists projects financed under this Credit.

Third Technical Assistance Credit 872-BD
The Third TA project for US$10.0 million was signed December 21,
1978. The Credit closed on June 30, 1983, after a one year extension. In
order to accelerate disbursements, it had been "overallocated" by about
US$1.5 million. Incompleted subprojects were transferred to and financed
from TA IV (Credit 1124). Although there were delays in the execution
of some individual subprojects, mainly because of disagreements on terms of
references and slow procurement of consultant services, the project has
proceeded satisfactorily. As of October 1983, subprojects have led to, or
supported seven IDA-financed projects amounting to US$235.0 million.
Table 3 provides a listing of projects financed under this Credit.
