The objectives of this credit are\n            fourfold. First, the credit will: (a) provide foreign\n            exchange for TA required for project preparation,\n            implementation and for studies required for the formulation\n            of economic and sector policies. It will also; (b) assist in\n            improving the capacity of Government agencies to prepare and\n            implement development projects; and (c) improve the\n            management and coordination of TA within Government\n            agencies. Finally, the credit will; (d) encourage the\n            strengthening of the local consulting industry. The project\n            will finance high priority technical assistance and training subprojects."}, "docdt": "1984-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
