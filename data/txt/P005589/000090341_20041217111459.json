The lessons learned indicate that valuation of\n            market size needs to consider substitute markets. To enhance\n            the possibility of small companies to participate under\n            projects promoting small and medium-sized renewable energy\n            systems, procurement rules in the project design need to\n            cater for their participation. Improving product quality and\n            reliability are important factors in stimulating and\n            sustaining demand. Projects based on concessionary finance\n            that support products over a limited time period should\n            actively consider how the sustainability of a market can be\n            assured following project closure. Sustainability can be\n            achieved by (i) including barrier removal activities; (ii)\n            considering learning cost curves; (iii) establishing a\n            stakeholder community, including through a network of local\n            industry; and by (iv) providing a framework for market\n            development (extending customer base both domestically and abroad)."}, "docdt": "2004-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
