Heating (SWH) Project are to assist the recipient in\n            encouraging the substitution of renewable solar energy for\n            fossil fuels in public and commercial private institutions\n            so as to mitigate global warming by maximizing carbon\n            dioxide displacement and demonstrate the potential of solar\n            water heating for reducing global warming. The two project\n            components are: a) a technical assistance component, which\n            finances promotion and marketing activities, international\n            procurement of equipment to guarantee the selection of\n            technologically efficient and price -competitive equipment,\n            and monitoring of the project implementation and its impact\n            in terms of market penetration and the environment; b) an\n            investment component, in the form of a 35 percent subsidy to\n            the cost of investment in SWH, which will make the decision\n            of investing in SWH economically attractive to potential\n            users and provide the seed for the development of a self\n            sustained market."}, "docdt": "1994-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
