                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After 20 months since effectiveness, implementation is progressing smoothly in the Business facilitation component with almost all the activities identified at project appraisal having
                         been initiated. Implementation has been slow in the public enterprise reforms due to national elections that were held in May 2010 and in the 2011 budget statement, government
                         has announced plans to accelerate implementation of these reforms. The reforms will begin with the water sector as some analytical work has already been completed.
                         The project team which is based in the field provides strong support to the Project Coordinating Unit and the Implementing Agencies in carrying out agreed activities. The
                         Government of Mauritius has requested the Bank to cancel this project and restructure the two FPD operations into a series of 3 sector DPLs which will focus more on the policy
                         dialogue.
