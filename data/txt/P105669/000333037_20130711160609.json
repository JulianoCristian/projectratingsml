moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            The project, financed with a US$18 million IBRD loan, was\n            designed at a stage where Mauritius started investing in an\n            ambitious economic reform program which aimed at moving the\n            country away from dependence on trade preferences to global\n            competitiveness. The sustainability of the Mauritian economy\n            depended on improving productivity and competitiveness. The\n            project intended to contribute to achieving the\n            country's development strategy by addressing the\n            challenges to private sector development. This included\n            easing constraints related to: (i) the business environment,\n            (ii) inadequate service delivery in key public enterprises\n            by helping restore fiscal discipline and reducing the\n            budgetary burden of the parastatal sector, and (iii) private\n            investment in key infrastructure sectors. The project\n            supported part of the broader and longer-term economic\n            reform program of Mauritius. The project was an integral\n            part of the country partnership strategy: 2007-2013 which\n            was anchored in the Government's long term development\n            program of: (a) fiscal consolidation and improved public\n            sector efficiency; (b) improving trade competitiveness; (c)\n            improving investment climate; and (d) democratizing the\n            economy through participation, social inclusion and sustainability."}, "docdt": "2013-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
