A strong\n            research-extension-training linkage was fundamental to\n            transferring new production techniques/technologies and\n            management to farmers/foresters. The development of a\n            fertilizer market implies that farmers can obtain fertilizer\n            more efficiently than through central procurement and\n            distribution. Future projects should include fertilizer\n            costs in farmers' loan packages. The participatory\n            approach is effective in ensuring farmers/foresters feel a\n            sense of ownership, but very poor farmers/foresters must be\n            cautioned that planting timber species could result in loan\n            repayment difficulties as maturity and harvest are long\n            term. Intensive and detailed Township and Village Enterprise\n            (TVE) analyses are necessary for projects with TVE\n            on-lending components. Manufacturing enterprises are more\n            susceptible to market shifts than producers of raw materials\n            and therefore requires critical evaluation."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
