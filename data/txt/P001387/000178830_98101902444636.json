 following: (a) provision of about 330 primary school\n            classrooms, including furniture and equipment, primarily to\n            house existing classes lacking adequate facilities. Further,\n            pit latrines would be provided at the proposed new sites and\n            at about 50 additional existing sites. The project would\n            include; (b) in-service training programs for about: (i) 600\n            unqualified primary teachers, (ii) 200 primary school\n            principals; (iii) 85 vocational teachers, (iv) 120 secondary\n            school principals during school vacations, and (v) 6\n            architectural technicians per annum (total of about 30) who\n            would work within the project implementation unit. At the\n            secondary level, the project would (c) upgrade facilities\n            and equipment in eight existing schools to better\n            accommodate existing enrollments, supplement equipment at 13\n            schools to maximize the use of existing facilities, and\n            supply only science equipment to 70 other schools\n            inadequately equipped. Finally, the project aims to; (d)\n            establish a business/commercial stream for about 50\n            students; (e) support the Ministry of Education, Sports and\n            Culture to strengthen its data processing capacity and\n            textbook and equipment distribution system; and (f) conduct\n            specialized studies."}, "docdt": "1984-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
