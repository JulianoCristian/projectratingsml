equipment, primarily to\n            house existing classes lacking adequate facilities.\n            Further, pit latrines would be provided at the proposed new\n            sites and at about 50 additional existing sites.  The\n            project would include; (b) in-service training programs for\n            about:  (i) 600 unqualified primary teachers, (ii) 200\n            primary school principals; (iii) 85 vocational teachers,\n            (iv) 120 secondary school principals during school\n            vacations, and (v) 6 architectural technicians per annum\n            (total of about 30) who would work within the project\n            implementation unit.  At the secondary level, the project\n            would (c) upgrade facilities and equipment in eight existing\n            schools to better accommodate existing enrollments,\n            supplement equipment at 13 schools to maximize the use of\n            existing facilities, and supply only science equipment to 70\n            other schools inadequately equipped.  Finally, the project\n            aims to; (d) establish a business/commercial stream for\n            about 50 students; (e) support the Ministry of Education,\n            Sports and Culture to strengthen its data processing\n            capacity and textbook and equipment distribution system; and\n            (f) conduct specialized studies."}, "docdt": "1984-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
