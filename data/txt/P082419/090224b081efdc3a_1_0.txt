                         This ISR covers the period from January to August 2013. During this period the team conducted one supervision mission, three technical visits, and one video conference.

                         To date, the Project has disbursed USD 23.67 million (74% of USD 32 million loan), of which USD 5.23 million was disbursed in FY2013. The Project has achieved two of its four
                         PDO objectives, namely 37% of beneficiaries of the rural component are living in indigenous comarcas and 86% of beneficiaries of the rural component are living in poor

                         corregimientos, highlighting the strong poverty focus of the Project. Progress on the two remaining PDO indicators will be measured during the end of the Project using data collected
                         in the Rural Water and Sanitation Information System (SIASAR) web-platform. Out of eleven intermediate outcome indicators, four have been achieved so far, including the
                         publication of the Annual Report of the subsector and the operationalization of SIASAR. The Project has improved access to water supply and sanitation (WSS) services for more
                         than 30,000 people, with a particular emphasis on indigenous communities and women, providing not only the physical infrastructure but also capacity building workshops for the
                         respective rural water boards in order to ensure sustainability.

                         During this period the project management unit (PMU), the Directorate for the Water and Sanitation Subsector (DISAPAS), has made significant progress on the implementation of
                         the agreed February 2013 action plan, including contracting for the: (i) construction of rural water and sanitation systems in 34 communities, (ii) hand-washing promotion campaign,
                         and (iii) social and technical consultancies supporting the sustainability of the services. These three activities are progressing satisfactorily. DISAPAS also made important progress
                         on water sector policy and local capacity building with the (i) creation of a pilot association of water boards in Dolega, (ii) drafting of legal instruments to create regional WSS
                         departments and water inspector corps, (iii) completion of the first phase of MAPAS, a policy instrument to monitor progress in WSS, (iv) development of a national manual for rural
                         water and sanitation projects, and (v) publishing of the 2010 and 2011 annual sector report. Through the implementation of MAPAS, the Ministry of Health led a policy dialogue on
                         sector performance in delivering WSS targets, generating the knowledge basis for evidence-based decision making, for making impact on inequalities with a focus on communities
                         without access to WSS services and better coordination among stakeholders. Following MAPAS, DISAPAS, in collaboration with other water-related agencies and the Bank team,
                         developed a roadmap for a national RWSS strategy. The roadmap is under review by an interagency water coordination unit.
