 PANAMA – WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION IN LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES PROJECT,
                         P082419, LOAN IBRD – 74770

                                         Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for the Panama Water Supply and Sanitation in Low-Income Communities
Project (PASAP) Loan No. 74770, P082419, would be extended from November 30, 2013 until
November 14, 2014.
2.      Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. To date PASAP has successfully
improved access to water supply and sanitation (WSS) services for 30,168 people and has
strengthened rural water management both on a micro (via water boards) and macro level (via rural
water supply and sanitation (RWSS) management tools such as the Rural Water and Sanitation
Information System) among other achievements. Work remains to be done under two activities:
RWSS works in 34 communities and a hand washing initiative. The RWSS works will expand access
to WSS services to an additional 10,600 people and the hand washing initiative will reach 325,000
women and children.
3.      The extension of the Project will enable the completion of the abovementioned activities and
thus, the successful achievement of the Project’s objectives. The Project currently complies with two
of the four PDO indicators and one of the 11 intermediate indicators. The completion of the
remaining works will result in the achievement of the targets set for the four additional intermediate
indicators, and will increase the odds of the two remaining outcome indicators, on the number of
beneficiaries using sustainable WSS systems, being met (these PDO indicators will be measure
during the last quarter using data generated from the rural WSS information system).
4.      The extension will also allow the consolidation of social and institutional strengthening
measures, which are tightly linked to the long term sustainability of the Project’s investments. For
example, the Project supported the development of a roadmap for a RWSS strategy, which is
currently under review by an interagency water coordination unit. The extension will enable the team
to provide further assistance in the development of this strategic planning tool.
5.    In addition, DISAPAS has submitted an action plan detailing an implementation strategy from
now until November 14, 2014.
6.     This will be the second extension of the Project, bringing the cumulative extension to a total
of 30 months. In November 2011, the Project’s closing date was extended from May 30, 2012 to
November 30, 2013.
