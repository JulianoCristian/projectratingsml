                         This is an interim ISR that covers the period from November 2011 to June 21, 2012. This ISR will be further updated after the supervision mission that will take place from June 22 to
                         27, 2012.

                         The Project continues to progress at the consistent implementation pace highlighted in previous ISRs. However, budget constraints have recently slowed down this rhythm. The

                         Project has disbursed USD 16.8 million (from a total loan of USD 32 million), of which USD 4.8 million was disbursed in FY 2012. In order to advance with disbursements and
                         commitments in a satisfactory manner in calendar year 2012, the implementing agency (Ministry of Health) has approached the Ministry of Finance with a request for supplementary
                         budget; this request is currently pending approval. Such financial uncertainties are delaying Project implementation, as some bidding processes have been postponed until financial
                         availability is confirmed. In addition, the Project’s closing date is currently set in November, 2013. In order to disburse 100% of the loan, the Project will require a considerable budget
                         allocation in FY2013.

                         In terms of physical advances, works have been completed in 73 communities (with 13.000 beneficiaries of water system works and 8.000 beneficiaries of sanitation works to date),
                         and projects are in progress in 38 communities. Furthermore, works are planned in 34 other communities (4 in Veraguas, 12 in Chirriqui and 18 in Bocas), and will be tendered over
                         the next couple of months depending on budget availability. These figures will be updated in the next supervision mission.

                         In addition to the progress recorded in the implementation of water and sanitation works, advances under Components 2 (Urban water supply and sanitation - implemented with
                         IDAAN), 3A(Strengthening of the water and sanitation sector) and 3B (Sector information system) continue to move forward at a solid pace. Nevertheless, the Bank team has
                         highlighted the need to accelerate implementation of those activities currently moving at a slower pace, related to the sustainable management of the water schemes constructed or
                         rehabilitated under the Project (component 1A) and to the hand-washing initiative (component 3C). Further progress is especially urgent in light of the Project’s upcoming closing
                         date.
