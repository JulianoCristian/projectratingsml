The specific\n            objectives are to: l) Enable participating households and\n            communities in poor rural and urban areas to access water\n            and sanitation services through innovative approaches to\n            provide services on a sustainable basis; 2) initiate a\n            political dialogue under the leadership of MINSA and the\n            generation and the knowledge base for decision making based\n            on the evidence of the long-term goal of creating strong\n            institutions and better focus on beneficiaries and greater\n            coordination between interested parties; 3) improve\n            sanitation and hygiene practices."}, "docdt": "2014-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
