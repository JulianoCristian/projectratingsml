                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective for this project is to increase access to sustainable water supply and sanitation services in participating communities. The specific
                         objectives are to: 1. Enable participating households and communities in rural and poor urban areas to access water and sanitation services through innovative
                         approaches geared to providing services on a sustainable basis; 2.Initiate a policy dialogue under the leadership of MINSA and generating the knowledge basis for
                         evidence-based decisionmaking, with the long-term goal of strong institutions, a focus on beneficiaries and better coordination among stakeholders; 3.Improve
                         sanitation and hygiene practices.

                         This ISR covers the period from February to September 2014. During this period the team conducted three supervision missions and several videoconferences.

                         The Project has disbursed USD 27.78 million (87% of USD 32 million loan). To date, the project has successfully improved access to water supply services for 32,082 people (out of
                         a 40,000 target), has improved sanitation for 21,487 people (out of a 26,500 target), and has strengthened rural water management both on a micro (via water boards) and macro

                         level (via rural water supply and sanitation management tools such as the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Information System - SIASAR), among other achievements. The Project
                         has currently achieved two of its four PDO objectives, namely 46% of beneficiaries of the rural component are living in indigenous comarcas and 88% of beneficiaries of the rural
                         component are living in poor corregimientos, highlighting the strong poverty focus of the Project.

                         The Project closing date is November 14, 2014. It is expected that the two remaining PDOs, number of beneficiaries using sustainable water systems and number of beneficiaries
                         using basic sanitation services, will achieve 95% and 100% of their targets respectively. Out of eleven intermediate outcome indicators, seven have been achieved so far. Of the
                         remaining four, it is expected that two would be fully achieved by the project’s closing date while the remaining two would achieve 87% and 95% of their targets.

                         During this ISR period, the project management unit (PMU), the Directorate for the Water and Sanitation Subsector (DISAPAS), has made progress on the construction of RWSS
                         systems in Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Veraguas although important delays have been encountered with one of the contractors working in Bocas del Toro and Chiriqui. Because of
                         this, 9 of 34 works in these areas will not be completed by the project closing date, and the Ministry of Health will need to continue with the implementation with counterpart funds.
                         Progress has also been made in the preparation of training material for the hand-washing promotion campaign and capacity building activities have already been initiated. The PMU
                         also strengthened water sector policy and local capacity building activities through the: (i) creation of a pilot association of water boards in Boquete; (ii) approval of a legal document
                         to create regional WSS departments and water inspector corps at the local level; (iv) development of a national manual for rural water and sanitation projects; and (v) publishing of
                         the 2010 and 2011 annual sector report. On the other hand, the PMU needs to improve supervision activities of the remaining RWSS works, in particular social and environmental
                         aspects need to be better integrated into the overall supervision strategy. The PMU is working on completing, implementing and consolidating several of the policy instruments and
                         activities developed during the Project.

                         The Ministry of Health has made progress in the collection of water supply and sanitation surveys using the SIASAR to measure the project indicators, and a consultancy to prepare
                         the final Project evaluation report is underway. Furthermore, the Bank team hired a consultant in July to begin the preparation of the project’s Implementation Completion and Results
                         Report (ICR).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project requires a level II restructuring to reallocate funds between disbursement categories as Category 3-B (consulting services) and Category 4 (Operational Costs) have been
                         overdrawn by an amount exceeding 15% of the total allocated amount for each category. MINSA (as documented in the attached Aide Memoire) presented a reallocation proposal
                         and it is currently being evaluated by the Bank team.
