                         This ISR covers the period from June 2011 to November 2011. During the above period, the team has conducted a supervision mission in October 2011.

                         The solid implementation pace highlighted in the previous ISR has continued to materialize. It is expected project disbursement will reach USD 7.6 million in 2011, as a result of the
                         contracting of rural WSS works at a large extend. At the end of October, works in 73 communities have been completed (thus 13.000 people benefit from the works on water systems

                         and 8.000 people from works on sanitation), 38 communities have projects in progress, and there are works planned in 34 more communities (4 in Veraguas, 12 in Chirriqui and 18 in
                         Bocas) which will be tendered in the next couple of months.

                         In addition to the progress recorded in the implementation of the WSS works, advances under the components 2 (Urban water supply and sanitation - implemented with IDAAN), 3A
                         (Strengthening of the water and sanitation sector) and 3B (Sector information system) were also picked out during the last supervision mission. However the Bank team has
                         highlighted again during the last supervision mission the need to speed-up the implementation of the activities currently moving at a slower pace and related to the sustainable
                         management of the water schemes constructed / rehabilitated under the project (component 1A) and to handwashing initiative (component 3C). The team and PASAP agreed on a
                         series of actions to accelerate their implementation in this regard.
