                         This ISR covers the period from September to February 2014. During this period the team conducted two supervision missions, one financial management supervision mission and
                         several videoconferences.

                         The Project was restructured in October 2013 to extend the closing date from November 30, 2013 to November 14, 2014. The extension allows for the completion of key rural water

                         supply and sanitation (RWSS) works and the consolidation of social and institutional strengthening measures. In addition, it allows the development and implementation of an action
                         plan to measure the sustainability of RWSS services, which is linked to the PDO indicators.

                         The Project has disbursed USD 26.89 million (84% of USD 32 million loan). The Project has improved access to water supply and sanitation services for 30,168 people, with a
                         particular emphasis on indigenous and poor communities, providing not only the physical infrastructure but also capacity building activities for the respective rural water boards and
                         institutional strengthening at the national level to ensure sustainability. The Project has achieved two of its four PDO objectives, namely 37% of beneficiaries of the rural component
                         are living in indigenous comarcas and 86% of beneficiaries of the rural component are living in poor corregimientos, highlighting the strong poverty focus of the Project. Progress on
                         the two remaining PDO indicators is considered satisfactory. Their calculation is pending on the results of the Index for Sustainable Water Services (ISSA) of the Rural Water and
                         Sanitation Information System (SIASAR), which depends on gathering and analyzing data from community level surveys. An action plan has been developed with the support of the
                         Bank and is currently under implementation. Out of eleven intermediate outcome indicators, four have been achieved so far. It is expected that all indicators will be met at the end of
                         the project closing date.

                         During this ISR period, the project management unit (PMU), the Directorate for the Water and Sanitation Subsector (DISAPAS), has made progress on the construction of RWSS
                         systems in Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui and Veraguas and the preparation of training material for the hand-washing promotion campaign. The PMU also strengthened water sector policy
                         and local capacity building activities through the: (i) creation of a pilot association of water boards in Boquete; (ii) approval of legal document to create regional WSS departments and
                         water inspector corps at the local level; (iii) completion of MAPAS, a policy instrument to monitor progress in WSS; (iv) development of a national manual for rural water and sanitation
                         projects; and (v) publishing of the 2010 and 2011 annual sector report. On the other hand, the PMU needs to improve supervision activities of the RWSS works, in particular social
                         and environmental aspects need to be better integrated into the overall supervision strategy. The PMU also needs to complete, implement and consolidate several of the policy
                         instruments and activities developed during the Project. To that end, PMU is executing an action plan for the next eight months, which is depicted in the last Aide Memoire and
                         biweekly meetings between the Bank team and PMU are taking place to go over the action plan progress.
