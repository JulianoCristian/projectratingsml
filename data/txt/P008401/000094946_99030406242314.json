          is rated satisfactory. The key lessons learned are as\n            follows: On the positive side, the technical assistance is\n            successful when it is provided over a longer period of time\n            and where there is continuity and sufficient time to build\n            mutual trust. On the negative side: a) In the case of a\n            credit line through commercial banks, the project should not\n            become effective until issues regarding legal documentation\n            relevant to the project have been resolved. b) The apex unit\n            should have been placed in the supervisory agency that is\n            responsible for the banking sector. c) For complete\n            implementation and proper evaluation of the success of a\n            project, the task manager who initiated and negotiated the\n            project should stay with the project until the closure of a\n            project regardless of where in the Bank he/she is located."}, "docdt": "1998-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
