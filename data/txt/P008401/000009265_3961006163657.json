 banking sector and increase the availability of investment\n            financing to the enterprise sector. The project will consist\n            of three components: 1) a commercial bank development\n            component, including long-term funding and technical\n            assistance; 2) assistance to the North Estonian Bank (NEB)\n            and 3) technical assistance to assist in project\n            implementation. The project will: improve efficient\n            allocation of resources by improving the intermediation\n            capabilities of the banking sector; increase the stability\n            of the banking sector, which will lead to greater\n            mobilization of funds; increase long-term investment by\n            providing critically needed long-term funds to the\n            enterprise sector which will in turn improve the\n            productivity of private enterprises by providing technology\n            and capital goods; and provide an incentive for\n            privatization by targeting investment funding toward private companies."}, "docdt": "1994-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
