ESTONIA
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 3803-EE)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Financial Institutions Development
Project in Estonia, for which Loan No. 3803-EE in the amount of US$10 million equivalent was
approved on October 18, 1994 and made effective on July 14, 1995.
The last disbursement for the only sub-loan financed under the Project was made on February 26,
1997. The bulk of the loan (US$7,673,231.25) was cancelled on July 1, 1997 upon the request of the
Borrower. The Project was closed on July 1, 1997. The original closing date was June 30, 1998.
The ICR was prepared by F. Esen Ulgenerk, Consultant, (Text) and Paula Lahdemaki, ECSPF,
(Tables and Formatting) and reviewed by Alexander Fleming, Principal Financial Economist, and Lily
Chu, Sr. Country Economist. The main co-financier, Swedfund, provided comments that were included
as an Appendix C to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission that took
place over the period May 10-May 15, 1998. It is based on material in the Project file. The borrower
contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the Project and commenting on
the draft ICR, both included as Appendices to the ICR.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN NO. 3803-EE)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.     Since joining the World Bank in 1992, the key objectives of Bank lending to Estonia have been
to support market-oriented reforms and alleviate the pockets of poverty that have developed during the
transition process, in addition to raising living standards. The Bank's first loan to Estonia was in October
1992. This US$30 million loan was approved to help the country finance imports of goods needed to
maintain electricity, tiransportation and health care services. In October 1994, the Bank approved a
US$10 million loan for a Financial Institutions Development Project to help accelerate the Government's
efforts to implement rieforms in the financial and enterprise sectors. The project was completed in June
1997 with US$2.4 million disbursed and the remaining US$7.6 million cancelled. To date, the Bank has
committed US$125.7 mnillion for seven operations in Estonia.]
Project Objectives
2.     The principal objective of the Financial Institutions Development Project was to support the
Government's reform efforts in the enterprise and financial sectors, focusing on strengthening the
banking system and increasing the availability of investment financing to the enterprise sector. The
Project included three components:
Part A        Commercial Bank Development: (i) $10 million equivalent to be on-lent by
Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) to private enterprises; (ii) strengthening the PFIs by
the provision of audits of an international standard for such PFIs; and (iii) assistance for the PFIs
in credit analysis, project finance, bank operations, treasury management, and management
information systems.
Part B        Restructuring of the North Estonian Bank (NEB), including a program  of
privatization and institutional development, and, as needed, re-capitalization.
Part C        Project Implementation: Strengthening the Borrower's capacity to implement
the Project by establishing a Core Advisors Group (CAG) and also by providing training in
environmental screening.
In addition to the above two loans, the other five operations are: US$18 million Health Project, US$38.4 million District
Heating Rehabilitation Project, US$12 million Highway Maintenance Project, US$2 million Hapsalu/Matsalu Water
Improvement Project, and US$15.3 million Agriculture Project.



Implementation Experience and Results
3.     The Project was successful in reaching its institutional development objectives for the banking
sector.  The participating banks were audited under international accounting standards.  The
environmental training program was implemented: a manual for evaluating projects for environmental
compliance for Estonia was prepared and eventually became a 'best practice' example in its area. The
Project's contribution to the development of the private sector in Estonia is modest since only one Project
was financed under the credit line. However, the discussions held with the Authorities on privatization
during the period up to appraisal provided general guidance for the overall privatization efforts in
Estonia.
4.     The CAG provided institutional development support through extensive technical assistance to
the banks. These advisors not only helped the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to implement the
Project, but also were supportive of all of the banks in Estonia that sought their guidance. Furthermore,
the CAG was in place for two years which ensured continuity and sufficient time for developing trust
between the banks and the advisors.
5.     The NEB was merged with Uhispank early in 1997. Due to management resistance, an effective
technical assistance and operational restructuring program, in line with World Bank requirements, was
not implemented. However, the Government undertook further financial restructuring of the bank,
involving the removal of its non-performing assets, before its merger to Uhispank. The joint resistance of
the World Bank and Swedfund Financial Markets AB (Swedfund) to injecting any equity unless certain
conditions were met, was beneficial in enforcing a transparent merger of this bank.
6.     Although the technical assistance component was very successful, the credit line did not disburse
significantly. This was not due to lack of demand for long-term credit by the private sector during the
preparation phase of the Project. By Project effectiveness, there were already two banks that qualified for
the credit line with various projects. However, this momentum was lost when the credit line became
effective in July 1995 but the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and the participating
banks was not legally resolved until April 1996. By this time, the six qualified banks had alternative
sources of long-term credit that had less stringent disbursement standards (particularly credit from
EBRD).
7.    The separation of the Swedfund from its close linkage to the credit line was beneficial to the
Estonian banks. During 1996 and 1997, the Swedfund contributed approximately US$6 million to the
Estonian banks that qualified under the Credit Line through share purchase or subordinated loans. The
World Bank credit line qualification procedure for the banks was helpful to Swedfund in determining the
creditworthiness of banks. In fact, the qualification criteria for banks for the World Bank credit line
became the major benchmark for foreign banks and other donors for identifying creditworthy banks in the
market.
Bank and Borrower Performances
8.     Bank and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory.  Bank performance was highly
satisfactory until July 1996, when mutual interest in the Project appears to have substantially waned after
the mid-term review of the project. The Borrower has not complied with Section 3, 4 and 5 of the
Implementation Program in Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement.



Summary of Findinlgs, Future Operations and Key lessons Learned
9.    The Project's overall performance is rated satisfactory. The technical assistance provided
through skills-building in the banking sector, environmental compliance training and the close follow-up
of the developments in the banking sector through the CAG were invaluable. The non-disbursement of
the credit line was not due to a lack of demand but due to an initial loss of momentum related to the slow
development, on the Government's part, of a subsidiary loan agreement with banks, slow processing of
the Project applications and the availability of alternative foreign currency funding sources for the banks
in Estonia. The Borrower's request for the cancellation of the credit line was primarily due to unexpected
overheating from excessive foreign borrowing in the economy, rather than the ineffectiveness of the
Project.
10.   There are no future operations discussed or planned with the Borrower in the financial sector.
However, discussions with the World Bank on the future development of the financial sector are expected
to continue. A Country Economic Memorandum addressing Estonia's EU accession is being prepared.
Due to Estonia's size, ithe country must rely on exports for its growth and will remain heavily dependent
on imported energy. Therefore, the country will likely require financial and technical assistance to
support reforms and investments that are conducive to export-led growth.
Some lessons learned are:
(i)          The technical assistance is successful when it is provided over a longer period of
time where there is continuity and sufficient time to build mutual trust.
(ii)         In case of a credit line through commercial banks, the project should not become
effective until issues regarding legal documentation relevant to the project have
been resolved.
(iii)        The apex unit, in case of projects that involve banking sector strengthening
should have been placed in the supervisory agency that is responsible for the
banking sector. The PIU in the Ministry of Finance did not have sufficient
motivation to make the project a success in Estonia. The Resident Mission
should ideally have played an enhanced role in project implementati,n although
it was not technically equipped to do so at that time.
(iv)         For complete implementation and proper evaluation of the success of a project,
the task manager who initiated and negotiated the project should stay with the
project until the closure of a project regardless of where in the bank he/she is
located, except when he/she is no longer with the bank.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 3803-EE)
PART ][. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement And Evaluation Of Objectives
Background
II.   Estonia began its price liberalization program and related economic reforms in 1989 and the pace
of reforms accelerated after independence in August 1991. Estonia's economy had been severely
distorted by half a century of central planning and by its heavy dependence on the former Soviet Union
for trade. The early 1990's resulted in a drop of 50 percent in the real level of Estonia's exports and
imports. Following a decline in 1992 and 1993, real output started to recover in late 1994. Tight fiscal
discipline helped assure the success of the currency board scheme under which Estonia's own currency,
the Kroon, was introduced in 1992. Inflation averaged around 2-3 percent during 1993, rising to an
average monthly rate of about 6.5 percent during the first quarter of 1994, but then falling to 1.6 percent
per month during the last months of 1994. Since then, Estonia's impressive economic performance has
qualified the country to be invited to start EU accession discussions in 1997.
12.   Before independence, Estonia's financial sector comprised the North Estonian State Bank
(formerly the Estoniari Branch of Vnesheconombank), the Savings Bank, the Social Bank, the Industry
and Construction Banlc, and 16 regional banks financing agriculture. The Bank of Estonia (BOE) was
established in January 1990, and in the following 2 years, most of the state-owned banks were privatized
or had state ownership diluted through share sales to the public. In late 1992, several banks developed
liquidity problems. The Government liquidated one bank and merged the two illiquid banks into a new
bank, North Estonian Bank (NEB). The Government took over the ownership of NEB through the
issuance of bonds to cover the asset shortage of the bank. After the banking crisis, the BOE conducted a
re-licensing survey of the banks and increased the minimum banking capital requirement. This screening
and higher capital requirements served to decrease the number of banks from 42 to 22 by end- 1994.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
13.   At the time the Project was conceived, the financial sector was still in its early stages of
development and the banks were learning to operate within the free market environment. A Bank
identification mission took place in September 1993. At that time, the mission felt that although long-
term investment funds were urgently needed by the newly privatized enterprise sector, a World Bank
credit line could not be justified, since IMF and G-24 (through the EU) were planning to provide around
US$50 million in long--term funds to be channeled through the banking sector.
14.   However, in subsequent discussions with the Government of Estonia, the Authorities expressed
concern that the banks might not have sufficient capital base to absorb these funds and that there was also
a need for increasing their technical capacity to evaluate and process these funds. Consequently, the



- 2 -
World Bank, along with the Government of Sweden, began working to develop an integrated approach to
financial sector strengthening in Estonia. The following needs were identified:
(i)           Long-term resources to meet enterprise investment needs (partially met through
the IMF and EU/G-24 money).
(ii)          Technical assistance to deliver long-term resources.
(iii)         An increase in the capital base of banks, which would allow them to make full
use of the available funding.
15.   In addition to credit delivery, sharpening competition in the banking sector dictated that: (a)
commercial banks need to develop a range of skills, not just credit skills; (b) the Government must
decrease its involvement in the commercial banking sector; and (c) the BOE must continue to upgrade its
banking supervision capabilities, particularly as one consequence of further banking sector competition
could be the emergence of further banking fragility.
16.   With these needs in mind, a comprehensive program was developed. To meet long-term credit
needs, a package of credit resources (IBRD), capital injections (Government of Sweden through
Swedfund), and technical assistance (BITS, EC PHARE, DAGTI, the Government of Norway, and the
Government of Netherlands) was structured. The technical assistance was designed to assist in credit
assessment and project finance, as well as bank operations, treasury functions, MIS needs, etc. The
Project would also help the Government to re-capitalize and restructure the NEB, so as to stabilize the
NEB sufficiently to facilitate its privatization. In parallel, EC PHARE and the IMF would be working to
provide technical assistance to improve overall supervision capabilities, including the capability to deal
with troubled banks and to improve bank accounting and reporting.
Project Components and Objectives
17.   The project comprised three components:
(i)           Commercial Bank Development. A line of credit to be channeled through the
commercial banking system to provide long-term funds for private enterprises.
These funds were to be supplemented by co-financing from the Government of
Sweden (Swedfund), that would be used to provide additional capital to private
banks. In addition, technical assistance was to be provided to banks to (a)
conduct audits to international standards, and (b) develop skills in credit analysis,
project finance, and general banking operations.
(ii)          Restructuring the North Estonian Bank.  The Bank would assist in the
coordination of financial resources and technical assistance to restructure and
eventually privatize the NEB.
(iii)         Project Implementation. Technical assistance would be provided to assist in
strengthening  project implementation.   This would  include the project
implementation unit, financial advisors, and environmental training.

Project Descriptioni
18.   Commercial Bank Development. This component included an IBRD-financed credit line of
US$1  n-illion. The funds were to be channeled through a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) at the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and then on-lent through participating banks. A spread would be added to the
13RD lending rate to reflect administrative and guarantee costs. The interest rates on the sub-loans were
to be negotiated freely between each participating bank and its clients. Co-financing from Swedfund
would be made available to the participating banks in parallel with the Bank credit line. A qualified bank
that was making a qualified sub-loan, and that also had reached an agreement with the Swedfund on
investment conditions, would receive 50 percent of the funds in the form of capital and 50 percent in the
form of World Bank credit. The on-lending banks would bear the foreign exchange and credit risks of
the su'. 'oans.
19.   The criteria for becoming a participating bank in this Project was to meet the regulatory financial
standards per BOE requirements and adequate loan loss provisioninig based on audits conducted
according to internationally accepted accounting practices. Since such audits can cost upwards to
US$100,000 equivalent, and some of the applicant banks at that time had capital of only US$1-2 million,
EC PHARE and the Government of Netherlands offered to help finance audits.
20.   To ensure that banks which qualify under the Project develop the skills necessary to use these
funds wisely, technical assistance in credit analysis, project finance, bank operations, treasury
management, and management information systems was to be provided.
21.   Restructuring of the North Estonian Bank. The Estonian Authorities had already begun taking
steps to financially restructure the NEB. However, once the remaining non-performing loans were
written off, the remailning capital of NEB was insufficient to support the current loan base of NEB. The
Government of Estonia, with the assistance from Swedfund, planned to inject new capital to NEB.
Swedfund's contribution was conditional on:
(i)          An agreement on a privatization program for NEB.
(ii)         An agreement on an institutional development program  with technical
assistance, including the appointment of management committed to its rapid
implementation.
(iii)        A capitalization program for the bank, which brings NEB up to a level that
satisfied the prudential norm, established by BOE with the Swedfund component
of the capital base representing a minority share of the capital.
22.   The World Bank would supervise the implementation of this agreement and also coordinate with
EC PHARE on the technical assistance to be provided to NEB.
23.   Project Imp Jementation. A PIU was to be set up in the MOF. Technical assistance would be
provided to assist in the project implementation. Such assistance would include: (a) establishment of a
Core Advisors Group (CAG) and (b) training in environmental screening.
24.   The CAG was planned to be a key element in the implementation of the credit line. The primary
purpose of the CAG would be to assist the PIU and the World Bank in: (a) evaluating the eligibility of the
banks; (b) monitoring the ongoing performance of the participating banks and their loan portfolios under
the credit line; and (c) reviewing the sub-projects to be financed under the credit line.



- 4 -
25.   In addition, the CAG was expected to provide technical assistance to all of the commercial banks
in various aspects of banking operations. Such assistance would include among others things: (a)
developing credit policies and procedures; (b) developing internal operational manuals applicable under
internationally acceptable accounting standards; (c) developing proper internal management information
systems for effective asset and liability management. The CAG was also expected to support the
implementation of the IMF STF and EU/G-24 Programs.
26.    The main emphasis of the training in environmental screening was to help build institutional
capacity to ensure that the World Bank environmental policies and Estonian environment laws and
regulations are being properly applied. The primary goal of this component was to train the loan
departments of the participating banks to screen proposed sub-projects according to environmental
standards.
Evaluation of the Objectives
27.   In line with the CAS prepared in 1994, the principal objective of the Financial Institutions
Development Project was to support the Government's reform efforts in the enterprise and financial
sectors, focusing on strengthening the banking system and increasing the availability of investment
financing to the enterprise sector. The Project components supported the institutional development of the
banks, the restructuring and eventual privatization of the NEB and also the regulatory infrastructure of the
banking sector through the bank audits and requirement for improved bank supervision by BOE. The
overall project was complex, especially in regard to the role of the Swedfund. The credit line component
was not essential to this project but helped support the objective of the development of the private sector
through the provision of long-term funds. It was not possible in practice, to forge a close (50:50) link
between the Swedfund equity injection and the World Bank credit line. There were no clear guidelines
for the Swedfund's participation in banks (and no time frame for exit). Furthermore, the linkage of
increased credit risk to equity participation is not necessarily a prudent motivation for a commercial bank.
B. Achievement Of Objectives
28.   The Project reached its institutional development objectives for the banking sector.  The
participating banks were audited successfully under international accounting standards and BOE adopted
similar requirements. The capital bases of the participating banks were strengthened and the banks
developed a capability to evaluate long-term credit. Twelve Estonian banks used the technical assistance
provided under the project to improve banking skills. The environmental training program was also very
successful. A manual for evaluating projects for environmental compliance for Estonia was prepared and
eventually became a 'best practice' example in its area.
29.    The CAG, funded by Grants, provided institutional development support through extensive
technical assistance to the banks. These advisors not only helped the PIU to implement the project, but
also were supportive of all of the banks in Estonia that asked for their guidance. Furthermore, the CAG
was in place for a long time period (two years), ensuring continuity and sufficient time for developing
trust between the banks and the advisers.
30.    The NEB was merged with Uhispank early in 1997. Due to management resistance, an effective
technical assistance and operational restructuring program - in line with World Bank requirements - was
not implemented. However, the Government undertook further financial restructuring of the bank,
involving the removal of all its non-performing assets, before its merger to Uhispank. The joint



resistance of the World Bank and the Swedfund to injecting any equity unless these conditions were met,
were beneficial in enforcing a transparent merger of this bank.
31.   Although the technical assistance component was very successful, the credit line did not disburse
significantly. This was not due to lack of demand for long-term credit by the private sector. By project
effectiveness, there were already two banks that qualified for the credit line with various projects.
However, this momentum was lost after the credit line became effective in July 1995: the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement betwleen the Government and the participating banks was not legally resolved until April
1996. By this time, the six qualified banks had alternative sources of long-term credit (including from
EBRD), that carried less stringent disbursement standards.
32.   The separation of the Swedfund from the strict credit line linkage was beneficial to the Estonian
banks. During 1996 and 1997, the Swedfund contributed approximately US$6 million through share
purchase or subordinated loans to the Estonian banks that qualified under the Credit Line (see Appendix
C). The World Bank credit line qualification procedure for the banks was helpful to the Swedfund in its
selection of creditworthy banks. The qualification criteria and the process for banks to access the World
Bank credit line, became the main benchmark for foreign banks and other donors in identifying
creditworthy banks in the market. The Estonian banks vied to get technical assistance and to qualify for
the World Bank credit line as proof of 'acceptance' by the regulafory authorities and the international
banking community.
C. Impliementation And Major Factors Affecting The Project
33.   The appraisal for the project was conducted in May 1994, the Loan Agreement was signed in
November 1994; and, the Project became effective in July 1995. As noted above, the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and the on-lending arrangement to qualified banks was not legally
resolved until April 1996. The delay for two years, from appraisal to effective project implementation for
the credit line component, meant that interest in the project waned considerably. This delay was
primarily due to factors under the Borrower's control: the Subsidiary Loan Agreement and the
parliamentary approval could have been more quickly processed.
34.   The demand for long-term finance by the rapidly growing Estonian private sector has never been
disputed throughout the implementation of the project. By September 1995, four banks had already
qualified and the PIU asked that the first two projects in the pipeline be formally submitted for approval.
The first of these projects was approved in June 1996, after 9 months. This long delay was due to both
the delays in the finalization of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement and the lack of experience in the qualified
banks to prepare a iFormal project finance package. Three projects totaling US4 4.7 million were
submitted to the CAG and PIU during the first half of 1996. The first one for US$ 2.4 million was
approved and financed under the credit line. However, by mid-1996, the Estonian Banks had plenty of
less stringent foreign currency funding sources and were thus impatient to go through the processing
steps for the World Bank credit line. Consequently, the two other projects submitted in May/June 1996,
that were approved by September 1996, were shifted to these other funding altematives.
35.   Two amendments to the loan agreement were made to accommodate the changing circumstances
in Estonia. One simplified the procurement procedure such that for contracts under US$1 million
standard local procurement practices were allowed to be used. The other addressed the disbursement
categories and removed the 50-50 split of expenditure financing between the credit line and the Swedfund
co-financing. Two other amendments were also discussed during the implementation but were not
finalized by cancellation. One was to convert the loan from Pool Loan structure to a Single Currency

Loan, and the other to broaden the coverage of the credit line to include financing of housing sector
loans.
36.   The major success of the project was the technical assistance provided by the CAG to the PIU
and the banking sector. The three advisors were in place from early 1995 until May 1997 and provided
technical assistance in all areas of banking skills to the interested banks. A credit evaluation manual was
prepared and distributed to all the interested banks. Several banks have adopted sections of this manual
as part of their own credit policies and procedures. In-house training was provided to the interested
banks in treasury management, accounting policy and procedure manual preparations and project finance.
37.   In addition, CAG provided supportive service to the PIU in evaluating the bank and project
qualifications for the credit line. The periodic updating on banking conditions submitted to the World
Bank and the PIU was also very helpful to both parties in tracking developments in this sector.
D. Project Sustainability
38.    The Estonian banking sector is undergoing another transition in 1998. The accession program to
EU will require its legislative and regulatory framework to be improved and enhanced. The banks are
merging so as to increase their capital base and grow in market share. This will help them continue to be
competitive. There are now 12 banks in Estonia and the expectations is that this number will decline to 5-
6 over the next few years.
39.    The rapid growth funded by foreign inflows over the last three years have left all of the banks
with a mismatched maturity profile (long assets and short liabilities). The majority of the available
foreign funding was of shorter term while Estonian banks also preferred to borrow short expecting
borrowing costs to decline. The stock market crash last Fall and recent concerns about emerging markets
have hurt the funding capability and costs of the Estonian banks. The rapid asset growth during 1994-97
also has weakened the quality of the loans. An IMF program implemented in late 1997 foresees various
measures to check the overheating in the banking sector.
40.    Since only one sub-loan was financed under the credit line, the Project's support for the
development of the private sector was not significant. However, the high quality of technical assistance
provided under the project was appreciated by the entire banking sector and provided a sound foundation
of support for the development of this sector in Estonia.
E. Bank Performance
41.    Bank performance is satisfactory primarily due to good performance until the mid-term review of
the project. Close supervision and frequent trips to the country by experts on different aspects of
financial sector development have occurred until July 1996, the mid-term review. A seminar on bond
markets, took place under the umbrella of the Project. Furthermore, experts on deposit insurance and on
capital market development also held discussions with the regulatory authorities on separate missions
under the Project. No supervision or further discussions on the development of the financial markets in
Estonia took place after July 1996, the mid-term review performed by a new task manager. The mid-term
review identified the weaknesses in the project. However, after July 1996 there were no other field
missions to discuss these weaknesses with the Borrower.  The contact and the follow-up with
Headquarters and the Borrower were maintained by the CAG. There is little written correspondence with
the Borrower in the files. This lack of communication becomes apparent where the Bank's official letter
to the Borrower, including suggestions to alter the form or to cancel the project, is written on March 17,



- 7 -
1997-10 days later than the date of the letter written by the Borrower requesting cancellation of the
project.
F. Borrower Performance
42.   The Borrower's performance is rated satisfactory. primarily because of the support provided to
the banking sector through the CAG under PIU. The delay in the approval and the signing of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement resulted in the loss of momentum for the disbursement of the credit line.
Unfortunately, PIU employees also opted for private sector jobs during the implementation of the Project,
further weakening project implementation and sustainability. Furthermore, the Borrower has not fulfilled
the implementation piogram as prescribed under Sections 3, 4 and 5 in Schedule 5 to the Loan
Agreement.  The file correspondence indicates that the Borrower's interest in the Project waned
considerably after World Bank and the Swedfund refused to qualify NEB for the credit line and equity
contribution unless prior conditions were met. Subsequently, there was very limited correspondence over
the project.
G. Assessment Of Outcome
43.   The Project's overall performance is rated satisfactory. The technical assistance provided in
skills-building in the banking sector, environmental compliance training, and the close follow-up of the
developments in the banking sector through the CAG were invaluable. The non-disbursement of the
credit line was not due to a lack of demand but due to an initial loss of momentum, slow processing of the
project applications, and the availability of alternative foreign currency funding sources for the banks in
Estonia. The Borrower's request for the cancellation for the credit line was primarily due to unexpected
overheating from excessive foreign borrowing in the economy, rather than the ineffectiveness of the
Project itself.
H. Future Operations
44.   There are no future operations discussed or planned with the Borrower in the financial sector.
However, advisory discussions with the World Bank on the future development of the financial sector are
expected to continue. Estonia's remarkable progress in transforming its economy into a market-based
system has resulted in the country being invited to European Union accession negotiations in 1997. A
Country Economic Memorandum addressing Estonian's EU accession is being prepared. Due to
Estonia's size, the country must rely on exports for its growth and will remain heavily dependent on
imported energy. Therefore, the country will likely require financial and technical assistance to support
reforms and investments that are conductive to export-led growth.

I. Key Lessons Learned
45.    On the positive side:
(i)           The technical assistance is successful when it is provided over a longer period of
time and where there is continuity and sufficient time to build mutual trust.
46.    On the negative side:
(ii)         In the case of a credit line through commercial banks, the project should not
become effective until issues regarding legal documentation relevant to the
project have been resolved.
(iii)         The Apex unit should have been placed in the supervisory agency that is
responsible for the banking sector. The PIU in the MOF did not have sufficient
motivation to make the project a success in Estonia. The Resident Mission
should ideally have played an enhanced role in project implementation although
it was not technically equipped to do so at that time.
(iv)          For complete implementation and proper evaluation of the success of a project,
the task manager who initiated and negotiated the project should stay with the
project until the closure of a project regardless of where in the bank he/she is
located, except when he/she is no longer with the bank.

9 The Borrower was supposed to submit annual audit reports. However, due to low disbursements and cancellation of the Loan,
the Bank requested only one audit report for the whole period of the project.
10 The audit of the Plroject for 1996 was waived. The Bank suggested that, given there was only one disbursement, the
Borrower would have one audit completed on the Project at its completion.

lThe mission noted that, on the financial side, there is the question of absorptive capacity, given other donor plans. On the
enterprise side, the most pressing need would require TA, for which the Government has indicated an unwillingness to
borrower. Two areas where investment assistance could be very effectively used are environmental clean-ups and export
credits for companies with clear privatization plans.
12 The mission noted the banks are continuing to lend almost exclusively short-term and to roll over existing short-term loans
with a new interest rate. There continued to be concern over the capability of the banking system to absorb a credit line,
particularly given the impending availability of funds from the G-24 and the IMF. The mission also commented that there
would be demand for the credit line if it were properly designed (fast disbursements; streamlined procedures).
13 The mission commented that developing proper mechanisms for delivery of the G-24 and the IMF funds is still an issue.
Therefore, the mission had started discussions to coordinate some of the processes involved in channeling these funds,
particularly the role of various advisors.
14 lntra-government problems emerged. The mission believed, however, that the Government's stance on financial sector
reform or this project should not be greatly altered by changes within the Government.
5 The mission commented that a major disappointment was the minimal amount of progress at the North Estonian Bank: the
bank had made almost no progress in operational reconstructing. There was also an issue related to the proposed sale of
the bank.
16 The mission noted ihat the then-recent elections had delayed the approval of the loan. This delayed the declaration of
effectiveness of dhe loan. The absence of an institutional development program at the NEB undermines the view that the
Government and the NEB management are seriously committed to taking the steps needed to convert the NEB into an
institution whichi will be commercially viable.

17 The mission commented that the Government and the commercial banks had realized that swapping currencies is more
expensive than expected. It was agreed that the mission would look into the possibility and procedures for changing the
loan into a SCL. The North Estonian Bank's condition appeared to have deteriorated further, according to the mission
statement. However, it was difficult to get an exact assessment of its financial condition as the bank's management could
not reach agreement with the auditors on its financial statements.
'9 Subsidiary Loan Agreements had not been signed yet.
19 The mission commented that some of the potential sub-borrowers do not yet understand the procedures for procurement
under ICB. The World Bank will work with the PIU and the banks to make sure that these procedures are handled
properly.
20 The mission noted that three projects with a total value of $4.7 million were received by the CAG and the PIU. Despite that,
the Form590 indicates that there may have been too much other money available to the commercial banks on terms more
favorable and/or under simpler procedures than that found with World Bank funding. The Form 590 also indicated that
there was a delay of parliamentary approval of loan effectiveness and in receiving the final subsidiary loan agreement from
the Ministry of Finance.

APPENDIX A
Finanicial Institutions Development Project (Loan no. 3803-EE)
Aide Memoire of Implementation Completion Mission
1.    A Bank mission consisting of Esen Ulgenerk (Consultant) and Paula Lahdemaki
(ECSPF) initiated work on the Implementation Completion Report for the Financial Institutions
Development Project during May 10-15, 1998. The mission met with the representatives of the
Ministry of Finance, Bank of Estonia and the participating banks (PFIs). The mission would like
to thank the Estonian counterparts for the cooperation and courtesies extended.
2.    The principal objective of the Project was to support the Government's reform efforts in
the enterprise and financial sectors, focusing on strengthening the banking system and increasing
the availability of investment financing to the enterprise sector. The Project included three
components:
(a) Commercial Bank Development: (i) USD 10 million equivalent to be on-lent by Participating
Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) to private enterprises; and (ii) strengthening the PFIs by the
provision of audits of an international standard for such PFIs, and assistance to the PFIs in
credit analysis, project finance, bank operations, treasury management, and developing
management information systems.
(b) Restructuring of the North Estonia Bank (NEB), including a program of privatization and
institutional development, and, as needed, recapitalization.
(c) Project Implementation: Strengthening the Borrower's capacity to implement the Project by
establishing a Core Advisors Group (CAG) and by providing training in environmental
screening.
3.    The project was cancelled upon the request of the Borrower in July 1997. Primary reason
being that the Estonian Banking Sector had sufficient alternative and less expensive long-term
financing resources and therefore there was no reason to continue keeping the undisbursed
amounts under the credit line. The North Estonian Bank had merged into the Uhispank in
January 1997. The technical assistance provided through the Core Advisors Group co-financed
by grant funds had already been completed by April 1997, prior to the cancellation of the Project.
There is one sub-loan totaling USD 2.4 million to be repaid by 2006 outstanding under the credit
line.
4.    The Ministry of Finance will continue to monitor the performance of the PFI and the
single sub-loan financed under the credit line. In the past, the Ministry of Finance had been
supported by advisors funded by grant funds to monitor the performance of the PFIs and the sub-
project funded under ihe credit line. Given the manpower and budget restrictions of the Ministry
of Finance, it appeared unclear as to how the Ministry of Finance would continue monitoring the
PFI and the sub-loan. The Ministry representative indicated that additional grant funding to
continue hiring external advisors to monitor the banking sector in Estonia on behalf of the



- 22 -
Ministry would be very helpful. No other operational plan activity was deemed necessary for the
Project.
5.    The Borrower's responsibilities in the preparation of the ICR were familiar to Ms Agate
Dalton. Copies of the Bank's BP 13.55 and relevant parts of the GP 13.55 were given. It was
agreed that the Borrower will receive the Bank's Draft ICR for comments on July 1, 1998 and
the Borrower will submit its report latest by August 1, 1998. To enable the comparison of
appraisal and actual and project costs and financing plans, the Borrower will update the relevant
tables of the CIR Draft when sent in July 1998.
6.    The following persons will coordinate the preparation of the Borrower's and the Bank's
preparation of the ICR:
For the Borrower:   Ms. Agate Dalton, MOF
For the Bank:     Alex Fleming
Paula Lahdemaki
Kristjan Kitvel
7.    The mission also submitted to the Ministry of Finance a TOR for audit of the financial
statements, SOEs, and the Special Accounts of the Project, covering the whole period of the
Project. The audit will concern the above Loan as well as the Grant s that supported the Project
(Danish Grant no. TF020222, Swedish Grant TF020223). The Borrower shall submit an audit
report by June 30, 1998, as agreed in the Loan Agreement. The Borrower confirmed that they
have complied with the World Bank request (Letters dated April 14, 1998) to submit supporting
documentation for the above Grants to recover the Special Accounts. With regard to the
recovery of the Japanese Grant (PHRD 29336), the Borrower confirmed that they will return the
balance to the Bank.

APPENDIX B
Financial Institutions Development Project (Loan no. 3803-EE)
Implementation Completion Report
REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER
The Government of Estonia received a loan from the World Bank in 1995 (Board approval in
1994) in the amount of 10 million USD. The loan and project were aimed for commercial banks
development and increasing available financing resources for enterprises. Grant co-financing
from Sweden, Denmark and EU Phare was arranged for establishing a Core Advisors Group,
who helped to implement the project and advised the banks on various issues over three years.
With the grant component, the project succeeded in assisting the commercial banks in Estonia to
develop their credit practices and provided support in their overall institutional development. In
1995, several commercial banks had only recently started to lend for longer-term investment
projects and their experience and practices were often inadequate. In addition to "learning by
doing" and private sector financed training in the area of credit policy and procedures, the Core
Advisors Group was available. It was regularly used by many banks. The Core Advisors Group
was located in the Ministry of Finance, but most banks did not see it as the "government's agent"
and accepted the external advice very well.
The loan component of the project had less success, as only one project was financed from the
credit line and less than 25% of the resource was disbursed. This was so largely because several
alternative financing sources (for example the STF facility from the IMF and EBRD credit lines
to major banks) became available at about the same time. These sources had considerably less
complex terms for pre-qualification of banks, projects selection and actual financing and
procurement procedure. Estonian banks were confused by the IBRD's project approval and
procurement requirements. It appeared to us that the IBRD was unwilling to ease the
requirements because of the banking crisis in neighboring Latvia. The Ministry of Finance did
not push the loans to the banks against their will. The banks also appeared very optimistic that
shorter term private sector flows, that started to come in 1995-1996, would never reverse.
By way of advice to possible similar projects, in Estonia or elsewhere, we suggest that the local
Bank office should have had a bigger role. The Local office could have more authority to help
with project implementation and be responsible for overall supervision. With that authority in
the Headquarters, this project was somehow living from "mission to mission". On the part of the
Borrower, a change of staff and parallel other duties of subsequent Project Implementation Unit
members caused delays as well.

taken place with the FIDP staff in Estonia since start of Swedfund's operations in the Fall of 1995.
Background: When launching its program in the Fall of 1995 (with the encouragement of the Bank),
Swedfund was able to draw heavily on the work already undertaken by the FIDP: the project's analysis of
the Estonian banks; the technical assistance and institution-building that was provided to individual
banks, and; the strengthening of the financial infrastructure.
The initial linkage: The original idea for linkage between FIDP and Swedfund was to "drip-feed" FIDP
credits and Swedfund equity investments into qualifying banks (in a ratio of one to one). This proved to
be impossible to implement in practice however given the differing procedures, objectives, and the
relative importance of timing
Linkage with other investors: Even though Swedfund worked extremely closely with the staff of FIDP, it
soon became apparent that there was a need to invest in the Estonian banks jointly with other institutions,
to create a critical mass of capital and governance expertise. In this context Swedfund partnered with
EBRD and also, to some extent, DEG. Swedfund also cooperated with purely commercial funds like the
Baltic Fund and, New Century Holdings. The catalytic effect of Swedfund investments has been
considerable. Swedfund has gone into banks at a very early stage and commercial funds have entered at
subsequent stage through participation in capital issues.
Dealing with conflict of interest: Swedfund quickly realized that it had to deal with the possible conflicts
of interest resulting from being a shareholder in more than one commercial bank in the same country (or
even the same region) given the cross border competition that has developed. Swedfund has lately tried
to concentrate its portfolio in a limited number of banks. The cooperation between Uhispank, Unibank
and Vilniaus is also supported and encouraged by Swedfund.
Current objectives: Swedfund's first priority is to be an active shareholder. It seeks to promote good
corporate governance through representation on the Supervisory Councils of the banks. Swedfund's
work of the Supervisory Councils is a constant struggle and it is prepared to resign from a bank (such as
Ukio) if its voice is not able to be heard. It is difficult for the banks' management to realize to fully
appreciate the respective roles of management, council, shareholders.
Conclusion: Swedfund, in cooperation with FIDP staff, has, in summary, made a substantial contribution
to the growth and stability of the Estonian banking system through helping to implement good corporate
governance and transforming management practices and thinking.
