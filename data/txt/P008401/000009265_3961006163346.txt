MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECIVE DIRECTORS
ON -A PROPOSED-LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
FOR A FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the fbllowing memorandum and recommend&tion on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Estonia for the equivalent of US$10 million to help finance a Financial Institutions
Development project 'The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
15 years, including 5 years of grace.
Country/Sector Background. Estonia began the price liberalization process and related
economic refonns earlier than the other former Soviet Union and Baltics (FSUB) republics (in 1989-90),
and the pace of refonn was stepped up significantly during the last three years The government's
stabilization strate_' has been highly successful. Initially, prices increased sharply as the distorted relative
prices inherited from the Soviet system adjusted to world levels. Nevertheless, tight fiscal discipline
helped assure the success of the currency board scheme under which Estonia's own currency, the aroon,
was introduced, and annual inflation during 1993 was only 35 percent. Inflation increased to an average
of 6.5 percent per month in the first quarter of 1994, but dropped to an average of 1.6 percent per month
in the second quarter of 1994. However, the stringent policy environment together with disruptions in
trade and payments with the FSUB and a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade, have had a severe
negative impact on the enterprise and banking sectors. Industrial production dropped 60 percent during
1992, and showed only a small improvement during 1993.
3.         Small-scale privatization has been proceeding well, with more than 80 percent of an
estimated 1600-1800' enterprises privatized. The Govenmment has also begun accelerating its privatization
program for medium and large scale enftrprises. It is now pursuing a multi-track privatization program
including (i) the current method of intemational tender followed by negotiation; (ii) expanded auctions;
(iii) a pilot of five initial public offerings; (iv) direct trade sales; (v) turn around management; and (vi)
joint ventures.
4.         In the financial sector, the Estonian Government has already handled a major crisis. In
October 1992, three of the largest banks in Estonia, representing about 40 percent of total bank assets,
suffered severe liquidity problems. The Government decided to close the Tartu Bank, and merged the
Union Baltic Bank with North Estonian Bank, resulting in substantial losses to owners and depositors.
5.         The decision made by the Government was a difficult one, but it showed the Government's
resolve to make banks responsible for their own operating decisions. As a result, the banks in Estonia
have shown increased prudence in making loans, and often are more cautious than standard prudential
norms. However, the caution of the banks has turned into a two-edged sword; banks now make almost
no medium or long-term investment loans, although the banks are highly liquid and there are widespread
investment needs. Much of this caution is due to serious tern mismatches between the sources of funds2
1.  Exact numbers are hard to determine since one enteprise may be sold off in several pieces. This mens that
pre- and postprivatizaon estmes of total entaprises do not match up.
2. 85 percent of commercial bank deposits as of December 1993 were demand deposits, and an additional
13 pecent of deposits had mauies of less tm  I year.

(mostly sho,t-term deposits) and the demand for long-term investment funds. In addition, the banks are
only now beginning to develop the skills needed to evaluate risks involved in long-term project finance.
6.         The banking sector now includes 20 commercial banks, the Savings Bank, and one
development bank.4 The only 100 percent government-owned bink is the Norith Estonian Bank (created
by the merger of two baiks during the banking crisis). The Bank of Estonia (BOE) owns 67 percent of
the Savings Bank. T1he remaining 33 percent is owned by Hansapank, a private commercial bank, and
BOE is looking for another investor to purchase another 33 percent of the Savings Bank. The BOE
eventually hopes to completely divest all of its Savings Bank shares. All the other commerial banks have
majority or 100 percent private ownership. The commercial banks make lending decisions imlependently
from Government directives, and account for more than 76 percent of the assets in the banking sector, and
87 percent of the loans.
7.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. Previous Ban- involvetnent in project
implementation in Estonia has been limited to a Rehabilitation Loan of UqJ' .nil,-, n effective since
Octobbr 6, 1992. As of August 31, 1994, over US$29 millior. 'f loan funds vcr:e committed, and
US$27.9 million had been disbursed. Complete disbursement undw the Rehablli-tion Loan is expected
by September 30, 1994. A Highway Maintenance Loan and a District Heating Rehabilitation Loan were
approved by the Board in May 1994.
8.        In a number of reforming countries in Central and Eastem Europe, severe difficulties have
been experienced in the disbursement of credit lines, due primarily to financial environments that deter
enterprises and banks from lending and boffowing term resources at market rates. However, in Estonia
the primary impediments to long-tern lending appear to be the shortage of long-term resources and long-
term lending skills, both of which will be addressed by this project. Another problem has been that
subprojects financed by World Bank funds require more careful preparation and extensive documentation
than subprojects financed through other sources, effectively raising the relative cost of using World Bank
funds. This project includes considerable technical assistance, particularly for project implementation,
which will help decrease the implementation burden on the commercial banks. In addition, this project
includes cofinancing in the form of capital injections, which will provide an additional incentive for banks
to develop medium and long-term lending skills. Finally, disbursements of credit lines in other countries
often have been slowed by lack of project preparation skills in the enterprise sector. In Estonia, the EC
PHARE has established Business Centers to provide consulting services to small businesses, including in
the area of project preparation, and a number of private consulting firms have also begun operating in
Estonia.
9.         Rationale for Bank Involvement. The World Bank is a strong supporter of the reform
process undertaken by the Republic of Estonia. It views a strong financial sector and new investment in
the private sector to be critical to the long-term development of Estonia. Although the favorable policy
environment has increased the amount of available domestic and foreign capital, investment is not taking
place at the desired pace. In 1993, fixed capital formation represented about 10 percent of GUP compared
to 15-25 percent in other comparable countries. Only 4.7 percent of govenmment expenditures were
allocated to investment and net domestic credit accounted for 30 percent of the overall assets of the
banking system. The project will help the country overcome these difficulties by: (i) facilitating
intermediation through improving credit analysis capabilities and the stability of financial institutions,
(ii) providing some of the funding required by enterprises for investments to restructure operations and

increase production; and (iii) providing an incentive to privatize by making much sought after invesatnent
fimds available to the private sector.- The World Bank's role in this project has been to serve as a catalyst
and coordinator of multinational and bilater support programs that address pivotal needs in these sectors.
As part of this program, the Government of Sweden will be providing SKr 100 million (approximately
US$12 million) for capital injections5 and technical assistance will be financed fiom a variety of sources,
including the Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support (BITS), EC PHARE, the Danish
Agency for the Development of Trade and Industry, the Government of Norway, and the Govermnent of
the Netherlands. In addition to mobilizing the resources directly for the program described in this
document, part of the structure of the World Bank progm will be integrted with the IMP SUTF program
and the EU/G-4 e&ssistance progrmn.
10.        The proposed project is consistentwith current bankpolicy in at it,helpsto-.ataIyze trans-
sectoral support for private sector development, privatization and subsequent rstucturing. As Estonia
is a new member, an interim Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed when the first Bank-
supported Rehabilitation Loan (Ln 3522EE) was presented in September 1992. A comprehensive CAS,
to be presented to the Board alongside this project, provides a full discussion of the Bank's assistance
strategy for Estonia of which this project is an integmal component.
11.       Project Objectives. The project's main objective is to support and help accelerate the
Govemment's implementation of refonns in the financial and enterprise sectors, with the long-run goal
of producing strong, stable, and competitive financial institutions and enterprises. Estonia has already
taken important steps towards developing a market-based banking system. However, the flow of credit
to enterprises greatly lags investment needs. This project is designed to provide long-term funds to be
onlent to enterprises and also to provide assistance to the banks in reducing long-tenn lending risks, such
as through traning in credit evaluation, long-term project finance structuring and monitoring, and risk
asset management. The project would also work to stabilize the financial sector through the
recapitalization, restructuring, and subsequent privatization of the North Estonian Bank, the only bank still
100 percent state-owned.
12.       Project Dese-2ption. The project would consist of three components:
(i)    Commercial Bank Development. A line of credit will be channelled through the
commercial banking system to provide long-term funds for private enterprises.
These funds will be supplemented by cofinancing by the Government of Sweden,
which would be used to provide additional capital to private banks. In addition,
technical assistance will be provided to (a) conduct audits to international
standards, and (b) develop skills in credit analysis, project finance, and general
opertions.
(ii)    Restucturting of the North Estonian Bank  The Bank would assist in the
coordination of financial resources and technical assistance to restructure and
eventually privatize the North Estonian Bank.
(iii)    Project Implementation. Technical Assistance would be provided to assist in
strengthening project implementation.  This would include the Project
hnplementation Unit (PIU), financial advisors, and environumental training.
13.        The project cost is estimated at US$31.75 million equivalent, with a foreign exchsage
component of US$?5.15 million equivalent (79.2 percent of total project cost) of which the Bank would
finance US$10 mihnion equivalent (39.8 percent of the foreign cost and 31.5 percent of the total cost).

Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached, Tle Staff Appraisal Report. No. 13176 EE
dated September 15, 1994 is being distributed separtely.
14.        Project Implementation.- The proposed project would be carried out- by the Project -
Implementation Unit in the Ministry of Finance. ft is expected that the PW will draw on the staffing and
skills of the PU established for the Estonia Rehabilitation Loan which is now more thm 80 percent
disbutsed. The new PIU will therefore have faminiarity with Bank procurement, disbursement, and
reporting procedures. For the financial sector aspects of the project, the PIU will be able to draw on the
skills and advice of several financial sector specialists (the Core AdvisorsO rop) who will be- finaced
by cofinansing under this project. Eligibility criteria for the participating banks and sub-borrowers, as
well as general loan conditions for the subloans, have already been established. Commercial bank audits
and environmental assessment training we already underway. Supervision requirenents are expected to
be at least 20 staff-weeks in each of the first three years, and 16 staff-weeks in the last year, reflecting
the need for ensuring that the participating banks properly learn and implement subprojects, including
conducting proper environment assessments and following acceptable procurement and disbursement
procedures
15.       Project Sustainability. This project has been designed to provide an integrated approach
to financial sector strengthening. Since the project will provide not only loan funds, but also long-tenm
capital to stabilize the participating banks, and technical assistance to develop and strengthen bank lending
and operational skills, it is envisioned that after this project is completed, the participating banks will be
able to continue applying their new skills and will have a strong capital base which wii. allow them to
-ontinue to effectively channel investment lending.
16.       Agreements Reached at Negotiations. Agreement was reached at negotiations on the
overall stucturing of the loan and its implementation, including agreements to ensure that the PIU will
be appropriately staffed during the lifetime of the project, and on reporting requirements, procurement
arrangements, disbursement arrangements, and a project supervision plan. Conditions of the loan were
also finalized at negotiations.
17.       Environmental Aspect. As a category "B' project involving internediary lending, an
environmental screening mechanism is being set up for projects financed by the credit line. Since Bank
environmental staff have reviewed enviromnental legislation and regulations in Estonia and found them
to be adequate, the primary environmental emphasis of this project will be to ensure that these laws and
regulations are properly followed. Environmental staff have been involved in preparing technical
assistance to train commercial bank staff in proper environmental screening processes and to strengthen
the Ministry of Environment's Environmental Assistance Board.
18.       Program Objective Categories. This project relates directly to the Bank's objective to
support Private Sector Development Currently, one of the biggest impediments to the growth of new
businesses, and to the restructuing of newly privatizated enterprises is the lack of long-term investment
funds.  This project will both provide long term fimds for investment, and will provide technical
assistance to help the banks in assessing the viability of proposed investment sub-projects.
19.       Project Benefits. The project will: (i) improve efficient allocation of resources by
improving the intermediation capabilities of the banking sector, (ii) increase the stability of the banking
sector, which will lead to greater mobilization of fimds; (iii) increase long-term investment by providing



-5-
critically needed long-term funds to the enterprise sector which will in tum improve the productivity of
private enterprises by providing tchnology and capital goods, and (iv) provide an incentive for
privatization by targeting investnent finding toward private companies.
20.        Risks. Among the possible risks are changes in the political environment which might make
it difficult for the Govemment to sustain the progwn of macroeconomic stabilization and which -might
slow down the progress towards a fully-fledged market-based economy. - Changes in financial policies or
deterior.tion in the investment climate could cause the performance of sub-borrowes under the line of
credit to deteriorate, which could then increase defaults. Finally, the abilit of the banks tn absolb the
long-term finds is limited. This is particularly true in Estonia, where additional fimds will be made
available through an IMP STF facility and the EU/G-24 progran. However, this project, which also
includes capital injections- (inter -alia, in the form of equity) is designed to help the Estonian banks
properly absorb this funding.
21.        Recommendadon.. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
