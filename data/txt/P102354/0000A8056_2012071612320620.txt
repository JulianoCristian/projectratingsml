                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation has improved significantly during the last 6 months which is translated by: (i) visible capacity improvement of communal councils members met during the supervision
                         and their ownership of the local activities of the Project and (ii) critical increase in Micro Projects (MPs) implemented both at commune and community levels thanks to the country's
                         current favorable institutional environment and good disbursement rates both on IDA funding (98.19%) and GEF funding (96.1%). Moreover, the Project has been able to adopt the
                         required flexibility to respond to this year challenges symbolized by the Libyan crisis which resulted in the return of about 210,000 repatriates in Niger and the final harvest deficit
                         estimated up to 700,000 tons in food staples production resulting of a bad 2011 rainy season. The overall contribution of the Project to the crisis mitigation has been estimated to CFA
                         1.8 billion (about US$ 3,600,000 equivalent) mostly spent on creating or consolidating Cereal Bank networks and SLM agenda using the Cash for Wok. The PDO and IP are both
                         Satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The IFAD and the Bank teams have agreed with the government to: (i) pursue regular implementation support missions, prepare an anticipated Bank ICR and (ii) promote
                         consolidating activities for sustainability of the project's results. On the Bank side, catch up on safeguards compliance of MPs completed before the MTR remains a specific concern
                         although the critical mass of MPs realized from early 2011 to date are in full safeguards compliance. The Bank team and the GoN confirmed their mutual agreement for a third phase
                         preparation of the project. It has been agreed that preparation should start by October 2012 the latest, and to accelerate it following streamline processing to avoid any disruption
                         between the second and the third phase.
