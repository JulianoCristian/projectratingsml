                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation speed has remained quite normal despite the particular circumstances in the country characterized by political transition which resulted in the abolition of the
                         network of elected mayors and municipal councils at the local level. Despite this, the transitional structures in place including the local level ones have allowed progress in
                         implementing the Project and getting satisfactory results. Overall Implementation is moderately satisfactory
