1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives, and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Poverty and agriculture. By most measures, Niger has long been, and still is, among the
world’s poorest countries. More than half of its people (59.5 percent) live below the poverty
threshold. In rural areas, where about 84 percent of the population lives, 63.9 percent are poor. The
Government of Niger does not view poverty simplistically as the result of low income levels but
rather as the result of widespread lack of access to food, clean water, natural resources, medical
care, education, financing, and other economic and social services — factors that have cause Niger
to place among the lowest-ranking countries in the United Nations’ Human Development Index.1

2.      Agriculture (including livestock production) remains the cornerstone of Niger’s economy
and provides more than 80 percent of rural income, yet pressure on Niger’s limited area of fertile
land has intensified, owing to the combined effects of rapid population growth, southward
migration in response to droughts, and the scarcity of employment opportunities outside
agriculture. Alongside Niger’s unfavorable climatic conditions for agriculture, at the time of
appraisal for this project, the biggest obstacles to agricultural and rural development in Niger were:
(i) weak market access; (ii) weak capacity for processing agricultural products; (iii) insecure land
tenure; (iv) poor access to key services (rural finance, agricultural research, knowledge and
information systems, and technical services); and (v) low private investment to expand irrigated
agriculture, improve rainfed farming systems, and intensify livestock production. In this context,
the central challenge is to modernize the agricultural, forestry, and livestock sectors rapidly,
sustainably, and in line with the government’s rural growth and poverty reduction objectives.

3.      Natural resource base. The condition of the natural resource base is integral to any effort to
increase economic growth and reduce poverty. Only one-eighth of Niger’s land is arable, and it is
fragile and declining in quality. Given periodic drought, the downward trend in rainfall, and the
encroachment of the Sahara, perhaps no country in the world is at greater risk of desertification.
Presently some 85 percent of the population inhabits a narrow corridor about 100–150 kilometers
north of Niger’s border with Nigeria. Pressure on the diminishing natural rangelands and water
resources in the south has made these resources less productive. Although the Sahel’s indigenous
flora and fauna are well adapted to its erratic and harsh climate, biodiversity is still under threat as
indigenous and other species used for food, fodder, household energy, medicine, veterinary
products, and construction material are overexploited.

4.      Administrative setup and services in the country. The central government and
administration are adequately developed, yet the administrative setup in regions, departments, and
lower-level administrative units is seriously underdeveloped. To develop an administrative
structure that reflects democratic approaches and to improve the provision of services to the
population, since 1999 the Government of Niger has taken important steps toward full
decentralization. The 1999 Constitution explicitly provided for decentralization. Gradually new
legislation supported that process—particularly the Decentralization Law, which created 265
municipalities (communes)—and since 2004 Niger has held a series of municipal elections. The

                                                             1
communes’ mandates include planning local development activities, managing natural resources,
developing land registration, taking responsibility for social services (such as schools, health
services, and the provision of potable water), and promoting agriculture and livestock.
Implementation of the Decentralization Law had been constrained, however, by: (i) the
government’s inadequate implementation of decrees to improve the decentralization framework;
(ii) the inadequate transfer of competencies from the central government to communes; (iii) the
inadequate provision for human resources—administrative and technical staff for local
governments—and for legal control over local government activities; (iv) the difficulty of tapping
tax resources at the local level; and (v) the difficulty of mobilizing adequate human resources in
the decentralized technical services mandated to provide technical support and advisory services
to the communal councils.

5.      The government’s strategy and the rationale for Bank/Global Environment Facility (GEF)
assistance. The Government of Niger initiated several reforms to reduce poverty. At appraisal for
this project, the government had adopted its Rural Development Strategy and second Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRSP II), which were the bases for the government’s economic, financial, and
social policies for 2008–12. PRSP II sought to reduce rural poverty from 60.7 percent in 2006 to
42 percent by 2012. The Rural Development Strategy contained three strategic objectives for
promoting sustainable economic and social development and decentralized service delivery:
         Promote the rural population’s economic opportunities.
         Prevent risks and improve food security and the management of natural resources in a
            sustainable manner.
         Build the capacities of public institutions and rural organizations.

6.      In addition, the government has ratified the main Multilateral Agreements on the
Environment, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the United Nations
Climate Change Convention, and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. It has
established a strategic action plan to fight desertification, adapt to climate change, and protect
biodiversity.

7.      Rationale for the World Bank. In full alignment with the Government of Niger’s poverty
reduction programs, the World Bank’s 2008–11 Country Assistance Strategies focused on
strengthening investments in infrastructure and the productive sectors of rural areas to accelerate
growth and reduce poverty. In that context, the Community Action Program (CAP) was seen as the
main tool in the Bank’s portfolio to reduce poverty and decentralize administration. The program
was designed as an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to be implemented over 12 years, divided into
3 phases of 4 years each. The first phase, which became effective on December 11, 2003,
successfully met its objectives, helping Niger to: (i) design and put in place decentralized,
participatory, and transparent mechanisms to enable rural communities and local governments to
implement their own development plans and (ii) promote integrated community management of
ecosystems and improve the environment in many ways.

8.     The experience gained in successfully implementing CAP heightened the interest of local
development programs and development partners in continuing support for the program.
Continued funding for CAP would make it possible to scale up the program’s interventions to
expand decentralization and would also help to mitigate frequent food security crises through


                                                2
cereal banks, seed banks, food- and cash-for-work programs, and activities linked with food
production. A second phase of CAP also allowed the Bank, in conjunction with the GEF, to play a
leading role in promoting the government’s and the Bank’s joint environmental goals and
sustainable land management approaches and to act in line with the broader framework of the
TerrAfrica partnership agenda.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

9.      The PDO for the second phase of CAP (CAP 2) was to improve rural communes’ capacity
to design and implement Commune Development Plans and Annual Investment Plans in a
participatory manner and therefore to contribute to enhancing rural livelihoods. CAP 2 was to
achieve that objective by empowering and building the capacity of communes and grassroots
communities to improve the management of local governments (including administrative,
budgetary, and fiscal management and participatory planning, monitoring, and evaluation); to
invest in income-generating activities; and to scale up sustainable land and natural resource
management activities. The beneficiaries themselves would propose and implement most of the
program’s activities.

10.    The project would monitor progress based on three PDO outcome indicators:
        The percentage of communes in which more than 50 percent of the population was
          satisfied with the implementation of the Commune Development Plan through the
          Annual Investment Plan.
        The percentage of targeted communes that increased the rate of coverage of social
          services by more than 2 percent in one of three sectors: education, health, and potable
          water.
        The percentage of beneficiaries in income-generating activities whose income
          increased by 30 percent.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

11.    The global environment objectives were to reduce land degradation and promote
sustainable land management in Niger, in order to improve human well-being, increase the
productivity of local and global ecosystem services for agricultural production, increase vegetative
cover on crop and range lands, and promote carbon sequestration.

12.    The key GEO indicators were:
          The percentage of targeted communes in which more than 200 additional hectares of
           land were protected and reclaimed.
          The percentage of targeted communes setting up land tenure commissions that started
           delivering land titles.




                                                 3
1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

13.    The PDO was not revised. The key indicators also remained the same, although the project
employed numerous other indicators for implementation and management (see Annex 2).
14.
1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

15.     The GEOs were not revised. The key indicators also remained the same, although CAP 2
employed numerous other indicators for implementation and management (see Annex 2). The
target for the additional hectares of land to be protected and reclaimed was reduced at midterm to
better correspond with the funds available.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

16.     The program’s beneficiaries did not change during its second phase. CAP 2 continued to
target rural communities, essentially focusing on reducing poverty among the poor and vulnerable
and improving the rural environment. Given that stronger institutions were considered critical to
the development of rural communities, CAP 2 sought to strengthen the capacity of decentralized
administrative structures. CAP 2 investments targeted public as well as private service providers
and built their capacity to deliver basic services to rural communities.

17.    The International Development Association (IDA) funding was augmented by US$ 4.67
million from the GEF Trust Fund, which helped to provide institutional support for promoting
sustainable land management to reduce land degradation in Niger.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

18.     The project had three components: (a) capacity building; (b) Local Investment Funds; and
(c) project coordination, management, monitoring, and evaluation.

19.    A. Capacity Building (US$ 7.63 million). Component A aimed to: (i) improve the ability
of communes and communities to engage in participatory planning and to design, implement, and
manage microprojects and (ii) improve the institutional and legal framework for local and
community development and decentralization of government administration. Component A had
two subcomponents.

20.     Subcomponent A1. Capacity building for communes and communities. This subcomponent
was to finance activities to strengthen the administrative, technical, and fiscal capacity of selected
communes to handle their institutional mandates as stipulated in the Decentralization Law and to
use decentralized and participatory procedures in planning, designing, implementing, and
managing their own development, through efficient partnerships with grassroots communities.
Subcomponent A1 supported capacity-building activities specifically designed for the communes
and local authorities involved. Among other things, the subcomponent financed: (i) preparation of
a communication strategy to help beneficiaries understand CAP 2’s objectives and intervention



                                                  4
mechanisms and to share good practices and tools adapted to communities’ training in their roles
and responsibilities, including local governance control; and (ii) a better understanding of
decentralization laws among elected officials and local stakeholders.

20.   This subcomponent also directed resources to sustainable land and natural resource
management at the local level by training communal and community stakeholders and setting up
communal land tenure committees (Commissions Foncières Communales).

21.     Subcomponent A2: Capacity building for the institutional and legal framework on
community development. This subcomponent was to finance studies, training, study tours, and
workshops for key ministries and national institutions involved in decentralization, community
development, and income generation in the rural sector, such as the Ministries of Interior, Public
Security and Decentralization (Ministère de l’Intérieur, de la Sécurité Publique et de la
Décentralisation); Planning and Community Development (Ministère de l’Administration
Territoriale et du Développement Communautaire); Agriculture; and Livestock. Funds were also
reserved for the Executive Secretariat of the Rural Development Strategy Unit to set up and
operate an effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for integrated management of the
unit’s various programs, and for the High Commission for State Modernization
(Haut-Commissariat à la Modernisation de l’Etat, HCME) to clarify, update, and finalize legal
texts on local governance, intergovernmental transfers, and fiscal decentralization. An important
implementation partner was the Ministry of Environment and the Fight against Desertification
(Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre la Désertification), whose tasks included
supervising the implementation of sustainable land management activities and the development of
a land use and natural resources management plan.

22.     B. Local Investment Fund (US$ 31.80 million). This component sought to improve
livelihoods in rural communities by financing a Local Investment Fund that channeled grants to
communes and grassroots communities to support socioeconomic microprojects as well as
activities to generate income and manage land and other natural resources. A central principle of
CAP 2 was that communities and communes would determine how to use the Local Investment
Fund grant for any sound microproject they deemed important, as long as it was part of a locally
prepared development plan that had been designed in a participatory manner.

23.     Given that the Government of Niger had started to set up a decentralized “basket”
mechanism to fund local and community development (through establishment of the Agence du
Financement des Collectivités Locales), the Local Investment Fund’s resources were expected to
be transferred directly into the communes’ budgets and managed using public accounting
principles. The CAP 2 midterm review was to assess progress and readiness of the basket-funding
mechanism for channeling the relevant IDA funds.

24.      C: Project Coordination, Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (US$ 4.87
million). Component C aimed to support the project’s administrative and financial management as
well as a results-based M&E system to measure CAP 2’s performance and impact. The project’s
institutional arrangements consisted of a Steering Committee, a National Coordination Unit
(Cellule de Coordination National, CCN), and a Regional Coordination Unit (Cellule de
Coordination Régionale, CCR) in each of Niger’s eight regions. Approval Committees for



                                                5
microprojects would be established at the regional level as well. GEF funds were to help
coordinate cross-cutting, sustainable land and natural resource-related activities, including
communication initiatives on environmental programs.

1.8 Revised Components

25.    The components were not revised.

1.9 Other Significant Changes

26.    Niger suffered a series of disasters (droughts and floods) during the implementation of
CAP 2. The government requested the project to support the following relief interventions, with
supplementary funding from different sources:
         West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (Projet d’Amélioration de la
           Productivité Agricole en Afrique de l’Ouest, PPAAO).
         Emergency Food Security and Rural Development Program (Programme d’Urgence
           de Sécurité Alimentaire et de Développement Rural, PUSADER).
         Community Action Program for Climate Resilience (Programme d’Action
           Communautaire pour la Résilience Climatique, PAC/RC).

27.    The project also supported implementation of the government’s relief provision
agreements with the World Food Programme (specifically, CAP 2 supported construction of more
than 150 cereal banks across Niger). The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
joined CAP 2 one year after it started.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

28.     CAP 2 moved rapidly from concept (March 2008) to Board approval (August 2008). The
multisectoral task team involved in preparing the project reflected CAP 2’s cross-sectoral
orientation. The background analysis for CAP 2 was sound, benefiting not only from knowledge
gained under CAP 1 but from the lessons learned through a previous pilot operation, a
community-driven development project, and other projects within and outside Niger. From these
related operations, CAP 2 incorporated lessons involving decentralization, institutional
development, local/community investment funds, and M&E. In particular, the design of CAP 2
sought to build on the lessons, momentum, and good practices of CAP 1 by incorporating
interventions to enhance beneficiaries’ sense of ownership and involvement, promote the
alignment of local development and sectoral priorities, and ensure flexibility to adjust to changing
circumstances. A major lesson from CAP 1 was the considerable energy and commitment that
women’s groups (in relation to all-male or mixed groups) could deliver to the program with respect
to financial and in-kind contributions. The government strongly supported the approaches
proposed for CAP 2, which enhanced the efficiency of preparing the project. These design
elements—particularly the flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances—proved invaluable
during implementation to cope with unanticipated shortfalls in staffing, a complex M&E system,


                                                 6
and the optimistic target for recovering land and monitoring the environmental plans for
microprojects.

29.     Key risks were identified appropriately at appraisal, except for the risk regarding the
“capacity of central and decentralized government services and local authorities to carry out their
(increased) duties.” That risk was estimated as moderate but proved to be high, because
government inaction delayed the start of CAP 2, and capacity at the field level was overestimated
as well as adversely affected by a series of unforeseeable changes in local leadership. The
heightened risk was mitigated by the effective implementation support missions and midterm
review, as well as timely action by the Government of Niger and World Bank. The mitigating
measures for all of the other risks proved to be appropriate.

2.2 Implementation

30.     The project’s structure did not change in the course of implementation, although
adjustments, especially in staffing, were required. The large number of provinces and communities
added to CAP 2, along with initial delays in establishing the full complement of staff, were
reflected in the pace of implementation at first. Implementation picked up swiftly once the staff
was in place and was completed within the planned four-year period, even as the project
satisfactorily implemented several new elements to support disaster relief (Section 1.8). The
midterm review in the third year of the project judged performance to be “moderately
satisfactory,” an assessment that reflected reservations related to environmental and social
safeguards for microprojects and to the M&E system.

31.    Several factors contributed to successful implementation of CAP 2, chiefly:
        The Bank and government showed flexibility in augmenting staff strength, particularly
          for project coordination, monitoring, and evaluation. When government staff numbers
          proved insufficient to implement the project in the regions and communes, staff
          numbers within the project and government were increased.
        As noted, a timely midterm review and regular supervision missions provided effective
          guidance and feedback to the implementing authorities.
        An experienced project management team was integral to success. Although the team
          members, especially the regional coordinators, were assembled late, all had been
          working in similar projects. They rapidly established work plans and engaged in
          effective troubleshooting to bring implementation up to speed.
        A report-based financial management and disbursement system allowed quarterly
          disbursement of funds from the Bank, which enabled implementation to continue
          despite political instability. That course of action would not have been an option under
          the invoice-based system formerly in place.

32.   To a considerable extent, these efforts and systems eased the emerging impediments to
implementation:
       Political upheavals (a military coup and two elections) created general uncertainty and
          a precarious macroeconomic environment. A particular issue for CAP 2 was that the
          councils and administration of the communes were changed three times, necessitating
          much more advocacy and training than anticipated.


                                                7
                During two of the project years, Niger was hit by drought and extensive flooding; both
                 calamities seriously hampered rural economic activities.
                Political interference in the recruitment of senior project staff delayed the start of the
                 project by more than six months.
                Initial delays in the government’s counterpart funding affected staff salaries,
                 procurement of goods and consultant services, and payment of operating costs.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

33.      Design. The Results Framework for CAP 2 satisfactorily reflected World Bank guidelines
at the time of appraisal, setting out the program’s objectives, causal relationships, and underlying
assumptions about how program actions would lead to intended outcomes. The appraisal mission
also established the targets for each project year. CAP 1 ostensibly provided a reliable structure for
CAP 2’s M&E system, which included personnel at the CCN, one person in each of the regional
coordination centers, and the assistance of other staff members, each of whom would cover one or
two communes.

34.     M&E implementation. During implementation, these arrangements were adapted to rise to
the demands of tracking 17 indicators for project performance and 5 indicators for socioeconomic
data across 164 communes in 8 regions. The information gathered for M&E included not only
project-related data but also data normally collected by national statistical systems, such as
nutritional information for the general population and poverty levels in project communes and
communities. The data were collected at the village level, forwarded to the project’s
interdepartmental M&E units, passed to regional project offices, and then to the CCN. This system
(although workable under the predecessor project) proved challenging under the circumstances of
CAP 2, as noted in aide-memoires for the supervision missions and by the midterm review. In
response, additional M&E staff at the intermediate level, covering several communes (and
focusing on data collection and processing) were hired and trained, along with new commune
development assistants (not scheduled at appraisal). The additional training and personnel helped
to smooth a complex M&E process that involved many actors with varying degrees of capacity and
commitment. During the second half of the project, the M&E system consistently improved. By
the end of the project, the system efficiently produced the essential information for the
Implementation and Completion Report (ICR) and for preparing a third phase of the program.2

35.     Utilization. After midterm, the M&E system became a valuable source of information for
project management, the Steering Committee, and supervision missions. Implementation support
missions and project management alike found that the M&E system provided empirical data and
analyses to improve decision making. The quarterly and annual reports were supported with
adequate data and produced on time (especially after the midterm review). Because the M&E data
were somewhat broader than required for reporting solely on the performance indicators, they
were useful for implementation more generally.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



2
    See the annexes of this report and the information in the government’s ICR (Annex 7).


                                                                 8
36.      Safeguard policies. Based on environmental and safeguard assessments, CAP 2 was rated
a Category B project. The project triggered two safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment
(OP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). An Environmental Assessment identified
measures to mitigate negative environmental impacts that could arise from implementing some
microprojects. In response to these triggered policies, the project updated the existing
Environmental and Social Management Framework and prepared two new safeguard instruments,
a Resettlement Policy Framework and a Process Framework, to identify and address any potential
environmental, social, or resettlement issues, establish systems for consultation and redressing
grievances, identify potential environmental and social challenges and impacts, and specify how to
address them. Earlier concerns about land and natural resource management under CAP 1
microprojects appeared to be addressed by CAP 2 activities that were expected to reinforce
resource management.

37.     Even so, during first two years of implementation, some microprojects did not prepare
acceptable environmental and social studies. Following recruitment of an environmental and
social safeguard specialist and clarification (recommended by the midterm review) of the division
of labor between the project and the monitoring bureau of the Ministry of Environment (Bureau
d’Evaluation Environnementale et des Etudes d’Impact, BEEEI), the quality of the studies was
adequate. Thanks to extensive training of personnel at all levels, the environmental regulations of
CAP 2 have become well known, and no major problems have emerged.

38.     Fiduciary compliance. Throughout implementation, the financial management team
maintained up-to-date financial accounts and provided financial monitoring information to
management on a quarterly and annual basis. The project’s more recent annual audit reports were
all submitted on the due dates, had unqualified audit opinions, and were acceptable to IDA. The
quality of the financial management system of CAP 2 has been recognized by the government and
donors to the extent that they have placed financial management of other projects under the same
financial management group (with additional accounting staff). As mentioned, a novelty during
the project period was adoption of the Bank’s new report-based disbursement system, which
allowed project operations to continue even during periods when assistance to Niger was
suspended by the Bank.

39.     The expanded area and number of communes covered under CAP 2 required extensive
training in financial management and procurement for CAP 2 staff working in communes and for
community committee members. The frequent change of local governments considerably
exacerbated procurement problems in the field, resulting in a midterm rating of “moderately
satisfactory.” The problems were gradually overcome, and the last implementation support
mission rated procurement performance as “satisfactory.”

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

40.    Because implementation of CAP 2 accelerated during the second part of the project period
and the project’s funds were exhausted some six months before the closing date, the Government
of Niger and World Bank undertook to design and prepare for the third phase as speedily as
possible. The last implementation support mission for CAP 2 (October–November 2012) also
served as a preparation mission for CAP 3. The mission verified that the triggers required for



                                                9
moving to the next phase had been met, providing the basis for a third phase that would be
approximately the same size as the second. The Board approved CAP 3 on May 24, 2013.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

41.     The objectives, design, and contribution of the Community Action Program, of which CAP
2 was the middle part, continue to have high overall relevance. The government’s Strategy to
Accelerate Growth and Poverty Reduction for 2008–12 was based on seven “pillars,” five of
which had direct relevance for CAP 2.3 Bank assistance to Niger for 2008–12 supported all seven
of the government’s pillars and emphasized the role of CAP 2 as a primary means of accelerating
equitable, sustainable growth. The project also reflected the global objectives of GEF at appraisal.
It was an integral part of the Bank’s US$ 154 million rural development portfolio in Niger (2012).

42.    The latest policy document, the Economic and Social Development Plan 2012–2015 (Plan
de Développement Economique et Social, PDES), describes the current sectoral policies and the
Prime Minister’s policy statements. As the sole reference framework for social and economic
development in the covered period, both for the government and its technical and financial
partners, PDES confirms that internal and external efforts should focus on: (i) food security; (ii)
governance and security; (iii) human capital development; and (iv) infrastructure development.
These priorities are fully consistent with the objectives, design, and implementation principles of
CAP 2. The Government of Niger has positioned CAP 3 as the main instrument for implementing
its 3N initiative (les Nigériens nourrissent les Nigériens), 4 underscoring the continued high
relevance of the program’s objectives and design.

43.     The World Bank’s most current strategic document on Niger (La Banque mondiale au
Niger; Consultations pour l’élaboration de la Stratégie de partenariat Niger – Banque mondiale,
October 2012) acknowledges shortcomings in education and health, underscores the need to
develop Niger’s human resources, and details the population’s vulnerability to climatic variability.
Rural development remains a key challenge for Niger’s overall development, including the
regeneration of ecosystems and reclamation of degraded land for economic development. In
financing a third phase of the Community Action Program, the Bank has highlighted the program’s
centrality to its assistance strategy in Niger, and it is working closely with France, Germany,
Switzerland, Luxemburg, the European Union, African Development Bank, the Islamic
Development Bank, United Nations agencies, and others to further support implementation of
Niger’s decentralization, rural development, and natural resource management strategies.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives



3
  The pillars were: (i) pursuit of strong, diversified, sustainable, and equitable growth that creates jobs; (ii) development of infrastructure;
(iii) creation of equitable access to quality social services; (iv) the empowerment and social protection of women; and (v) promotion of
good governance and capacity building.

44.     IDA-financed components. The key performance indicators of CAP 2 remained unchanged
throughout the project period; stated simply, the goal was to improve rural communes' capacity to
design and implement Commune Development Plans and Annual Investment Plans in a
participatory manner and thus to enhance rural livelihoods. The achievement of the PDO is
measured by three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), while that of the Global Environmental
objectives were assessed by 2 KPIs, all of which CAP 2 succeeded in achieving. The project’s
investments helped strengthen capacity in rural institutions and improved rural livelihoods. Local
government structures, particularly at the commune and community levels, acquired substantial
capacity in planning, implementing, and monitoring projects derived from their local development
and investment plans. The microprojects also significantly improved the rural poor’s access to
social services such as schools and health centers and provided opportunities to engage in
income-generating activities that improved their livelihoods.. The following section assesses the
achievement of agreed PDO performance indicators (each key indicator had several subindicators;
see Annex 2).

Targets and achievements of KPIs:
 Target: More than 50 percent of the population was to be satisfied with the way the Communal
   Development Plans (CDP) had been implemented using the Annual Investment Plans (PAI).
   End result: 92 percent of the population in target communities were satisfied;
 Target: More that 60 percent of the beneficiaries were to augment their income though
   revenue-generating activities. End result: 75 percent of the beneficiaries succeeded in doing
   so;
 Target: More than 50 percent of the communes were to have increased by at least 2 percent in
   their education, health or drinking water services. End result: 65 percent of communes for the
   education sector, 55 percent for the health sector, and 83 percent for drinking water had
   reached the required improvement;
 Target: At least 60 percent of environmentally targeted communes were expected to protect
   and improve 200 hectares or more of land. End result: 72 percent of targeted communes had
   reached this level;
 Target: All 164 targeted communes were to have functioning land registration committees.
   End result: 99 percent of communes had established these commissions and they had started to
   process land transactions;

sustainable land management in Niger, leading to improved human well-being and increased
provision and productivity of local and global ecosystem services for agricultural production,
increased vegetative cover on crop and range lands, and carbon sequestration. Table 2 indicates the
achievement of key indicators (each indicator had several subindicators; see Annex 2).5

46.     Causal linkages. The project’s achievements provide appropriate evidence that the
objectives for both its Bank-financed and GEF-financed activities were met. Causal linkages
between the objectives and components have also proved to be rational: Without ministerial
collaboration and the successful establishment of decentralized government administrations to
deliver services, without building capacity to better manage local governments, and without
investing in socioeconomic activities, it would have been impossible to implement participatory
commune development plans or to carry out social, economic, and environmental microprojects at
the local level. All stakeholder groups and persons contacted (including the regional,
departmental, and commune officials and beneficiaries in Tillabéry and Dosso) agreed with this
conclusion in discussions with the ICR team.

3.3 Efficiency

47.     Under CAP 2, most project funds went to build capacity that supported local governments
and social microprojects, which does not lend itself to reliable economic analysis. Primarily for
that reason, the CAP 2 appraisal mission did not perform an economic analysis or calculate a
financial rate of return for the project as a whole. Nor did the appraisal mission consider it feasible
to forecast the types of microproject investments and perform an economic assessment on that
basis, because the microprojects were to be demand-driven, chosen in accordance with the
priorities of the local population.


5
 Note that one subindicator—the area of improved land (above the area to be planted with Acacia trees)—was modified from
24,000 hectares to 8,000 hectares at midterm to correspond to the funds available. The revised target was essentially achieved.


                                                               12
48.     Instead, as a basis for estimating the internal rate of return (IRR) for the CAP 2 economic
microprojects, the appraisal mission reviewed the analysis of the profitability of agriculture in the
Action Plan of Niger’s Rural Development Strategy, which used models based on five-hectare
farms in the different regions of Niger. The appraisal team also reviewed an analysis prepared for
the ICR of CAP 1, which estimated the financial returns under one component, the Local
Investment Fund, based on a 2007 study of the profitability of microprojects that was organized by
the Project Coordination Unit and Ministry of Agriculture. Using those two studies—probably the
most relevant information at the time—the appraisal mission estimated that the IRR for CAP 2’s
economic microproject subcomponent was likely to be 25–27 percent for investments in
agriculture as well as livestock, when computed over a10-year period.

49.   No cost or financial analysis was done at appraisal on microprojects or areas to be covered
by GEF activities, apart from the Net Present Value (NPV) and IRR calculations in the CAP 1
ICR.

50.     For the same reasons that applied at the appraisal of CAP 2, at its completion no economic
or financial analyses were attempted for the project as a whole. Instead, as recommended by the
ICR mission team, project authorities organized a separate review of the financial results and an
economic analysis of the revenue-generating microprojects, based on actual outcomes. CAP 2
management and the Ministry of Agriculture conducted the analysis with the help of the National
Institute of Statistics (Institute Nationale de Statistiques, INS). The detailed results are presented in
Annex 3.

51.      In brief, the financial analysis of microprojects showed that all types of microprojects
(except village grain mills) are sufficiently or even highly profitable investments, with an internal
financial rate of return (FRR) varying from 23 percent to 61 percent.6 Because cereal banks
accounted for nearly one-half of all revenue-generating microprojects—285 of a total 627
microprojects were for cereal banks, and they had a 31 percent FRR—and because most of the
other microprojects have even higher FRRs than the cereal banks (except for some 40
microprojects involving grain mills, stocking of fish ponds, and irrigation/garden sites for
women), the ICR mission estimated that the overall FRR for revenue-generating microprojects
probably exceeded 30 percent. The cost of in-kind contributions was not included in the
computations—the opportunity cost of labor was assumed to be very little—so the FRR would be
reduced by a few percentage points if some value for labor were included. The economic analysis
of microprojects provided results very similar to those for the financial analysis (Annex 3). The
initial appraisal mission’s estimations of the FRR and ERR at 25–27 percent appear to have been
validated by the INS study.




6
  The FRR for grain mills varied from –1 to +4 percent. The nonmonetary benefits—in particular, the alleviation of drudgery for
women—may justify investments in these mills in some cases, however, as long as their use is maximized and the cost involved for reducing
drudgery is understood and accepted by the population using them.


                                                              13
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

52.     Taking into consideration the relevance of the PDO, project design, and implementation;
achievement of the development objectives; and evidence of efficiency, the overall project
outcome for both the IDA- and GEF-financed activities is rated Satisfactory. All key performance
indicators were fully achieved, and most exceeded their targets. These achievements were
obtained within a reasonable budget and with a high level of efficiency. Some of the reasons
supporting a rating of satisfactory or better include:
         Project objectives—both PDO and GEF objectives—remain highly relevant in the
           current economic and environmental context, particularly considering the impossibility
           of achieving the developmental and environmental goals of such a large country as
           Niger without decentralization and improved local development capacity (Section 3.1).
         The development objectives and all important output targets were achieved and/or
           exceeded in many cases (Section 3.2 and Annex 2).
         The Bank’s implementation support and midterm review missions, plus the flexibility
           shown by the government and the Bank, permitted timely and effective modifications
           during implementation (Section 2.1 and Annex 6).
         The partial financial and economic analyses, covering the revenue-generating
           microprojects, were positive (Section 3.3).


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

53.     The extent of the project’s general impact on poverty in project areas was not measured
(that task corresponds to the INS), but based on project studies and the monitoring system, the
incomes of the roughly 358,800 beneficiaries of the 627 economic microprojects financed under
CAP 2 have increased by more than 30 percent. Also, CAP 2 benefited the poorest through its
food- or cash-for-work programs, implemented with GEF funds for 472 environmental
microprojects. This action was especially important during the two years in the project period
when natural disasters occurred. The very poorest also benefited through the social microprojects
that improved their access to education, health services, and potable water. The Bank’s earlier
economic sector work on the impacts of sustainable land management programs on land
management practices, agricultural production, and poverty in Niger also have demonstrated
favorable economic impacts of several land management practices.

54.     CAP 2 gave special attention to reaching women and young people and to monitoring the
approval of microprojects by planners and decision makers in accordance with guidelines to that
effect. Slightly more than one-half of the beneficiaries of revenue-generating microprojects were
women (some 241,000, or 50.43 percent)—a substantial increase from CAP 1, in which women
were one-quarter of all beneficiaries. Young people, male and female, represented about 30
percent of the beneficiaries of revenue-generating microprojects. Many localities (especially those
where women actively presented themselves as candidates) reached the target of ensuring that
one-third of the members of elected bodies in communes, communities, and microproject



                                                14
committees were women. Regional disparities in women’s representation were attributed mainly
to insufficient education, family traditions, or prevailing customs.

55.     The project substantially influenced social development in CAP 2 communes and
communities by building and equipping schools, improving access to potable water, and building
and improving health centers. The targets set at appraisal were exceeded (see Annex 2). According
to stakeholders, the economic and natural resource microprojects, particularly the carbon
sequestration program, gave considerable help to young people by providing income, giving them
new opportunities to show their initiative, and ultimately encouraging them to stay in the
countryside. Stakeholders also indicated that the microprojects encouraged women to play a more
prominent role in local decision making, although that role has yet to reach substantial dimensions
in the commune councils.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

56.      Stakeholders affirmed to the ICR mission that CAP 2 was the main financial instrument for
decentralizing public administration and services to 110 new communes and helping to
consolidate earlier achievements in 54 communes (altogether, 65 percent of the total). Aside from
facilitating a sound basis for decentralization by helping to finance the development of a legal
framework, CAP 2 had three other important institutional achievements. First, it helped communes
(in many cases for the first time) to prepare development and investment plans; second, it built
capacity to enable communes to continue preparing and managing investment plans in subsequent
years; third, it enabled them to carry out other commune and community functions more efficiently
than before. The communal land commissions and community-based microproject management
committees will probably prove to be valuable additions to local institutions and encourage
longer-term development and sustainability of investments. All groups of stakeholders agreed that
without the Community Action Program these developments would not have been possible (see
further discussions in Section 3.6 and Annex 6).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

57.    CAP 2 proved to be a flexible instrument for implementing emergency programs to reduce
the negative effects of two national disasters (drought and excessive flooding). The program
helped to alleviate serious food shortages among a substantial part of the population: 64,000
persons under a special government program in 2011 and 432,500 persons under the
environmental program financed by GEF and cash-for-work assistance.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

58. Annex 6 of this report presents results of the stakeholder workshop and beneficiary survey.
The ICR mission held workshops with three groups of stakeholders: private-sector service
providers, the donor community, and regional coordinators of CAP 2. In addition, the mission
interviewed large numbers of other stakeholders individually or in small groups (see Annex 6,
Attachment 1). Annex 6 reports the results of those discussions, which covered the project’s major
achievements, problem areas, and lessons. Stakeholders identified the following highlights
(lessons suggested by stakeholders are incorporated in Section 6, “Lessons Learned”).



                                                15
               Most workshop participants expressed appreciation for the program’s achievements in
                the field and appreciation for the work of their own organizations. All stakeholders
                strongly endorsed the program’s general approach. They confirmed that CAP is known
                throughout Niger as an important project and that it is valuable for the country’s
                socioeconomic development.
               CAP 2 experienced a problematic start, partly because of political interference.
                Although the project was signed within the standard time period after World Bank
                approval, it took several months to nominate and approve the staff and for the project to
                become active. Political instability also impeded implementation; during the four-year
                program period, local governments turned over three times. Because of this turnover,
                substantial additional training was needed, and decisions at the departmental and
                commune levels were delayed.
               CAP 2 helped to finance the drafting and approval of laws, decrees, action plans, and
                operational manuals required to decentralize decision making and to implement local
                development plans. Local beneficiaries emphasized the importance of microprojects,
                such as health centers, classrooms for schools, revenue-generating investments,
                administration buildings at the commune level, and environmental activities that
                generated income (such as the cash-for-work program) when natural disasters or other
                calamities removed other sources of income.
               CAP 2 helped to improve the effectiveness of the government’s technical ministries by
                providing the technical resources to support and monitor program activities at the
                regional, departmental, and local levels. It financed the creation of manuals and
                documents that were used widely in training and in implementing project activities.
               CAP 2 accelerated the establishment of land commissions, land registration, and
                sustainable land management. Other environmental improvements included reclaiming
                unproductive land, introducing Acacia senegal7 plantations, and carbon sequestration.
                A contract with the World Bank–administered bio-carbon fund was signed during CAP
                1, but no funds had been paid to Niger until CAP 2 was implemented. The program
                financed the hiring and training of more environmental staff and helped build capacity
                for systematic surveillance in the field.
               Substantial financial resources were allocated for the project, but most stakeholders
                observed that the resources could not entirely meet the need to strengthen local
                administrations and carry out the social and economic microprojects desired by the
                local populations, especially social investments in health centers, schools, and wells,
                but also revenue-creating investments in livestock and agriculture. Many stakeholders
                expressed the view that “more would be needed for everything” and “more funds
                would be needed to consolidate the achievements and reinforce the structures
                developed.”

59.     Rating: Moderate. The moderate risk rating for the IDA-financed activities reflects the
following assessment of the potential key sources of risks and the likely mitigating effect of
existing/likely arrangements.8

60.     Capacity to continue decentralization and to finance the targeted communes. Because the
triggers for moving to CAP 3 have been fulfilled, and because all stakeholders have a positive
attitude toward decentralization, there is little risk that decentralization will cease, but the prospect
that local communes cannot raise the funds necessary to provide services initiated through CAP 1
and CAP 2, even with central government contributions, is a clear cause for concern. This concern
is augmented by the newness and frequent changes of local elected bodies and the training of their
staffs, which remains limited. (As mentioned by stakeholders, more training and other forms of
capacity building are needed to “professionalize” the public- and private-sector stakeholders; see
Annex 6.) Factors mitigating such risks include: (i) the government’s clear commitment to
decentralization; (ii) the capacity building that has already taken place in target communes; (iii)
the plans to continue consolidating this achievement in target communes; (iv) legislation
(essentially completed) to improve taxation at the local level; and (v) the fact that communes have
already been able to improve their fund raising, albeit still in moderate amounts.

61.     Profitability and maintenance of microprojects. To be approved by the regional
committees, all economic microprojects had to have a financial analysis showing adequate
projected financial returns. As noted in Section 3.2, the analysis conducted at the end of CAP 2
showed that nearly all microprojects were profitable. The microprojects also have nonmonetary
benefits, but if the less profitable ones cannot improve their profitability, they must soon close or
find subsidies to continue. To mitigate the risks in this respect, CAP 2 promoted better budgeting
and budget control, in addition to establishing 821 microproject management committees (for
social and economic microprojects) and training their members. Management committees of many
microprojects still need to training, however, and some means must be developed to keep them all
active, to ensure good maintenance of microprojects, and to facilitate their continued use. For the
social microprojects, improved fund raising by communes, already mentioned, could provide
some relief.

62.     For GEF-financed investments, the risk rating is also Moderate, and the points just
mentioned for risks related to the economic microprojects also pertain to the natural resource
investments. For land recuperation and the planting of Acacia senegal, both very important
achievements during CAP 1 and CAP 2, an additional consideration is how to maintain the
population’s interest in these environmental microprojects after the trees and bushes have been
planted and water catchments have been completed. To encourage interest in long-term natural
resource management and environmental protection (including the maintenance of trees), it is not
only essential to continue building awareness in the population and providing training but to offer
concrete incentives (as environmental payments). Early payments from the World Bank–
administrated carbon sequestration fund could prove incentivizing, so they should have high
priority under CAP 3, especially given the disappointment over payment of those incentives
among the beneficiaries of GEF funds under CAP 2.

    Climatic uncertainty and variation probably present the greatest risk (see Annex 7, the government’s ICR).


                                                                 17
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory. The Bank intensely engaged with the Government of Niger in
designing, preparing, and implementing CAP 1 and CAP 2. In light of the government’s
poverty-reduction strategies at preparation, the objectives of the program and the project were
fully relevant at that time. The preparation and appraisal teams took into account the lessons
learned from previous projects in Niger, similar projects elsewhere in the Sahelian zone, and
recommendations emerging from the ICR of CAP 1 (including recommendations on equality
issues and the need to develop solutions to the maintenance and sustainability of microproject
investments). Possibly because the first phase of the program had been successful, the Bank did
not consider it necessary to carry out a quality-at-entry review of the project.

Although the risk assessment was generally appropriate (and the uncertainties arising from the
coup and subsequent election cycles could not have been anticipated), the appraisal mission
underestimated the risk associated with decentralizing government services and empowering local
authorities to implement and monitor the project, given the relatively small professional staff
available. The ICR mission attributed that shortcoming to the Bank’s policy of mainstreaming
project activities. Although mainstreaming is a desirable objective in principle, in Niger’s
circumstances, where local, autonomous administration just beginning to emerge, too much was
expected too soon. In the event, inadequate field organization before the program and the limited
public-sector resources and capacities initially available made it necessary to set up a separate
management/coordination unit for CAP 2. Fortunately, flexibility in increasing project and
government staffing, combined with other favorable factors in the course of implementation (see
Section 5.2), enabled the project to succeed in the end.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory. Supervision during the project period—aided by the presence of the Task
Team Leader at the Resident Mission office after the first year—was thorough. The seven missions
and the midterm mission contained a suitable mix of specialized skills, spread across the various
missions. The mission teams generally included several Bank staff or consultants. Government
ministries and agencies and other donors, such as IFAD, were always involved. The extensive
aide-memoires contained detailed surveys in their annexes, directed the CCN’s attention to
activities or processes requiring correction, and helped to assess the pace of implementation
overall. In particular, the midterm review mission and its report led to corrections in the original
understaffed project coordination units and the M&E system, thus making implementation
manageable and enabling it to remain focused on attaining the development objectives. The ratings
in Implementation Support Reports (ISRs) were generally candid and the Bank’s management
inputs appropriate. Preparation of CAP 3 was started early to ensure continuity of the program as
soon as possible after the project closed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

63.     Rating: Satisfactory. To recap, project preparation was smooth and fast. The project’s objective
was sound and clearly focused on activities aligned with the government’s agenda for decentralization and
management of environmental quality. The Bank was assiduous in supervising implementation and
offering appropriate guidance for improvement.


5.2 Borrower Performance

64.     Rating: Moderately satisfactory. The government was fully committed to the program.
The government had prepared a poverty reduction strategy and considered the CAP an important
vehicle for achieving the strategy’s objectives. The government also maintained a steering
committee from eight ministries to oversee the project (and numerous other programs and
projects), and this committee met regularly. In addition, the government:
         Organized a multidisciplinary team to prepare the project, supervised its design,
            acquired the funds to prepare the program (including funds from outside the World
            Bank and GEF—see Section 1.7), and generally demonstrated its commitment to the
            program.
         Acted promptly in making the project effective within the standard period after
            approval.
         Promoted policies and legislation that supported CAP objectives and implementation,
            especially related to the decentralization of government administration and services.
         Organized a parliamentary mission to verify implementation of the program and the
            new laws and decrees in the regions.
         Endorsed the recommendations of the supervision missions (for example, the
            recommendations to increase project staffing and modify disbursement categories),
            thus improving the performance of the project.
         Recruited experienced staff for the project period, facilitated the changes that were
            necessary (for example, providing consultants for activities with weak performance
            and appointing an environmental and social sector specialist to ensure that safeguard
            issues were addressed adequately), and mobilized human resources from different
            ministries to support the project’s operations.
         Ensured an early start for the transition arrangements for the next phase of the program.

65.     Three shortcomings partially offset the favorable factors just mentioned, however, and
result in the overall rating of “moderately satisfactory”:

      1. Political interference delayed the recruitment and appointment of the staff for CCN and
         the CCRs, causing a delay of more than six months in getting the project underway.
      2. A delay in paying the annual counterpart funds and failure to contribute part of the
         committed funds (nearly 50 percent) made it difficult for the project to implement the
         disbursement categories that the government was cofinancing. It is important to note,



                                                   19
          however, that the government improved its payment of counterpart funds toward the end
          of the project.
       3. The National Agency for Local Government Financing (Agence Nationale de
          Financement des Collectivités Territoriales, ANFCT), created in 2008, was slow to hire
          personnel and become active; staff recruitment was taking place during the ICR mission.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

66.     Rating: Satisfactory. The satisfactory rating for agency performance was based primarily
on the effective work of the CCN (the program coordination unit), CNRs (responsible for regional
coordination), and the Ministries of Decentralization and Agriculture,9 although several other
organizations and agencies helped to implement key activities of CAP 2.

67.      Factors that influenced performance positively included:
          Once the key personnel were in place, the CCN and field organization and service
            providers were recruited in all eight regions.
          A four-year program was implemented in three years (starting six months late and
            finishing six months before the official closing date), despite being implemented in a
            very large country with extensive poverty.
          A functioning local government was built from the ground up in 65 percent of Niger’s
            communes (164 of 252, including the communes under CAP 1).
          Targets were achieved and sometimes exceeded in an impressive number of activities,
            and additional assignments were undertaken in response to Niger’s food and
            environmental crises.
          A major tenet of the program’s strategy—local participation and consultation with all
            stakeholders and donors—was adhered to conscientiously, while emphasizing benefits
            for the more vulnerable segments of the population.
          M&E activities were conducted satisfactorily, providing all necessary information to
            the supervision, ICR, and CAP 3 preparation missions. Annual reports and financial
            statements were prepared on time, and the annual audits were unqualified.
          The planning, appraisal, and other arrangements for transition to CAP 3 began early.

68.    Operational problems that arose in the early stages of the project were gradually corrected.
They included problems related to the complex monitoring system, erroneous procurement
decisions, and poor filing of documents in the field, as well as inadequate safeguard plans by some
microprojects. Credit for achieving the project’s development objectives and exceeding many of
the operational targets largely belongs to CCN, the CCRs, and the supporting agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

69.     Rating: Satisfactory. A satisfactory rating for overall Borrower performance is justified
on the following bases:



9
  The Ministry of Agriculture was the main supervising ministry and its Secretary General the chairman of the Steering Committee
throughout the project period.


                                                              20
           The moderately satisfactory rating for the government’s performance is offset by the
            highly successful performance in project implementation once the delays in appointing
            staff to start project activities were resolved.
           The development outcome objectives were reached or exceeded, largely owing to the
            effectiveness of the CCN, CCRs, and support by government agencies.

6. Lessons Learned

70.     The experience gained and good results achieved through CAP 2 reaffirmed the principal
lesson of CAP 1, which is that bottom-up development, based on a community-driven approach, is
promising, although it is more complicated to implement than more traditional approaches. The
process is particularly difficult if public services and institutions outside the main cities are nascent
or nonexistent (as was the case in many of Niger’s communes). In such situations, success depends
on the enactment of appropriate policies and laws (for example, for land use and registration,
decentralization of government administration, and local revenue collection); the establishment or
strengthening of technical services (public and private); extensive education and capacity-building
programs at all levels, from the capital to villages; and good plans based on annual, long-term, and
gradual implementation schedules. More specific lessons are summarized next.

71.      A program implemented in several phases should avoid gaps and delays in initiating each
new phase. It is difficult to plan and design successive phases of a longer-term program to prevent
gaps from occurring between phases. As much as possible, however, such gaps should be avoided.
They not only interrupt the program but carry the risk that experienced staff will be lost. Many
activities started during an earlier phase may require consolidation during the subsequent phase. A
gap occurred between CAP 1 and CAP 2 because the government was slow to realize that the
project was nearing its end, and disputes arose over the selection of new staff. The gap between
CAP 2 and CAP 3 resulted from the accelerated implementation of CAP 2 and the full
disbursement of funds six months before the project officially closed. Between CAP 1 and CAP 2,
all staff had to be laid off; between CAP 2 and CAP 3, the government retained senior personnel to
look after other investments under the program.

72.     To realize the benefits of local participation, some guidance may be necessary. Local
participation is vital for involving people in their own development by discussing plans, agreeing
on priorities, and gaining an understanding of how to implement planned activities and monitor the
sustainability of their investments. Given full liberty to set microproject priorities, many
communes may identify the same priorities, possibly on the basis of a recent crisis (as occurred
under CAP 2, when most microprojects involved seed and grain banks). With limited funds
available, the cross-cutting contributions arising from different types of investments may be lost.
Although microprojects have been based in individual communes, many investments may be more
suited to intercommunal microprojects, such as investments in feeder roads, middle schools, health
centers, and even seed banks. Clear, simple procedures should be developed for such cases under
the next phase of the program. Adequate supplies to make microprojects effective, such as
medicines for health centers and textbooks for schools, should be included in microproject
packages.




                                                   21
73.     Readiness for mainstreaming should be judged objectively based on a readiness survey. It
is the policy of the Bank and the Government of Niger to integrate development projects gradually
into regular government activities and obviate the need for separate project coordination or
management units. That said, it is easy to underestimate the public sector human and financial
resources needed for an effective, countrywide, and multiministerial response to multiple
objectives (decentralization, socioeconomic development, participation of the population, and so
on). It is also easy to underestimate the additional strains that such integration may place on
overburdened government staff, who often lack the necessary training to carry out expanded
responsibilities. In Niger, the regional, departmental, and local administrators were not ready to
assume the tasks involved in implementing CAP 2 in addition to their normal duties, and
additional project-funded staff had to be recruited beyond the number estimated at appraisal.

74.     Ministerial collaboration is essential for complex projects. Complex projects like CAP 2
require collaboration among the ministries involved. It takes substantial time to develop such
linkages; in Niger, the relatively limited linkages among various public services were stronger in
the field than at the center. CAP 2 produced encouraging progress toward fostering better linkages
across public entities, although some stakeholders wondered why the Ministry of Agriculture
continued to be the supervising ministry, as only a relatively small part of the program provided
resources for agricultural development. The ICR mission noted that CAP 2 was more of a
decentralization and communal development project than an agricultural project, and it
recommended that the issue of the supervisory ministry be reviewed during the appraisal of CAP
3.

75.     Equity issues can be resolved through special programs and better targeting of
beneficiaries. Participation in the economic microprojects for CAP 1 required a contribution of
10–20 percent of microproject costs, making it impossible to accommodate the poorest people.
The more vulnerable groups (women, girls, and youth in general) were underrepresented among
the beneficiaries. Under CAP 2, special programs (undertaken with assistance from the
government and the World Food Programme) and better targeting were introduced to enable the
poorest and most vulnerable groups to participate, and the support for these groups increased
significantly. They benefited from more employment opportunities in constructing microprojects,
as well as from the increased number of social microprojects, such as health centers, improved
schools, commune halls, farm input stores, and collectively managed environmental
microprojects.

76.     Training and coaching is needed to empower stakeholders at all levels. Empowerment of
stakeholders at levels is integral to foster a sense of ownership and motivate community effort. The
project facilitated extensive training at all levels, but many stakeholders called for much more
training and other forms of capacity building to “professionalize” the public- and private-sector
stakeholders. The nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in providing services need
more training than CAP 2 was able to provide. When external resources are available, it is
relatively easy to organize training for the leaders, management committees, and ordinary
members of commune and government staff. It is more challenging to foster the kind of
entrepreneurship needed to operate an economically successful farmer organizations.
Entrepreneurial, economic, and commercial skills are not easily taught. They require not only




                                                22
classroom teaching but also follow-up instruction and coaching, often for years after the original
training.

77.      Incentives are needed to sustain environmental improvements. To interest people in
long-term natural resource management and environmental protection (including the maintenance
of trees), it is absolutely necessary to give them concrete incentives, such as food or cash for work,
and perhaps to be more “supply-driven.” Poor people struggling with survival frequently rank
microprojects with production benefits as a higher priority than natural resource management
microprojects. To ensure adequate interest, natural resource microprojects would benefit from
their own priority listing and separately allocated funds (as happened under CAP 2).10 A related
question is how to keep the population interested in areas reclaimed for economic use (a matter
that needs to be addressed under CAP 3). To improve efficiency, the public sector environmental
staff also needs incentives, such as transport, training, and allowances.

  Some peer reviewers reacted cautiously to a similar comment in the ICR for CAP 1.However, experience under CAP 2 indicates
that separate allocations for natural resource development increase the number of microprojects in that sector.

Note: The data in Table (a), Project Cost by Component, consist of IDA financing, the World Environmental Fund, the Government
of Niger, and the beneficiaries. The amount needed for Component C was originally underestimated; a reallocation of funds was
approved to transfer funds from the unallocated category and Component A to cover the gap. The overall utilization of funds (88
percent) reflects the changes between the United States dollar and SDR and the differences between the funds disbursed by the
financiers. The actual disbursements were as follows: IDA and the World Environmental Fund 99 percent; beneficiaries, 87
percent; and government, 51 percent. Note that the beneficiaries and the government continued to finance project activities in areas
where IFAD financing permitted their continuation after the IDA/WEF project closed.

2.     Under this component, the project achived its objective of strengthening the administrative, technical
and fiscal capacities of targeted communes to handle their institutional mandates under the decentralization
law, and to utilize participatory processes in planning, and managing own development at the grassroot
level. Some of the key achievements under this component include the following :

         Methodological tools for communes, of which the most important were manuals for: (i)
          commune operations; (ii) administration, accounting, and financing; (iii) simplified
          procurement; (iv) planning and M&E; (v) development and implementation of environmental
          and social safeguards; and (vi) a communication strategy. CAP 2 also produced a Guide for
          preparing Community Development Plans and a Guide for Monitoring Community Development
          Plans.
         Several studies, including one to increase vulnerable groups’ participation in CAP 2 activities
          and a study of how CAP 2 activities contributed to building capacity (see Annex 9).
         Extensive, substantive training for community committee members and CAP 2 personnel. For
          example, 2,288 local elected officials and communal administrative staff were trained in
          management of communal (civil) works, and A large number of personnel in public sector
          institutions received training to support local development. For example, 39 persons received
          training outside Niger in auditing microprojects, local development, decentralization, and
          results-oriented management, and 892 staff received training in sustainable land management,
          environmental and social safeguards, and rural area management. Selected focal points in


                                                      25
          national institutions involved in implementing CAP 2 received information materials, office
          furnishings and consumables, fuel for vehicles, and funds for communication and equipment.
         Administrative tools, guides, studies, and other products developed at the national level included:
          - A system to measure the performance of communes was prepared and validated; a local
              communications guide was produced; regional plans were developed to improve soil fertility
              and water management; a national extension strategy was established for the cereal banks in
              Niger; and the 3N program was operationalized.
          - Tools for developing a law on cooperatives and preparing Commune Development Plans
              were produced.
          - Guidelines were issued for preparing commune budgets, managing accounts, organizing and
              managing communes, and handling intercommunal operations. The 1991 and 2009 laws and
              decrees decentralization were redrafted. In addition, a reforestation guide was prepared,
              arrangements were made for rural advisory support, and four regional action plans for the
              Rural Development Strategy were prepared;
          - Studies were produced on the fiscal sector.
          - Allometric equations were developed (to assess forest biomass and carbon stocks, for
              example), along with institutional and organizational diagnostics for bio-carbon areas.
         To strengthen local staff for communes, CAP 2 recruited 46 young, diploma-holding local
          development assistants (ALD).

      Other outputs of activities under Compent A
3.    A number of other principal outputs resulted from Component A, including:
       A total of 164 Commune Development Plans were prepared and verified (one for every
         participating commune).
       Microprojects were analyzed in 141 departmental and regional committee meetings.
       Those committees received 2,213 microproject dossiers for review; 1,946 were approved.
       A total of 1,449 financing agreements between CAP 2 and communities were signed (for cereal
         banks, the agreement sometimes covered the entire commune, which explains why the number of
         signed agreement is sometimes smaller than the number of implemented projects).

4.    Tables A2.1 and A2.2 present the number of commune development plans prepared, agreements
made, and programs implemented at midterm and by September 30, 2012. Table A2.2 shows activities by
region, including the following highlights:
       Of 164 communes assisted under CAP 2, 163 implemented at least one microproject. The single
           exception was Gangara in Aguié Department.
       A significant number of communes (70) each implemented at least 10 microprojects.
       The program established and trained 821 management committees, which are now operational.
           Note that some communes did not need to form a new management committee, particularly if
           they had made complementary investments (e.g., additional classrooms for schools, head offices
           of the mayors, or storage facilities).
       The program established 132 M&E systems for communes, which are now operational.

7.    Financing was provided through grants, with the proviso that beneficiaries would provide partial
financing of 5 percent (in kind) for natural management microprojects, 10 percent (in kind) for
socioeconomic microprojects, and 20 percent (in cash) for revenue-generating microprojects. Beneficiaries
provided total cofinancing of FCFA 1.5 billion, which was 74 percent of the original commitments.

8.      Of the 1,518 microprojects scheduled, 1,464 were completed by September 30, 2012, and 38 were
still being implemented. The total—1,502—was 98.8 percent of the scheduled number. Achievement of the
target varied among regions ranged from 204 percent in Diffa to 87 percent in Tahoua.11 Table A2.5 shows
the acceleration of microproject implementation over the project period as well the average number of
microprojects per commune for each region. The table indicates that CAP 2 covered all of the regions and
communes participating in the program. Table A2.6 confirms that microprojects were evenly distributed
across all three categories: socioeconomic, natural resource management, and revenue-generating
microprojects.

9.     Socioeconomic microprojects included new and rehabilitated classrooms and equipment, literacy centers,
maternity centers, HIV/AIDS training, different types of wells, hygienic latrines, community centers, market
shelters, animal markets and abattoirs, and feeder roads. The natural resource management microprojects
covered land preparation for bio-carbon sequestration, reforestation, ravine reconstruction, pasture
rehabilitation, animal transit routes, and marshland improvement. The revenue-generating microprojects ranged
from land improvement to construction and stocking of agricultural and livestock input shops, provision of
agricultural equipment, veterinary services, purchase of irrigation wells and pumps, construction and stocking of
cereal banks, purchase of different types of cattle and small livestock, building of grain mills, agricultural
production programs, and training of committee members for these microprojects.


Performance under Component C: Project coordination, management, monitoring, and
evaluation (USS$ 4.87 million)

10. Component C supported administrative and financial management for CAP 2 and was charged with
developing a results-based system for monitoring project performance and impact. The indicators for the
component were: (i) the percentage of communes that submitted quarterly reports on time (the target was 80
percent); (ii) semiannual dissemination of the project’s progress report to donors and other stakeholders;
(iii) the number of regional collaboration agreements signed and satisfactorily implemented (the target was
five); and (d) unqualified annual audits. Table 2.7 presents the achievements of the performance
indicators of this component.

11. Based on those indicators, performance under Component C can be considered satisfactory. The
percentage of communes that submitted quarterly reports on time reached 70 percent (with nearly all
communes ultimately reporting). The semiannual implementation progress reports have been disseminated
to the agreed recipients, although donor representatives felt that the list of recipients could be increased (see
Annex 6). Collaboration agreements or other similar arrangements have been made with all of the most
relevant donor-funded projects. Throughout implementation, CAP 2 received such high marks for financial
management that its Financial Management Unit has been asked (and has agreed) to manage the financial
books of other projects. All audits during the past three years were unqualified.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Because most project funds went to build capacity that supported local governments and social
microprojects, which do not lend themselves to reliable economic analysis, the appraisal mission did not
perform an economic analysis or calculate the FRR for the project as a whole. The appraisal mission
considered it impossible to forecast the types of microproject investments that communes and communities
would make, because such investments would be chosen in accordance with the priorities of the local
population.

2. Lacking a basis to perform an economic analysis for CAP 2, the appraisal mission instead reviewed the
analyses presented in the Action Plan of Niger’s Rural Development Strategy to justify the profitability of
agriculture, focusing on models based on five-hectare farms in the different regions of Niger. The appraisal
team then reviewed an analysis prepared for the ICR of CAP 1. That analysis estimated the financial returns
to one component of CAP 1, the Local Investment Fund, based on a 2007 study organized by the Project
Coordination Unit and Ministry of Agriculture on the profitability of microprojects. Guided by these two
studies, which were probably the most relevant at the time, the appraisal mission estimated that the IRR for
CAP 2 economic subprojects was likely to be between 25 percent and 27 percent for both agricultural
investments and livestock investments, when computed for a10-year investment period.

3. No cost or financial analysis was done at appraisal on microprojects or areas to be covered by GEF
activities apart from NPV and IRR calculations (apparently the positive results in the CAP 1 ICR were
approved).

4. The CAP 2 supported actives covered a mixed of demand-driven productive and social
investments: capacity building, social infrastructure, income generation and natural resource
management and sustainable land management. Although some of the investments, e.g., office
buildings, capacity building, project management, did not generate direct economic benefits, the
others generate varying degree of economic benefits. As Table 3.1 below reveals, much of of the
CAP2 investments went into Natural resources management (23.8%) and capacity building and
institutional strengthening (19.6%), while about equal amounts of investments were done
supporting income generation actives (17.6) to improve rural incomes and also to prop up basic
social infrastructure in the communes (17.5). Income generation activities accounted for more than
half of the subprojects.

Ex post analysis of CAP 2

5. Background. In retrospect, given that CAP 2 focused largely on improving institutional arrangements
and building capacity, it might have been appropriate to estimate the cost-effectiveness of resources spent
on components rather than the Local Investment Fund (through unit-rate norms, service standards, and
other measures, as appropriate). Because the PAD did not adopt this approach, and because relevant
information on both outputs and costs is limited, such an analysis could not be undertaken for CAP 2 at the
ICR stage.

6. Although different investments and conditions under CAP 1 and CAP 2 make it difficult to prepare a
comparative cost analysis, the project’s financial management data indicate that the ratio between operating
costs and investment costs dropped substantially in the second phase of the program.

7. For the same reasons that existed at appraisal, no economic or financial analyses were attempted for the
entire CAP 2 program at completion. Because the CAP 2 appraisal mission did not attempt to prepare new
financial analyses based on the microproject investments under CAP 1 (it summarized the results, without
including details about assumptions, prices, adoption rates, and the like), there was no basis for the ICR
mission to repeat the computations.

8. Instead, the ICR mission requested project authorities to organize a separate review of the financial
results and carry out an economic analysis of the CAP 2 subcomponent that financed revenue-generating
microprojects, based on actual outcomes. INS assisted CAP 2 management and the Ministry of Agriculture
with this effort. The text that follows does not attempt to compare the projections at appraisal with the
actual results at the close of the project, except in a general way.

9. Owing to the national population census, the start of a comprehensive, scientifically valid study on the
profitability of revenue-generating microprojects was delayed, so CAP 2 authorities first organized an
“indicative economic and financial analysis” to provide appropriate material for this report.12 A more
comprehensive report was completed in February 2013 on a sample basis..

10. Methodology. The objectives and methodology were first validated at a workshop that CCN organized
with the INS. The workshop agreed that the objective of the overall study was to prepare an economic and
financial analysis on the revenue-generating microproject investments in the communes where CAP 2 had
been active, with the aim of verifying whether the investments were well chosen, suitably sized, effectively
implemented, and efficient in their use of funds. The workshop also agreed on the modalities of the study,
such as the regions to be included, material to be studied, types and numbers of microprojects to be studied,
sampling and data collection methods that would be used, the staff involved (team leader, four assistants,
four field supervisors, and 20 data collectors), fieldwork, and preparation of a report.

11. Ultimately a sample of 52 microprojects representing agricultural investments and small-scale trading
was selected for the full study (the other economic microprojects are artisanal work and environmental
protection microprojects). The approach taken in the study was to choose 5 regions (of 10) around the
country to represent average conditions and study randomly selected economic microprojects in each of the
typical subsectors for economic microprojects. The microprojects selected from among 11 subsectors were:
    1. Cereal banks (8), to preserve produce and prepare for calamities/dry season scarcity.
    2. Cattle production (8), to improve pastures and fatten and sell cattle.
    3. Grain mills (3), to reduce the milling burden and save women’s time for other revenue- generating
         activities.
    4. Sheep production (10), to improve pastures and fatten and sell sheep.
    5. Red-goat stocking (7), to introduce better-quality goats.
    6. Agricultural input shops (3), to provide inputs needed by farmers and livestock producers.
    7. Veterinary input shops (2), to provide veterinary supplies and services to producers of cattle and
         other livestock.
    8. Animal transport (2), to purchase 50 oxen and 50 carts for transport and income.
    9. Edible oil processing (3), to extract groundnut oil and provide income for women.
    10. Irrigation sites for the use of women (4), to improve food security and nutrition.
    11. Stocking fish ponds (2), to improve nutrition and enhance rural livelihoods.

11. The INS analysis used a number of general assumptions:
     The financial profitability of microprojects takes into account the original investment and annual
       operational costs as well as the actual annual receipts.
     Revenues are based on actual receipts for 2 or 3 years of operations, extended over a 10-year
       period.
     The benefit-cost ratio reflects the funds invested and the benefits obtained in monetary terms. It
       reports undiscounted benefits and undiscounted costs of the microproject.
     The NPV is the current value of benefits within the 10-year period of the microproject. It is equal to
       the sum of “nonactualized” (undiscounted) new benefits.
     The financial cost of the microproject is the amount provided by CAP 2 and contributions made by
       the beneficiaries. In-kind contributions have not been taken into account. Because only agricultural
       activities are being discussed and the opportunity cost of farmers’ labor is very low, only cash
       contributions are relevant.
     Duties and taxes are assumed to be constant throughout the life of the microprojects.
     The discount rate for calculating the new present value is the one used in Niger for similar projects
       and the one used by commercial banks (4 percent).
     For calculating the financial IRR, all elements that are not expressed in monetary terms
       (depreciation, amortization, reserve funds, and so on) are excluded.

12. Results. For computing results, the principal tools were cash flow (benefits to costs), financial NPV,
financial IRR, IRR, and the period required to recover the investment. The team prepared matrix tables to



                                                     33
ensure consistency in the fieldwork. As for the values of these indicators, if the benefit-cost ratio is higher
than 1, the microproject is profitable (according to INS). The NPV reflects the profitability of the
investment compared with alternative investments in financial markets at a given interest rate (4 percent); a
positive value shows that the microproject is more profitable than the alternatives. In Nigerien conditions,
an IRR that exceeds 10–12 percent is typically considered satisfactory, and a rate exceeding 20 percent is
excellent. If the microproject is profitable, the recovery period should be less than 10 years.

13. Table A3.2 summarizes the results of the financial analysis of microprojects. Except for village grain
mills, all types of microprojects are sufficiently or even highly profitable investments (and note that at least
one village mill had a slightly positive IRR). The nonmonetary benefits—particularly the alleviation of
drudgery for women—may justify investments in grain mills in some cases, as long as their use is
maximized and the cost involved is understood. (The nonmonetary benefits are discussed later in this
annex.)

were apparently for a varying number of different types of microprojects, they could not be compared across microprojects, and the
ICR mission did not include them in this table.



14. The purpose of the survey was to provide results for the most typical microprojects, so the INS team did
not attempt to synthesize results by region or for CAP 2 more generally. Even so, given that the selected
subsectors represent the most common types of microprojects (cereal banks being by far the most
common), and given that all types of microprojects except village grain mills showed very good returns on
investment, this subcomponent is likely to have a very good overall financial return—one that is perhaps
good enough to absorb much of the project’s administrative and capacity-building costs and still provide a
positive overall return.

15. Because cereal banks formed nearly one-half of all revenue-generating microprojects (285 of 627, with
an FRR of 31 percent), and most other microprojects had FRRs higher than that of cereal banks,13 the ICR
mission team estimated that the overall FRR for CAP 2’s revenue-generating microprojects would probably
surpass 30 percent. Note that the cost of in-kind contributions was not included in the computations,
however (the opportunity cost of labor was assumed to be very little). If some value for labor is included in
the analysis, the IRR would decline by a few percentage points.

     With the exception of some 40 microprojects involving grain mills, stocking fish ponds, and irrigation/garden sites for women.


                                                                 34
16. The INS attempted a sensitivity analysis, varying the income values upward by the consumer price
index. The results were naturally more beneficial, except for grain mills, for which the NPV, negative even
at noninflated values, increased even more.

17. Microprojects for natural resource management. To determine the benefits of land preservation and
recuperation for agricultural use, CAP 2 carried out two reviews at midterm. The reviews concluded that
although most benefits of such investments are expected to materialize over a longer (still unquantified)
time horizon, some short-term benefits could be identified. Examples include a plant nursery microproject
and a microproject in which 40 hectares were recovered for pasture. In the first example, the nursery
owners’ incomes from plant sales often exceeded their other agricultural income. They used the additional
funds for buying additional animals, agricultural equipment, and food and generally improving their
standard of living. In several cases, the additional income allowed the young farmers to get married. In the
second example, the participants in the pasture microproject received cash-for-work payments based on the
amount of land they cleared and replanted. The cash helped them and their families to survive in the
aftermath of the natural disasters (drought and floods) that had recently occurred in Niger. Overall, CAP 2
facilities enabled CFAF 1.4 billion in cash-for-work payments to assist some 61,000 families.

18. Nonmonetary benefits. The INS study also identified nonmonetary benefits expected to arise from the
microprojects, if they remain profitable. In general, the study argued that all microprojects help consolidate
food security, augment beneficiaries’ capital, improve the income of participating individuals and
households, reduce drudgery (especially for females), and increase employment in communities. With
microprojects, the standard of living and social status of beneficiaries (who were women in more than half
of the cases) have improved.

19. Improvements recommended. The INS study recommended that the team preparing CAP 3:
     Continue monitoring microprojects and disseminate the information broadly to stakeholders.
     Ensure that microprojects submit repayment instalments on the agreed dates.
     Increase the number of beneficiaries and positive impacts in the communities.
     Periodically advise microproject management committees about managing their funds
       transparently and improving their operations.
     Use funds created by microprojects to ensure the sustainability of microprojects in beneficiaries’
       communities and to envision new revenue-generating activities for the population.

20. Administrative costs. The ICR mission team observed that the actual cost of project coordination and
management exceeded the original budget by more than 174 percent. This cost overrun was covered mainly
by reducing the funds available for Component B (Local Investment Fund). That action may be justifiable
because new activities were incorporated into the project.14 Equally important, it was essential to increase
the staff available for M&E and field operations, as discussed in the main report.

21. The costs of the microprojects need further investigating. The INS study calculated the average cost per
benefiting family and found that it varied hugely, from some FCFA 7,000 to more than FCFA 400,000.
Although some of the microprojects may benefit many people indirectly, the reasons for such large
variations will need to be investigated under CAP 3. It may be advisable to prepare guidelines for
communes about the “comparative advantages” of different types of microprojects—in other words, which

Alimentaire et de Développement Rural (PUSADER); and (c) Le programme d’Action communautaire pour la résilience climatique
(PAC/RC). The project has also implemented the annual agreement that the Government of Niger has made with the World Food
Programme. IFAD joined the program a year later than CAP 2 started.


                                                          35
types of microprojects are most likely to yield improvements in the lives of the greatest number of villagers
rather than to yield a large improvement for a small number of individuals.

22. Economic analysis. The INS team attempted to assess whether the different types of microprojects
were beneficial from society’s viewpoint. For that purpose, the team considered using shadow prices, but
because the agricultural family’s labor has few alternative uses and the prices for inputs and outputs are
essentially the same as market prices, shadow pricing does not make a substantial difference.

23. The difference comes more from the fact that the cost of microproject management and a proportion of
the regional and national M&E and coordination were “loaded” on microprojects. The indicators of
economic profitability were the same as in the financial analysis: cash flow (benefits-costs), economic
NPV, ERR, and the period for recovering the investment. A discount rate of 5 percent was used in
calculating the NPV (NGOs in the field have used this rate for projecting social future values of
microprojects).

24. The INS team had more microproject data for the economic analysis than for the financial analysis, and
some of data for the economic analysis are the same as the data used in the financial analysis. The
assumptions used in the economic analysis were:
     Cereal banks (and similar): prices used were 5 percent less than market prices.
     Animal transport: family consumption 20 percent.
     Irrigation sites; family consumption 20 percent.
     Village mills: for reducing domestic drudgery and gaining time—1 percent of the production
        value.
     Cattle production: increase of revenue from milk and manure by 5 percent.
     Sheep production: increase of revenue from milk and manure by 1 percent.

25. Table A3.3 shows that all microproject activities were also profitable in economic terms, except for
village mills.15 The spread of the indicator values was substantial, probably reflecting the efficiency with
which the microproject funds were used.




15
  Actually, one of the two mills was marginally profitable. Also, as mentioned earlier, in the Nigerien conditions only a FRR above
10 percent is considered satisfactory.

Evaluation of the economic and financial analysis

26. As noted at appraisal, this type of project does not easily lend itself to rigorous economic or financial
analysis. In the view of the ICR mission team, it was understandable that the appraisal mission avoided
attempting a comprehensive financial and economic analysis, even for the revenue-generating microproject
subcomponent (under Component B). The approach chosen—to use the analysis from the recent Rural
Development Strategy and the study undertaken upon completion of CAP 1—appears justified. Forecasting
the types of microproject investments selected under CAP 2 would have involved wild guesses, and in fact
the investments selected at the local level for CAP 2 turned out to be very different from those under CAP 1.
An additional consideration is that the allocation of the costs of other components for microprojects in the
analysis would have been arbitrary.

27. The financial and economic analysis in December 2012–February 2013 was carefully planned and
carried out (and, as mentioned, the plan and methodology developed for the study were validated through a
workshop). The analysis was done in two phases. An indicative study of 20 cases in 2 regions, using a
purposively small sample to obtain indicative results, was followed by a second, more comprehensive and
scientifically more reliable study, involving 52 cases in 5 regions. The sample for the second study was
large enough to represent the 627 productive microprojects, especially because only those microprojects
were accepted into the sample which had been implemented two to three years earlier. The study was
carried out by an experienced agency (INS), and it included both a study of documents prepared earlier by
CCN and actual visits to the project sites. The results adequately reflect the results across all the
administrative regions and departments.

28. The ICR mission benefited from the fact that the results were in tabular format (the tables in this annex
were prepared by the ICR team from the INS report’s text). The INS tables were simplified (cost and benefit
items were summarized), but because the report lists the types of items that are included under the costs and
benefits, they appear to be reliable (and the ICR mission studied two cases in detail). The report furthermore
claims to give both economic and financial returns, using these terms in accordance with World Bank
terminology. In summary, the INS report 16 provides the information essential for the ICR mission to
determine with sufficient confidence which microproject investments were profitable and which were not.

16
   The report includes some inaccuracies and raises some questions (such as why ERRs are higher than FRRs in a couple of cases,
despite loading the former with additional expenses), but they do not affect the overall satisfactory findings on the profitability of
the microprojects.


                                                                 37
Nevertheless, profitability (especially when expressed by IRR) seems unexpectedly high, and it is possible
that some expenses may have been underestimated because they do not necessarily come up in the actual
amounts within the first two to three years. A sensitivity analysis of factors other than revenue alone would
have been valuable.

29. In any event, the ICR mission is confident that the financial and economic returns are sufficient to
justify the range of microprojects financed under CAP 2, except for the grain mills—which could be
justified only on the basis of reduced drudgery for women or higher milling fees, if households are willing
to pay higher fees against the saving of women’s time. Overall, the appraisal mission’s estimations of the
FRR and ERR at around 24–27 percent appear to be validated by the INS study.

30. CAP 2 management organized midterm surveys on natural resource microprojects, which indicated that
those microprojects yielded some direct and indirect benefits, but CAP 3 should prepare more
comprehensive analyses of microprojects that protect the environment. For example, aside from
microprojects to improve pastures and agricultural fields, the analysis could include projects that collect
household refuse, plant trees and protect forests, establish bio-carbon sites, and provide equipment for
fishing. The analysis could also involve artisanal microprojects.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1. The project’s Monitoring and Evaluation Unit completed an end-of-project beneficiary survey
in September 2012,17 concentrating on verifying the attainment of project goals and objectives.
The survey and the project’s regular monitoring activities also produced a broad spectrum of
information on the target population and project beneficiaries, including women and youths. This
annex summarizes the methodology and results of the beneficiary survey, along with monitoring
data related to CAP 2’s beneficiaries and effectiveness.18

2. Despite some issues with late submission of field data, the survey was completed “through
huge collection and summarizing efforts at the field level and equally demanding processing
efforts at the central monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit.” The resulting data allow the
contributions of CAP 2 to be estimated with sufficient accuracy. They suggest that the approach
adopted by CAP 2 successfully engaged the target populations in consultations and ownership of
the program at the local, regional, and national levels.

Methodology

3. Of 21 indicators selected at the start of CAP 2 to describe the its performance, data for 17
indicators were collected through the project’s regular M&E setup, whereas data on 4 additional
indicators were gathered through a special opinion poll. Both the M&E system and opinion poll
were carefully designed and used a random sampling technique.

4. M&E system data. For regularly scheduled M&E, the local development assistants, along with
village-level management committees, completed monitoring sheets prepared by the national
M&E unit. The sheets were delivered to the communes to be consolidated under supervision of the
Secretary General of the commune (a step that simultaneously updated knowledge of field
circumstances at the commune level). Next, the data were delivered to the provinces, where they
were examined by provincial M&E staff before being submitted to the national M&E unit, which
prepared a synthesis with the help of the INS.

5. In villages (or village clusters), data were collected first from the population and then from the
local management committee. The study sampled 17 communes from all 8 regions included in the
project (15 percent of the new communes involved in the project), and 10 villages in each
commune. As 30 households were included in each village, the total study population was about
5,100 (the total number varied slightly among the 17 indicators). This sample size is considered to
be fully adequate to yield robust results.

6. Opinion-poll data. The survey was administered at the local level by specially recruited and
trained enumerators (enquêteurs). The sample population was similar to the population used for
collecting data under the M&E system just described, consisting of 17 communes in 8 regions, 10
villages in each commune, and 30 families (households) randomly selected in each village, based


17
  A similar survey was also carried out at midterm.
18
  Note that data gathered through routine monitoring improved from midterm to the end of the project, when they were fully
satisfactory.


                                                              40
on a list of households; if a list was not available, interviewees were randomly selected in the
marketplace). The fieldwork was supervised by a project-financed supervisor; the commune’s
mayor oversaw the process.

7. At the national level, the project’s M&E unit solicited technical assistance from INS for
processing the data.
Principal survey results

8. Results for the indicators, targets, and achievements include:
    Target: More than 50 percent of the population was satisfied with how Commune
      Development Plans were implemented using the Annual Investment Plans. End result: 93
      percent of the population in target communities were satisfied.
    Target: More that 60 percent of beneficiaries augmented their income though
      revenue-generating activities. End result: 75 percent of beneficiaries succeeded in doing
      so.
    Target: More than 50 percent of the communes had increased their education, health, or
      drinking water services by at least 2 percent. End result: 65 percent of communes attained
      the required level of improvement for education, 55 percent for health, and 83 percent for
      drinking water.
    Target: At least 60 percent of environmentally targeted communes protected and
      improved 200 hectares or more of land. End result: 61 percent of targeted communes had
      reached this level.
    Target: Environmental and social safeguarding measures were taken into account in 80
      percent of microprojects in communes. End result: The indicator value rose from 55
      percent at midterm to 100 percent by the end of the project.
    Target: At least 60 percent of targeted communes had functioning land registration
      committees. End result: 92 percent of communes had established these commissions,
      which had started to process land transactions
    Target: All 164 of the target communes had prepared a Commune Development Plan
      using the national guide for commune development. End result: 99 percent had prepared
      a plan.
    Target: All 164 communes had taken into account the national guidelines for natural
      resource management in preparing their Commune Development Plans. End result: 100
      percent. At midterm the quality of the environmental and social plans was inadequate in
      many cases, but the documents were improved before the end of the project.
    No specific target: Communes were expected to organize annual information workshops
      on their activities. End result: 90 percent of communes, benefiting from extensive training
      given to village committees in community affairs and communication, and with
      contributions from elected officials in the commune council and the commune mayor,
      organized workshops.
    No specific target: Communes adjusted their Commune Development Plans and Annual
      Investment Plans based on feedback from the village or village clusters. End result: 93
      percent, according to heads of surveyed households, made this adjustment.
    No specific target: Communes made satisfactory agreements between the commune and
      technical public services. End result: No formal agreements were made, but public


                                               41
         technical services are taken into account in microproject contracts with service providers
         and entrepreneurs, and the arrangement has been satisfactory in 99 percent of
         microprojects.
        No specific target: Communes took special measures to ensure sustainability of the
         microproject investments (establishing management committees, collecting user fees, and
         using technical services). End result: 93 percent of communes have made these
         arrangements.
        No specific target: Each commune made at least 50 percent of the population aware of the
         priority activities in the commune, its budget, and the management arrangements. End
         result: 64 percent of the beneficiary population was familiar with this information.

Other social and economic data

9. The survey also collected and analyzed other data from the surveyed households and
individuals, including information about the gender of the household head (77 percent were
headed by men and 23 percent by women); family size (46 percent of households had 6–10 family
members and 28 percent had more than 10); and level of education of the household head (36
percent had none, 34 percent had been to a Koranic school, and 6 percent had a secondary
education). About 67 percent of the population of the targeted communes had benefited from the
economic project activities (of which 38 percent benefited from livestock and 25 percent from land
protection and improvement activities). The survey also generated information about the principal
occupation and income sources of the population in the targeted communes, among other things.

10. As for improving social services and combatting poverty, the project is believed to have
contributed substantially, in addition to fostering women’s involvement in some 400 social
microprojects (for health, education, and portable water). The 627 income-generating
microprojects (of which half of the beneficiaries were women) are credited with creating rural
employment and revenue, and the 427 environmental microprojects provided cash-for-work
payments that were very important during the recent famine years.

11. The regular M&E system provides data on a range of other variables, including the gender and
age of beneficiaries. The total number of beneficiaries is estimated to approach 1.6 million, of
which more than half (50.43 percent) were women, although women’s share of representation in
communal and other committees was substantially smaller. Youths were actively targeted under
the microprojects and account for about 30 percent of microproject beneficiaries.

12. Because the most recent beneficiary survey did not study gender issues in depth, Attachment 1
presents some important relevant observations from the 2008 review.19

February 2013 financial and economic review

13. At the end of the project, as INS conducted a study for the financial and economic analysis, it
also reviewed the extent of (and reasons for) beneficiaries’ satisfaction with the microprojects.


19
  Several stakeholders (see Annex 6) observed that that women’s position in Nigerien society has continued to improve. Women
have become more visible and vocal in local committees, and at the national level, 5 of 24 ministers are women.


                                                            42
Depending on the region and type of microproject, as many as 73–100 percent of microproject
beneficiaries reported satisfaction with microproject results. The principal reasons for satisfaction
were increased income and solidarity among microproject members, whereas the efficiency of the
microproject operations received much lower marks.

Annex 5, Appendix 1: The Role of Women in CAP-supported institutions and activities

Studies undertaken for CAP 2 did not broadly explore gender issues and thus did not permit the
ICR mission team to draw new conclusions. The team felt, however, that the 2008 beneficiary
study was quite thorough and offers insights that remain pertinent as CAP concludes its second
phase. The 2008 study was used in designing and implementing CAP 2, partly with a view to
modifying approaches and expanding women’s role in project-supported institutions.

1. Results of the 2008 study

The regional coordination units of CCN collect information on numbers of women elected to
commune councils as well as administrative bodies and special commissions in village clusters.
The units also collect information on the number of women who participate in training sessions.
However, the study team could not confirm the extent to which women have official roles.

The extent to which women participate effectively in CAP microprojects varies greatly among
regions and even among communities within the same region. In several communities of Agadez,
Tahoua, and Niamey regions, for example, women have long been members of management
bodies, where they often play important roles. In other regions, such as Maradi, women have been
involved very little in official functions. Even women in female microproject groups seemed to
have little knowledge of decision making and the priorities pursued under their Local or Commune
Development Plans.

Long before the advent of CAP, women’s groups in Niger had participated in savings and credit
activities (tontines). Many women confirmed that CAP had energized these groups and opened
new possibilities for improving women’s lives through new economic activities. With CAP
activities, the groups often retained their social and economic character and had a strong spirit of
community. For instance, when women raise goats or breed cattle and one woman’s animal dies,
the other women collect money to buy her a new one.

Apparently, women’s groups can mobilize personal contributions so that all members can benefit
from microprojects. The study team noted that in all cases the women had been able to collect the
necessary funds for the microprojects in time to receive a grant from the project. It is important to
note, however, that microprojects undertaken by women were generally of a more modest size
than microprojects run by mixed or male groups.

Most members of women’s groups in Niger are illiterate, but they all wished for their own
children—boys and girls—“to have the opportunity to go to school so that they could help improve
the life of their parents, and live a better life than their parents.”

2. Revealing women’s potential in the fight against poverty

The ability of women’s groups to mobilize and manage funds means that they have a potentially
important role in the fight against poverty. One high-level government administrator had told the
study team that “it is necessary to place much more funds in the hands of women. They know very




                                                 44
well how to manage money and how to grow the initial capital, and at the same time improve the
life of the family.”`

The study team suggested, however, that women’s contribution to poverty reduction could be
optimized only if the following preconditions are met:
(a) Clean drinking water must be available close by, both to save time for women who now must
    fetch water from a distance, and to allow women to enter productive activities that require
    water.
(b) A solution must be found to the drudgery of grinding grains. Some groups have obtained flour
    mills under the CAP microproject program, but unfortunately the mills have not worked well
    or have broken down. Better maintenance and improved bookkeeping are needed.
(c) The capacity of women’s groups must be improved. Women’s groups have requested literacy
    programs and training in simple accounting and management.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1. Organization of stakeholder workshops

1.     The ICR mission for CAP 2 organized three stakeholder workshops/meetings, as well as
individual sessions with stakeholders. The first meeting was with service providers; one person
attended from each key service subsector—local planning and capacity building, technical
microproject design and control, and civil works execution. The second meeting convened the
regional CAP 2 coordinators, whose major responsibility was to promote and facilitate
implementation of the program in the field. The third meeting was with the international donor
community; the mission met representatives of the European Union, Swiss Cooperation, United
Nations Development Programme, and IFAD,20 all of which are involved in decentralization and
community development in Niger.21

2.      The mission also met high-level officials from all six ministries involved in the CAP 2
Steering Committee and in decentralization of government administration, community
development, and local people’s social and economic development. The ministry focal points
participated in a staff meeting at the project’s office or met with the mission at their ministries. In
addition, in private sessions the mission met all CAP 2 staff, the Bank’s resident mission staff who
had dealt with the program, and (in two regions) other stakeholders, ranging from representatives
of the governor to implementers at the commune level and microproject beneficiaries (see
Attachment 1 for a full list).

2. Methodology

3.      After the opening discussion, in which stakeholders clarified the relationship of their
respective ministry/agency/organization to CAP 2, or the extent to which the
ministry/agency/organization engaged with the project, the mission asked the stakeholders three
key questions.
         What were the most significant results/achievements of the project?
         What were the main factors that hindered implementation of the project?
         What are the most important lessons learned from the project and its implementation
           that can help in the design of a follow-on project in Niger, or similar projects in other
           countries?

4.     The views expressed in these workshops and meetings are summarized in the following
sections.

3. Main achievements

5.     Most workshop participants and stakeholders who were individually interviewed
expressed appreciation for the project’s achievements in the field and appreciation for the work of


20
  The IFAD representative was met through a Skype connection.
21
  Other international agencies were also invited, but their representatives had already left for their year-end holidays. They will get
an opportunity present their views on the draft ICR.


                                                                  46
their own organizations. They confirmed that CAP 2 is well known all over the country as an
important project, and that it is valuable for Niger’s socioeconomic development.

6.      All stakeholders strongly endorsed CAP 2’s general approach, which is to help
decentralize and strengthen the administrative structure in Niger’s central agencies, regions,
departments, and communes as a basis for long-term social and economic development. The
stakeholders also acknowledged that, if this approach is to be effective, it must be a collaborative
effort among several ministries at all levels, accompanied by supporting actions and activities (for
example, the provision of information, training, and technical and operational support).

7.      Collaborative networks have been developed throughout Niger to fight poverty. The
networks include the staffs of the ministries of agriculture, animal services, water, environment,
decentralization, and community development, as well as many representatives from the public
and private sectors on the coordination committees (whose members have been trained in their
duties). The principle of participation in development, decision making, and even execution of
microprojects has been successfully implemented in 164 communes (subdistricts).

8.      The project stimulated an entirely new level of dynamism (force de la stratégie) and
confidence in the ministries, their personnel, and local populations by providing information,
training, equipment, and investment and operational resources to stakeholders in the anti-poverty
fight. The project also facilitated the preparation of Commune Development Plans and Commune
Investment Plans (Plans d'Investissement Annuels Communaux) and the financing for communes
and villages or village clusters (communautés) to implement the plans themselves (as expressed by
two stakeholders: “C’est les communes qui gèrent”).

9.      The project helped finance the drafting and approval of the laws and decrees, action plans,
and operational manuals needed to decentralize decision making and implement local
development plans. Local beneficiaries emphasized the importance of microprojects, such as
health centers, classrooms for schools, revenue-generating investments, administration buildings
at the commune level, and environmental activities that generated income in times of calamities
(such as the cash-for-work program).

10.    The stakeholders emphasized the value of the capacity building facilitated by the project.
The project organized and trained a large number of people in decentralized administration and
taught them how to fight poverty. It helped form coordination committees at the regional,
departmental, and commune levels to take charge of activities financed by the project. It also
developed training modules for the service providers to ensure that training was uniform.

11.    The project improved the effectiveness of the government’s technical ministries by
providing the technical resources to support and monitor program activities at the regional,
departmental, and the local levels. It financed the creation of manuals and documents that were
widely used in training and implementing project activities.

12.    The project provided technical assistance that vastly improved communication all the way
to primary beneficiaries and, to some extent, to development partners.




                                                47
13.     The project accelerated sustainable land management, land registration, and the
establishment of land commissions. Other environmental improvements included recovery of
unproductive land, introduction of Acacia senegal plantations and carbon sequestration. (A
contract with the World Bank-administered bio-carbon fund was signed during CAP 1, but no
funds had been paid to Niger until now). The project financed the hiring and training of more
environmental staff and helped build capacity for systematic surveillance in the field.

14.     The project financed the hiring of more contract service providers, who gained more
experience in development efforts. The village and commune committees also gained experience
in procurement and supervision of microprojects, as well as in following environmental
regulations.

15.     Several stakeholders praised the project’s willingness to implement tasks other than those
originally planned, especially when food needed to be distributed under the World Food
Programme and when supplementary cash (under a cash-for-work scheme) was needed during the
famines (caused first by droughts and then by floods). These interventions and the economic
microprojects helped the population develop resilience against calamities.

16.      The project helped to harmonize the approaches and M&E practices used by various
development partners in the sector (and to derive good practices from some of them, as, for
instance, from IFAD’s practices regarding gender and poverty issues). The project was also
instrumental in integrating women and young people in local development. Although these groups
are still underrepresented in the communal and higher-level councils, they received substantial
benefits from project investments (women accounted for more than 50 percent of all beneficiaries
and young people about 30 percent).

17.     As a step for mainstreaming the financing of local development, the project facilitated
establishment of an Agency for Financing of Elected Bodies in the Niger Territory (at the time of
the mission’s visit, the agency was in the process of recruiting staff).

4. Problem areas and difficulties

18.   Although the stakeholders were generally very satisfied with the project and reported no
major problems in dealing with CAP 2, they mentioned a number of problems during
implementation:
       The start of the project was problematic partly because of political interference.
          Although the project was signed within the standard time period after World Bank
          approval, it took several months to nominate and approve the staff and to make the
          project active. Later, political instability impeded implementation of the project; during
          the four-year project, local governments turned over three times. As a result, a
          substantial amount of new training was needed and decisions at the departmental and
          commune levels were delayed.
       Substantial financial resources were allocated for the project, but most stakeholders
          observed that the resources were not enough to meet the need for building up the local
          administrations and for accomplishing the social and economic microprojects desired
          by the local populations (especially for social investments such as health centers,


                                                48
    schools, and wells), but also for revenue-creating investments in livestock and
    agriculture. Common statements by stakeholders were that “more would be needed for
    everything” and “more funds would be needed to consolidate the achievements and
    reinforce the structures developed.”
   There was a mismatch between the staffing of the project and the targets set for it. The
    program was expected to expand from 54 communes during CAP 1 to 164 communes
    in all of Niger’s 8 regions during CAP 2. At the same time the project was expected to
    consolidate activities in the original 52 communes. All this was to have been
    accomplished with fewer staff at the National Coordination Center and in the regional
    coordination units than was the case during the first phase of the program. (The staffs
    were increased during the project.).
   While the idea of “mainstreaming” the project activities in the existing government
    organizations was good, it was often difficult to get the full attention of the officials,
    except for the focal points in the different ministries, because all project personnel also
    had other pressing tasks. However, the contributions by the technical ministries and
    their staff in the field were appreciated.
   The personnel and committees in the new departments and communes were not
    familiar with the project’s procedures, especially those relating to procurement. The
    terms of reference, technical specifications, approval of contracts, and filing
    procedures were often inadequate, though they improved toward the end of the project
    thanks to extensive field training by the project procurement staff. The mayors at the
    communes changed three times and were not aware of the decision process regarding
    procurement.
   During the first two years of the project, the requirements and forms for environmental
    safeguards were not well understood in many microprojects, and the supervising
    agency of the Ministry of Environment (BEEEI) had too few staff in the field. After
    midterm, the recruitment of a safeguards specialist for the project allowed more
    training and verification of the environmental forms; as a result, during the last part of
    the project the regulations were being well followed. Some stakeholders expressed
    concern that payment to communities for their efforts under the carbon sequestration
    program had not yet started.
   Improving the capacity at all levels of government administration was an important
    goal, but some project training activities could not be completed. Also, the quality of
    service providers was inadequate, and too many poor-quality microprojects and local
    development plans were proposed during the first two years of the project. Moreover,
    the capacity building for CAP 2 was not linked to training on using the Public Financial
    Management System, which may need to be rectified.
   Payment to service providers was sometimes slow. Monitoring of infrastructure
    investments by architectural/engineering firms took a lot of time, and multiple visits to
    construction sites were required because of delays at the local level and slow payment
    by communes to entrepreneurs (at least one architectural/engineering firm suffered
    financial loss).
   Delays and shortcomings in the government’s counterpart funding impeded some
    project actions, and the government has been slow to implement its earlier decision to
    establish a national agency to finance local governments (ANFCT). However, staff
    recruitment is underway.

5. Lessons learned, as articulated by stakeholders

19.   Weighing the achievements of the project against the difficulties, stakeholders identified a
number of lessons:
       The approach of the project, that is, making the regions and communes responsible for
          social and economic development to the extent possible (responsabiliser les maires et
          communes), is appropriate for conditions such as those in Niger, where the distances
          are long, environmental problems are huge, and the population is poor.
       The project played a very influential role in Niger in introducing an integrated
          approach to decentralization of government administration and the fight against
          poverty. Integration of decentralized measures, social and economic investments, and
          participation of local populations in decisions that concern them directly—that is,
          social and economic investments—have proved effective. These kinds of operations
          require long-term commitments and will need to continue, however, at least to
          facilitate operating the organizations established and the investments made.
       In conditions like those in Niger, with very difficult environmental problems (severe
          land degradation, lack of land registration, pollution of rivers and swamps,
          insect-borne diseases, air pollution especially from mining, and lack of recycling of
          plastic and other materials), it is essential to combine environmental protection and
          recovery activities with socioeconomic development efforts for long-term agricultural
          and other development. Stakeholders praised the cofinancing of the project by the
          World Bank and GEF (and IFAD) and the use of the same procedures, but they also
          emphasized the need for more training for environmental agents as well as for the local
          population.
       To encourage interest in long-term natural resource management and environmental
          protection (including maintenance of trees), it is essential to give the population
          concrete incentives (food or cash for work, as was done under CAP 2). It is also
          important to recognize that different conditions regarding biodiversity and availability
          of water require different solutions, and those conditions should be taken into account
          in devising responses and training.
       It is easy to underestimate the financial and human resources needed for an effective,
          countrywide response to multiple objectives (decentralization, socioeconomic
          development, civil society participation, and so on). In Niger, the regional,
          departmental, and local administrators were not ready to take over the tasks involved in
          project implementation in addition to their normal duties, and substantial
          project-funded staff was needed.
       Collaboration among the ministries that are involved can be achieved both at the
          central and local levels once the roles and shares of funds have been worked out. In
          Niger, only limited linkages had existed earlier among the different public services,
          and these linkages were more in the field than at the center. The results in this respect
          were encouraging during the second phase of the program.
       An impressive level of collaboration has been achieved among the implementing
          agencies. The teamwork between development partners, geographic complementarity
          of assistance, as well as commonly used procedures and manuals allowed different



                                                50
             development partners to feel that they were working toward a common goal. The same
             applied to the key ministries.

20.     Other opinions voiced by stakeholders included:
         More training and other forms of capacity building are still needed to “professionalize”
           the public and private sector stakeholders. Also, the NGOs involved in providing
           services need more training than was given under CAP 2.
         Investment needs are not simply commune-based (a fact that was recognized during
           CAP 2) but are often intercommunal (for example, middle-level schools or irrigation
           on both sides of a valley, which may belong to different communes), and easy
           procedures need to developed for such cases.
         The report-based disbursement system introduced for CAP 2 allowed implementation
           of the project to continue even when the World Bank suspended disbursements because
           of political instability (IFAD has continued the earlier invoice-based approach and has
           experienced problems in that respect.) For financial management, the presence of
           financial staff in the regions and their frequent visits to communes are important and
           will be needed under CAP 3 to sustain the investments made.
         Adequate supplies (such as medicines for health centers and textbooks for schools)
           should be included in microproject packages.
         The participation of women and youths can be improved by using targeting and
           appropriate selection criteria for microprojects and their beneficiaries (this was done to
           some extent under CAP 2, but it could be done to a greater extent under CAP 3).

A. CONTEXTE

La deuxième phase du Programme d’Actions Communautaires (PAC-2) est entrée en vigueur le 24
décembre 2008 pour une durée de quatre ans. Il est financé par l’Association Internationale pour le
Développement (IDA), le Fonds pour l’Environnement Mondial (FEM), le Fonds International de
Développement Agricole (FIDA), l’Etat du Niger et les bénéficiaires pour un montant global de 61, 530
millions de dollars US. L’achèvement des accords de financement avec la Banque Mondiale et le Fonds
pour l’Environnement Mondial est prévu le 31 décembre 2012.

Le présent rapport d’achèvement (i) rappelle le contexte, les objectifs et la conception du projet au moment
de sa préparation, (ii) analyse les principaux facteurs ayant affecté la mise en œuvre et les résultats du
projet, (iii) fait une évaluation des résultats atteints, (iv) fait une évaluation des risques pour le maintien de
ces résultats, (v) analyse les performances des parties prenantes à la préparation et à la mise œuvre du projet
et enfin, (vi) tire les principales leçons apprises.

Le projet est la seconde phase d’un Prêt Programmatique Adaptable (PPA), conçu pour appuyer le
Gouvernement à améliorer les conditions de vie en milieu rural. Au total, cinq (5) indicateurs ont été définis
pour mesurer l’atteinte de l’objectif de développement du projet, dont deux (2) se rapportant à l’objectif
environnemental global. Ces indicateurs ont été libellés ainsi qu’il suit:
- Pourcentage des Communes dans lesquelles plus de 50% de la population est satisfaite de la mise en
    œuvre des PDC à travers des Plans Annuels d’Investissements ;
- Pourcentage des Communes ciblées qui augmentent le taux de couverture des services sociaux par plus
    de 2%, dans l’un des trois secteurs suivants: éducation, santé, eau potable ;
- Pourcentage de bénéficiaires d’activités génératrices de revenus qui augmentent leur revenu de 30% ;
- Pourcentage de Communes ciblées dans lesquelles plus de 200 hectares additionnels de terres sont
    protégés;
- Pourcentage des communes ciblées ayant mis en place les commissions foncières qui ont commencé à
    délivrer des actes de transaction foncière.

En outre, deux indicateurs de déclencheur de phase ont été convenus et 21 indicateurs de performances ont
été définis dans le cadre de résultats du projet, dont les cinq (5) ci – dessus cités dans les accords de
financement du projet.

Trois composantes ont été définies et n’ont connu aucune modification durant la vie du projet : i) A :
Renforcement des Capacités (7,52 millions US$) ; ii) B : Fonds d’investissement local (31.80 millions
US$) et C : Gestion fiduciaire et suivi évaluation (4.77 millions US$).

B. ANALYSE DES FACTEURS AYANT AFFECTE LES RESULTATS DU PAC2

Le rôle nécessaire de l’équipe de projet (CNC et CRC) avait été sous-estimé. Ce rôle se résumait
principalement à (i) la gestion fiduciaire dans le cadre du dispositif de transfert de fonds, (ii) la mise en
œuvre du suivi-évaluation des activités du projet et (iii) la facilitation des activités mises en œuvre en
partenariat avec les institutions nationales. A la mise en œuvre, cette prévision s’est avérée trop optimiste
parce que, d’une part la majorité des acteurs d’accompagnement avaient une faible maîtrise du processus de
décentralisation et de la maîtrise d’ouvrage communale, et d’autre part les multiples changements
intervenus au sein des conseils municipaux n’a pas permis de valoriser les connaissances acquises lors des
formations dispensées par le projet. Il a donc fallu que l’équipe de projet, déjà en effectif réduit, réorganise
de fait ses attributions pour faire face à la sollicitation des communes.



                                                       54
Par ailleurs, les ressources prévues au titre des charges d’opérations du projet, qui ont été réduites de 68%
par rapport à la phase 1 du PAC, se sont avérées sous-évaluées. En effet, l’estimation de ces ressources s’est
basée sur le staff réduit, pour les raisons ci-dessous, mais n’a pas pris en compte l’accroissement de la
couverture géographique du projet qui est passée de 54 à 164 communes d’intervention et qui engendre
conséquemment des surcoûts d’opération.

Bien que la mise en vigueur des accords de financement du projet ait été effective dans les délais requis (24
décembre 2008 pour le financement IDA et FEM et 22 septembre 2009 pour celui du FIDA), le démarrage
effectif de la mise en œuvre du projet sur le terrain a connu un retard d’environ six mois, dû à (i) une lenteur
dans la mise en place du staff du projet, (ii) la lenteur dans le règlement des arriérés vis-à-vis des comptes
spéciaux IDA et FEM et (iii) la fin des mandats des différents conseils communaux.

Durant la mise en œuvre, le suivi d’exécution des activités du PAC-2 a été opérationnel et a enregistré une
performance satisfaisante tout au long de la durant la vie du projet. Cette performance a été réalisée grâce à
un dispositif d’acteurs organisé en quatre niveaux : communal, agents de développement local, régional et
national.

Les données nécessaires au renseignement des indicateurs du projet ont été collectées et traitées d’une part,
par le dispositif de suivi interne et d’autre part, par deux enquêtes23 auprès des ménages et des communes
bénéficiaires.

A l’évaluation ex ante, les risques environnementaux et sociaux potentiels inhérents à la mise en œuvre des
activités du projet ont été globalement jugés modérés. En conséquence, le projet a été classé en catégorie B
dans la classification environnementale et sociale de la Banque Mondiale. Les politiques opérationnelles de
la Banque mondiale relatives à l’ « Evaluation Environnementale (PO 4.01) » et au « Déplacement
Involontaire (PO 4.12) » ont été jugées applicables au projet.

Du fait de l’approche et de la démarche du projet qui sont fondées sur la demande, les mesures de
sauvegarde environnementale et sociale ont été définies à travers trois instruments à savoir: le Cadre de
Gestion Environnementale et Sociale (CGES), le Cadre Politique de Réinstallation des populations (CPR)
et le Cadre de Procédures de Réinstallation des Populations (CPRP). L’éligibilité et la sélection des actions
soumis au financement du projet sont restées entièrement conformes à cette classification. Sur les 1502 MP
réalisés dans le cadre du PAC2 (au 30 novembre 2012), on ne relève aucun microprojet de la catégorie A,
tous les microprojets relevant des catégories B et C.

Les microprojets réalisés avant 2011 ont fait l’objet d’un audit environnemental et social réalisé par le
BEEEI avec lequel le projet a établi un partenariat en 2011 pour le suivi environnemental et social des
activités du Projet. Cet audit a mis en exergue des insuffisances significatives pour les microprojets
financés en 2009 et 2010. Pour permettre la mise en œuvre diligente de mesures correctives, des avenants
sont préparés et en cours pour prendre en charge les mesures correctives.

En dépit des difficultés vécues, notamment en 2009 et 2010, les efforts de communication et de
renforcement de capacités à l’endroit des acteurs, ont permis d’enregistrer des acquis notables à ce jour :(i)
le reflexe de prendre en compte systématiquement les questions environnementales et sociales, (ii) le
respect effectif de la procédure nationale et celle de la Banque dans le domaine.
La gestion financière et comptable ainsi que la passation des marchés du PAC2 est satisfaisante. Les audits
annuels des comptes du projet ont été régulièrement réalisés par des auditeurs indépendants dont et les

rapports d’audits ont toujours été certifiés sans réserve. Outre ces audits, la gestion fiduciaire a été encadrée
par un dispositif de contrôle interne et par des missions de supervision externe régulièrement effectuées par
la Banque Mondiale et les structures étatiques. Cette performance dans la gestion fiduciaire a permis
d’atteindre un niveau de décaissement très satisfaisant (plus de 99% pour les fonds de l’IDA et du FEM au
30 novembre 2012).
C. EVALUATION DES RESULTATS

Pertinence de l’objectif, de la conception et de la mise en œuvre

Les objectifs du projet sont restés entièrement pertinents au regard du contexte dans lequel le projet s’est
exécuté. Les actions du projet ont permis (i) d’améliorer les capacités des communes à concevoir et à mettre
en œuvre leurs Plans de Développement Communaux (PDC) ainsi que les Plans Annuels d’Investissements
(PAI) qui en sont dérivés, (ii) de renforcer l’environnement juridique et institutionnel nécessaire pour
l’ancrage du processus de décentralisation, notamment en milieu rural, (iii) d’améliorer les conditions de
vie en milieu rural, (iii) de réduire la dégradation des terres et de promouvoir la gestion durable des terres
(GDT) au Niger.

Les objectifs du projet sont également restés en bon alignement sur les orientations de l’initiative
gouvernementale 3N « les Nigériens Nourrissent les Nigériens ».

L’approche d’intervention du PAC, fondée sur la participation et la responsabilisation des acteurs à la base
a été jugée très satisfaisante et porteuse pour tous les acteurs. La démarche du projet a mis l’accent sur
l’habilitation et la capacitation des communes rurales bénéficiaires à initier et conduire toutes les étapes de
la maîtrise d’ouvrage qui vont de la planification à l’évaluation, en passant par la passation des marchés
puis la gestion et le suivi physique et financier de l’exécution des contrats de prestation.

La couverture nationale du PAC2 ainsi que les critères de choix des communes d’intervention du projet, qui
sont principalement fondés sur le profil de vulnérabilité des communes et des villages puis le genre, ont été
bien appréciés par l’ensemble des parties prenantes. C’est l’un des rares projets qui aient intervenu dans les
zones dites difficiles, en raison de leur inaccessibilité et de la rareté des ressources naturelles (Bilma,
N’gourti et autres). Le nombre de 164 communes retenues pour l’intervention est aussi judicieux compte
tenu des ressources financières disponibles, notamment pour le fonds d’investissement local. Bien que ce
déploiement sur l’ensemble du territoire (toutes les 8 régions) ait été unanimement apprécié par les acteurs,
il est à noter que l’étendue de la zone d’intervention a engendré des coûts d’opérations élevés pour assurer
un encadrement efficace.

Le mode de financement des microprojets à la demande et sur la base d’une dotation indicative financière
(DIF) 24 par commune, établie et publiée auprès de l’ensemble des communes bénéficiaires, a été fortement
apprécié par les autorités administratives et les bénéficiaires. A partir de 2011, avec l’amélioration sensible
des capacités de consommation budgétaire des communes, les bénéficiaires ont commencé à déplorer
l’insuffisance de la dotation indicative financière (DIF) au regard des besoins en investissement.

Hormis le faible niveau d’adéquation entre les ressources humaines et l’étendue géographique de la zone
d’intervention, le dispositif organisationnel du PAC2, qui comporte une cellule régionale de coordination
dans chaque région et une cellule nationale, a été satisfaisant. Ce dispositif a permis d’assurer une relative
accessibilité du projet aux bénéficiaires et d’assurer un suivi accru pour garantir une gestion fiduciaire
satisfaisante.

La démarche du faire-faire a permis l’émergence de plusieurs opérateurs locaux (ONG, bureaux d’études,
consultants, entrepreneurs) et leurs capacités se sont progressivement améliorées par la pratique. Ceci a
engendré la création de plusieurs emplois. Les ONG constituent une proportion importante des partenaires
ayant exécuté des prestations pour les communes.
Niveau d’atteinte de l’objectif de développement du projet

En rappel, l’objectif de développement du projet (ODP) initial est d’améliorer les capacités des communes
à concevoir et à mettre en œuvre, de façon participative, des Plans de Développement Communaux (PDC)
et des Plans Annuels d’Investissements (PAI) dans le but d’améliorer les conditions de vie en milieu rural.

Le niveau d’atteinte des objectifs du projet est satisfaisant au regard des valeurs des indicateurs d’impacts et
des effets produits par les actions du projet.

En effet, le cadre institutionnel et juridique de mise en œuvre de la décentralisation s’est davantage renforcé
grâce au soutien du projet pour l’élaboration et la diffusion des textes.

Les enquêtes menées en 2012 ont montré que l’ensemble des communes et des communautés ciblées ont
montré une plus grande aptitude à concevoir et à mettre en œuvre, de façon participative, leurs Plans de
Développement Communaux (PDC) et leurs Plans Annuels d’Investissements (PAI). Un nombre
impressionnant de bénéficiaires ont accès aux services sociaux de base et/ou accru leurs revenus grâce aux
activités génératrices de revenus financées par le projet. D’importantes superficies de terres dégradées ont
été récupérées, accroissant ainsi le principal capital de base pour l’amélioration de la production agricole,
pastorale et sylvicole au profit des populations les plus pauvres, tout en réduisant en même temps leur
vulnérabilité.

Indicateurs de l’objectif de développement

Les cibles de tous les trois indicateurs définis pour mesurer le niveau d’atteinte de l’ODP ont toutes été
atteintes et même dépassées à la date du 30 septembre 2012 :

Pourcentage des Communes dans lesquelles plus de 50% de la population est satisfait de la mise en œuvre
des PDC à travers des Plans Annuels d’Investissements : la valeur cible de cet indicateur est de
63% ; L’enquête auprès des populations des communes bénéficiaires a montré que dans 92% des
Communes supportées par le projet, plus de 50% de la population est satisfaite de la mise en œuvre des
Plans de Développement Communaux (PDC). Le projet a soutenu la mise en œuvre de 164 Plans de
Développement Communaux (PDC) dont 64 ont été élaborés avec son appui ; Sur la base de ces PDC, des
PAI ont été régulièrement élaborés. Les activités identifiées dans ces PAI ont fait l’objet de 1449
conventions de cofinancement signées entre le PAC2 et les communes de la zone d’intervention, ce qui a
permis le financement et la réalisation de 1502 microprojets. Ces microprojets couvrent divers domaines
notamment les investissements socio-économiques et les activités génératrices de revenus. Au total, on
enregistre plus de 16 milliards de francs CFA directement gérés par les communes et les communautés et 1
586 793 personnes (soit 20,55% de la population totale des 164 communes ciblées) ont été bénéficiaires de
ces microprojets. Plus de la moitié (50.43%) de ces bénéficiaires sont des femmes;

Pourcentage des Communes ciblées qui augmentent le taux de couverture des services sociaux par plus de
2%, dans l’un des trois secteurs suivants: éducation, santé, eau potable : la valeur cible de cet indicateur est
de 50% pour chacun des trois secteurs concernés ; l’enquête auprès des bénéficiaires a montré que (i) 66%
des communes ciblées ont augmenté par plus de 2% le taux de couverture des services pour le secteur de
l’éducation, (ii) 55% des communes ciblées ont augmenté, de plus de 2%, le taux de couverture des services
pour le secteur de la santé, et (iii) 83% des communes ciblées ont augmenté de plus de 2% le taux de
couverture des services pour le secteur de l’eau potable. Les infrastructures socioéconomiques réalisées


                                                      57
avec l’appui du projet représentent 26,83% du nombre total de microprojets financés et elles ont bénéficié à
672 533 usagers (élèves, la population utilisant les puits, celle qui fréquente les centres de santé). Ces
infrastructures ont permis aux communes concernées d’améliorer sensiblement leur offre éducative,
sanitaire et celle en eau potable ;

Pourcentage de bénéficiaires d’activités génératrices de revenus qui augmentent leur revenu de 30% : la
valeur cible de cet indicateur est de 60% ; l’enquête a révélé que 75% des bénéficiaires d’activités
génératrices de revenus ont augmenté leur revenu de 30% au moins. Les activités génératrices ont connu un
engouement et une forte demande de la part des communautés. En effet, 627 microprojets (soit 41,74% du
total de microprojets réalisés) ont été mis en œuvre et ont bénéficié à 478 399 personnes dotées du fonds de
roulement initial en espèces ou en nature. Ce nombre est sensé s’accroître au fil des années, étant entendu
que le recouvrement des fonds auprès des bénéficiaires initiaux permettra de toucher de nouveaux
bénéficiaires en attente.

L’objectif global environnemental du projet est de réduire la dégradation des terres et de promouvoir la
gestion durable des terres (GDT) au Niger. Les cibles des deux indicateurs qui lui sont associés
sont atteintes au 30 septembre 2012. Ces indicateurs concernent:

Le pourcentage de Communes ciblées dans lesquelles plus de 200 hectares additionnels de terres sont
protégés : la valeur cible est de 60% ; Les données du suivi ont montré que dans 72% de Communes
ciblées, au moins 200 hectares additionnels de terres ont été récupérés et protégés. Au total, 472
microprojets de gestion durable des terres ou de gestion de ressources naturelles ont été réalisés et ont
permis, entre autres, la restauration de 32 202 ha de terres dégradées dont 8 133 ha reboisés pour les sites
bio-carbone, la restauration de 2217 ha de pâturage. Pour la mise en œuvre de ces microprojets, 4,5
milliards ont été redistribués sous-forme de rémunération «cash for work» à 432 565 personnes,
considérées comme les bénéficiaires immédiats. Cette rémunération a permis d’assurer la couverture des
besoins céréaliers de plus de 61 000 ménages pendant 3 mois.

Le pourcentage des communes ciblées ayant mis en place les commissions foncières qui ont commencé à
délivrer des actes de transaction foncière : la valeur cible est de 100%. Les données collectées par le
dispositif de suivi-évaluation montrent que 99% des communes ciblées ont mis en place des commissions
foncières qui ont commencé à délivrer des actes de transaction foncière. Au total, 162 commissions
foncières communales ont été mises en place et rendues opérationnelles; celles-ci ont commencé à délivrer
des titres, permettant ainsi d’améliorer les conditions de production agricole et sylvicole grâce à une
sécurité foncière accrue. Pour les deux autres le processus est terminé de mise en place est terminé.

Les deux indicateurs déclencheurs pour permettre le passage de la phase 2 à la phase 3 ont également atteint
un niveau appréciable (pour le premier la valeur cible est atteinte et pour le second le niveau atteint est
satisfaisant). Ces indicateurs sont:

Les textes d’application pour la mise en œuvre du Code Général des Collectivités Territoriales sont
adoptés et disséminés : Le Code Général des Collectivités Territoriales a été élaboré et adopté par
l’Ordonnance N° 2010-54 du 17 septembre 2010. Il a été largement diffusé. Les textes d’application sont
progressivement préparés et adoptés par voie règlementaire. On dénombre actuellement dix-sept textes
dont neuf ont été adoptés, diffusés et servent de référence aux communes pour la mise en œuvre des actions
de développement. D’autres outils ont été élaborés, édités et diffusés auprès des communes et des régions
en vue d’une meilleure compréhension et d’une bonne application des textes sur la décentralisation par les
acteurs.

Le fonds de péréquation pour les Collectivités locales est mis en place et est opérationnel : Le
Gouvernement a retenu de loger le fonds de péréquation au niveau de l’Agence Nationale de Financement


                                                    58
des Collectivités Territoriales (ANFICT), créée en 2008. Les documents de référence de cette structure,
dont le manuel de procédures, ont été élaborés et adoptés. Parmi les sept (7) textes de lois élaborés, trois (3)
ont été adoptés, et constituent le cadre réglementaire et légal du fonds de péréquation. Le parachèvement de
son dispositif opérationnel est en cours, avec la nomination du Directeur Général et du Président du Conseil
d’Administration, et sera terminé avant 2013.
Evaluation des résultats et effets par composante

Composante A : Renforcement des capacités
Le renforcement des capacités visait, d’une part à habiliter les communes à assumer leur rôle d’animation et
de promotion du développement local, notamment en matière de gestion administrative, technique et
fiscale, et d’autre part à appuyer les principales reformes institutionnelles afin de créer les conditions
favorables à la mise en œuvre de la décentralisation.

Les valeurs cibles de l’ensemble des six (6) indicateurs de performance associés à cette composante ont été
atteintes et dépassées.

Au niveau national, le soutien du projet a permis au Gouvernement d’élaborer le Code Général des
Collectivités Territoriales qui a été adopté par l’Ordonnance N° 2010-54 du 17 septembre 2010. Suite à son
adoption, dix-sept (17) textes ont été élaborés dont neuf ont été adoptés, diffusés et servent de référence aux
communes pour la mise en œuvre des actions de développement. Par ailleurs, le projet a également soutenu
la mise en place de mécanisme de financement pérenne des collectivités à travers l’appui au Gouvernement
pour le renforcement des instruments devant servir de base à l’opérationnalisation de l’Agence Nationale de
Financement des Collectivités Territoriales (ANFICT) créée en 2008. Sept (7) textes de lois sont élaborés,
dont trois ont été adoptés, ainsi qu’un manuel de procédures, rendus disponibles pour régir le
fonctionnement du fonds de péréquation.

Au niveau des communes, le renforcement des capacités a permis une meilleure appropriation de leur place
et de leur rôle dans l’animation du développement local, ainsi qu’une grande aptitude à exercer la maîtrise
d’ouvrage communale qui s’est traduite par l’exécution de 1502 microprojets. Au total, 64 PDC ont été
élaborés/actualisés, 141 sessions de Comités départementaux et régionaux d’analyse de microprojets, 2213
dossiers de microprojets élaborés et soumis aux sessions de CDAP/CRAP. Pour garantir une utilisation
durable des investissements, 821 comités de gestion mis en place, formés et fonctionnels. Les commissions
foncières communales ont été mises en place dans 99% des communes ciblées et sont rendues aptes à
délivrer des titres de sécurisation foncière.

Cela a été possible grâce à la formation de 2 288 acteurs communaux (élus locaux et cadres de
l’administration communale) sur divers thèmes relatifs à la maîtrise d’ouvrage communale, et de 366
agents des ONG et autres opérateurs d’appui-conseil aux communes sur l’élaboration des dossiers de
microprojet, le concept de projet « Mécanisme de Développement Propre – MDP » et la communication de
proximité. Pour l’amélioration de cadre légal et institutionnel d’appui au développement local, 931 agents
des institutions nationales formés sur diverses thématiques (Gestion Durable des Terres, sauvegarde
environnementale et sociale, gestion axée sur les résultats) dont 39 ont bénéficié de formations modulaires
à l’extérieur du Niger.

Toutefois, au regard de l’instabilité qui a caractérisé les conseils municipaux, après que bon nombre de
formations aient été déjà dispensées par le projet, les acquis ci-dessus énumérés restent à être consolidés
dans le cadre de la troisième phase, notamment en ce qui concerne l’appropriation des textes sur la
décentralisation, les techniques de négociation pour la mobilisation des ressources nécessaires au
financement des plans de développement communaux ainsi que les stratégies de mobilisation des
ressources propres.



                                                      59
Composante B : Fonds d’Investissement local
Cette composante visait l’amélioration des conditions de vie des populations, notamment en rehaussant le
niveau d’accès aux services sociaux de base, du niveau de revenus et l’amélioration des capacités
productives des ressources naturelles de base dont dépendent la grande majorité des populations rurales.

Les valeurs cibles de quatre indicateurs sur les six (6) indicateurs de performance définis pour la mesure des
résultats de cette composante ont été atteintes et dépassées. Le mécanisme de transfert de fonds aux
communes et les acteurs impliqués dans l’exercice de la maîtrise d’ouvrage ont été performants.

La mise en œuvre de ce mécanisme s’est faite conformément au manuel des procédures du projet qui a été
diffusé auprès des partenaires et des bénéficiaires. Ce manuel a clairement défini les critères d’éligibilité
des communes bénéficiaires, les conditions d’accès au fonds d’investissement local, les modalités de
détermination de la dotation indicative financière (DIF)25, les obligations des parties ainsi que la démarche
et les outils de sa mise en œuvre. Ces dispositions de transparence et de redevabilité ont été très
positivement appréciées par les bénéficiaires et l’ensemble des acteurs.

En dépit de l’instabilité des conseils municipaux en 2009 et 2010, les communes et les communautés ont
réalisé 1502 microprojets, dont 403 pour les infrastructures socioéconomiques, 627 pour les activités
génératrices de revenus et 472 pour la gestion durable des terres. La réalisation des ces investissements a
nécessité la mobilisation d’environ 16 milliards de francs CFA dont 8,68% représente la contribution des
bénéficiaires. Près 1.6 millions de personnes sont bénéficiaires de ces investissements qui ont permis de
rehausser l’accès aux services sociaux de base d’au moins 2% dans plus de la moitié des communes ciblées,
d’augmenter de plus de 30% le revenu de 358 799 bénéficiaires d’activités génératrices de revenus,
récupérer 32 202 ha de terres dégradées, de reboiser 8 133 ha de terres dégradées dans le volet bio carbone
et de restaurer 2 217 ha de pâturage.

Composante C : Gestion et suivi-évaluation
L’objectif de cette composante était d’appuyer (i) la gestion financière et administrative, (ii) le
suivi-évaluation du projet axé sur les résultats ainsi que le suivi de l’impact du projet. Le niveau d’atteinte
des cibles des 4 indicateurs de performance associés à cette composante est satisfaisant.
La gestion financière du PAC-2 est satisfaisante. Les comptes ont été régulièrement audités et tous les
rapports certifiés sans réserve.

Le système de suivi-évaluation, qui comprend le suivi des performances et des effets/impacts, a pleinement
assuré ses fonctions et a permis de produire régulièrement les documents de campagne à savoir les
programmes et rapports trimestriels d’activités ainsi que des notes d’informations qui sont diffusés à
l’intention des acteurs du projet, des ministères impliqués et des partenaires techniques et financiers. Le
projet a également aidé à la mise en place de système de suivi-évaluation fonctionnel au niveau de 132
communes.

Analyse du niveau et rythme de décaissement

Le coût total du projet est de 61 530 000 $EU. Sur la base d’un taux moyen de conversion de 450 FCFA
pour un (1) dollar des Etats-Unis soit un montant de 27 721 638 000 FCFA. Les montants des financements
par bailleur se présentent comme suit : IDA 30 000 000 $US, FEM 4 670 000 $US, FIDA 16 000 000 $US,
Etat: 6 600 000 $US, Bénéficiaires : 4 260 000 $US.



25
  DIF = P x C1 + C2 x (A x Id), avec: P = nombre d’habitants ; C1 = le coefficient associé à la densité de la population. C2=le
coefficient associé à la vulnérabilité environnementale. A = taille du cheptel en UBT Id = Indice de risque de désertification.


                                                              60
Pour les financements de l’IDA et du FEM, dont l’achèvement est prévu le 31 décembre 2012, les taux de
décaissement étaient respectivement de 99,86% et 99,82% au 30 novembre 2012.

Les autres sources de financement, dont l’achèvement est prévu en 2013, ont des niveaux de décaissement
moindre (75% pour le FIDA, 51% pour l’Etat et 87% pour la contribution des bénéficiaires). A la même
date, sur un montant total prévisionnel (toutes sources de financement confondues) de 27 721 638 000
FCFA (valeur du financement au taux de 450 FCFA), 24 213 843 624 FCFA a été décaissé, soit un taux de
décaissement global, de 87,35%.

Le projet a connu un faible décaissement au cours de la 1ère année (38,5% du PTBA 2009), en raison du long
délai de mise en place du staff du projet. Le taux de décaissement s’est nettement accru les autres années,
bien que les prévisions annuelles fussent de plus en plus importantes.
Les niveaux actuels de décaissement de la contrepartie de l’Etat et de la contribution des bénéficiaires
s’expliquent par, d’une part la survenue d’aléas non prévisibles notamment la crise alimentaire de 2010
- 2011 et les inondations de 2012 qui ont fortement sollicité les ressources de l’Etat et impacté sur la
mobilisation des ressources fiscales des communes, et d’autre part la crise sociopolitique qui a ébranlé la
stabilité institutionnelle dans le pays.

Efficacité et Efficience

Le niveau d’efficacité et d’efficience du projet est jugé satisfaisant. Comme le montre l’ensemble des
indicateurs de performance, le projet a éteint ses objectifs, aux plans quantitatif et qualitatif, avec les
ressources prévues. Le ratio Coûts d’opérations sur coûts d’investissement pour cette phase (13% du coût
total du projet) s’est réduit par rapport à celui de la phase 1 (16%), avec une couverture géographique qui a
triplé.

Par ailleurs, le taux de remboursement des prêts contractés par les bénéficiaires initiaux dans le cadre des
microprojets d’activités génératrices de revenus (AGR) est très élevé et 75% des bénéficiaires ont accru
leurs revenus de plus de 30%. Cela a permis de toucher de nouveaux bénéficiaires et multiplier le nombre
de bénéficiaires par 1,72 (en moins de deux ans). Ces données montent que les AGR ont un taux de
rentabilité interne élevé et un délai de retour sur investissement inférieur à deux ans. Des dispositions sont
prises par le projet pour réaliser une analyse économique et financière des investissements du projet.

Justification de la notation globale des résultats

L’appréciation d’ensemble des résultats du projet est très satisfaisante. Les cibles de l’ensemble des
indicateurs de l’objectif de développement sont atteintes et mêmes dépassées. Il en est de même pour la
quasi-totalité des indicateurs de performance du projet. Les objectifs et l’approche du projet sont restés
pertinents tout au long de sa mise en œuvre. Les bénéficiaires ont exprimé leur satisfaction pour les actions
réalisées par le projet.

Thèmes généraux, autres résultats et impacts

Impacts sur la pauvreté, genre et développement social
Grâce au mécanisme de ciblage des groupes vulnérables mis en œuvre dans le cadre du projet, la femme est
la classe sociale la plus touchée par les bénéfices des investissements du PAC2, comme le montre le
tableau 26 ci-après. Outre l’amélioration de l’accès aux services sociaux de base, le projet a
substantiellement contribué à la réduction de la pauvreté, principalement au niveau des groupes
vulnérables. Et cela, à travers la création d’emplois ruraux et de revenus engendrés par la mise en œuvre des

627 microprojets d’activités génératrices de revenus ainsi que des 472 microprojets de gestion durable des
terres et des ressources naturelles. Ces microprojets ont accru de plus de 30% les revenus de 358 799
personnes bénéficiaires d’activités génératrices de revenus (AGR). Ces revenus additionnels ont
principalement été utilisés pour l’amélioration de l’alimentation, la prise en charge des frais de scolarisation
des enfants, l’équipement agricole et la contribution aux évènements sociaux.

Toutefois, du fait de la faible représentation des femmes au sein des conseils municipaux, elles ont peu
bénéficié de renforcement de capacités sur la gouvernance locale, ce qui risque de porter préjudice à leur
pleine participation citoyenne à la vie des communes.
Impacts institutionnels
Au niveau national, le cadre normatif de la décentralisation est rendu disponible et se consolide davantage
avec l’élaboration et l’adoption des textes d’application de la loi portant code général des collectivités
territoriales. Au niveau local, l’organisation interne des communes ciblées a été parachevée avec la mise en
place des commissions foncières communales, des commissions foncières de base au niveau villageois,
ainsi que la dynamisation des commissions spécialisées.

Les communes ont régulièrement sollicité les services techniques de l’Etat, les ONG et les prestataires de
services privés, pour les accompagner dans le cadre de l’élaboration des plans de développement
communaux, les plans annuels d’investissements, les dossiers des microprojets à soumettre au projet. Cette
sollicitation a indirectement créé des compétences et des aptitudes au sein de ces entités qui ont appris en
faisant (learning by doing), renforçant ainsi l’offre de service en matière d’appui-accompagnement pour la
maîtrise d’ouvrage locale.

Autres résultats et impacts inattendus (positifs ou négatifs)

Le projet a eu d’importants impacts positifs sur la vulnérabilité des ménages des communes ciblées et la
reconstruction des moyens d’existence, notamment suite aux sécheresses, aux inondations et aux
rapatriements forcés de populations émigrées qui résidaient dans certains pays en crise.

Bien souvent, les projets à approche communautaire et décentralisée, ont connu des difficultés pour la prise
en compte adéquate des groupes vulnérables. Dans le cas du PAC2, le cofinancement du projet par
plusieurs bailleurs s’est avéré un facteur de complémentarité et de synergie, qui a enrichi la démarche du
projet. En effet, les outils de ciblage des groupes vulnérables développé avec l’appui du FIDA, ont permis
d’enrichir la démarche d’identification des bénéficiaires et de planification participative des activités,
bonifiant ainsi l’impact du projet dans le domaine de la réduction de la pauvreté au sein des groupes les plus
défavorisés et les plus vulnérables.
Résumé des résultats de l’appréciation des bénéficiaires et des ateliers des parties prenantes

Deux enquêtes ont été conduites par le projet avec l’appui de l’Institut National de la Statistique et des
données ont aussi été collectées par le dispositif interne de suivi des indicateurs. Il ressort que (i) environ
92,6 % des chefs de ménages sont satisfaits des activités réalisées par les communes ciblées et 70,4 %
affirment avoir bénéficié des actions de leurs communes. Plus de 47 % des chefs de ménage affirment que
la population participe à la réalisation des actions prioritaires de leurs communes. Ces études ont aussi
montré que les microprojets ont ciblé les personnes les plus vulnérables et que le PAC2 a réduit la
vulnérabilité des bénéficiaires).

D. EVALUATION DES RISQUES POUR LE MAINTIEN DES RESULTATS

Les risques pouvant affecter la durabilité des investissements réalisés par le projet sont jugés globalement
modérés. Ces risques potentiels sont d’ordres techniques, économiques et financiers, environnementaux et
institutionnels.

Risques techniques. Les risques techniques pouvant impacter sur la durabilité des résultats est modéré. Les
microprojets ont été conçus et dimensionnés pour être maîtrisables et duplicables par les bénéficiaires,
moyennant des formations techniques appropriées à dispenser avant l’exécution des microprojets.

Risques sociaux et organisationnels. L’intervention du projet est fondée sur une approche participative,
inclusive et décentralisée qui répond à la demande des bénéficiaires. C’est pourquoi le projet s’est assuré de
la participation effective de toutes les couches sociales et professionnelles lors de l’élaboration des plans de
développement communaux et des plans annuels d’investissement, dont la mise en œuvre requiert la
contribution de bénéficiaires.

Risques économiques et financiers. Les risques économiques et financiers potentiels sont principalement
liés à l’insuffisance de ressources financières pour assurer le maintien de la fonctionnalité des
infrastructures et à l’effondrement des prix des productions agro-sylvo-pastoraux. Ces risques sont jugés
très modérés dans la mesure où la l’adoption des textes sur la décentralisation et ceux sur la mobilisation et
les transferts fiscaux ainsi que le retour à la stabilité institutionnelle.

Risques environnementaux. Les risques environnementaux pouvant affecter la durabilité des acquis du
projet sont principalement associés à la variabilité climatique qui expose constamment les communautés
rurales du Niger, à l’instar de tous les pays sahéliens, à une production agro-sylvo-pastorale aléatoire. Ces
risques, notamment de sécheresse et d’inondation, sont jugés significatifs au regard de l’historique des
évènements climatiques de trente (30) dernières années. Les risques environnementaux négatifs liés à la
mise en œuvre de microprojets sont modérés. Tous les microprojets financés sont classés en catégorie B ou
C.

Risques institutionnels. Les risques institutionnels pour la durabilité des acquis du projet sont
principalement inhérents, d’une part aux insuffisances de clarté et de cohérence du cadre normatif de la
décentralisation, et d’autre part au manque de cohésion au sein des conseils municipaux et/ou entre les
autorités municipales et les autorités coutumières. Ces risques peuvent engendrer des conflits d’autorité de
nature à affaiblir la synergie et la mutualisation indispensable des énergies pour la mise en œuvre efficiente
des plans de développement communaux, et plus globalement, pour l’animation et l’orientation du
développement local; mais la conception et l’approche du projet ont pris en compte ces risques.
E. APPRECIATION DES PERFORMANCE DES PARTIES PRENANTES
Performance de l’emprunteur

Performance du Gouvernement
La performance du gouvernement est jugée satisfaisante. En effet, après la préparation, l’évaluation, la
négociation et la signature des accords de financement de l’IDA et du FEM le 25 septembre 2008, le


                                                      63
Gouvernement à réussi à obtenir la mise en vigueur du projet le 24 décembre 2008. Il a également poursuivi
ses efforts de négociation avec le FIDA qui ont abouti à la signature de l’accord de financement le 15
janvier 2009.

Pendant la mise en œuvre, le Gouvernement a toujours assuré un suivi et un pilotage adéquat du projet qui
sont matérialisés par la tenue régulière des session du comité de pilotage, la participation aux missions de
supervision du projet, la mobilisation de la contrepartie de l’Etat pour le cofinancement du projet,
l’adoption des textes législatifs et règlementaires nécessaires à la mise en œuvre efficace du projet et la
mobilisation des ressources humaines au sein des services techniques de l’Etat pour accompagner les
communes dans l’exécution des actions du projet au niveau communal.

Toutefois, la lenteur accusée dans la mise en place de l’équipe de projet a occasionné un démarrage tardif de
l’exécution sur le terrain.

Performance de l’agence d’exécution

La performance de l’agence d’exécution, en l’occurrence la cellule nationale de coordination du projet, est
très satisfaisante. La rigueur dans la planification et le suivi des activités a permis d’une part, de résorber le
retard accusé au démarrage du projet et d’autre part, de décaisser la totalité des fonds prévus pour l’IDA et
le FEM et d’assurer la liquidation de tous les engagements avant la date de clôture. Les audits des comptes
sont régulièrement réalisés et les rapports d’audits sont toujours certifiés sans réserve. Par ailleurs, il faut
noter que sur une prévision de couverture géographique initiale de 106 communes (40% des communes du
pays), le projet a couvert 164 communes (grâce aux ressources financières mobilisées auprès du FIDA)
avec quasiment les mêmes ressources humaines.

La Cellule Nationale de Coordination de Projet a assuré, concomitamment, la gestion fiduciaire et le
suivi-évaluation de trois projets dont le Projet d’Urgence pour l’appui à la Sécurité Alimentaire et le
Développement Rural (PUSA-DR, financement FIDA), le Projet d’Amélioration de la Productivité
Agricole en Afrique de l’Ouest (PPAAO, financement IDA) et le Projet d’Actions Communautaires pour la
Résilience Climatique (PAC/RC, financement IDA).

Performance des partenaires techniques et financiers

La performance des partenaires techniques et financiers (la Banque mondiale, le FEM et le FIDA) est très
satisfaisante. Ils ont assuré, aux côtés du Gouvernement, la préparation et la qualité du document
d’évaluation de projet ainsi que des accords de financement. La qualité de la préparation s’est traduite par la
pertinence des objectifs et de l’approche constatés tout au long de l’exécution du projet. Ces partenaires ont
régulièrement conduit des missions de supervision (7 missions) et de revue à mi-parcours. Ces missions ont
fait plusieurs recommandations idoines qui ont permis au projet de prendre des mesures correctives,
notamment en ce qui concerne (i) la mise en œuvre des mesures de sauvegarde, les plantations bio-carbone,
le système de suivi-évaluation au niveau communal, etc. Les traitements des demandes de remboursement
de fonds se sont faits de manière diligente, ce qui a permis l’alimentation régulière des comptes spéciaux du
projet. Aucune tension de trésorerie n’a été notée au cours l’exécution du projet.


F. PRINCIPALES LEÇONS APPRISES ET RECOMMANDATIONS

Les principales leçons à capitaliser de la préparation et la mise en œuvre de cette phase sont:

La maîtrise d’ouvrage locale, un facteur de durabilité des acquis du projet : En confiant aux communes et
aux communautés la responsabilité d’identifier leurs besoins, de planifier les actions de développement et



                                                       64
de les exécuter, les bénéficiaires ont mieux appréhendé les coûts (en ressources financières et humaines)
des investissements et ont développé un sentiment de fierté et de responsabilité d’assurer leur valorisation
optimale et durable. C’est un gage d’appropriation qui augure des impacts positifs qui vont se consolider
dans la durée, par la pratique et l’expérience des acteurs locaux.

Le renforcement des capacités, clef du succès des projets à approche décentralisée : Le Gouvernement a
marqué sa volonté d’aller vers un développement décentralisé, piloté par les acteurs à la base. Toutefois,
dans un contexte où l’analphabétisme persiste de façon endémique notamment en milieu rural,
l’appropriation des principes et objectifs de la décentralisation, la maîtrise de la démarche, des outils et des
exigences du développement local par une masse critique d’acteurs au niveau local, restent des défis
majeurs à relever. Le renforcement des capacités des élus locaux et des autres acteurs apparaît
incontournable pour ancrer véritablement la décentralisation et en faire une approche de développement
humain durable. La planification, la préparation et l’exécution des 1502 microprojets au cours de cette
phase ont été possibles moyennant un important dispositif d’information, de formation et d’encadrement
des bénéficiaires ;

La stabilité des institutions locales, gage de réinvestissement des acquis : Les institutions locales,
notamment les communes rurales, bien souvent dotées d’une administration municipale embryonnaire,
acquièrent des aptitudes et une certaine opérationnalité grâce aux formations reçues qui sont consolidées
par l’exercice pratique. Les renouvellements brusques et répétés des membres des conseils municipaux
conduisent à la perte de ce capital de connaissances et d’expériences qu’il faut sans cesse renouveler. Entre
2010 et 2011, les changements des acteurs au sein des communes, à trois reprises, a fortement ébranlé les
capacités opérationnelles des communes. Fort heureusement, le développement des capacités des acteurs
d’accompagnement (services techniques de l’Etat, ONG et prestataires) à travers l’apprentissage par la
pratique (learning by doing) a énormément aidé à amoindrir les impacts négatifs de cette instabilité ;

Activités génératrices de revenus, moyen efficace de réduction de la pauvreté et la vulnérabilité à la
variabilité climatique : Les résultats du projet ont montré que les AGR permettent de créer de nombreux
emplois ruraux et d’accroître substantiellement les revenus des bénéficiaires. Mieux, elles permettent de
diversifier les sources de revenus des populations, les rendant ainsi résilientes aux risques de sécheresses et
d’inondations dont les probabilités d’occurrence sont de plus en plus élevées au Sahel. Cependant, le niveau
de la contribution demandée aux bénéficiaires, pour accéder aux microprojets générateurs de revenus, est
jugé élevé notamment par les groupes vulnérables (les femmes, les jeunes et les handicapés), surtout
pendant les périodes de crise alimentaire.
