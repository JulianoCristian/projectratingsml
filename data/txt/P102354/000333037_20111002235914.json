{"cdata!": "The objective of the Second Phase of the\n            Community Action Program Grant Project (PAC2) for Niger is\n            to improve rural communes' capacity to design and\n            implement in a participatory manner Communal Development\n            Plans (CDP) and Annual Investment Plans (AIP) and therefore\n            contributing to enhance rural livelihoods. The project\n            constitutes the second phase of the Community Action Program\n            (a 12 year APL). The country's political and\n            institutional context is challenging. Implementation of the\n            Project is on track but could experience difficulties if an\n            adjustment is not made to the disbursement scheme so that\n            the underestimated cost of selected activities is\n            appropriately corrected. The initial estimation for\n            operating costs was based on the PAC1 coverage of 54\n            communes instead of the actual 164 communes covered by the\n            PAC2. Overall, changes are minor."}, "docdt": "2011-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
