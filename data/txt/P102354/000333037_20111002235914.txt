         SECOND PHASE OF THE COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM

                   GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY (GEF)
                           GRANT TF 92411- NE



SUMMARY
This memorandum seeks your approval for a reallocation of Grant proceeds, to support
the achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDO). The IDA Grant (H423
NE) of USD 30,000,000 was approved on August 29, 2008 and the GEF Grant
(TF92411) of USD 4,670,000 was approved by the Board on September 25, 2008. Both
grants became effective on December 24, 2008. The Recipient, in its letters attached in
this memo, requested a reallocation of Grant proceeds among disbursement categories in
the International Development Association Financing Agreement and the Global
Environment Facility Grant Agreement signed on September 25, 2008.

The PDO is to improve the capacity of the rural Communes to design and implement in a
participatory manner Communal Development Plans and Annual Investment Plans, in
order to enhance rural livelihoods.

The Project constitutes the second phase of the Community Action Program (a 12 year
APL).

The country’s political and institutional context is challenging. Implementation of the
Project is on track but could experience difficulties if an adjustment is not made to the
disbursement scheme so that the underestimated cost of selected activities is
appropriately corrected. The initial estimation for operating costs was based on the PAC1
coverage of 54 communes instead of the actual 164 communes covered by the PAC2.
Overall, the proposed changes are minor.


PROJECT STATUS
The Mid Term Review took place from May 9 to 24, 2011. As a result the Development
Objective (D.O) is rated satisfactory while the Implementation Progress is moderately
satisfactory. By its end, the Project is likely to achieve its D.O.


                                           4
As of August 22, 2011, the disbursement rate is 74.91 percent for the Second Phase of
the Community Action Program (H423 NE) and 81.27 percent for Global Environment
Facility Grant (TF 92411).


PROPOSED CHANGES
FINANCING

The purpose of the proposed reallocation is to adjust some of the categories in order to
meet the Government’s ongoing and planned commitments by focusing on priority
actions. The changes requested are not significant and will not affect the PDO and the
results framework

The objectives pursued through activities under various Categories will be fully achieved
with reallocation. Most of the goods and equipment have already been acquired.

H 423 NE : Reallocation of funds: To date the project has disbursed USD 21,676
million (74.91 %) of total amount (30 million). The proposed reallocation of the Grant
proceeds is shown in the table below (Annex1). Overall the project amount to be
reallocated is equivalent to USD 930,000 (3.1% of Grant) which is the unallocated part of
the project. The status of categories will be as follows:

   (1) Works, Goods, Consultants ‘Services, audits, and Training : There is no increase
       in the category

   (2) Matching Grant : There is no increase in the category

   (3) Matching Grant : There is no increase in the category

   (4) Operating Cost: The increase in this category is the biggest part of the
       reallocation. The increase will be from 1,350,000 to 2,562,000.

   (5) Refund of PPF: The amount allocated is XDR 420.000 and the revised amount is
       XDR 138,000 of the unallocated amount.

TF 92411 - Reallocation of funds: The project has disbursed, to date, USD 3.795 million
(81,27%) of total amount (4.670 million). The proposed reallocation of the Grant
proceeds is shown in the table below (Annex2). This reallocation is aiming at better
support to the project from the National Coordination and Regional Coordination Units

The status of categories will be as follows:

   (1) Works, Goods, Consultants ‘Services, audits, and Training : There is a reduction
       in the category; the decrease is from USD 1,430,000 to USD 1,040,000 ;

   (2) Matching Grant : There is no increase in the category

                                               5
(3) Operating Cost: The increase in this category is the biggest part of the
    reallocation. The increase will be from USD 240,000 to USD 630,000.
