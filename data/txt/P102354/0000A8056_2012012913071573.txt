                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation speed has critically increased within the country’ s new favorable institutional circumstances characterized by the installation from July /August 2011 of the
                         network of newly elected mayors and municipal councils at the local level. However, Niger is facing new other challenges constituted of Libyan crisis resulting in return to home of
                         about 210,000 repatriates and deficit of about 520,000 tons in food staples production resulting of a bad rainy season. Nevertheless the implementation has progressed well and
                         actual results in terms of physical achievements and disbursement rating are satisfactory. Overall the PDO and the implementation progress are satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The IFAD and the Bank teams have agreed with the government to pursue: (i) intense implementation support missions and (ii) inter-communal structuring investments in socio
                         economic infrastructures to keep the good trend of disbursement on the LIF component. However, IDA and GEF funding will likely be totally disbursed by June 30, 2012 i.e 10 months
                         before the Project normal closure. During the mission, the GoN and various stakeholders have called to the Bank for helping to avoid any financing disruption between the CAP 2 and
