Public Sector\n            Adjustment Loan/Credit Project for Pakistan was marginally\n            satisfactory. The project achieved some of its objectives,\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of the Bank was marginally\n            satisfactory while the Borrower's was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            lessons of experience from previous adjustment operations\n            need to be built into the design of succeeding operations.\n            Second, care must be taken by the Bank to avoid sending\n            unclear or mixed messages to a Government regarding the\n            prerequisites of adjustment lending. Third, it may take\n            years to prepare adequately to seize a moment. Fourth,\n            covenants should be concentrated only on measures which the\n            Bank has existing in-depth knowledge. Fifth, adjustment\n            operations can be designed with a \"process\n            approach\". Sixth, the design of reform programs should\n            be replete with ID measures to strengthen both near-term and\n            long-term implementation capacity. Seventh, supervision\n            should be forward looking and focused not so much upon\n            details of compliance and actions taken as upon problem\n            solving and implementation assistance. Finally, governance\n            is generally crucial to sustainability."}, "docdt": "1996-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
