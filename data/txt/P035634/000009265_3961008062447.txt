MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A PRIVATE SECTOR COMPETITIVENESS PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 8.3 million (US$12.3 million equivalent)
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for private sector
competitiveness.
2.    Country Background. Uganda embarked upon an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in
May 1987 which evolved into a broad Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in 1991. The
objective of the program was to bring about rapid and sustained improvements in the standard of
living of the average Ugandan. The objective was to be achieved through policy and structural
reforms aimed at: (i) restoring internal and external financial stability and lowering inflation
through prudent fiscal and monetary management; (ii) creating the conditions for rapid and
sustained growth of GDP through deregulation of the incentive and regulatory framework; and (iii)
developing human capital through investments in education, health and other social services. The
reforms have had a positive outcome on a number of counts. GDP grew by an average of 5.8
percent per year from 1986/87 to 1993/94, a gain of about 2.9 percent per capita per year.
Reflecting the present coffee boom, the estimate for GDP growth in 1994/95 is 10 percent.
Annual inflation has been reduced to 7.8 percent in 1994. Exchange rate stability has also largely
accompanied price stability although there was some appreciation of the Ugandan shilling against
the US dollar in 1994. Challenges remain in trying to extend this period of macroeconomic
stability, not least in addressing issues associated with long-standing current account and fiscal
deficits. Furthermore, notwithstanding its successes on the macroeconomic front, Uganda remains
among the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income of only US$220 in 1994.
3.    According to projections in the latest Country Economic Memorandum, GDP is expected
to grow by about 7 percent in 1995/96, by 6.5 percent in 1996/97, and by about 5.5 percent
thereafter, assuming a continuing satisfactory performance in stabilization and structural reform.
However, resource balance deficits are also expected to increase from 1997/98, after some
reduction between 1994/95 and 1996/97.  These projections underline the fragility of the
macroeconomic stability and the need to deepen the structural adjustment over the medium term --
in particular, in the areas of public sector reform, improved financial sector performance, and
improved incentives to exporters.
4.    Project Rationale. The Ugandan private sector remains fragile and underdeveloped.
First, many firms are still in their infancy: about one-third of the over 100,000 private companies
and business names registered in Uganda have been established in the last four years. Second,
most firms are extremely small: the micro and small enterprise sector (fewer than 10 employees)
provides 90 percent of total non-farm employment, with large enterprises accounting for only 6
percent. Third, the informal sector is important, particularly in agriculture (employing 80 percent
of the labor force) which is dominated by rural smallholders and subsistence farmers. Fourth,
diversification into exports has been limited (Uganda still relies heavily on donor assistance to



finance its current account deficit); private investment has only picked up recently; and there are
weaknesses in private sector capacity. These factors are constraining the supply response needed
to drive further growth over the medium to long term.
5.    There are four key factors likely to affect the growth of the Ugandan private sector in the
near future: (a) the size and growth of markets for the output of the private sector; (b) a policy
environment that minimizes uncertainty and controls while maximizing incentives for
investment, production, and trade; (c) a supportive business infrastructure (including efficient
legal and financial systems; modem physical infrastructure; responsive civil service; effective
business service providers); and (d) elimination of the existing gaps in capabilities of Ugandan
firms (i.e., low capitalization, lack of know-how, inadequate corporate culture, lack of export
marketing networks, etc.).
6.    The project supports the Government's strategy for developing the private sector in
Uganda. This strategy - as outlined in the Private Sector Policy Statement - will focus on the
following areas:
(a)   improving the policy environment by decreasing budget deficits and further
liberalizing markets while reducing any remaining anti-export bias;
(b)   upgrading the business infrastructure by reforming laws and regulations,
restructuring the financial sector, accelerating privatization, and improving the
performance of existing physical infrastructure while encouraging the development
of new facilities by the private sector itself, and
(c)   filling the gaps in the capabilities of Ugandan firms so that they can expand on a
more demanding domestic market and on highly competitive international markets.
7.    The project focuses on the third area: the competitiveness of the Ugandan private sector
that needs to be improved for a sufficient supply response to materialize and for the long-term
sustainability of ongoing reforms. The most effective way in which the Ugandan private sector
can enhance its capacity within a short time span is to tap from available private sources of
technical and managerial know-how and finance. The project adopts this approach which leaves
most decisions in private hands and does not rely on the public sector. The alternative, the
provision of these services by the public sector, is not feasible or advisable in Uganda due to: (a)
lack of public sector capacity; (b) negative worldwide experience with government-run schemes;
and (c) the fact that such an option would not be limited to financial support and would not be
demand-driven, thus discouraging instead of encouraging the development of markets for such
services.
8.    Each of the project's four components tries to reach a different private source (i.e., foreign
partners, equity investors, business consultants, and other domestic firms), who could help
Ugandan firms either to overcome their internal constraints or to influence their external
environment (e.g., improving the policy environment by influencing macroeconomic policy
through a constant dialogue with Government, or improving business infrastructure by easing
access to good consultancy services). The project tries to address four sets of constraints that
impede access by Ugandan firms to the above-mentioned private sources of technical and



managerial know-how and finance. They include: (a) price distortions in the market for business
services; (b) information asymmetries in the financial market; (c) information gaps; and (d) an
overall high degree of uncertainty affecting investment decisions by domestic and foreign
investors alike.
9.    Project Objectives. The purpose of the project is to make the Ugandan private sector
more competitive so that it can expand sales on both domestic and international markets. To
achieve this objective, the project will: (a) help improve the business and investment environment
by decreasing policy constraints; (b) strengthen institutions supporting the private sector; (c)
enhance the dialogue between the private sector and the Govemnment; and (d) alleviate problems
associated with inadequate know-how and the weak financial system.
10.   Project Description. The project will have a total cost of US$20.9 million equivalent (of
which US$12.3 million funded by IDA) and will consist of four mutually reinforcing components.
11.   Shaping the Business Environment:  the Private Sector Foundation Component
(component total cost of US$2.5 million, of which US$2.0 million funded by IDA). The project
will be managed by the private sector itself through a Private Sector Foundation (PSF), established
in August 1995 during the preparation of the project. The Foundation will advise Government on
policy issues affecting PSD and implement the project. Similar instruments have been effective
elsewhere in promoting and institutionalizing policy dialogue between Government and private
sector to reduce policy uncertainty and build confidence with both domestic and foreign investors.
In its advocacy role, the PSF will address policy issues such as taxation and other regulations
affecting private sector development, particularly business licensing and access to industrial land,
with short-term technical assistance. In its second role as the Implementing Unit for this project, it
will be responsible for establishing the management systems to execute, monitor and supervise as
well as evaluate and learn from the project's performance. It will also have the responsibility for
maintaining an open and inclusive  participatory process which maximizes private sector
involvement in the implementation and supervision of the project.
12.   Enhancing Know-how through Markets:  the Business Uganda Development Scheme
Component (component total cost of US$7.5 million, of which US$4.5 million funded by IDA).
The Business Uganda Development Scheme (BUDS) is a program to support the injection of know-
how and expertise into Ugandan firms. It will be a demand-driven business services program
designed to provide the support firms want and will use. At the core of BUDS is a cost-sharing
grant scheme in which Ugandan firms can receive 50 percent of the costs of using consultants and
other service suppliers. Services may cover a broad range of subjects, including marketing,
production, and business planning. Firms may obtain these services through individually tailored
services or through group schemes where Ugandan firms come together to obtain services jointly.
The total of grants to one firm may not exceed a common cumulative limit, set at US$30,000 per
firm or other recipient entity. In addition to the grants, BUDS will provide free hand-holding advice
to firms on the basics of business planning; deciding on what services will be most helpful; selecting
a service supplier; and obtaining the best services from the supplier. The scheme will be managed by
a private contractor on behalf of the PSF, and will be deliberately temporary as it will be wound up
at the end of the PSC Project.



-4 -
13.   Enhancing Know-how through Financial Partners: the Equity Financing Component
(component total cost of US$9.0 million, of which US$3.9 million funded by IDA). The project
will fund the Uganda Equity Facility (UEF), an account set up to provide equity resources under
management contract to participating equity funds that will mobilize resources from private
investors and/or reach small- and medium-sized enterprises. To become a participating equity
fund, strict eligibility criteria must be met, including the fund being economically viable with a
sound financial structure, having reputable management with a demonstrated track record and a
well-defined investment policy and strategy. At present, there are two equity funds -- one soon to
be established and the other still under study -- that are likely to meet the eligibility criteria for the
UEF. Both funds would involve IFC as a direct or indirect shareholder. The project component
will also fund the provision of advice to improve the overall environment for equity financing. In
particular, as investors need to exit their investments, technical assistance and policy advice will
be provided to establish a Depository Receipts System (DRS) on a regional stock market for the
exclusive purpose of increasing exit options for equity investors in Ugandan companies.
14.   Enhancing Know-how through Industrial Partners:  the Investment Promotion and
Facilitation Component (component total cost of US$1.9 million, all of which funded by IDA).
This component will support a reforrned Uganda Investment Authority (UIA), freed from any
functions relating to licensing or granting of tax exemptions, to focus on promotion and
facilitation of private investment. Promotional services -- to be provided in partnership with an
experienced international contractor -- include informational publications, guides, and meetings
with potential investors (individually and in groups) overseas and in Uganda. Facilitation services
include practical assistance, such as advice to investors starting up projects on power, telecoms
and other utilities, local regulations and market conditions, etc.. Other services scheduled to be
delivered by the UIA, which are not funded under this project but which complement the
supported promotion and facilitation services, include support for local enterprise development at
the district level, and advertising and public relations. The administrative and regulatory duties
associated with investment licensing and various tax exemptions, which to date have taken up a
significant proportion of UIA's staff resources, will be discontinued in line with planned revisions
to the Tax and Investment Codes.
15.   Project Costs. The program cost is estimated at US$20.9 million equivalent (U Sh 19.8
billion) inclusive of US$0.3 million of taxes and duties, out of which the proposed credit will
finance US$12.3 million equivalent. The foreign exchange component of the program is estimated
at 70 percent of the total cost. Base cost estimates, US$20.5 million, are in July 1995 prices.
Price contingencies are estimated at US$0.4 million (2 percent of project costs). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Project benefits and costs are shown in
Schedule B1, financial analysis tables in Schedule B2, and the project's performance indicators in
Schedule B3. Amounts and methods of procurement, credit summary allocations, and the
disbursement schedule are described in Schedule C. The key processing events are shown in
Schedule D, and the status of Bank Group operations is shown in Schedule E. The Staff
Appraisal Report (14965-UG) is being distributed separately.
16.   Project Financing. The proposed IDA credit of US$12.3 million equivalent would
finance about 59 percent of project costs, net of duties and taxes. Credit proceeds would be
provided by Government to the PSF as a grant and either transferred from the PSF to private firms
as matching grants under the BUDS component (US$3.0 million), invested in preference shares of



eligible equity funds (US$2.5 million), or spent by the PSF on studies and technical assistance
(US$4.5 million), recurrent expenditures (US$ 1.2 million), and other expenditures (US$1.1
million). International and local financial institutions (including IFC and DFCU) are expected to
contribute US$4.0 million to the equity component. The local contribution made by Government
will be for an estimated amount of US$0.3 million. The private sector will participate in the
financing of the project in three components for a total amount of US$4.3 million.
17.   Project Implementation. The PSF will be the implementing agency for the PSC Project
and, in this capacity, it will report directly and through its board, to GOU, and IDA. This project
management activity will complement the PSF's initiatives (also supported under this project) to
analyze key issues affecting the private sector and promote constructive dialogue with
Government. BUDS will function as a self-standing scheme, implemented by a management
contractor, chosen by an internationally competitive tender and operating under a performance
contract with the PSF. The UEF will have no independent legal status. It will be a bank account
administered by the PSF and shares in participating equity funds shall be held in the name of PSF.
Finally the services under the Investment Promotion and Facilitation component will be delivered
by the UIA under a service agreement with the PSF.
18.  In order to ensure proper coordination and supervision of project components, a Project
Steering Committee (PSC) will be established including all members of the PSF Board (the Board)
and two government representatives, the Secretary to the Treasury and the Permanent Secretary of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry or their nominees. The Project Steering Committee will be
responsible for: (a) approving the annual work plan; (b) reviewing the full report on each year's
project performance, including the implications of financial and operational audits; and (c)
meeting with IDA supervision missions.
19.   For each component the PSF's approach to overall project management will be: (i) to
delegate the maximum degree of operational independence and responsibility to the selected
agents implementing individual components; (ii) to avoid involvement in day-to-day operational
issues; and (iii) to monitor broad performance each quarter, and rigorously review performance
each year, with the PSC. To help the component managers and the PSF Project Coordinator fulfill
their roles effectively, a draft Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was prepared as part of the
appraisal process.  The PSF Project Coordinator will be responsible for the effective
implementation of the PSCP. A letter has been received confirming that: (i) provisions have been
made by Government for the appropriation of funds for the purpose of the project; and (ii) the
person filling the post of PSF Project Coordinator will be considered a public officer for the
purpose of the Public Finance Act, Cap. 149, Laws of Uganda, and will be able to access credit
proceeds and government counterpart funds directly.
20.   Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Experience. First, IDA's experience in private
sector development in Uganda is limited. Under the Enterprise Development Project (Credit 2315-
UG of January 9, 1992), IDA is providing technical assistance for privatization and resources for
term lending to finance private investment in Uganda. The first three years of experience have
shown slow disbursement for both components and led to the restructuring of the EDP project in
February 1995. Resistance to privatization by various interest groups had caused considerable
delays, until the management structure of the privatization and parastatal reform program was
restructured at the end of 1994 with the appointment of a Minister of State responsible for



- 6 -
privatization. Disbursement under the line of credit component of EDP has only recently started
to accelerate, although sub-borrowers are still mainly large firms. Ugandan SMEs have seldom
been able to access the line of credit due to the poor quality of their project proposals and
inadequate capitalization. The proposed project is expected to remedy this situation and to allow
SMEs to access the line of credit under EDP without compromising on the quality of applications.
Second, experience of other countries has shown that government interventions in support of
SMEs are needed whenever firms are poorly-endowed, as is the case in Uganda 1. However, it is
important that these interventions keep a light touch by being limited to financial support and
being demand-driven. The proposed project adopts this approach which leaves most decisions in
private hands and does not rely on the State. Third, IDA's experience with technical assistance in
Africa has been mixed, due to lack of ownership by Governments and because long-term experts
have tended to substitute themselves for their counterparts. The proposed project's emphasis on
sustainability and beneficiaries' participation both in design and implementation should go a long
way towards addressing these potential pitfalls. Fourth, throughout the 1990s, the Government of
Uganda has shown effectiveness in following through with its commitment to policy reforms
within its adjustment program. This track record bodes well for the proposed project being
implemented effectively.
21.   The proposed project would complement other donor-funded PSD activities in several
ways. First, by supporting a Private Sector Foundation, it will introduce an important element of
coordination (to be carried out by the private sector itself) of PSD activities. Second, BUDS will
complement USAID's activities in the area of business services by focusing only on firms that are
willing to pay a substantial share of the cost of the services provided to them and by opening
access to all sectors and not just to a small sub-set of exporters. Third, the fact that the support for
the UIA will go through the PSF will provide an effective way of channeling donor support to the
Authority.
22.   The equity financing component of this project has particularly strong linkages with IFC
activities in Uganda. As of September 30, 1995, IFC has made equity and loan investments in
Uganda totaling US$29.15 million in 16 projects. Within this total, approximately US$1.0 million
has been invested in an equity stake in Development Finance Company of Uganda (DFCU), a
local financial institution that acts as a source of equity and term finance for commercial
investment projects in Uganda. More recently, IFC's Board has approved (July 10, 1995) a
proposed investment in the East African Venture Capital Fund (EAVCF) which will make equity
and quasi-equity investments in Kenyan, Tanzanian and Ugandan firms. IFC's capital market
strategy in Uganda includes developing non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), which broaden
and deepen the range of financial products available. The equity financing component of this
project, in which it is anticipated both DFCU and EAVCF will play a key role as participating
equity ftinds, would support this strategy, and IFC's management has confirmed the
complenientarity of this component with its own initiatives. In particular, this project helps
address issues highlighted by IFC's experience by leveraging new private investment in equity to
enlarge the sources which can be tapped by firms, and by allowing equity funds to target
enterprises of a smaller size.

23.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of
the Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board on June 1, 1995.
The Uganda CAS states that promoting growth through private sector development is the basic
tool for addressing poverty in Uganda's development strategy. The key is how to encourage
private investment, both by domestic and foreign investors.  The project focuses on the
competitiveness of the Ugandan private sector that needs to be improved for a sufficient supply
response to materialize and for the long-term sustainability of ongoing reforms. IDA is well
positioned to provide support in this respect because of its extensive experience worldwide with
matching grant schemes, the credibility its support would give to the Private Sector Foundation, its
capacity to achieve effective donor coordination, and its excellent policy dialogue with
Government and the Ugandan private sector on PSD issues, supported by extensive economic and
sector work. Overall, IDA would play the role of catalyst around which significant additional
private and donor resources would be mobilized. The close involvement of IFC in the preparation
of this project and its likely participation in the implementation of the equity financing component
will allow Uganda to benefit from a full range of services and skills available in the Bank Group.
24.   Agreed Actions.  The following are the conditions of  credit effectiveness:  (i)
establishment of the Project Steering Committee and appointment of the government Liaison
Officer within the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning; (ii) receipt of a signed copy of the
Subsidiary Agreement acceptable to IDA; and (iii) receipt of the final satisfactory Project
Implementation Plan and Action Plans for all components for the first year of the project.
25.   The following are the conditions of disbursement: (i) for the investment promotion and
facilitation component: receipt of a final satisfactory Institutional Development Plan for the
Uganda Investment Authority, approved by both the UIA Board and Government; and (ii) for the
equity financing component, investments in and by participating equity funds will need to be made
in accordance with the eligibility criteria and terms and conditions for the UEF.
26.   The following assurances were received during negotiations:  (a) the Subsidiary
Agreement between the PSF and GOU will be satisfactory to IDA; (b) the project will be carried
out in accordance with the Project Implementation Plan, satisfactory to IDA, including Action
Plans for all components; (c) commencing from the second year of project implementation, the
Action Plans will be refined and submitted to IDA as annual work plans no later than the first day
of May preceding the financial year covered in the work plan; (d) standard
procurement/consultancy recruitment processing timetables and documents will be utilized during
project implementation; (e) financial and operational audits will be undertaken annually during
project implementation; the format of the audit report would be satisfactory to IDA; and audited
accounts would be submitted to IDA within six months of the close of the financial year; and (f) a
mid-term review will be undertaken within 30 months after project effectiveness but no later than
December 31, 1998, with significant government and private sector participation and analytical
inputs, and actions agreed during the review would be implemented expeditiously, in consultation
with IDA.
27.   Environmental Aspects.  The project is in environment Category C.  A National
Environment Action Plan (NEAP) has been adopted by the Government of Uganda and IDA is
actively involved in its implementation, including through the Environment Management Project.



- 8 -
The proposed PSC project will mainly provide technical assistance, except for the equity financing
component. To be eligible for equity financing under a participating equity fund, firms will be
required to demonstrate they conform with Uganda's environmental laws. Participating equity
fund managers will review the overall environmental performance of the investee companies and,
if necessary, make recommendations to improve and strengthen corporate performance.
28.   Program Objective Categories. The project supports IDA's Program Objectives: (i)
private sector development; (ii) financial intermediation; and (iii) economic management.
29.   Participatory Approach. The involvement of the Ugandan counterparts in all aspects of
project processing has been an integral part of the capacity building envisaged under the project.
The process started with an IDA Project Identification Mission in late January 1995, after which
an IEPS was prepared and discussed intemally. A project design workshop was then held in
Kampala on March 30-31, 1995. Over 80 participants from the private sector, the public sector,
and the donor community worked on project design (starting from IDA's Initial Executive Project
Summary and from substantive sector work conducted during the previous year) and elected a
Private Sector Task Force, comprising five private sector representatives and four government
officials to work with IDA in project preparation and appraisal. The workshop was characterized
by several working sessions in small groups. During the following two months, the Task Force
coordinated the work of several consultants, added one component (the Private Sector Foundation)
to the project and made substantial changes to all the other components of the project. The Task
Force then visited Washington, D.C. for preappraisal (May 22-June 2, 1995). During preappraisal,
the Task Force worked closely with the Bank team on the preparation of a draft Project
Implementation Plan. During this visit, the Task Force members met with over twenty task
managers from the Bank, IFC, MIGA and FIAS who had had direct experience in the areas
covered by the proposed project (i.e., matching grant schemes, government-private sector
consultative mechanisms, equity financing, and investment promotion agencies). The Task Force
then continued to work with the Bank team during project appraisal and participated in the
preparation of the Green Cover Staff Appraisal Report. Two members of the Task Force have
recently been elected to serve in the Board of Directors of the Private Sector Foundation and, as
such, they will continue to be involved in project implementation. A participatory supervision
process has also been designed for this project.
30.   Project Benefits.  The proposed operation complements Uganda's macroeconomic
adjustment program, supported by the Bank and the IMF, and is expected to provide the following
sustainable benefits. First, the project will improve the capacity of the Ugandan private sector to
compete internationally. This improved competitiveness should have a positive effect on exports,
employment, and investment. Second, the project will improve the dialogue between the
Government and the private sector, thus enhancing the long-term sustainability of ongoing
economic reforms and improving the quality of the reform process itself. Third, the project will
encourage private capital flows to Uganda, although still on a very limited scale, thus reducing
Uganda's dependency on donor flows. In short, the project seeks to catalyze the growth of private
firms and their contribution to Uganda's overall economic performance.
31.   Many of these benefits are difficult, if not impossible, to measure in advance, but the best
estimate is that the project as a whole would generate a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$7.8
million at a discount rate of 12 percent (see Schedule B1 for further details). The estimate is based



on calculations which measure three categories of benefit only. First, the Business Uganda
Development Scheme should generate additional output and/or profits in firms assisted by the
know-how of business consultants part-financed under the scheme. At present, access to their
know-how is limited to larger firms due to price distortions in the market for business services
which the Scheme will help overcome. Second, the Uganda Equity Facility supports equity funds
in providing equity investment (and associated hands-on managerial advice) to commercial
projects, which should produce a financial and economic return from the productive use of that
capital 2. Third, investment promotion and facilitation and the reduced degree of uncertainty
achieved through a close dialogue between Government and the PSF should increase the flows of
additional foreign direct investment which generate employment, new technologies, and other
benefits in Uganda. Of course, domestic investment should also increase, although this benefit
was not quantified in estimating the project's net present value. The total present value of benefits
is estimated at US$23.8 million, excluding any value for intangible benefits. Setting this against
all the identifiable costs of the project (present value of US$16.0 million) indicates a NPV of
US$7.8 million (an estimated economic rate of return of 23%), which might be considered as a
lower bound estimate of the actual economic return to be generated.
32.   Project Sustainability.  Project sustainability is being ensured by meeting IDA's
requirements for determining quality at entry with an integrated approach to the sector, the
involvement of all stakeholders in policy determination, the coordination of the efforts of all
donors, common implementation arrangements, and minimal reliance on long-term technical
assistance. The leading role played by the Private Sector Task Force in designing this project sets
sound foundations for local ownership and commitment to the initiatives being taken.
Furthermore, Government, in consultation with the Private Sector Task Force, has prepared a
Private Sector Policy Statement which defines the supportive policy framework within which this
project will function. Finally, all public and private entities involved in the project are, and are
expected to remain, financially sustainable. In particular, while the Uganda Equity Facility and
the Business Uganda Development Scheme will be temporary and will be wound up once credit
proceeds are, respectively, returned to Government or fully utilized, the Private Sector Foundation
will attempt to outlive the project. To ensure it will be able to do so, the Ugandan private sector
has been asked to bear the cost of establishing the Foundation, as a sign of its commitment.
Furthermore, IDA's contribution to the PSF operating costs will be reduced over time, so that the
private sector will bear 100 % of non-project related operating costs by project's end as shown in
Schedule B2.
33.   Risks. Several conditions are assumed, which could affect the perfornance of the overall
project, including: (i) the continuation of political and macroeconomic stability; (ii) Government
remaining committed to PSD and willing to discuss policy issues with the private sector; (iii) the
acceleration of the privatization process and substantial improvements in the management of major
public utilities; and (iv) a substantial improvement in the functioning of the financial sector.
Specific assumptions have also been made on each component: (i) the PSF component assumes
that associations will be able to work together within one apex institution (the Foundation) and
that it will be allowed to act as implementing agency; (ii) the BUDS and the equity component
assume a sufficient degree of openness of firms towards external advice/capital and a sufficient
2     Assuming that the financial costs and benefits of sub-projects can be approximately equated with the economic costs and
benefits; a reasonable assumption given the largely undistorted prices.



- 10-
degree of cooperation among donors; (iii) the equity component also assumes there will be enough
profitable projects able to attract equity investments and enough private investors interest in
EAVCF and any other fund which might participate; and (iv) the Investment Promotion and
Facilitation Services component assumes that Parliament will pass a reformed Investment Code,
allowing the UIA to cease its administrative/regulatory duties.
34.   The project includes a considered program of mitigating some risks and maintaining active
supervision to redress problems should any of the other considered risks arise.  First, in
recognition of the fact that the PSD agenda is substantial and evolving, provision has been made
for a flexible approach to providing consultancy support for specific activities and also for
acquiring expert assistance on an as-and-when-needed basis for the entire life of the credit.
Second, implementation risks would be monitored by the Project Steering Committee (PSC). The
PSC will include government representatives who have had previous experience in dealing with
IDA projects. Third, the risk of lack of donor coordination in the area of business services and
equity financing will be addressed by the PSF Board, which will liaise closely with all donors
interested in PSD issues. Fourth, risks affecting the BUDS component (i.e., participants unwilling
to apply new skills in their business and grant abuse) will be addressed through the free hand-
holding services that will be provided by the BUDS management to firms applying for assistance.
Hand-holding services will include advice on how to decide what tasks would most benefit from
service use, how to select the most suitable service provider for the task, how to get the best out of
the provider, and how to ensure a lasting impact within the firm. Fifth, the involvement of IFC in
EAVCF and possibly in the proposed DFCU Fund should ensure that both funds are professionally
managed and substantially reduce any moral hazard risk. In addition, the local sponsor of EAVCF
(Industrial Promotion Services (Kenya) Limited, which is affiliated to Aga Khan Foundation for
Economic Development) and DFCU (in which IFC, CDC and the German development agency,
DEG, are also shareholders) have a long track record of successful equity investing. The quality
of these two local sponsors bodes well for the identification of suitable investment projects. Sixth,
it will be private entrepreneurs who will be committing their own finance and resources (supported
by the project), taking risks and making operational decisions. The discipline of the market should
help ensure that the myriad of individual investments (expected to be about 400 in total), assisted
under this project, deliver sound economic returns to Uganda as projected. Finally, the cost-benefit
estimates indicate that in a worst case the performance targets for individual components could be
underachieved by a third, while still generating a positive NPV for the project based solely on
quantified benefits.
35.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed credit.

Main Assumptions
*  For BUDS, for every $1 of consultancy assistance the assisted firm will increase output (sales) by $15 over 5
years. It is also assumed that requests for BUDS assistance will be evenly split between support for
technological improvement and support to gain access to markets. However, different distributions do not
affect the overall net benefits from the project as a whole.
*  For the UEF, sub-projects will generate a rate of return of 20% and the financial costs and benefits of sub-
projects can be equated with the economic costs and benefits of the operations of the assisted firms due to
largely undistorted prices.
*  For UIA, for every $1 spent on promotion, an additional $10 will be generated in foreign direct investment.
Sensitivity Analysis
*  BUDS. The component's NPV would fall to zero if more than one-half of the assisted firms received no
incremental benefit from consultancy inputs.
*  UEF. A rate of return on sub-projects of up to four percentage points below the target of 20% will still
generate a positive NPV for this component.
*   UIA. The performance target of $10 of additional foreign direct investment can be reduced by up to 25%
before the component switches to zero NPV.
Nature of Benefits
*  Incremental output and investment by both local and foreign firms.
*  Higher quality and quantity of entrepreneurs as a result of the consultancy services provided by BUDS and the
wider benefits associated with increased foreign direct investment.
* Enhanced awareness in the international community about investment opportunities in Uganda.
Non-quantified benefits
*      Any benefit relating to the PSF as project implementation unit (e.g., creating a consistency between project
design and implementation);
*      Any benefit relating to the PSF in its policy advocacy function;
*      The benefits delivered by the BUDS managers in helping educate firms in their use of business consultants,
and in developing the capacity of the local consulting profession;
*      The wider benefits (from technology transfer, management skills, etc.) associated with FDI; and
*      A widening of choice of instruments (particularly to SMEs) in the financial sector.
Main Beneficiaries
* Over 400 Ugandan firms will benefit directly from the BUDS and UEF. The PSF (representing 12,000
enterprises) will facilitate the public-private sector dialogue and build a more responsive public sector and
responsible private sector. More generally, the private sector will benefit as markets for business services
develop and the environment becomes more business-friendly.

C. UGANDA: IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
1.    The IDA portfolio for Uganda as of September 30, 1995 consists of 24 projects, with a
total commitment of about US$1.1 billion. Of these, 21 are investment projects with an
undisbursed amount of about US$690 million. The portfolio showed solid improvement in FY95,
largely as a result of intensified effort by task managers and staff generally (i.e., through PERs)
to remove the obstacles to project implementation and get better results in the field. As a result of
this effort, several projects were restructured and others were closed. This was done in close
cooperation with the Government and now all IDA projects are considered core projects in the
Government's development budget.
2.   In the FY95 Annual Review of Portfolio Performance (ARPP), there were no projects
rated unsatisfactory on the development objectives rating, and only two unsatisfactory projects
on the implementation progress rating. Early in the current fiscal year, one of these unsatisfactory
projects (Enterprise Development) was restructured and is expected to be upgraded to
satisfactory before the end of the current fiscal year; the other one (First Urban) will take a little
longer to turn around, even though some restructuring of it has already occurred. Disbursements
have increased steadily in recent years from US$136 million in FY93 to US$193 million in
FY95, resulting in a net transfer to Uganda of about US$173 million in the latter FY. Because the
approval of additional projects raised the undisbursed balance in FY94, the disbursement factor
dipped slightly in FY95 to 13.3 from 14.5 in FY94. Had no new projects been approved, the
factor would have been 17.3.
3.    A number of factors account for the improved implementation performance in Uganda. A
major factor is the increased involvement of Ugandan project managers in solving
implementation problems through a series of effective CPPRs they were largely responsible for
organizing in conjunction with the Bank's Resident Mission. To follow up on the decisions taken
at the CPPRs, a Group of Project Managers (GPM) was formed and is meeting regularly to
address implementation problems common to all or most projects. Other important factors in the
improved implementation performance are the periodic training and workshops on disbursement
and procurement issues; the coordination between the CPPRs and PERs in resolving the
counterpart funding problems facing the development budget; and the intensive project review
and restructuring exercise that has taken place in the past couple of years. The Resident Mission
has been instrumental in achieving these improved results through its close cooperation with the
GPM.
4.    While good progress has been made, project implementation is still not satisfactory and
further improvements are needed. Disbursement and procurement are still sluggish in several
projects, counterpart fund shortages occur periodically in projects, accounting and auditing are
still deficient in many respects and timely results on the ground continues to elude many

projects. Consequently, IDA will continue to work with the Government to strengthen the CPPR
process, including the follow-through on the recommendation made, and will continue to focus
attention on the generic constraints (e.g., disbursement and procurement practices, accounting
and auditing procedures, adequacy of counterpart funds, etc.). In addition, much greater
emphasis is being placed by IDA on quality at entry, through increased beneficiary and
stakeholder participation (including more solid government commitment) in the project cycle,
from identification through to completion of the Board documents. Much closer involvement of
beneficiaries and stakeholders in implementation will also be sought in IDA projects, including
greater use of NGOs, other donor representatives, etc.
