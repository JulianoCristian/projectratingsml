competitive so that it can expand sales on both\n            domestic and international markets. To achieve this\n            objective, the project will: 1) help improve the business\n            and investment environment by decreasing policy constraints;\n            2) strengthen institutions supporting the private sector; 3)\n            enhance the dialogue between the private sector and the\n            government; and 4) alleviate problems associated with\n            inadequate know-how and the weak financial system. There are\n            several beneficiaries from this project. First, the project\n            will enhance the competitiveness of individual enterprises\n            directly. Second, other stakeholders will benefit from\n            serving as a means to this end. Finally, the government of\n            Uganda will come closer to realizing its stated goal of\n            building a modern, self-sustaining economy, based on free\n            enterprise. The project consists of four mutually\n            reinforcing components: 1) shaping the business environment:\n            the private sector foundation component; 2) enhancing\n            know-how through markets: the \"business Uganda\"\n            development scheme component; 3) enhancing know-how through\n            financial partners: the equity financing component; and 4)\n            enhancing know-how through industrial partners: the\n            investment promotion and facilitation component."}, "docdt": "1995-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
