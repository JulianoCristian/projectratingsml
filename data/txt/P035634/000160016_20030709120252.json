Bank performance is rated satisfactory\n            overall. The Borrower's  performance is rated\n            satisfactory, due to its commitment to implement policies\n            based on issues and constraints raised by the private\n            sector. The key lessons pertain to the participatory\n            process, private sector implementation, and donor\n            collaboration: 1) The participatory approach for organizing\n            the preparation and appraisal of the project holds promise\n            for broader application. The project provides evidence that\n            under certain conditions, participation can have valuable\n            development benefits. These benefits take the form of\n            improved project design, early and sustainable beneficiary\n            commitment and involvement, and improved trust among the\n            different parties. 2) Private sector projects, jointly\n            supervision with the Government, appear to benefit the\n            implementation process. Project activities were generally\n            implemented on time, procedures were followed, and staff\n            changes were implemented quickly and without major delays to\n            the project. The issues raised, discussed or implemented\n            were based on broad consultation and ownership by the\n            private sector. 3) The project consulted and coordinated\n            with all donors during project design, implementation, and\n            in the review process. This contributed to a harmonization\n            of donor funding and joint or continued funding of some activities."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
