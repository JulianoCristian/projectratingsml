KILOMBERO SUGAR rOJECT (LOAN 1041-TA/CREDIT 513-TA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Kilombero
Sugar Project, for which Loan 1041-TA and Credit 513-TA, each for
US$ 9.0m, were approved on September 5, 1984. The loan/Credit were
closed on December 31, 1980; the Credit Was fully disbursed by September
10, 1976 and the Loan by May 14, 1981.
This report was prepared by the Regional Mission in Eastern
Africa (RMEA) following a mission to Tanzania in July 1983, and reflects
information made available by the project agencies, namely the Sugar
Development Corporation (SDC), which monitored the project, and the
Kilombero Sugar Company Limited (KSC), the agency responsible for
implementation of the project. Drafts of the PCR prepared by KSC in 1981
and 1982 served as useful background documents. Other sources of
information included the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 466a-TA) dated July
30, 1974, the Loan, Credit and Project Agreements dated September 27,
1974, and subsequent amendments to these Agreements. Supervision
reports, correspondence with the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda as
contained in relevant RMEA files have also been consulted. The PCR was
substantially completed and submitted to the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) in May 1984.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments
on September 4, 1984. No comments have been received from the Borrower
so far.
The valuable assistance provided in prepazing this report by the
Government of Tanzania (GOT) is gratefully acknowledged. Special mentioi.
must be made of the General Man&ger and Directors of Planning and
Operations of SDC, and the General Manager and Financial Controller and
other staff of KSC.
Tftis project has not been audited by the OED.

TANZANIA
KILOMOERO SUGAR PROJECT (LOAN 1041-TA/CREDIT 513-TA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Summary of Hlghlights
1.       The Project wa£ the third Bank Group supported project to assist
the Tanzanian sugar industry. The International Finance Corporation
(IFC) had earlier made two investments in the Kilombero Suga, Company
(KSC). The first, in February 1960, supported the original development
of the estate and a 20,000 ton factory; the second, in March 1964,
supported expansion to 31,500 tons l1. The total IFC investment was
equivalent to t4.7 mAllion, or 36 per cent of KSC's capital. KSC
experienced numerous problems in its early development, including a cane
disorder ('yellow wlUt"), inadequate management resulting in poor cost
control, and insuffici.ent tractor maintenance.  These difficulties were
overcome by the appointment of Dutch Managing Agents in 1965, but due to
pricing policy difficulties th.e principal investors sold their interests
In the company to the Government of Tanzania (GOT) in February 1969.
Apart from a set-back in 1972 due to problems with a diffuser, KSC's
operations were reasonably efficient at the time of Project preparation
and appraisal.
2.      The Project, prepared with the help of the Managing Agents and
PMFA (now RMEA), was appraised in the field in November/December 1973,
negotiated at HQ between June 24-27, 1974, and Board approval for an IBRD
Loan ef $9m and an IDA Credit of O9m was given on September 5, 1974. The
Danish Government was to provide $17.3m, the Netherlands Government
ll.Om and GOT $9.5m, bringing the total to $55.8m. The GOT contribution
included KSC self-generated funds of $4.Om thus reducing the GOT
budgetary contribution to t5.5m.
3       The Project was in two parts.  Part I was to develop a new sugar
cane estate, ancillary services and outgrowers' land, and Part TI was to
provide a new factory and related facilities. The financing was to be
shared as follows:  Part I -  IDA t9m, IBRD tm, GOT $5m = $23m; and Part
II -  Netherlands $11m, Denmark $17.3m, GOT $4.5m = $32.8m.  It was
anticipated that KSC's annual sugar production would be increased by
45,000 tons, there would be savings and/or earnings of foreign exchange
of $14m annually, and outgrower farm families would earn $275 annually by
year 2 and $725 annually after about six years.
1/ Subsequent development raised capacity to 43,000 tons sugar per annum
at time of appraisal.



- i v -
4.       Physical implementation of the- Project was executed
satisfactorily by KSC initially under the direction of the Managing
Agents who also supervised the factory construction under a separate
contract. Cost overruns, inadequate budgetary provisions, delays in the
flow of counterpart funds and in reimbursement to KSC of funds originally
provided by them, and an inadequate ex-factory sugar pricing policy
caused major problems throughout the implementation period. These
problems appeared to have been. largely overcome and institution
building' achieved when local management took ower and the Managing
Agents were left with only an advisory role from 1977. Sugar output from
both KSC estates increased from 43,817 tons in 1977 to 65,959 tons in
1978. The success was shortlived, however, as there was a dramatic drop
in 1979 to 51,948 tons followed by 48,070 tons in 1980. The General
Manager was relieved of his duties at the end of 1980 and an experienced
expatriate tool over as GM early in 1981.
5.       Overall, the objective of setting up the plantation,
constructing roads, building a factory and establishing the
infrastructure was achieved successfully. The major factors responsible
for bringing KSC as a company and the Project as a whole down were the
rapidly deteriorating general economic situation (with a severe overall
shortage of foreign exchange), poor ex-factory prices (which prevented
the generation of funds with which to buy spares and replacements for the
original KSC equipment), and the deterioration in management following
localisation in 1977, which was further compounded by the total lack of
labor discipline.
6.       The main lessons to be learned from this Project are: (i)
additional management responsibilities and staff needs arising from a
project should be carefully assessed and provided for before overloading
an existing company or parastatal organization; (ii) pricing policy and
financial performance covenants should be strictly enforced; (iii)
Governments should realize the foreign exchange implications and demands
of sugar projects on their own resources; (iv) projections of benefits
and implementation schedules in crops such as sugar and particularly in
countries like Tanzania should allow for likely delays and risks of
non-performance; and (v) more scope should be given to the use of turnkey
contracts in projects.



TANZANIA
KILOMBERO SUGAR PROJECT (LOAN 1041-TA/CREDIT 513-TA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REEORT
I.   lnrroduction
1.01     At the time of appraisal Tanzania with a per capita income of
$lO was one of the world's poorest countries. About 90% of the
population, then estimated at 14 million and growing at 2.8% a year, were
dependent on agriculture for their living. Agriculture contributed 80%
of commodity exports and 40X of total GDP but in the period 1968-1972 had
a disappointing real growth rate of 2.4%. In 1973 foreign exchange
resources were being drained by imports of food including sugar (US$
18.0m annvally).
1.02     Increased agricultural production and development of rural areas
were given great emphasis in Tanzania's Second Five-Year Plan (then in
its final year). Priorities for crops were set based on production
possibilities, market prospects and aimed at country self-sufficiency.
One of the crops set for self-sufficiency was sugar because projected
expansion of output had not been achieved and domestic demand had
exceeded anticipated levels due to rapid increases in per capita
consumption.11 Import substitution in the case of sugar had become
imperative.
1.03     The proposed project was the most advanced of four sugar
developments planned by Tanzania which in combination aimed at achieving
self sufficiency in sugar by 1977. By 1980 (its 6th year) the Project
was expected to result in an incremental annual production of 45,000 tons
of sugar and a foreign exchange saving of about $14 million a year. Ihe
increase represented 43Z of the then current production and was almost
one third of the projected expansion by 1980.
1.04     Tanzania's sugar is grown by four estates:  the Tanganyika
Planting Co was established at Arusha Chini in 1936 and operated by
private Danish interests until it was bought by GOT in January 1980. At
the time of appraisal, it accounted for over half the country's
production from estate-grown irrigated cane resulting in a long milling
season which helped to make it the most efficient plant in Tanzania. The
Kagera Sugar Co Ltd was formerly a private estate and factory opened in
1958 in the Bukoba area in West Lake District to handle rainfed cane. At
appraisal it was producing 8% of the national total but GOT had acquired
1/   10 kg/year in 1972, compared with annual per capita consumption in
Kenya of 16.6 kg; Uganda 14.8 kg; and USA/UK over 50 kg.



70% of the interests and had plans to expand to about 60,000 tons sugar
per annum by 1983. Mtibwa Sugar Estates Ltd was privately buil- in
1960/61 north of Morogoro and GOT acquired 50% of the interests through
the National Agricultural and Food Corporation (NAFCO) -n 1970 and the
balance in 1975, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sugar
Development Corporation (SDC). Cane was provided by the estate and
outgrowers and produced at the time of appraisal 7,000 tons sugar
annually (6% of national production). There were plans to expand to
50,000 tons by 1985 but this was subsequently amended to about 34,000
tons.
1.05     Kilombero Sugar Co (KSC) was the newest of Tanzania's sugar
plants, commencing production in 1962. KSC was formed in 1960 with IFC
and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) as its principal
shareholders. Other initial investors were the Netherlands Overseas
Financierings-Maatschappj - H.V. (MOFC), Vereridge Kilatteuse Cultur
Maatschappj, Rubber Cultur Maatschappj Amsterdam and the Standard Bank of
East Africa. KSC experienced considerable problems in its development
and was profitable in only two of its first seven years of operation. A
cane disease ('yellow wilt") depressed yields necessitating the
introduction of new varieties and extensive drainage improvements. Poor
cost control and inferior tractor maintenance resulted from inadequate
management, but these problems were overcome by appointing expatriate
managing agents in 1965. Apart from a setback in 1972 due to problems
with a diffuser in the factory which led to excessive down-time, KSC's
operations had become reasonably efficient.
1.06     In late 1968 Government decided to reduce the assured ex-factory
price of sugar which it felt included a subsidy to KSC. The investors,
however, were of the view that KSC would not be viable at the reduced
price and felt that the higher price was fair for running an efficient
operation. In February 1969 the principal investors sold their interests
to GOT at mutually acceptable terms. The investments at the time of sale
comprised IFC TSh 29.5m (34%), CDC TSh 30m (35%), IOFC TSh 12.5m (14.5%),
Standard Bank TSh 4.1m (5%), GOT TSh 6.0m (7%), Rubb.er Cultur TSh 2.5m
(3%) and Public TSh 0.8m (1%); total TSh 86.0m. On taking over KSC, the
capital structure was reformed by GOT with ISh 36m as paid-up ordinary
shares and TSh 36m as fully paid 7% non-cumulative preference shares. In
1972 GOT transferred the ordinary shares to NAFCO who transferred them to
SDC in 1974. The company and its operations continued to be run by the
Managing Agents.
1.07     To translate GOT's expansion plans for the sugar sector into
action, the Sugar Development Corporation (SDC) was formed in 1974. It
was given powers to develop the sugar industry, engage in sugar growing,
processing and marketing, and manage sugar companies in which it had a
controlling interest. Equity holdings originally held by the National
Agricultural and Food Corporation (NAFCO) in KSC, Mtibwa and Kagera were
transferred to SDC. Initially SDC concentrated on developing and
implementing expansion plans and later took over the functions of the
National Sugar Board in controlling and regulating production, marketing
sugar in the mainland, and handling imports. It has always relied
heavily on the support of consultants, maInly funded under Netherlands
aid.

II.   Project Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
Identification and Preparation
2.01     At the beginning of 1973, the Managing Agents for KSC were
requested by GOT to prepare a feasibility study for the expansion of
Kilombero and the construction of a second factory. The feasibility
study was expected to be ready by April 1973. The financing of the
project was to be partially provided through bilateral aid funds from the
Netherlands and Denmark. As GOT was anxious to start the Project before
the end of 1973 it was hesitant to approach the Bank because of time lags
associated with Bank loan processing. The Bank, however, advised GO., 'tn
March 1973, that subject to receiving a request for Bank assistance and
adequate project preparatory work, it would endeavor to appraise the
proposed project in September 1973. It is not altogether clear from the
files but it appears that GOT's request for financing was made in early
May 1973, and PMEA (as RMEA war known at that time) which was ossisting
in preparation fielded a pre-appraisal mission at the end of June 1973.
Sugar pricing policies, orgaoisatIn= af outgrowers, local training needs
and the need for continuing expatriate management were among the major
issues identified at the preparation/preappraisal stage.
Appraisal
2.02     The Project was appraised in November/December 1973 and
consisted of two major elements to be executed over the five year period
1974-1978.
Part I. The development of a new sugar estate and outgrowers'
land adjacent to the existing Kilombero Estate at Msolwa (KI). 'he
Project area in the Kilombero Vallev (Kilosa district of the Morogoro
Region) covered 37 square miles to the north of KI estate bounded on the
west by the Migomberama mountains, on the south by the Great Ruaha River
and KI estate, on the east and north by the Selous Game Reserve (see map
IBRD 10889 in Appraisal Report 466a-TA). It is linked to Dar-es-Salaam
by a railway and 370km of all-weather road. Specifically, Part I
comprised:
(a) Land Development:
(i)    development of a 7,300 acre (2,954 ha) sugar estate,
partly under irrigation, and provision of
cultivation equipment, roads and cane transport;
(ii)   development of 2,400 acres (971 ha) of new, rainfed
land for outgrowers (the Kilosa District Development
Corporation (KDDC) and farmers settled in ujamaa
villages); and
(iii) expansion of 2,200 acres (890 ha) of existing
outgrower land for KI to replace outgrowers whose
production would be diverted to Ruembe (KII);
(b) Non-factory Ancillaries:
provision of staff housing, water supply and community
facilities, and a rail -Ink;



- 4 -
(c) Training and Research:
Ci)    on-the-job and overseas training for factory and
field personnel;
(ii)   provision to increase adaptive research at KSC; and
(iii) provision for the identification and preparatlon of
feasibility studies on further sugar developments in
Tanzania.
Part II consisted of the provision of a new factory mainly
financed by bilateral aid funds and specifically comprised:
(d) the erection of a 2,400 TCD (tons of cane per day) sugar
factory complete with ancillaries under a fixed price
turnkey contract; and
(e) supervision of construction under a separate contract.
2.03     The Project was to be executed by KSC under the direction of its
Managing Agents, who would also supervise the construction of the factory
in Part II under a separate contract. It was anticipated that the
Project would increase the annual production of semi-refined sugar by
45,000 tons.
2.04     Following the appraisal mission, an Issues Paper was prepared on
January 17, 1974 and discussed in Washington at a Decision Meeting on
January 25, 1974. The main issues discussed and decisions taken were:
Ca) Role of the Managing Agents. The Managing Agents were
playing a multiple role in the Projec;: project preparation
for KSC, construction supervision for the factory under a
separate contract, preparation of tender documents for the
turnkey construction, and continuation as managing agents
for KI and KII on completion of the Project. It was
proposed t:lat IDA should review all contracts and proposed
agreementt. snd advise GOT accordingly, and that the
construction contract should include a clause providing for
independent inspection by a consulting engineer. It was
decided to submit IDA's review to GOT ( this was done on
January 30, 1974) but that a separate consultant would not
be recommended as confusion and conflicts could easily
occur.
(b) Retroactive Financing and Amount of Credit. To enable the
factory to commence milling operations in the 1976 season,
US$ 0.7 million was proposed as retroactive financing for
land development equipment and civil works. This was
agreed and it was also recommended that the TDA allocation
be raised to US$ 11 million from US$ 10 million in the
approved lending program.



- 5 -
(c) Factory Location. It was proposed that the factory should
be located in a site central Lo the project area instead of
in an area in the SW corner on the north bank of the Great
Ruaha River. It was decided that appraisal should continue
on the assumption that the central site would be chosen and
GOT should be advised accordingly. After further
investigations and cost analyses, the original site was
accepted by the appraisal mission.
(d) Price Policy. GOT expressed itself flexible on sugar price
policy and stated that its policy was that a nationalized
industry sL.ould make a "reasonable return" (which in
practice meant covering all costs, includIng machinery
replacements and loan servicing), and that it would welcome
IDA guidelines on the price required for KII to operate
profitably. It was proposed that rather than set a target
rate of return the mission should calculate the effects on
KII's internal financial return of a number of prices,
inform GOT of the implications of each and leave the price
setting to GOT, subject to an undertaking that prices will
be adequate for II to service and repay the loan capital
and in the long run to provide a Positive flow of cash to
KSC equity-holders. It was decided that all costs
including 'the cost of money- should be recovered and that
KSC should receive an ex-factory price sufficiently high to
cover all its cash requirements incluiding the service and
repayment of loan capital and replacement of machinery.
2.05     It was pointed out in the issues paper that there had been
increases in factory costs and GOT, the Netherlands and Denmark were
looking to IDA for an independent assessment of the whole project partly
as a check on the feasibility study prepared by the I1anaging Agents. The
appraisal mission was of the view that appraisal of the estate
development without an examination of the factory component was
impracticable. It was rherefore decided to send a supplementary mission
to Holland and Denmark to discuss progress on the factory proposals with
the Managing Agents and :ne bilateral lending agreements with the Dutch
and Danes. In fact minsions from both projects and programs divisions
visited these countries in late February 1974. At the same time a
Tanzanian delegation "as in Amsterdam with powers to negotiate and sign
the factory contract with the consortium. The contract was now to be a
fixed price turnkey contract and the price had risen by about 60Z above
the August 1973 submission and had escalated about 40% since the December
1973 appraisal mission. This necessitated adjustment in financing with
attendant delays but it was still thought the factory could be readv for
test runs in 1976. The bilateral fundizg arrangements were sorted out,
the project submitted to the Loan Committee on June 14, 1974 and a Credit
of US$ 11 million and a Loan of US$ 6.5 million were proposed. After
review the Loan Committee decided that Bank Group contribution to the
Project should be US$ 18 million: IDA allocation US$ 9 million and IBRD
allocation US$ 9 million. The Project was finally approved bv the Board
on September 5, 1974 and the Legal Documents signed on September 27, 1974.



-6-
Agreements Reached
2.06     During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a) in the event that outgrowers were unable to meet the
schedules laid dom-n for them, their land may be developed
and operated by KSC until the outgrowers were ready to take
over the developed areas;
"b) KSC's appointment of a Training Officer would be made only
after consultation with the Bank;
(c) SDC would obtain the approval of the Bank on its proposals
for organizing the sugar study prior to finalizing the
selectian of consultants;
(d) Government would commit not less than the equivalent of US$
17.3 million of Danish loan funds to this Project;
(e) not less than 30% nor more than 50% of the total proceeds
of the Dutch and Danish aid would be passed to RSC through
SDC as equity capital;
(f) an experienced Financial Controller for RSC would be
recruited;
(g) KSC's accounts would be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and the accounts and auditors'
reports would be submitted within six months of the close
of each financial year;
Ch) prior approval of the Bank would be obtained to the terms
of any renewal of the managing agency agreement due to
become.effective on May 1, 1974, or to any alternative
arrangements which may be made;
(i) Government would set an ex-factory price for KSC sugar
which would give a return on all capital employed, taking
one year with another, of about 9%;
(j) retail prices for sugar would be reviewed regularly in the
light of such factors as production costs and import
prices; and
(k) KSC would keep under review the price payable for
outgrowers' cane and would adjust this as necessary to
ensure the maintenance of outgrowers' production incentives.

2.07     Effectiveness
Conditions of effectiveness of tht Credit and Loan were as
follows:
(a)  receipt by the Bank of satisfactory evidence of firm
commitments by the Dutch Government to provide the
equivalent of US$ 11.0 million and the equivalent of USs
17.3 million by the Danish Government, to meet the cost of
the turnkey factory and supervision;
(b)  the execution of financing agreements, acceptable to the
Bank, between Government and KSC; and
(c)  signature of a new managing agency agreement on terms
acceptable to the Bank.
Financing
2.08     Total project costs were estimated at US$ 55.8 million (Table 1)
and the financing of the Project was to be shared as follows:
Dutch   Danish
Govt    Govt      IDA     Bank   Gov't  Total
uS$Tmillion)
Part I (estate and             -         -       9.00    9.00    5.00   23.00
ancillaries)
Part II (Factory)              11.00    17.30      _              4.50   32.80
Total Financing           11.00    17.3(   9.00    9.00    9.50   55.80
Percent of Total-         20        31     16       16      17      100
The Government contribution included KSC sblf-gemarated funds of about
US$ 4.0 million, and the GOT budgetary contzi r,ion was thus expected to
be reduced to about US$ 5.5 million, or 10% of total Project costs.
2.09     The IDA Credit of US$ 9.00 million was on standard terms and the
IBRD Loan of US$ 9.00 million at 8% p.a. was for 25 years including five
years' grace. Bank Group financing represented 78% of Part I costs,
including all foreign exchange costs and about 34% of local costs. The
Dutch loan was on the same terms as the IDA Credit. The Danish
contribution representing parts of three loans to Tanzania were part
repayable over 25 years with 7 years' grace and part over 35 years with
10 years' grace, all  .t zero interest.  For both Dutch and Danish aid
funds, 75% of expenditure had to be made on goods or services originating
in the lending country. The composition of supplies for Part II took
this into account and the bilateral financing was expected to be
available as needed under the terms of the turnkey contract. The Danish
loan was part of a larger commitment to Tanzania which was not tied
specifically to this Project. At negotiations, Government assurances
were obtained that it would commit not less than the equivalent of US$
17.3 million of Danish loan funds to the Project.



-8 -
2.10     Apart from funds required for the sugar survey (which would be a
grant to S1C), Bank Group finance committed to Part I of the Project was
to be on-lent to KSC at 9% per year interest. The proceeds of both the
Loan and Credit were repayable by KSC over 25 years including 5 years'
grace. Danish and Dutch aid covered Part II of the Project and an
assurance was obtained that not less than 30% nor more than 50% of the
total proceeds would be passed to KSC through SDC as equity capital. The
Tanzanian contribution, other than that derived from KSC's self-generated
funds, was to be passed to KSC as a-9% loan or equity as appropriate.
2.11     In order not to delay the start-up of the factory, preliminary
work on land clearirg and development, access roads, rail bed preparation
and site clearing was being undertaken. To meet such costs incurred
between May 1, 1974 and Loan/Credit effectiveness, provision waE made in
the IDA allocation for a sum not exceeding US$0.7 million from which
expenditures on equipment and civil works would be met by retroactive
financing.
Procurement
2.12     Assurances were obtained at negotiations that procurement
procedures would be as follows:
(a) vehicles and related equipment for land clearing and
preparation, for cane transport, and for administrative and
service staff, irrigation, potable water and electricity
transmission equipment (US$7.4 million) would be procured
by international competitive bidding. Orders less than US$
30,000 could be procured in accordance with government
procedures. The sugar survey and feasibility studies would
be carried out by consultants appointed in accordance with
Bank guidelines;
(b)  civil works construction (US$ 2.3 million) would also be
procured by international competitive bidding except for
small individual items costing less than US$ 30,000;
(c) land preparation, road construction, rail bed construction,
and installation of irrigation equipment (US$ 2.6m) would
be carried out by KSC itself. Rail line would be proctred
and laid by East African Railways unae: their standard
procedures. Potable water and electricity would be
installed by .YSC or by local contractors.

III.   Project Implementation and Operating Performance
Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01     The date of effectiveness indicated in the Legal Agreements was
December 31, 1974. In addition to the conditions described in Section
2.07 above, the Project Agreement had to be duly authorized and ratified
as legaLly binding on KSC, and the Subsidiary Loan Agreement had to be
duly authorized and ratified as legally binding on GOT and KSC. On
December 19, 1974 the Bank extended the date for effectiveness to
February 8, 1975 and on February 5, 1975 extended it again to March 10,
1975. GOT, however, met all the conditions sooner than the new date and
the Bank declared the Loau, Credit and Project Agreements effective on
February 14, 1975.
3.02     The slippage in the date of effectivness by six weeks cannot be
considered unduly long taking into account the number of institutions and
departments involved and when compared with delays in achieving
effectiveness subsequently experienced in other projects im Tanzania.
The delay did not adversely affect project start-up as the Managing
Agents had appointed a Planning and Development Manager who had previous
experience in dealing with Bank-funded projects. The first supervision
mission (December 9-12, 1974), prior to effectiveness, while reporting
some shortcomings did indicate that considerable progress had been made
in the preparation of bidding documents and tenders. The mission
highlighted problems which were likely to arise due to cost overruns,
shortage of housing for contractors' staff, increase iD permanent housing
requirements due to villagisation policies, delays in installation of
turbines at Kidatu power house, delay in pump house construction and the
irrigation installation, delavs in access roads and the rail link,
appointment of consultants and the handling of procurement. The mission
did report, however, that land development was up to target and
proceeding well. Overall, the start-up can be considered satisfactory.
Implementation
3.03     The Project was, at that time, the largest Bank-funded
agricultural project in Tanzania. It had numerous facets and throughout
the project there were many problems covering agriculture, civil and
mechanical engineering, finance, procurement and staffing. These were
actively and positively tackled during Project implementation. A close
rapport developed between RMEA (who supervised t.ie Project), GOT, SDC,
KSC, the Managing Agents and the various consultants. This resulted in
physical implementation being successfully completed. Ihe Bank's
supervision missions between 1975/76 and 1978 assessed the Project
overall as having only moderate problems. By 1978/79 implementation was
virtually complete, the remaining problems were judged to be relatively
minor, trend was improving and RII production had reached 72% of the
appraisal figure. Unfortunately, the success was shortlived due to
mismanagement and the Project was rated in October 1980 as having serious
problems with a worsening trend, by the same mission which had judged it
a year earlier as having only minor problems and improving. The reasons
for the collapse leading to a proposed rehabilitation project will be
discussed later iu this report together with the problems related to
specific items, how they arose and how they were addressed.

A. Land Development, Cane and Sugar Production
3.04     The extent of the area to be developed, referred to as KII, was
based on the following assumptions. The agronomic conditions of the
Lover Ruembe Valley (XII) were considered to be even better for growing
cane than in the existing KI estate in the Ruaha and Msolwa areas. The
mean yields of RI were used as a basis for assessing the areas required
on the assumption that the climatic conditions, particularly rainfall, of
the existing and new areas, 7.5km apart, would be similar. The rainfall
pattern over a 12 year period was analysed and it was deduced, based on
XI experience, that adequate cane ripening and milling days would be
available in the 234 day period May 1 - December 20, to produce 421,500
tons cane, yielding 44,300 tons sugar at 10.5% rendement from a 2,400
tons of cane per day (TCD) factory.
3.05     The new factory was scheduled to start its first milling season
by September 1, 1976 and up to that date all new project cane grown in
KII would be milled in the existing XI factory. To achieve this the KI
factory would have had to extend its milling season or ircrease its
throughput by about 5% which was anticipated to be readily achievable
from an established factory. If there was a processing shortfall, some
came could be held over to the next season and any drop in sucrose
content as a result would at least be offset by increased yields, and the
delay in obtaining returns was not expected to have a significant effect
on the overall returns. In the first operational season of KII
(1976/77), it was estimated that 323,000 tons cane would be harvested
from 7,540 acres (3,051 ha) including outgrovers, which could be handled
by the nes f-t_c   [e 15 n -s     le%w47   f%r inx ei%  tS via -Thin a  renrA
would have meant milling until the end of January which, as proved later,
is a bit risky and a 10% downtime for a new factory for various reasons
proved to be much too low.
3.06     After the first milling season, it was planned to increase cane
production as quickly as possible by a crash program of land clearing,
preparation and cane planting. The program of land clearing,
preparation, planting, harvesting and sugar yields compared with actual
achievements are shown in Tables 2 and 3.  Ihe results are su-marised
below.

3.07     Land clearing and planting on the estate got off to a good start
and the May 1975 supervision mission reported work as being 33% above the
appraisal figures. There was a delay, however, in organising the
outgrowers and carrying out soil tests resulting in their achievement
being 67% of the appraisal target. It appears that as outgrovers were
not apprised fully about the Project in the early stages and not being
fully committed, they could not readily appreciate why they should
provide labor for planting. Rainfed cane is planted in December/January
coinciding with foodcrop activities which caused a labor shortage and
hampered planting. While the estate pushed rapidly ahead with the
physical implementation of land clearing, preparation and planting, the
support services such as surveying, recording and forward planning were
inadequately staffed. The early statistics, therefore, were unreliable
and several rechecks had to be made and figures readjusted at supervision
missions before reasonably accurate areas of land under cane emerged. By
June 1976 the position improved both in implementation and recording, and
overall was about 115% of the appraisal target (estate 126% and
outgrowers 88%). By then KSC were working to higher targets than those
at appraisal and felt the land could and should be further improved:
specifically, if local finance could be made available the planting
program could be brought forward by a year, which w-.uld improve the
factory viability. At this time certain sections of GOT were of the view
that in order to maximise factory capacity cane should be grown on an
estate basis, while others felt that outgrowers should receive more
emphasis. In December 1976 the Bank requested GOT to clarify its policy



- 12 -
to ensure a regular supply of cane to both XI and K.!I factories for the
future. The matter was finally sorted out in early 1977 when GOT stated
that apart from estate production, outgrowers in parastatal organizations
such as Kilosa (KDDC) and varioue cooperatives would be encouraged and
assisted by KSC. The individual outgrowers who had proved reliable in
the past would continue to receive mechanisation support for bush
clearing, cultivation and planting where required. This would, it was
thought, ensure that the factories would be fed to capacity. On the
whole, this was a big program requiring good management, but
coincidentally management changes were also taking place.
3.08     By early 1977, the Managing Agents had been at KSC for nearly 12
years, qualified Tanzanian staff were becoming available, and GOT felt
that the time was opportune to localise KSC's management. The existing
managing agency agreement which expired on April 30, 1977 was therefore
replaced by a Management Advisory Agreement whereby the previous Managing
Agents would second to KSC a General Management Advisor, a Factory
Management Advisor and an Agricultural Management Advisor. The original
expatriate General Manager and the Agricultural Manager provided by the
consultants left and their posts were filled by their Tanzanian
deputies. The ten remaining expatriate staff originally employed by the
consultants were expected to be employed by KSC and an agreement was
reached between KSC, SDC, the Treasury and the Dutch Government for the
Ltopping up" of the expatriate salaries.  Most of the expatriates,
however, did not readily accept the switch from working for the Managing
Agents to direct employment by GOT (through KSC). By November 1977 only
4 of the posts had been filled (Instrument Engineer, Chief Engineer,
Chief Stores Officer and Financial Controller) leaving the important
posts of 3 mechanical engineers (factory), 1 factory workshop engineer, 1
tractor workshop engineer and . farm machinery and transport manager
vacant. At this time, quite apart from the vacancies mentioned above,
there had been a large turnover of junior management which created gaps
in middle management. There were no Assistant Field Managers in XI and
only two in KII whereas there should have been three in each. The
General Management Advisor and the General Manager proved to be
incompatible and the former was tr-inoferred to Kagera estate as General
Manager leaving the advisory post vacant. Unfortunately at this time SDC
was insufficiently staffed to con1tre and guide KSC.
3.09     In March 1977 SDC issuea a directive to KSC on the planting to
be done in 1977/78 to achieve full factory capacity in 1978/79. A
concerted effort was made during 1977/78 and by November 1977 the cane
area had been increased above appraisal targets to compensate for lower
yields per acre experienced in the preceding three years. The
comparative areas were:

It will be seen that the Estate area overall was to be 12% above
appraisal, mainly in the rainfed area, while the KII outgrowers would be
94% above and the KI area only 61% of the appraisal figures.
3.10     The April 19.8 supervision mission, however, found that matters
were not improving. Cane production was lower than anticipated at
appraisal and in the previous season was even lower than estimated by
KSC. The 1977/78 estimate by KSC was 31,337 tons sugar and achievement
was only 23,111 tons although the milling season was extended to February
15, 1978. As a result the 1978/79 estimates had been revised downwards
from 42,800 to 32,884 tons of sugar. The figures (including YI factory)
were:

3.11      Various reasons were given for the low yields which at that
time were averaging: RI estate 32 tons cane/acre (TCA), KII estate 28.5
TCA and outgrowers 20TCA. (At appraisal averages were taken as:
Irrigated cane KI & KII 45TCA, Rainfed cane 36TCA and outgrowers 30TCA).
The KX irrigation equipment was old, had not been maintained and was
virtually ineffective; KII irrigation installation was delayed and the
whole of KII estate could be considered rainfed; the outgrowers did not
use any fertiliser. Apart from these it was found that in some of the
KII plantings there were gaps of up to 25% of the area. The Agronomy
Department reported that management at that time did not heed their
advice and there was evidence of conflict (the Agronomist subsequently
left). The Agronomy Department was of the opinion that low yields were
principally due to the application of fertiliser at the wrong time and no
soil analyses having been done on which fertiliser programs could be
based. Over 90% of the estate was planted with variety NCo376 which is
suitable for the area and soil conditions but susceptible to smut
(ustilago acitaminea) which was present and depressing yields.  They also
confirmed a low plant population which they felt was due to lack of
supervision during and after mechnical planting; none or inadequate land
planing had been done. Adversely affecting both estate and outgrowers in
that season was a cholera epidemic and quarantine which restricted
movement of men and machinery. It was obvious at that time that the
Management Advisory Agreement was only working moderately well, there was
a lack of qualified staff, agricultural operations were sub-standard,
Irrigation in XII was behind schedule and the installation required much
more detailed supervision and coordination. Both KSC and SDC were
advised of the position and it was stressed that the reasons for the low
yields must be identified and dealt with. Another factor which adversely
affected the factory operations was lack of transport co haul the cane.
Even if yields had been higher it is doubtful if the cane could have been
transported. At the lower than estimated yields XI factory had 23% and
KII had 31% downtime due to shortage of cane in the 1977/78 season. This
meant a considerable amount of stand-over cane plus a large cane area for
the 1978/79 campaign estimated to produce about 50% more sugar than in
1977/78. Lack of staff and spares in the workshops had been the cause
but four Indian engineers and one Dutch tractor workshop engineers had
been engaged and a crash program was in hand to have as much equipment as
possible in operation by the start of the 1978/79 season.
3.12      The November 1978 mission reported estate development had been
completed ahead of schedule but the installation of the irrigation
equipment had only been 65% commissioned by August 1978 and yields were
therefore lower than anticipated. To make up for the low yields the
total acreage including outgrowers was 25Z above the appraisal
estimates. The standard of management appeared to have improved although
it was agreed that two more years of advisory service were required with
emphasis on agriculture, irrigation, cane haulage and factory
processing. By end-November 1978 a total of 65,000 tons of sugar had
been produced from both factories and by the end of the season 66,034
tons sugar had been produced compared with the appraisal estimate of
88,000 tons, KSC's original estimate of 80,200 tons and their revised



- 15 -
estimate of 66,589 tons. All cane har:ested in the 1978/79 campaign was
rainfed and the average for plant cane and three ratoons was 34.25 tons
cane per acre (TCA) compared with the appraisal figure of 38.25 TCA, a
shortfall of 10.5%. Plant and first ratoon yields were high because 60%
of the former and 24% of the latter was stand-over cane, but the mission
was of the view that as there was ample room for improvement of yields
due to better agricultural management practices, the appraisal figures
for rainfed estate cane could be obtained. The mission stressed the
importance of leaving about 900 acres of cane, which was retarded due to
the dry conditions which had prevailed during the milling season, for
crushing in the next season when it would have received the benefit of
the rainy season which was just starting . RSC management, however, were
reticent about accepting this advice as they were anxious to achieve
their revised target of 66,589 tons of sugar. Outgrower cane production
was 74% of the appraisal estimate and, since management regarded the
yields actually achieved as the best that could realistically be
expected, they planned to increase the outgrower area to 125% of the
appraisal figure. Additional transport for outgrower cane haulage would
be available for the 1979/80 campaign. The general condition and
availability of equipment together with the tractor workshop and overall
control had improved. While there were still problems with vibration of
the KII factory turbo-alternators, the 1978/79 campaign had shown a vast
improvement in factory performance. Overall project development had
proceeded well, inevitable problems in a project of this size had been
tackled sensibly and while a considerable amount of improvement was
necessary the Project appeared to have a sound base. The mission
therefore stated the Project was having only minor -roblems and
improving. This was a rare rating for project implementation in Eastern
Africa.
3.13      In the 1979/80 season the irrigated estate area was reduced by
67 acres (60 acres found unsuitable and 7 acres handed over to NSI) but
the balance 3,633 acres was still above the appraisal figure of 3,500
acres. A 21 acre block was developed in the rainfed estate bringing the
area to 4,529 compared with the appraisal figure of 3,800 acres. The
total estate area was therefore 8,162 acres which was 112% of the
appraisal figure of 7,300 acres. Because of lower than anticipated
outgrower yields, KSC decided to encourage outgrower production by
strengthening their outgrower department, organizing a separate project
outside the Bank-supported Project financed by the Tanzania Investment
Bank (TIB) and the Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB). About 5,230
acres of outgrower cane was to be planted, bringing the KI and KII
outgrower area to 9,395 acres or 204% of the appraisal figure of 4,600
acres. Overall the area under cane would be 17,557 acres or 147% of the
appraisal figure of 11,900 acres. The Bank was not consulted before the
outgrower plan was developed but it was roughly in line with the
consultants' study on Kilombero and was aimed at producing about 88,000
tons sugar in the 1980/81 crushing season based on average estate yields
of 31.5 TCA and outgrower yields of 24TCA. (Appraisal figures: estate
40.3TCA, outgrowers 30TCA). KSC appeared to aim at a larger area with
lower yields rather than identifying the causes for the lower yields and
rectifying them (see para 3.18).



- 16 -
3.14      The 1979/80 milling season got off to a bad start due to
excessive rains which commenced in November 1978 and continued almost
unabated until May 1979. Fields were flooded, cane flowered, the
campaign was late in starting and the labor went on strike because of the
additional work in trimming the bottoms which had been flooded and the
tops which had flowered. This prevented them from achieving their tasks
and deprived them of any bonus. The KSC sugar production estimate for
both factories for 1979/80 was 65,000 tons (appraisal 89,000 tons) but
the achievement was 51,948 tons (KI - 25,328, KII - 26,620). The average
estate yields at XI and KII were 27 and 27.9TCA respectively and the
rendement figures were 9.32% and 8.82% for XI and KII factories
respectively. The main reasons for the low output per acre and the low
sucrose content given by KSC management were the excessive rains which
adversely affected the cane and prevented replanting of the uprooted
areas and nurseries. Crop maintenance was sub-optimal because labor
could not work because of rain and equipment could not enter the fields
because of wet conditions. Tillering was poor resulting in low stalk
population, average stalk thickness was small, and flowering was early
and of a high percentage. The extreme weather conditions under this
campaign made it difficult to identify other reasons for the low yields
or any shortcomings in management which were to manifest themselves later.
3.15      In July/August 1979 there were indications that management was
improving as well as vehicle/equipment maintenance and utilisation, which
would result in better agricultural practices and improved yields. IThile
the KII irrigation system had become operative it had not been fully
utilised due to the unusual rains, and it was going to be some time
before comparative figures between irrigated and non-irrigated cane could
be established. A management advisory agreement with the consultants for
two more years had been finalised, and KSC estimated that in the 1980/81
season, due to increased outgrower cane area and production coupled with
better estate practices, at least 85,000 tons of sugar would be produced
compared with the appraisal figure of 8°,000 tons. Estate yields were
assessed at 31.45TCA and outgrowers' yields at 23.95TCA.
3.16      During the supervision-cum-preparatlon mission of February
1980, the General Manager of KSC was on forced leave pending an enquiry
by the Party (CCM) but there was no clear indication that management was
deteriorating. Prior to the mission a Bank consultant had paid a visit
to KSC to examine the soils in connection with the expansion program
which the consortium of consultants had proposed under the sugar study
financed by the Project. The Bank consultant felt that a careful check
and reappraisal of the expansion program was necessary and KSC staff
confirmed that about 75% of the existing estate area was poorly or
inadequately drained. The 1980/81 crop projections were closely examined
by the mission and the estimate was revised downwards to 65,000 tons of
sugar. This was even considered an optimistic figure and it was agreed
with KSC/SDC that their consultants would be asked to investigate and
identify if possible the reasons for the low yields bearing in mind that
the area under cane had been considerably increased. They would also
make recommendations on the action required to arrest the decline and to
bring yields back to a level which would feed both factories to capacity.



- 17 -
3.17      As the 1980/81 campaign progressed it became evident that the
quality of the cane being harvested was poor and the sugar content was
low. XSC therefore revised L..e estimate down to 60,720 tons sugar which
was still over-optimistic because the plant population on KII proved to
be significantly lower than expected and the stalk length and thickness
of the cane on KI was considerably below the long-term average. However,
despite the area under cane being much larger than envisaged at appraisal
and an excellent grouving season with 1,422mm of well-distributed rain
between December 1979 and May 1980, only 48,069 tons of sugar was in fact
produced (KI - 19,503 and XII - 28,566) from 508,748 tons cane. The
rendement was 9.47% from KI and 9.44% from KII.
3.18      The study which the February 1980 mission proposed was
completed by KSC's consultants by about July 1980 and the report was made
available to the October 1980 Bank mission. In general the decline in
yields was attributed to poor agricultural activities. The report
specified poor land preparation (ploughing and levelling), poor planting
(whole stalk planting and some of doubtful quality), inadequate weed
control (lack of herbicides), ineffectiveness of fertiliser (due to poor
irrigation and shortage of fertilizer), poor cultivation (done too late
or not at all due to lack of and bad use of available equipment, lack of
workshop backup and spares, lack of experienced personnel), inefficient
irrigation and drainage. The October 1980 mission discovered that
although the KSC General Manager bad returned to duty in April 1980,
having been cleared of the Party's charges, the standard of management,
loyalty and discipline in all sectors of the company had deteriorated
sadly. Although the irrigation system was now fully operative, its
utilisation was far from optimal. There was lack of supervision
resulting in wrong irrigation cycles, wrong spacing, wrong number of
sprinklers, pipes not vertical, sprinklers not revolving, blocked
nozzles, leaking connections and punctured pipes. Operators did not know
when to shut down and move pipes and the section manager could not be
traced in the field or in his office. With the drv weather prevailing
every effort should have been made for efficient use to promote healthy
cane growth after harvesting for the following season. Although the
August 1979 mission had found equipment/vehicle operation and mainterance
improving, it was reported to the February 1980 mission (there was no
harvesting in progress) that spare parts had again become a problem. In
October 1980, towards the end of the 1980/82. campaign, the shortage of
cane transport was causing excessive factory shutdown time. In these
conditions one would have expected tight control and supervision but the
mission reports this to have been totally lacking in the fields and in
the cane yards. It was obvious to the mission that the next season's
crop would be low because, apart from the irrigation constraints
mentioned above, it was found that the agricultural practices were being
skimped as tractors of the correct type, trash rakes and chisels were not
available. Due to lack of funds little or no replacement of KI
transport/equipment had taken place, and KSC management had instead
deployed KII project equipment to RI. How long this practice had been
going on is not kncwn becaus, earlier missions which had concentrated
more on the KII project had been assured that all project machinery was
in fact being used on the Project. The area was too vast to carry out



- 18 -
specific checks but the October mission was able to ascertaln that of 131
tractors financed under the Project 17 were beyond repair and were to be
sold. The balance 114 were split up as follows: 51 at KI (22 under
repair, 29 operating); 63 at KUI (20 under repair, 43 operating). This
meant that only 43 out of 131 project machines were operational at KII-
and the Project was being adversely affected due to the lack of a
properly coordinated replacement program at KI.
3.19      Subsequent missions were in connection with the preparation of
a proposed rehabilitation project and no further supervision reports were
submitted. It was decided by the SDC Board on December 30, 1980 that the
General Manager of KSC should be removed from his post at the end of
January 1981. The then expatriate General Manager of Mtibwa estate was
appointed General Manager KSC, which post he held until his retirement in
June 1983. He was replaced by the expatriate who had succeeded him at
Mtibwa on July 1, 1983. Through funds provided from the Export
Development Credit scheme, KSC was able to purchase some equipment and
the Dutch Government has financed 10 expatriate staff. This has
preventec the estate from sliding back while the future of a possible
rehabilitation project is being considered. The production over the last
three years is as follows:

capacity ar.ticipated at apprai_.,. and KI factory at under 50% capacity.

B. Irrigation
3.20     There is no discussion iu the SAR on the proposed irrigation
system other than a general description, a statement that it will be
needed early in 1974/75 for use by XSC in the development of the estate
and an indication in the critical path method network (Annex 12) of a
target date of June 1975. The draft bidding documents were not prepared
for review until January 1975, tenders closed June 20, 1975 and
completion was expected by November 1975. The supply and Installation of
the irrigation system was fairly large and complex and the consultants
who were supervising the factory building work were awarded the contract
for design and supervision of construction. They were not responsible
for the supply and delivery of the equipment; to save on costs this was
split up, which caused problems at a later date. The pipes were supplied
from Belgium, the sprinkler equipment from Austria, shipping, delivery to
site and insurance was awarded to a West German firm, and the
installation was entrusted to a local contractor. There were numerous
changes in the consultant's staff, shipping mix-ups and a lack of
coordinated control of all the people involved. In retrospect the
possibility of a turnkey contract for the irrigation works should have
been given more serious consideration.
3.21     In April 1976 a Bank consultant visited the site and esamined
the specifications, the work in progress and confirmed that, apart from
some over-designing and suggested improvements to protect the river bank,
the system as a whole was satisfactory. Shipments were on time and it
was estimatel that the main line would be completeL' by December 1976 and
pumping tests carried out on the entire system early in 1977. The
installation contract was awarded mid-1976 to a reliable local contractor
but there was a delay in the transportation arrangements of the pipes
from Dar-es-Salaam to site and a new completion date of September 1977
was set. Further slippage took place: by March 1977 it was estimated
that completion would be November 1977 but that portions of the system
could be handed over progressively; by November 1977 some of the trenches
had caved in, 85% of pipes had been laid but only 30% tested as KSC had
not provided the test pumps as per contract, shortages of essential pipes
and gaskets were discovered, and the new completion date became February
1978. The April 1978 supervision mission discovered a lack of
coordination and progress was very slow. The General Management Advisor
had been allotted the task of overseeing and coordination when the new
consultants' management advisory agreement came into effect but shortly
afterwards he was transferred to Kagera and control lapsed. KSC made
efforts to bring this facet of the Project back into line but the system
was not completed until November 1978, three years behind the appraisal
date and L..- years behind the date set at the beginning of 1975.
3.22     Due to the heavy rains in November 1976-May 1979 the system was
not fully utilised, and it was therefore not possible to diagnose any
shortcomings in t.ae system or establish any comparative figures between
irrigated and rainEed cane. The supervision-cum-preparation mission of
February 1980 was :nformed that the irrigation system could not be used
when the factorv wa. not working due to limited power being available
from TANESCO. Although the November 1980 mission was advised that the



- 20 -
TANESCO power problem had been resolved and the system was fully
operative, it was found that it was being poorly operated as described in
paragraph 3.18. During a visit to the estate in July 1983 in connection
with the PCR, it was sound that TANESCO power had become a problem again
as additional load had been added to the transmission lines and
transformers. As a result KII irrigation could only be used to 60%
capacity and the new KI system (financed separately under Dutch and
Danish aid and Austrian suppliers' credits) to 50% capacity. Action was
planned to resolve the difficulties but when it would be achieved wts not
known. KSC has summed up the problems of the KII irrigation installation
work as stemming from poor coordination between the four
suppliers/contractors involved, unplanned shipments resulting in
materials arriving in the wrong order of use and poor consultancy input.
On start-up there was insufficient power and excessive bursting of
pipes. The former has still to be resolved but the latter has been
rectified by lowering the working pressure and better coordination
between the field and the pumping stations. With increased usage from
1981, problems of lack of spares, inadequate numbers of lines, lack of
repair facilities and lack of transport for supervision manifested
themselv'es. These had been resolved by the 1982/83 season but KSC
foresees problems ahead unless it is allocated foreign exchange to
replace damaged pipes. The system has been in partial operation for six
years and a regular replacement program is essential. The result of all
these delays and misfortunes is that KII irrigated area has never
received the full benefit of irrigation which has had a deleterious
effect on past and future yields of cane.
Weir across Great Ruaha River
3.23     The effects which the construction of the Kidatu Hydroelectric
dam would have on the river were not foreseen at preparation nor
appraisal. The Kidatu reservoir acted as a silt and sand trap lowering
the river's normal load of sediment, resulting in scouring and degrading
of the river bed adjacent to the new KII pumphouse. The stage was
reached when the pump intakes were actually clear of the water. KSC
built a temporary weir which was breached on several occasions,
consultants' advice was sought by SDCIKSC and a permanent weir was
constructed together with reinforcing of the river's banks. The initial
cost of the temporary weir was TSh 0.75m ($0.105m) but emergency repairs
cost TSh 3.25m (SO.45m) and the permanent weir cost DG4.91m (US$ 1.75m)
including consultancy fees plus TSh 2.57m ($0.36m). The whole was met by
Dutch grants. The Mtera dam which controls the flow of the Great Ruaha
River to Kidatu has been completed, which means that in future there
should be no excess flow from the Kidatu dam which caused the extensive
damage to the original rock weir constructed by KSC. The weir as now
constructed does not have any sluice gates and the road once envisaged
will not be constructed due to lack of knowledge about the weir's
foundations. There will, therefore, be no means of transporting cane
from KI estate to KII factory across the weir as envisaged in the
development program prepared by the sugar study consultants.

C.   Factory
3.24     Under Part II of the Project, a factory having a capacity of
2, 400 tons of cane per day (TCD) Was to be constructed and ready for
start up by July 1976. It was estimated that the factory would produce
45,000 tons sugar per annum in a milling season of 200 days allowing for
10% factory downtime with an outturn of 10.5% sugar to cane. A
fixedprice turnkey contract was awarded to a Dutch firm covering the
factory building, milling machinery, cane intake, steam and power
generation plants. The ancillary work comprised tractor workshops,
warehouses, storage tanks, offices, pump stations and canals for factory
and irrigation water supply, a teleDhone system and spare parts for the
factory equipment. The construction was supervised by XSC's Managing
Agents under a separate contract.
3.25     The factory buildings and the machinery installation were
completed by July 1976 when test runs were carried out. The factory was
officially opened by the President of Tanzania on August 3, 1976.
Rectification of problems with the boilers and the turbo-alternator sets
delayed the start of actual milling trials until September 10, 1976.
During 53 operating days 35,000 tons of cane were crushed, equivalent to
660TCD or 27.5% of design capacity. Liquid fuel consumption was
excessively high due to low tliroughput and resultant low bagasse
production. Numerous operating problems came to light some of which were
attributed to design, others to faulty installation. The main ones were
excessive vibration of the turbo-alLernators (one had to be sent back to
Germany for rebalancing), unreliable automatic regulation of the steam
supply, low steam generation, inadequate level control of the
evaporators, impurities detection equipment was over-sensitive, an
uncerground cable to the induced draft fans burned out and there were
numerous mechnical problems with driving gears, chain drives, leaks in
the plumbing installation, etc.  The Principal Contractor's Project
Manager was replaced and experts from the various suppliers were brought
in to rectify defects during the non-milling season. Successful
performance tests were eventually conducted between September 3-5, 1977
when the factory over a continuous 3 days running averaged 2,518 TCD,
fuel consumption was 4.99 litres per ton of cane (satisfactory because of
low fibre content in the cane) and total downtime 'or factory reasons was
9.37%. The suppliers of the turbo-alternators stated that the vibrations
were within permissible limits and the warranty on these units was
extended to October 1979. By October 15, 1977? Nu 1 alternator had to be
closed down because of excessive vibration and an expert had to be sent
to investigate the situation. In the meantime the contractors refunded
TSh 1.22 million to xSC, based on a claim submitted by their Managing
Agents, fur late completion and testing.
3.26     The factory has never been extended to full capacity over a
prolonged period since it started up and the performance is shown in
Table 5 up to 1980/81. In subsequent years sugar produced was 30,000,
25,394 and 27,47n tons up to 1983/84, which means the factory has cnly
been operated at about two-thirds of its capacity in any one year.
Despite this KSC feel that factory performance has been generally
satisfactory (once the initial problems had been rect'fied), the major
exceptions being the vibration of turbo-alternatcrs mentioned above and
prob'lems in cane lrading and handling because the cranes were too fragile



- 22 -
for heavy duty operations. However, factory performance as a whole
cannot be fully evaluated until yields rise and full and continuous
capacity mi±uing seasons are achieved.
D.   Tractor Workshops and Maintenance.
3.27     KSC had a past historv of poor tractor and equipment maintenance
(paragraph 1.05) and the additional strala put on the KI workshops during
the development of KII estate aggravated the situation. After the
completion of the KII tractor workshops in July 1976, KSC reorganised the
workshops into a light and heavv section, and the November 1976 missioz
again reported an improvement in maintenance and servicing. There was,
however, a shortage of spares and materials due to import restrictions
which was discussed with Treasury aad Kilimo representatives. Staffing
of the workshops lagged and by March 1977 onl- 5 of the 9 engineers
required were in post, middle echelon staff were only 40% of the cadre
and there was a shortage of Grade I mechanics. Although this was pointed
out to the management of KSC/SDC, the November 1977 mission again
reported poor operation and maintenance of equipment due to lack of
trained mechanics, workshop engineers, senior tractor workshop and
transportation staff and inadequate stocks of the correct spares. There
was a wide range of makes and models compounding the difficulty of proper
ordering, and although KSC could now order directly instead of through
the State Trading Corporation they did not have the qualified staff to
organize it efficiently. BY April 1978 five expatriate engineers had
been employed, local agents for vehicles and equipment had been called in
to carry out repairs and to advise on maintenance procedures, and
mechanization officers who had been acting as workshop engineers were now
in the agricultural department to control the use of plant and
machinery. By November 1978 a Farm Machinery and Transport Manager was
in post, a private firm of advisors had carried out a stores survey and
-were about to submit recommendations in inventory control, and KSC felt
they were getting on top of the equipment and vehicle operation and
maintenance problems. The improvement continued and KSC reported to the
August 1979 mission that they had 90% of vehicles and equipment plus 100%
of tractors and trailers on the road at the start of the 1979/80
campaign. A stores controller had been employed and was progressively
improving systems and about TSh 6m ($0.7m) worth of obsolete stock had
been identified which would be sold or modified to suit existing
requirements. Unfortunately, by the end of the 1980 milling season the
position had again deteriorated, there was a shortage of transport for
cane haulage causing shutdowns at both factories, and agricultural
practices were being skimped for lack of the correct equipment (paragraph
3.18).
3.28     At the request of SDC a special study was made in 1980 by the
KSC consultants, who also provided the management advisory services, and
they recommended a massive injection of field and transport equipment,
particularly into KI estate. The misuse of KII project equipment has
already been discussed at the end of paragraph 3.18. The situation was
partially alleviated by funds from the Export Development Credit and by
the control exercised by the new General Manager who took over in
February 1981. A new expatriate workshop team (2 Chief Engineers, 4
supervisors) under a Farm M;achinery/Transport Manager was installed in
1982, financed by Dutch aid and supplied by the consultants who provide
the management advisorv services and the current expatriate General



-23 -
Manager. In July 1983 a mission in connection with this PCR found that
the position of both KI and KII workshops was vastly improved but this
cannot be maintained without an injection of foreign exchange in the
immediate future, as most of the salvaged and modified spares have been
used up. Although the machines can be made to run, they cannot all be
operated at full capacity and a replacement program is necessary. Unless
this is put in hand immediately, the present expatriate staff cannot see
how they can achieve more than they have done and the position will again
deteriorate. The bulk of the expatriates, apart from two on the
permanent staff of the consultants, are on two year contracts but the
work ahead of them will take much longer; it is doubtful if all will wish
to extend their contracts unless they have the materials with which to do
their work.
3.29     Due to frequent changes In workshop staff and senior management,
coupled with a hand-to-mouth existence forced on KSC by import and
foreign exchange restrictions over the years, there has been a lack of a
coordinated equipoent policy. This has resulted in a multiplicity of
makes and types of machines making servicing and maintenance
unnecessarily difficult. Some of the machines on the inventory are not
now required and others are not ideally suited for the work to be done.
During discussions with the present expatriare staff at KSC, it was
agreed that the following action is now required: (1) Assess and list
accurately what machinery is required for the operations of KI and KII
plus outgrowers; (2) Prepare a full condition report on each existing
machine which fits 5nto this list; (3) Quantify costs to overhaul and
rehabilitate each machine; (4) Decide on (a) which machines can be
economically rehabilitated, (b) which should be sold or scrapped and (c)
what new purchases are essential; (5) Decide on necessary fleet changes
and standardisation for the future when considering item 4(c). This is a
big task and it is doubtful whether the existing expatriate staff can
undertake it and carry out thleir current work program at the same time.
Inputs by a specialist consultancy team will be required.
E. Ancillary Works and Other Items
3.30     Support work under Part - of the Project comprised the
construction of roads and a rail link, deep wells for a potable water
supply, staff housing, community center and guest house, shopping area,
primary school and a police station. Numerous problems attended the
implementation of these works, some of which were resolved during
implementation and some of which still exist.
Roads
3.31     Access roads to the factory and fields were successfully
constructed with equipment funded under the Project. The standards were
good and the roads have stood up remarkably well. Maintenance has been
only fair due to the lack of a planned program caused mainly by the lack
of trained management personnel, vehicles and equipment. This is a
matter which will require continued attention in the future to obviate an
expensive road rehabilitation program.



- 24 -
Rail Link
3.32     The rail link for the transportation of sugar and molasses was
constructed by the East African Railways Corporation. W7ith the
dissolution of the East African Community in 1977 the service was taken
over by the Tanzania Railways Corporation, which for a variety of reasons
has been unable to provide adequate wagons and tankers since 1977. This
has resulted in KII sugar being mainly transported by road and molasses
being firstly transported to KI by private contractors owning small
tankers, where it is transferred to tankers on the TAZARA rail link for
delivery to Dar-es-Salaam for export. (KI is served by both TAZARA and
Tanzania Railways Corporation). This has resulted in heavy
transportation costs.
Wells and Potable Water
3.33     The original project design contemplated two deep wells and
these were constructed by an international firm of contractors based in
Tanzania. Some water was also supplied through the KII factory water
treatment plant. The deep well water supply has been unsatisfactory from
the beginning as regards quality and quantity and finally the wells
collapsed and are now unusable. The factory water supply depends on the
use of imported chemicals which are not always available, and with the
large increase in population at KII potable water is a problem. KSC
management have taken the matter up with the Regional Authorities who
agree that water supply in the area is really their responsibility and
will endeavor to obtain funds from the Central Government to ease the
situation. In view of Tanzania's current financial situation this will
not be easy and will inevitably take time. KSC intend to construct a
separate main to carry untreated water to be used for flushing toilets,
watering gardens, etc and are also planning an alternative good water
supply from springs situated close to the TANESCO power house complex.
Housing
3.34     International tenders were invited for the devel-pment of the
housing estate including staff houses, guest house, community center,
shopping center, school and police station in accordance with the SAeR.
The bids received were much higher than the allocations in the SAR and
the requirements had to be reassessed to suit the availability of funds.
A substantial part of the increase was due to the need for extra 'C' type
houses caused by the dispersal of people living close :o the estate at
the time of appraisal to distant Ujamaa villages. There were protracted
negotiations between the Bank/GOTISDC/KSC regarding how the cost overruns
were to be financed. Although adjustments could be made between
categories, GOT had to increase its counterpart funding. The contract
was finally awarded in January 1976 for 15 'A' type houses, 20 'B' type
houses and 704 'C' type houses, a guest house and a community center, and
the work was essentially completed by mid-1977. Modifications had to be
carried out later to the 'C' type houses to prevent the ingress of rain,
to give some privacy to the kitchen areas and to improve the drainage
system. Due to lack of supervision by the consultants, rectification



- 25 -
work had to be carried out to the community center, which was done at the
consultants' expense. Cane cutters' camps to house seasonal labor are
being constructed under a phased program by KSC and in the meantime the
temporary camps set up by the building contractors are being used for
this purpose. Using hindsight more detailed planning at preparation and
appraisal and during implementation by the supervising consultants of
this large housing complex would have been advantageous.
Sugar Survey
3.35     To avoid continued piecemeal growth of the industry, the Project
included provision for a country-wide survey of sugar potential which
would identify possible development areas and include preparation of
detailed feasibility studies (SAR 4.14). The study was late in starting
and the TOR drafted by the appraisal mission had to be amended by SDC
(with Bank approval) to suit the changed conditions. As the study
progressed it was found that there was considerably more work involved
than envisaged at appraisal, including extensive soil analyses and aerial
surveys plus a manpower development survey. The final survey cost was
US$ 771,000 in foreign exchange plus TSh l.lm ($134,000) in local costs
of which $869,706 was claimed from Project funds.
3.36     The study report proposed for consideration by GOT/SDC the
expansion of Kilombero I factory from 40,000 to 43,000 tons and KII from
45,000 to 94,000 tons sugar per annum making a total of 137,000 tons;
expansion of Mtibwa from 25,000 to 54,580 tons; and the development of a
new estate and factory at Ruipa to produce 111,600 tons sugar per annum.
The reports contain much useful information but unfortunately, because of
the decline in the sugar industry mainly due to Tanzania's foreign
exchange constraints, they cannot be used for developing new expansion
projects at present. Because of the decline in Kilombero performance a
rehabilitation instead of an expansion program is under consideration,
Mti')wa expansion -was scaled down to a factory improvement project (being
funded by the Netherlands), and the Ruipa project is held in abeyance.
Ihe manpower study (see para. 3.40 below) was linked to the expansion
program but the criteria in the report still hold good and the report,
therefore, can be used as a guide to assist SDC in its manpower planning
even at a lover scale. It is a pity that more benefit is not going to
emerge from such a large expenditure on studies, but the idea at
appraisal was sound and the sad turn of events ix the sugar industry only
manifested themselves after the completion of the studies.
Training and Research
3.37     Because of the acute shortage of suitably trained manpower in
Tanzania at technical and higher levels, a training program was built
into the Project. At the time of appraisal GOT had decided to set up a
National Sugar Institute (NSI) at Kilomberc funded by the Dutch. KSC had
in place a system comprising in-company training schemes and fellowships
aimed at upgrading its staff at all levels. These programs required
strengthening and expansion to meet the needs of KII estate and factorv
as well as the general growth of the sugar industry.



- 26 -
3.38     An experienced expatriate training coordinator/instructor was to
be recruited under the Project to review and upgrade existing training
courses, curricula and procedures. More workers and supervisory staff
than necessary for KI would be employed so that they could receive
training, and then experienced personnel would be divided between 1l and
KII when the latter became operational. Training was to cover all facets
of the sugar industry including field work, cane transportation, tractor
workshops, factory operations, factory workshops and maintenance, civil
works, administration and accounts.
3.39     Despite repeated requests the training coordinator was never
recruited, and finally a Tanzanian was sent on a diploma course in
'Industrial Education and Training". Training at lower levels based on
in-company training worked reasonably well, but training for middle level
supervisory staff got off to a slow start and it was only at the
beginning of 1978 through the insistence of supervision missions that
overseas training programs were initiated. 28 candidates were sent for
overseas training in material management, accountancy, industrial safety,
general management, mechanical and electrical engineering, industrial
education and training, personnel management, crop pathology, planning
and control in agriculture, irrigation, sugar cane technology and power
electronics. Apart from this a number of candidates were sent for
training to various establishments within Tanzania.
3.40     Out of Project funds, US$515,668 was spent on training, about
US$36,000 was provided by the main factory contractors for factory
training and US$107,000 was provided by the Dutch Government in the
advisory consultants' contract which was utilised for various training
facilities. The Bank also provided a sum of US$276,000 for equipment for
the NSI. In the national sugar study (para. 3.35 above) financed under
the Project, the consultants made a thorough study of manpower and
training needs for the sugar industry as a whole and submitted a report
to SDC in January 1980. At that time, taking into account the sugar
expansion program which GOT had in mind, the consultants assessed that
the additional manpower requirements were for 183 managerial, 410
supervisory, 185 clerical, 1,618 artisanal and 426 semi-skilled workers:
a total of 2,822 personnel over a ten year period. The costs were
estimated at TSh 39.5m ($4.8m) local and US$448,000 foreign costs. These
figures will be reduced because the expansion program cannot take place
as planned, but they give an indication of what is still required for
manpower training in Tanzania's sugar industry.
3.41     In spite of the training efforts made under the Project, the
results in terms of institution-building were not up to appraisal
expectations. Although most trainees returned to work at KSC (at least
initially), they still lacked depth of practical experience and were not
yet in a position to assume posts with independent management
responsibility. This is manifested by the current status where,
alongside the management advisory agreement, no less than eleven
expatriates have had to continue to be employed (under Dutch Aid) to fill
such posts as General Manager, Field Superintendent, Mechanisation
Superintendent, Irrigation Superintendent, Farm machinery/Transport
Manager, two tractor workshop engineers and four supervisors. There are
several technical posts in the factories filled by expatriates and the
Chief Accountant-cum-Financial Controller is also an expatriate. Sugar
estates/factories are usually in remote and somewhat inhospitable areas,



- 27 -
making it difficult to attract local managerial and technical staff of
the required calibre unless they are given considerable incentives to
take up these posts. Apart from this there is still a chronic shortage
in Tanzania of the numerous skills required to run a sugar industry and
it will take several years at considerable expense to rectify the
situation.
Research
3.42     Sugar research in East Africa was coordinated by the East
African Agriculture and Forestry Research Organisation (EAAFRO) with
headquarters at Muguga in Kenya. The EAAFRO sugar research station
responsible for the introduction, selection and breeding of new varieties
is at Kibaha in Tanzania. Pest control was based in Uganda. National
research comes under the Ministry of Agriculture but only limited variety
trial work was carried out at its research station at Katrin. Most
applied researcl is carried out by estates but this has been limited in
quantity and quality. With the break-up of the East African Community in
1977 the facilities at Kibaha were reduced. At KSC only little useful
work has been done and improvements made during the Project due to the
general constraints (see para. 3.11). The research component in the
Project was limited to the supply of two agronomists, two assistants and
some equipment. Even if the component had been bigger, it is doubtful if
under the circumstances prevailing at KSC more could have been achieved.
The sugar industry has approached GOT to implement a program of applied
research covering irrigation, drainage, field mechanisation, smut and
nematode control, cane quality and new varieties appropriate to various
geographical areas. With the new rapport being built up between the
three East African community countries, sugar research may improve but
this will take time.
Follow-On Project
3.43     In view of the continuing shortfall in overall sugar supply
compared with demand projections over the longer term, it was expected by
both the Bank and GOT that a follow-on project would emanate from the
results of the Sugar Study and feasibility reports. As explained in
para. 3.36, with the decline in Kilombero performance, it became apparent
that further expansion of Kilombero was unrealistic for the time being
and what is really required is rehabilitation of existing facilities.
Meanwhile, the Dutch had agreed to finance the necessary improvements to
Mtibwa factory. As preparation of a rehabilitation project at Kilombero
proceeded, the Danish Government, who had been requested by GOT to assist
in rehabilitating the Tanganyika Planting Company (TPC), approached the
Bank to ascertain how they could coordinate their action with the
Bank's. It was agreed in March 1981 that the Dutch would cooperate with
the Bank on the Kilombero rehabilitation while the Danes would cooperate
with the Bank on TPC rehabilitation. It was also agreed between SDC/GOT
and the lenders by the end of 1981 that a healthy overall sugar sector
was a prerequisite to a successful rehabilitation project and preparation
would therefore encompass the whole sugar sector. Five scenarios have
been developed covering full rehabilitation down to holding operations,
but the costs are high, particularly the recurrent foreign exchange costs
which will be
required to keep the industry going after rehabilitation. It is doubtful
if Tanzania can afford to embark on any of the scenarios given its
present economic situation, and the matter is under consideration by the



- 28 -
GOT. With its present limited resources, Tanzania will have to
decide no its priorities within the agricultural sector and where tvie
sugar industry fits into these priorities. The sugar industry is
relatively foreign exchange-intensive and the Bank's recent Agricultural
Sector Report rated sugar as a low priority in economic terms. It is an
import substitution crop as opposed to a foreign exchange earner (except
fcr molasses and the Lome convention quota), and to keep it in a healthy
state requires a large slice of Tanzania's limited foreign exchange
resources. The industry also requires cousiderable management and
technical skills which have not yet been developed in Tanzania. It will
take time and money to rectify the situation, and Tanzania's sugar
industry will continue to have to rely on expatriate management and donor
assis;,ance for some years to come.
Procurement
3.44     At the very beginning of Project implementation, problems in
procurement arose because of the Managing Agents' tendency to disregard
the Bank's procedural guidelines in their professed desire to 'get on
with the job". This was manifested particularly in the following two
actions: (i) award of a contract for staff housing without the required
approval from the Bank (this was subsequently proposed to be finauced
from other sources); and (ii) appointment of a Dutch firm as the
principal design and supervision consultants, also without prior RBnk
approval (the firm was retained after it had agreed to beef up its
staff). Apart from these initial lapses at the commencement of the
Project, procurement procedures were subsequently followed in accordance
with Bank Guidelines and the Legal Documents.
IV. Project Impact
4.01     Despite the development of considerable infrastructure, the
P°Tject so far has had less than its intended impact largely due to three
factors, at least two of which were beyond its control: a rapidly
(particularly in later years) deteriorating general economic situation, a
difficult and unsupportive policy environment, and extremely weak
management. With a severe overall shortage of foreign exchange and
completely inadequate ex-factory prices, the Project (as well as the
existing KI estate) was starved of funds for normal operation,
maintenance spares, and replacement of equipment. Weaknesses in
management (including the expatriate advisors) were manifested in the
failure to improve the irrigation and drainage systems at both KI and
RII, the use of unsuitable and costly cultivation practices, the
toleration of poor husbandry standards, etc. These weaknesses were
further compounded by the total lack of labor discipline resulting from
the politicization of management-labor relations which, among other
things, made it almost impossible to dismiss incompetent staff.
4.02     Although the results and benefits estimated during preparation
and appraisal have not been fully achieved, the Project has undoubtedly
developed the Kidatu area: the establishment of the estate and the XII
factory with the ancillary infrastructure is of great potential benefit
to Tanzania. Considerable effort is now required by GOT/SDC/KSC to
improve and sustain cane yields to ensure that the factory is kept
continuously fed to capacity, thereby exploiting to the maximum the large
investment wnich has been made.



- 29 -
4.03     The sugarcane outgrowers in the area have received extensive
assistance and a base has been formed from which further improvement is
possible. More detailed organisation and control is necessary, however,
to obtain the full benefits of outgrower cane production bearing in mind
that the KII factory has to depend on outgrowers for about one-third of
its cane supply. This subject will have to be more vigorously tackled by
GOT/SDC/KSC in the interests of both the outgrowers and KSC.
4.04     The Project provided employment to many hundreds during
implementation and has created permanent and seasonal employment since
the factory started up in 2977.  The number of permanent employees in KII
rose from 982 in January 1977 to a peak of 2,206 in December 1978 and has
now levelled off at about an average of 1,200. There is a large employee
turnover, a few leaving with due notice and a large number merely
absconding from duty for personal reasons. Seasonal labor varied between
about 1,200 in 1977 rising to 3,632 in 1980 and now averages about
2,500. If the necessary effort referred to in the two preceding
paragraphs is applied, there is greater useful employment potential.
4.05     The implementation and subsequent management of this Project has
highlighted the difficulties which obtain in running an efficient sugar
industry. GOT/SDC are now much more fully aware of the problems which
inevitably arise unless the ex-factory price of sugar is regularly
adjusted to ensure company liquidity and thereby the capacity to finance
replacements of equipment and the purchase of spares. Apart from this,
the necessity to make a regular allocation of foreign exchange of a
substantial amount to KSC (and the sugar industry in general) has become
clear.
V.   Financial Performance
5.01     As showrn in Table 1 the total project costs were estimated at
appraisal at US$55.8m (TSh 397.9m) and the financing was to be shared as
shown in para. 2.08. The Tanzanian contribution included at least USt4m
of self-generated funds by KSC who were expected to produce a net surplus
of US$10m after taxation in the 5 years from 1973/74 to 1977/78. In the
same period GOT was expected to receive a further US$4m in excise duty
from the incremental sugar production. From 1978/79, the Project's sixth
year, GOT was expected to show a positive net cash flow exceeding US$5m
per year (SAR 6.08).
5.02     Changes in the price structure of sugar are shown in Table 9
together with the variation in excise duty, etc.  The profit and loss
accounts of KSC for the fiscal years 1973 - 1981 are shown in Table 10.
The salient figures from these tables together with production figures of
KI factory have been compiled in Table 12. Actual sugar production at KI
dropped from 39,072 tons in 1973/74 to 20,094 tons in 1981/82. At
appraisal it was assumed to be 44,000 tons in 1973/74 and remain constant
thereafter at 45,000 tons per annum. XII actual production commenced in
1976/77 with 11,612 tons sugar rising to 30,000 tons in 1981/82, whereas
at appraisal it was expected to commence at 34,000 tons rising to 44,000
tons per annum over the same period. KSC, therefore, did not produce the
net surplus of US$10m as anticipated between 197;/74 and 1977/78. Apart



- 30 -
from 1973/74 KSC ran at an actual operating loss from 1974/75, and by
1977/78 the accumulated loss was TSh 26.5m (US$ 3.71m). In 1980/81 GOT
waived previous and current interest payments due by KSC, but even then
the accumulated losses had risen to TSh 38.25m (US$ 5.4m). With the
large increase in the ex-factory price in 1981/82 (mainly due to
negotiations for preparation of the rehabilitation project), the position
is now better and in 1981/82, due to an operating surplus of TSh 30.7m
plus TSh 8.5 other income, the accumulated loss had been reduced to TSh
0.7m, even on the low throughput of 50,000 tons. The main point,
however, is that KSC has been unable to contribute to the Project as
anticipated and the burden has fallen on GOT through SDC.
5.03     From the incremental sugar production in the KIT factory, using
the sales tax, excise duties, etc shown in Table 12, the total revenue
which accrued to GOT for the years 1976/77 and 1977/78 was TSh 66.4m (US$
9.3m). The amount from excise duty alone was TSh 14.34m (US$ 2m)
compared with the appraisal figure of US$ 4m. This ignores the actual
drop in KI production and the resultant loss in excise duty between
1973/74 and 1977/78. Actual production of the two factories is between
50-56% of appraisal targets and GOT revenue from excise duty, sales tax,
etc is very nuch lower than anticipated. GOT, however, introduced a
special revenue account in November 1974 of TSh 2,800 per ton, made other
adjustments and raised the domestic price from TSh 3,000 to TSh 6,000 per
ton. It will be seen from Table 9 how frequently changes were being made
to the price structure at this time in order to collect more revenue.
The sugar companies, however, did not get the full benefit of these price
increases and suffered in general in not having enough funds to carry out
adequate repairs and replacements. Due to the difficult foreign exchange
situation, spares were scarce and exorbitant prices had to be paid for
such items as were available. Although ex-factory prices were adjusted
from time to time, the increases usually were too little, came too late
and did not cover the cost of production. At negotiations it bad been
agreed that GOT would set an ex-factory price which would give a return
on the capital employed, taking one year with another, of at least 9%.
Due to the low production, the high rate of inflation and other demands
on GOT resources, the factory prices were never in fact adjusted to
achieve this during the project period, despite Bank supervisiou missions
continuing to point this out as a problem. (It may be recallf2d that it
was substantially on this pricing issue that IFC and other private
investors had been obliged some years earlier to sell their shareholdings
in Kilombero to the Government).
5.04     The actual project costs amounted to TSh 504.94m ($63.2m) and
were incurred as shown in Table 11.  The actual financing percentages
compared with those at appraisal were:

VI.   Institutional Performance and Development
6.01     During appraisal it was determined that there was insufficient
local management strong enough to continue running KI and at the same
time implement a Project of this size. At negotiations, therefore, it
was agreed that as a condition of effectiveness a new m3naging agency
agreement would be signed between KSC and the then existing Managing
Agents. It was also agreed that prior Bank approval would be obtained to
the terms of any renewal of the agreement or to any alternative
arrangements which may be made. (Paragraphs 2.06(h)and 2.07(c)). In
1977 GOT/SDC were keen to have KSC managed by Tanzanians and at the same
time the Managing Agents did not appear particularly keen to continue to
carry full management responsibilities. With the agreement of the Bank,
because at that time it did appear that local top management who had been
in the sugar industry for many years could cope, the managing agency was
changed to a management advisory agreement. This was not a success,
local top management failed and was replaced by expatriates. KSC is now
being run with a large expatriate staff indicating that institutional
development has been slower than expected at appraisal (paragraphs 3.08,
3.11, 3.18, 3.28).
6.02     A training program was built into the Project because of the
shortage of suitably trained manpower and an expatriate training
coordinator was to be recruited. The coordinator was never employed,
training got off to a slow start and had to be rushed towards the end of
the Project. Nevertheless a considerable amount was spent on trainiag
and it is disappointing that some ten years later so many expatriate
staff have still to be employed. If GOT wish to have a successful sugar
Industry managed by Tanzanians, a properly coordinated training program
for the whole industry is required (paras. 3.37-3.41).
6.03     KSC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sugar Development
Corporation (SDC). During the life of the Project there were numerous
changes in top management of SDC and they did not have senior experienced
technical staff to guide or monitor the work of KSC. Certain SDC staff
were sent on training under the Project which has been of L_nefit, but
much more has to be done if SDC is to be effective as a holding company
fully able to monitor the performance of its subsidiaries.
6.04     Because of the problems outlined above, heavy reliance on
consultants has resulted. Some consultants have been engaged for
specific tasks within the Project while others have operated over long
periods such as those providing management and management advisory
services. Performance and the results have been varied. The consultancy
work covering the housing and the KII irrigation scheme left something to
be desired. The sugar study was adequately handled although there were
cost overruns. The yields at Kilombero and the Project declined despite
having been managed by the firm of consultants who were insisted on by
the appraisal mission. SDC staff have pointed out that the managers (and
subsequently advisors) were working under difficult conditions and in
many instances their instructions/advice had not been adhered
to/followed. This is essentially correct but the consultants should have
then made clear their inability to manage under the prevailing conditions.



- 32 -
Compliance with Legal Covenants
6.05     During implementation both SDC and KSC had to be reminded by
most supervision missions (and during CouDtry Implementation Reviews) of
compliance with legal covenants. At the close of the Project there were
three Project Agreement conditions which had been violated: PA 3.05(b),
the training officer was never employed but a staff officer was trained
under the Project (para. 3.44); PA 4.02, submission of audited accounts
was always late; PA 2.04(b), without reference to the Bank a large number
of items of agricultural equipment were diverted for use on KI estate,
not part of the Project (para. 3.18). Clause 3.05 of the Development
Credit Agreement whereby the ex-factory price of sugar should be adjusted
to allow 9% return on the capital employed "taking one year with another"
was never achieved. Although an amendment to the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement (SlA 2.04) was agreed in principle by HQ on December 28, 1979,
the final amendments were never submitted to the Bank for approval.
VII.   Bank Performance
7.01     The Bank went into this Project with its eyes open having had
the experience of the two previous investments by IFC in 1960 and 1964.
The various issues were addressed during preparation, pre-appraisal and
appraisal and the rationale for the Project made good sense. The
estimated potential yields, however, proved in practice to be
over-optimistic.  It has now been learned from experience that a more
cautious approach is required taking into account all the constraints if
a project of this type is to be a success.
7.02     Phvsical implementation was satisfactory bearing in mine the
complexity of the Project. Supervision by RM1EA was regular, there was
continuity of staff and the mix of disciplines of members was correct.
MOA, SDC and KSC commented appreciatively on more than one occasion on
the help and guidance received from missions. The missions concentrated
initially on the KII Project and using hindsight it might have been
beneficial if they had looked more closely at KI operations earlier thar.
they did, when the downslide of YI yields and equipment might have been
identified. In the same context it would have helped if an
agriculturist/agronomist had been attached to some of the missions
between 1975 and 1978. At the same time it must be borne in mind that
KSC was managed and advised by a firm of international consultants having
a reputation of sugar experience and had been connected with KSC for many
years. One would have expected them to have brought the problems they
zere facing to the notice of supervision missions but there is no record
of this having been done.
7.03     Bank staff were helpful in dealing with financial problems
arising from the housing cost cverruns at the beginning of the Project,
assisting in getting GOI to reimburse KSC with funds, and funding some of
the equipment in the National Sugar Institute. They also interceded on
numerous occasions regarding ex-factory prices, although their success in
this field was not verv marked.
7.04     In the final stages it was Bank supervision-cum-preparation
missions which identified and highlighted the problems facing KSC as a
whole and guided SDC on how they should be tackled. Overall, Bank
performance has been satisfactory.

VIII. Economic Re-Evaluation
8.01     The major quantifiable benefit of the Project has been increased
sugar production which has substituted for imports and thereby helped
improve Tanzania's balance of payments position. However, due to the
various causes cited in earlier sections, actual KII production under the
Project has fallen well short of the appraisal targets of 45,000 tons'
sugar and 16,000 tons' molasses annually from 1979. The peak sugar
output level reached by XII was in fact only 32,889 tons (in 1978179),
after which production fell off again. In the absence of further major
rehabilitation investments, the best that can be hoped for over the next
10-12 years is that annual sugar production at KII can be held around the
25,000 ton level.
8.02     Largely as a result of the shortfall in sugar (and molasses)
production, the economic rate of return (ERR) on project investments is
now estimated at about 4% (Table 13). Ihis is well below the likely
opportunity cost of capital in Tanzania and compares unfavorably with the
ERR figure of 12.9% anticipated at the time of appraisal.  If sugar
production had in fact increased at the rate projected in the appraisal
report, the revised ERR would have been a more satisfactory 12%. The ERR
could also be significantly higher if world sugar prices rise
substantially above the levels projected for the rest of this decade,
although this is unlikely.
8.03     The above ERR estimate tak"s account of all investment,
operating and maintenance costs, including items such as research,
training and the sugar sector survey whose benefits in the long run would
accrue to the economy as a whole and not just to the Project. Costs and
benefits have been computed at border prices in constant 1981/82 terms,
and exclude all taxes, duties and subsidies. Since sugar production
under the Project is being used entirely for import substitution, the
economic analysis was based on import parity prices for sugar based on
the World Bank's commodity price data and forecasts, with appropriate
adjustments for ocean freight, handliDg and other charges (see footnote 6
in Appendix to Table 13). On the other h- iJ, since molasses output
(equal to roughly 3.5% of cane produced by weight) is largely exported,
.t has been valued on the basis of export parity prices.
8.04     In all calculations of economic costs and benefits, the foreign
exchange component (direct and indirect) h ; been shadow-priced to
reflect the economic cost of foreign exchange to Tanzania. Specifically,
the shadow exchange rate has been taken as '0% above the official rate in
1973/74-1975/76, 50% above the official rare in 1976/77-1979/80, and 200%
above the official rate thereafter (see iootnote 2 in Appendix to Table
13). In view of the difficulties occasionally experienced by Kilombero
in obtaining labor to work in the cane fields, the shadow wage rate has
been taken as equal to the market wage.

IX.   Conclusions
9.01     The objective of creating a plantation and constructing a
factory with the associated infrastructure to achieve considerable
savings in foreign exchange was sound when the Project was conceived in
1972/73. Although the implementation was carried out reasonably
successfully, the economic situation in Tanzania deteriorated rapidly
during the project period. The Project and KSC as a company suffered
from poor ex-factory prices which prevented RSC from generating funds to
replace the existing KI equipment and they therefore used KIUI project
equipment on KI to get over their difficulties. There was not enough
equipment to serve both KI and KII which resulted in the KII Project
suffering and the KI problem not being really solved. The sudden
deterioration of management exacerbated the situation, resulting in a
rehabilitation project having to be considered for Kilombero.
9.02     Lessons to be learned from this Project are:
a)     It should not be readily assumed that an ongoing company
or parastatal (however well managed) can easily handle
the substantial increase in workload and responsibilities
involved in taking on a large new project in addition to
its existing operations. The additional management
responsibilities and staff needs should be carefully
assessed and provided for in each such case, and the
possibility of creating an ancillary unit or entity (part
of, and reinforcing, the original organization) to assist
in preject implementation should also be considered.
b)     Pricing policy and financial performance covenants can be
critical to the success or failure of revenue-earning
entitities, particularly when the internal generation of
funds is an integral part of the overall financing plan
for a project (mainly to cover maintenance and
replacement needs). The enforcement of such covenants
should therefore receive highest priority in the Bank's
dialogue with the Government, both in the course of
project supervision and as part of general agricultural
sector policy discussions.
c)     In all sugar projects it is necessary to realise at the
outset the relatively high foreign exchange component in
both operating and replacement costs. This is
particularly the case when the objective is foreign
exchange savings and the crop or product is not actually
creating foreign exchange. Governments then have to made
adequate provisions for foreign exchange allocations from
their own resources.



- 35 -
d)     In crops such as sugar and particularly in countries like
Tanzania where so many operating difficulties abound, it
is only prudent to be somewhat conservative in
projections of benefits and implementation schedules,
with appropriate allowance for likely delays and risks of
non-performance in accordance with expectations. This
does not indicate that a negative attitude should prevail
but all possible constraints should be taken into account
to arrive at realistic projections under the particular
circumstances.
(e)   Although turnkey contracts may initially appear to have a
somewhat higher cost than separate contracts for
equipment, shipping, installation, etc., they may later
avoid costly delays in accrual of benefits and also
ensure the provision of an important management element
in the procurement process (particularly in situations
where foreign technical assistance is otherw'.'e a
sensitive issue). Projects should, therefore, allow more
scope for use of turnkey contracts, with proper
evaluation of bids including the relatively greater risks
and costs of delays in delivery and installation under
separate contracts.
