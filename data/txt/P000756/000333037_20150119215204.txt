The Health Sector Development Program Project for Ethiopia aims to develop a health system which
provides comprehensive and integrated primary care services, primarily based at community health
level facilities. It focuses on communicable diseases, common nutritional disorders, environmental
health and hygiene, reproductive health care, immunization, the treatment and control of basic
infectious diseases like upper respiratory tract infections, the control of epidemic diseases like malaria,
and the control of sexually transmitted diseases especially HIV/AIDS. The project has eight
components.
They 1) expand primary health care access; 2) improve the technical quality of primary health care service provision; 3)
expand the supply and productivity of health personnel; 4) ensure a regular and safe supply of effective, safe, and affordable
high quality drugs while improving prescribing behavior by health providers; 5) improve awareness about personal and
environmental hygiene and basic knowledge of common diseases and their causes as well as promote political and
community support for health services; 6) transform the health system into a four-tiered system that is linked, equitably
distributed, and managed in a decentralized, participatory, and efficient manner; 7) monitor improvements in service delivery,
quality, and financial performance and evaluate the impact, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the project's
components; and 8) improve financial sustainability.
