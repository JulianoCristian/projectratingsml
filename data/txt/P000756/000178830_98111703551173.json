comprehensive and integrated primary care services,\n            primarily based at community health level facilities. It\n            focuses on communicable diseases, common nutritional\n            disorders, environmental health and hygiene, reproductive\n            health care, immunization, the treatment and control of\n            basic infectious diseases like upper respiratory tract\n            infections, the control of epidemic diseases like malaria,\n            and the control of sexually transmitted diseases especially\n            HIV/AIDS. The project has eight components. They 1) expand\n            primary health care access; 2) improve the technical quality\n            of primary health care service provision; 3) expand the\n            supply and productivity of health personnel; 4) ensure a\n            regular and safe supply of effective, safe, and affordable\n            high quality drugs while improving prescribing behavior by\n            health providers; 5) improve awareness about personal and\n            environmental hygiene and basic knowledge of common diseases\n            and their causes as well as promote political and community\n            support for health services; 6) transform the health system\n            into a four-tiered system that is linked, equitably\n            distributed, and managed in a decentralized, participatory,\n            and efficient manner; 7) monitor improvements in service\n            delivery, quality, and financial performance and evaluate\n            the impact, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the\n            project's components; and 8) improve financial sustainability."}, "docdt": "1998-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
