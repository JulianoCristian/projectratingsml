performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: There is a need to synchronize the\n            infrastructure, human resource and support systems within\n            the accelerated expansion of Primary Health Care (PHC),\n            paying due attention to all components of the Health\n            Services Extension Program (HSEP); regions should prioritize\n            making existing health facilities (hospitals, health centers\n            and health posts) fully operational through rehabilitation\n            and provision of appropriately trained health workers,\n            equipment and medicines; central human resources development\n            must be strengthened, particularly in its strategic and\n            stewardship capacity, and it is urgent to establish\n            incentive schemes (in addition to the standard civil-service\n            provisions) to retain staff, especially at outlying\n            stations, and to ensure continuing service delivery for\n            disadvantaged populations; efforts are still needed in the\n            area of procurement and distribution, human resource\n            availability, rational drug use, budget allocation and\n            logistics to ensure regular supply of quality and affordable\n            drug supply to all levels; and there is a need to build\n            sufficient flexibility into a sector program so that the\n            efficacy of investment is not contingent upon the\n            involvement of other donors."}, "docdt": "2007-08-17T00:00:00Z"}
