The project has eight components. They: 1) expand\n            primary health care access; 2) improve the technical quality\n            of primary health care service provision; 3) expand the\n            supply and productivity of health personnel; 4) ensure a\n            regular and safe supply of effective, safe, and affordable\n            high quality drugs while improving prescribing behavior by\n            health providers; 5) improve awareness about personal and\n            environmental hygiene and basic knowledge of common diseases\n            and their causes as well as promote political and community\n            support for health services; 6) transform the health system\n            into a four-tiered system that is linked, equitably\n            distributed, and managed in a decentralized, participatory,\n            and efficient manner; 7) monitor improvements in service\n            delivery, quality, and financial performance and evaluate\n            the impact, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of the\n            project's components; and 8) improve financial sustainability."}, "docdt": "2004-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
