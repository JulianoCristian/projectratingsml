In addition, the research and\n            seed production capacity of ARI's Yezin station would\n            be strengthened through farm development; (b) develop seed\n            processing and storage facilities on the six farms and at\n            two or three ginneries selected for cotton seed handling;\n            (c) develop a quality control program based on seed testing\n            laboratories at ARI, on seed farms and at cotton and\n            groundnut facilities; (d) include a pilot project to\n            establish the feasibility of providing groundnut seed\n            storage in Lower Burma; (e) provide for overseas\n            post-graduate training of research staff and overseas and\n            local short courses for research staff, farm managers and\n            quality control staff; and (f) provide about 116 man-months\n            of technical assistance to training staff and assist in\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "1977-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
