                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to increase affordable access to electricity in remote rural areas of Bolivia.

                         To this end the project will:

                          (a)    Extend sustainable electricity access to at least 7,000 households, micro-enterprises, schools and/or clinics in remote and dispersed rural areas using
                         solar home systems at a subsidy of $650 per unit, and develop basic improved lighting solutions at a subsidy of $150 per unit for an additional estimated 2,000
                         very poor households (therefore directly benefiting an estimated 9,000 households, or 45,000 people).

                          (b)     Consolidate and mainstream a mechanism for electrification of dispersed households in Bolivia using output-based #Service Contracts# with private
                         sector for the provision of electricity with decentralized, renewable energy technologies under the framework of the Government#s universal access policy.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes            No
