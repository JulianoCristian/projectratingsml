The extension will be for 24 months\n            (from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2013). This restructuring\n            will reallocate approximately US$100,000 from disbursement\n            category two to disbursement category three. This change is\n            due to: 1) a decrease in the cost of the items to be\n            financed under category two since the bids for supplying\n            Pico-Photovoltaic (PV) systems came in significantly less\n            than expected, and 2) an increase in costs of category three\n            for consultant services since the government will no longer\n            have funds from the Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural\n            Transformation (IDTR) project, which closed on May 27, 2011,\n            to support the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)."}, "docdt": "2011-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
