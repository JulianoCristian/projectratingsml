                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
1.       This restructuring paper is for a second extension of the closing date of the $5.175
million Decentralized Electricity for Universal Access Grant (TF90206 and TF90207,
referred to below as the “Grant”). The extension would be for 24 months (from June 30,
2011 to June 30, 2013). This would result in a cumulative extension of 36 months from
the original closing date of June 30, 2010, and a total Project implementation period of
five years and eleven months from the signature of the Grant on July 20, 2007. A total of
approximately US$100,000 will also be reallocated among disbursement categories to
reflect the updated cost estimates of the Project.

2.      The proposed extension and reallocation of the GPOBA Project would enable the
disbursement of the US$5.13 million remaining grant funds (of the total US$5.175
million), allowing a minimum of 7,000 additional households to benefit from electricity
from solar home systems (SHSs) and an additional 2,000 of the poorest households to
benefit from low-cost pico-PV systems. In total, this would benefit approximately 45,000
people.

3.      In addition to an extension and reallocation, the Project will be restructured to
decrease the length of the service contract for the SHSs from four years to two years. The
length of the service contract is being decreased because it will not affect the quality of
service provided and will decrease costs. The solar industry has matured significantly
over the past few years, making systems and installation more reliable. This reduces the
need for formal visits from the service providers. Based on the data from the associated
Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural Transformation (IDTR) Project, two years is a
sufficient amount of time to maintain the systems.


PROJECT STATUS
Project Description

4.      The PDO is to increase access to electricity in remote, rural areas. Project
components are to fund output-based subsides to private providers for the sale,
installation, after-sale service, and market development for solar home systems in rural
households, microenterprises, schools, and clinics. The Project also aims to facilitate the
market development of the pico-PV market, and thus provide affordable lighting to the
poorest households. GPOBA has provided $5.175 million in funding (US$3,622,500
from the IFC Trust Fund and $1,552,500 from the DFID Trust Fund). The Project is
closely related to the IDTR Project and has been administered by the same Project
Implementation Unit (PIU).


                                             2
Causes of Implementation Delays

5.      As the Project shares a PIU with the IDTR Project, the initial delays associated
with the latter also slowed the implementation of the GPOBA Project. One delay was the
appointment of a new Minister and the ensuing allegations of fraud and corruption, which
resulted in the freezing of all procurement processes. Second, one of the two providers of
SHSs curtailed its activities in Bolivia due to its own financial problems arising from the
global crisis. Other delays resulted from lack of adequate staffing of the PIU.

Resolution of Implementation Delays

6.     These issues have now been resolved. The IDTR Project was restructured.
Taking into consideration the fact that one of the SHS providers has left, the restructuring
connects a certain number of households to the electricity grid instead of providing them
with solar home systems. The IDTR project achieved its PDO before the May 27, 2011
closing date. By the end of the grace period in September 2011, 92 percent of the funds
(US$18.3 million of US$20 million) will have been disbursed.

Current Project Status

7.      With the resolution of the implementation delays, which have affected both the
IDTR Project and the GPOBA Project, significant advances have been made. Under the
IDTR Project, the joint PIU gained substantial capacity and successfully oversaw the
installation of 10,100 solar home systems and 134 photovoltaic systems in schools and
clinics, and the connection of 20,000 households to the electricity grid. This has
benefitted approximately 165,000 people in total.

8.      Implementation progress on the GPOBA Project has been upgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory. A Bank-executed TA for a study of use of pico-PV systems has been
completed. The bidding documents for eight contracts were launched in July 2010 and
bids were received by September 23, 2010. The Evaluation Report has been received.
The contracts have been satisfactorily procured, and the Bank is prepared to issue its “no
objection.” Since the bids for the first procurement process came in significantly under
the expected value, the PIU plans to launch a second bidding process for the installation
of 1825 additional solar home systems.

9.      There are no outstanding audits; and overall financial management performance is
rated as moderately satisfactory.

PROPOSED CHANGES

   •   Reallocation

10.    This restructuring will reallocate approximately US$100,000 from disbursement
category two to disbursement category three. This change is due to: (i) a decrease in the
cost of the items to be financed under category two since the bids for supplying PV
systems came in significantly less than expected, and (ii) an increase in costs of category

         three for consultant services since the Government will no longer have funds from the
         IDTR Project, which closed on May 27, 2011, to support the PIU.

AMOUNT

              •    Components

         11.      Component I (US$4.6 million) involves contracting new SHS service contracts.
         As part of this restructuring, the service provider that installs the SHS will be required to
         provide satisfactory service over two years, in place of four years (as originally outlined
         in the PAD and loan agreement). The service provider will still carry out at least one
         visit a year to each user for the length of the service contract. This change will not affect
         the PDO or PDO indicators.

         12.     This change is justified based on the fact that it will not affect the quality of
         service provided, while at the same time it will reduce costs. The solar industry has
         matured significantly over the past few years, making systems and installation more
         reliable. This reduces the need for formal visits from the service providers. Based on the
         data from the IDTR Project, two years is a sufficient amount of time to maintain the
         systems and should generate some cost savings.

         13.    In addition, the installers have more experience and a greater presence within the
         country, making them easier to find and reach out to in the event there is a problem. For
         some of the richer customers, there is also a possibility for consumers to purchase

                                                             4
appliances for the systems, which increases the service provider’s interactions with the
consumers.

      •   Closing date

14.     The third change resulting from this restructuring is that an extension of 24
months (from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2013). This would result in a cumulative
extension of 36 months from the original closing date of June 30, 2010, and a total
Project implementation period of five years and eleven months from the signature of the
Grant on July 20, 2007. No further implementation delays are expected to delay the
GPOBA.

15.       There are significant reasons that justify this request:

             a. The Government of Bolivia (GOB) attaches high priority to rural
                electrification, as evidenced by its “Electricity to Live with Dignity”
                program. The GOB expects the GPOBA Project to make an important
                contribution to that program.

             b. The implementation difficulties that resulted in the delays to date have
                been resolved and Project Implementation Progress has been upgraded to
                Moderately Satisfactory (as described in Section B).

             c. The extension would have significant development impact. Services under
                the eight contracts from the procurement process that is under way and
                ready for to award contracts, can realistically be completed within the 24
                month extension. These services would allow 7,000 poor households to
                benefit from electricity generated by solar home systems and an additional
                2,000 of the poorest households to benefit from low-cost, small-scale
                (pico-Photovoltaic, pico-PV) solar systems. Thus, with the 24 month
                closing date extension, the Project Development Objective (PDO) can be
                fully achieved.

             d. The extension of the Project will provide a bridge for continued
                engagement with the GOB on rural electrification matters following the
                closing of the related Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural
                Transformation (IDTR) Project (P073367) on May 27, 2011, and a
                possible IDTR follow-on project which is being discussed. The GOB has
                expressed its interests in such a follow-on IDA credit to support its
                “Electricity to Live with Dignity” program. With extension of the GPOBA
                grant, GPOBA funding will allow key PIU staff to remain on board,
                preserving the momentum that has been built in the past year, and
                enhancing the ease with which a second phase IDTR Project could be
                prepared and implemented.

             e. GPOBA will fully fund the supervision, grant administration, and the PIU.
                GPOBA (DFID/IFC) has agreed to an extension of the funds until the end
                of the proposed closing date of June 30, 2013.

                                                 5
             f. The request from the Government confirms that the PIU will be composed
                of a financial manager, a monitoring manager, and two solar PV technical
                specialists. Once the extension is approved, the team will move ahead
                with processing these contracts.

* Funding for the service calls is included as a “guarantee” in the bidding documents, and
therefore no additional funds will be needed. The Government of Bolivia will continue
to oversee the completion of the contracts.

17.    The team believes that this is a realistic schedule. Although the first bidding
process was slow to get under way, it is now well advanced, and the Bank is prepared to
give its no objection and then award the contract. This will leave 24 months for
implementation and completion of the works under those contracts and an additional two
months to close them before the June 30, 2013, closing date. The second bidding process
should be completed by September 2011. Given the lessons learned and experience
                                               6
gained during the IDTR Project, it is expected that further implementation delays will be
minimal and that the works procured under the second process can be also completed
within        the       24           month          closing       date         extension.
