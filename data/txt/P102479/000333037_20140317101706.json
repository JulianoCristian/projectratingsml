follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderately satisfactory, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the active involvement of departmental\n            governments and municipalities proved to be instrumental in\n            the successful implementation of the project through the\n            provision of better information on the communities'\n            requirements, poverty challenges, and the need and provision\n            of additional financing. Also, since local interests are\n            consistent with the long-term sustainability objectives of\n            the rural electrification effort the involvement of local\n            entities during this period is essential. An adequately\n            designed bidding process has the potential of reducing\n            subsidy requirements and, hence, maximizing the outcomes of\n            a rural electrification project. The project experience\n            confirmed that a competitive process that incorporates\n            incentives to maximize the leverage of grant proceeds (e.g.\n            the selection of bids based on the lowest subsidy\n            requirement per unit) is an effective way of taking\n            advantage of what the market can offer, and actually reduce\n            subsidy requirements, while enhancing the scope of an\n            electrification project. Rural electrification projects are,\n            by nature, poverty reduction operations. The limited\n            affordability of rural households in dispersed rural areas\n            constitutes a major constraint that often requires the\n            support of local governments. The local contribution to the\n            financing of off-grid electrification projects should be\n            carefully assessed taking into account household's\n            affordability and local government's willingness and\n            capacity to support such effort. A flexible design -in terms\n            local contributions and levels of subsidy, adaptable to the\n            conditions found in each community should help in maximizing\n            the benefits of the electrification effort."}, "docdt": "2013-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
