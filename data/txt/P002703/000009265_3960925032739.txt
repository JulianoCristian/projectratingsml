PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TANZANIA - FIRST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Credit 601-TA)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        This International Development Association Credit, which was
channelled through the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB), was designed to help
Tanzania improve the quality of investments in the productive sectors of
the economy. Specifically, the project provided technical assistance to
prepare a pipeline of investment projects in the productive sectors, ear-
marked primarily for external and possibly World Bank Group financing, to
improve capacity utilization in industry, and to develop local manpower in
order to reduce dependence on expatriates (4.0). In order to achieve these
objectives, the Credit (i) financed pre-investment and feasibility studies;
(ii) financed productivity and capacity utilization improvement studies;
and (iii) strengthened the capacity of local institutions in project prepa-
ration and implementation by financing training for managerial staff. It
was envisioned that the credit would also create within TIB the capacity to
subsequently arrange corsultancy services for quasi-governmental and
govermmental organizations to help them prepare bankable projects. Discus-
sions between the Bank and the Govenment for the provisiom of a Technical
Assistance credit Pegan in early 1975 and were finalized late the same
year. The Credit was approved on November 25, 1975 and signed on January
9, 1976 in the amo1nt of US$6 million (paras.3.01, 4.01, 4.02).
2.        The Technical Assistance Credit experienced implementation
problems during the start-up phase that eventually led to a 30-month delay
in implementation beyond the scheduled closing date of June 30, 1980. The
delay was due to several factors. First, both IDA and TIB lacked at the
time experience in the management of such a multi-sectoral and complex
technical assistance credit which necessitated the creation of new institu-
tional structures (e.g. Technical Assistance Unit in TIB) to manage the
credit. The initial arrangement whereby the Resident Mission in Dar-es-
Salaam had to transmft all subprojects to IDA led to delays in subproject
approvals. Second, given the lack of experience on the part of TIB to
handle technical assistance of this nature, the original timetable for the
project's completion proved to be optimistic. Delays also occurred because
a considerable amount of time was needed by the Borrower to leara Bank
technical assistance procurement procedures, for hiring of consultants and
preparation of subprojects. Finally, the sub-borrowers were at first slow
in submitting applications for utilization of the IDA technical assistance
financing, partly because of lack of awareness and partly because of their
attempt to secure technical assistance on a grant basis from other external
sources  (paras. 5.01-5.03).
3.        Once the initial problems were sorted out implementation of the
Credit picked up speed. The Credit fianced a total of 33 feasibility and
capacity utilization studies, and training for 389 managerial staff. Out
of the 26 feasibility studies done under the Credit, 19 projects were
identified and included in TIB's project pipeline. Of these, 11 projects
have already been launched and decisions on implementation of recommenda-
tions contained in 8 more studies are pending. Recormendations contained



- iv -
in the rest of the seven studies have not been implemented either because
of the general deterioration in the macroeconomic environment in Tanzania,
or due to lack of external resources or because the proposed projects were
not found to be viable (paras 5.03 and 5.04). Of the seven capacity utili-
zation studies, recommendations contained in six have been implemented.
Recommendations in one study, namely those for a saw mill, have not been
implemented for lack of spare parts. The training component was the
fastest disbursing of the three credit components, such that in mid-1978 it
became necessary to increase the amount allocated under the credit to
training (para 5.07). Overall, disbursements were well administered. By
the closing date of June 30, 1983, a total of US$5.2 million (87% of the
total Credit) out of the total of $6.0 million had been disbursed and the
balance cancelled (para. 6.01).
4.        In general, the Credit succeeded in attaining its primary objec-
tives. A strong pipeline of new inveqtment projects was prepared, substan-
tial capacity utilization improvements were undertaken and training for
staff in TIB and other Tanzanian parestatals financed. As a result of the
training provided to its staff, TIB emerged as a stronger institution that
enjoys a good professional reputation in Tanzania. In addition, the staff
who were trained under the Credit enhanced TIB's capacity to be more effec-
tive in project identification, appraisal and promotion, and this enabled
the institutimn to influence positively the quality of sectoral invest-
ments, especially fpr projects that it helped finance. The objective of
institution building was attained and the Project Unit established under
this Credit has continued to operate under the second Technical Assistance
Credit approved in PY81 (paras. 7.01-7.04).
5.        TIB worked well as an executing agency for the Technical Assis-
tance Credit (para 7.01). The first technical assistance project provided
the following valuable lessons:
gi)    In order to avoid delays in execution, the administrative proce-
dures (for hiring consultants, processing documents, and procure-
ments) for such a multi-sectoral credit need to be carefully and
clearly defined at an early stage;
(ii)   the schedule for such first tlme multi-sectoral operations needs
to be more realistic so as to give the Borrower time to gear up
for the implementation phase; and
(iii)  such technical assistance projects need closer supervision by the
Bank during implementation, with emphasis on studies for projects
with higher local raw material content. Some of the procedural
issues could be resolved before the project is approved by the
Board (paras. 9.01-9.04).
6.        These lessons were borne in mind in the design and implementation
of the ongoing second Technical Assistance project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TANZANIA - FIRST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Credit 601-TA)
I* BACKGROUND
1.01      The Fitst Technical Assistance Credit 601-TA to the United
Republic of Tanzania was approved by the Board on November 25, 1975, and
signed on January 9, 1976, in the amount of US$6.0 million and became
efiective on September 14, 1976. The Credit constituted continued World
Bank Group assistance to Tanzania that dated hack to 1963 with an IDA
credit for education. The Credit was closed on December 31, 1982, after a
delay of 30 mont)s from the scheduled closing date. By June 30, 1983, a
total of US$5.2 million had been disbursed and the balance of 0.8 million
cancelled. The Credit was designed to provide technical assistance to fac-
ilitate Implementation of the Government's investment strategy in the pro-
ductive sectors, It was evident to both the Government of Tanzania and IDA
that, given the acute shortage of qualified manpower, public institutions
could not successfully implement the program without a large and sustained
supplemental technical assistance program. The Government's strategy posed
a major challenge for the country because of Tanzania's deteriorating
domestic economy..,
1.02      After inependence in 1961, tht Tanganyika African National Union
(TANU) political pIrty, under the leadership of President Nyerere, deve-
loped a philosophy (later articulated in the Arusha Declaration of 1967)
that aimed at restructuring Tanzania's political, social and economic
orientation by emphasizing the dual objective of achieving economic growth
accompanied by equitable income distribution. The public sector was
expected, under the Government's philosophy to play a central role in the
attainment of these objectives. By 1973, owing to large Government finan-
cial outlays plus substantial concessionary extemnal aid inflows, Tanzania
had made considerable progress in developing basic infrastructure and pro-
viding expanded social services. The bulk (80%) of total investments were
accounted for by the public sector, which derived most of its investment
resources from the Government. The majority of investments were in the
industrial sector by parastatals (accounting for 0S of industrial output
in 1973), which, due to poor performance, became financial burdens to the
Government.
1.03      In 1974, Tanzania was confronted by a severe economic crisis.
The drought and oil shock of late 1973 and early 1974, respectively, caused
a sharp decline in the production of the country's staple food crops and a
depletion of foreign exchange reserves. The drought forced the Government
to import large quantities of food in order to alleviate the imminent food
shortages. Export crops were also adversely affected by the drought,resul-
ting in lower export volumes at a time when commodity export prices were
rising sharply because of the OPEC oil shock. Both the OPEC-induced energy
crisis and the drought led to a stagnation in industrial output due to
shortages of Imported raw materials. The shortages resulted from a sharp
decline in export revenues and interruptions in hydroelectric power



-2-
and water supplies. In addition, many firms In all sectors of the economy
experienced declining productivity which was attributed in part to poor
incentives, poor machinery maintenance, ineffective management and inade-
quacy of industrial skills.
1.04      Government attempts to Institute an industrial restructuring pro-
gram in the face of declining economic performance, which coincided with an
expansion in the Bank Group's lending program to Tanzania, revealed the
acute shortage of suitably trained and experienced manpower in the
country. Part of the trained manpower vitally needed in Tanzania was
deployed in the running of the large corporations and services belonging to
the East African Community (EAC) which consisted of Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda. The EAC had been set up in 1967 by the three member countries to
foster increased and comprehensive political and economic cooperation among
the three partner states. However, due to divergent political developments
in each country, the cooperation became strained. Eventually the arrange-
ment proved untenable and led to the dissolution of the Treaiy of East
African Cooperation in 1977.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION
2.01      The issues affecting industrial performance were raised in
various Bank economic and sector reports on Tanzania, accompanied by
substantive intra-Governmental discussions on possible solutions. The Bank
Group participated in these discussions within the context of its general
country economic work. The provision of technical assistance was consi-
dered as part of the strategy to alternate the shortage of qualified man-
power. The objective was to provide technical assistance in the form of a
project designed to help improve the implementation of investment projects
and stimulate new investments.
III* PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
3.01      Discussions between the Government of Tanzania and the World Bank
Group regarding the provision of technical assistance began late in 1974.
Over the next one year, contact with the relevant authorities in Taiizania
was maintained through the Bank Group's resident mission in Tanzania with
the objective of exploring the best methods of delivering the technical
assistance. Eventually IDA held negotiations with Tanzania Government
officials in October 1975 that resulted in the Report and Recommendations
of the President (there was no appraisal report for the Credit) dated
November 12, 1975. The Executive Directors approved the project on
November 25, 1975, and the Credit documents were signed on January 9,
1976. The Tanzanian Government requested, and IDA agreed, that TIB be
given the primary responsibility for the implementation of the project.
The decision was based on TIB's previous experienee in administering
bilateral technical assistance projects.
3.02       Established in 1970, TIB was set up by the Govermment with the
objective of promoting economic development in Tanzania by providing
technical assistance and medium to long-term finance, primarily to
parastatals in the industrial, agricultural and tourism sectors.  By 1975,
TIB had emerged as a vital financial intermediary in the development
process within Tanzania and its level of operations as a consequence had
risen sharply (TIB loans to projects in 1975 accounted for about 20Z of



- 3 -
total new industrial investments in Tanzania). TIB had also developed a
strong management team and improved its project appraisal capacity.
Increasingly, the institution could exert a positive influence on the tech-
nical, financial and economic quality of parastatal investment decisions
especially on projects that they financed. TIB derived an enhanced status
from the valuable experience they had acquired through the implementation
and administration of both bilateral and multilateral technical assistance
projects. All these attributes made TIB the most suitable institution for
administering the Credit. A special Technical Assistance Unit (TAU) was
established within the Planning and Development Department of T1B to admin-
ister the IDA Technical Assistance Credit. The Unit was made responsible
for preparing Terms of Reference (TOR) for consultants to be engaged by
Tanzanian institutions to carry out the feasibility studies and also for
evaluation of such studies.
IV. PROJECT OBJECTIVE
4.01      The primary objective of the Project was to help Tanzania Improve
the quality of investments in the productive sectors of the economy. Until
1975, Tanzania had few well prepared investment projects (this hindered the
promotion of investments). The country was facing declinirtg capacity util-
ization, inefficiency in existing industries and a severe shortage of qua-
lified and experienced manpower who could prepare and supervise the imple-
mentation of projects in specialized areas of industry. Therefore, to help
alleviate these bottlenecks to investments, IDA agreed to provide a techni-
cal assistance credit that would finance the prepa.ation of a pipeline of
viable investment projects (earmarked primarily for external and possibly
World Bank Group financing). The Credit would also finance studies for
improvement of industrial capacity utilization and development of local
managerial manpower that would eventually lead to reduced dependence on
expatriates.  The Credit was, therefore, designed to finance:
a)   consultancy servicea for preparation of investment feasibility
studies;
b)   consultancy services to prepare studies aimed at improving
production efficiency and capacity utilization in installed
industrial facilities;
c)   local and overseas training for Tanzanian nationals in project
preparation; and
d)   establishment of a technical assistance unit (TAU) in the
Tanzania Investment Bank.
4.02      It was also envisioned that the project would enhance TIB's capa-
city for project preparation,. appraisal and supervision. Initially, expa-
triate consultants would be hired to enhance local expertise within TIB,
besides carrying out the various studies. Second, through improved perfor-
mance by new and existing investments, it was expected that Govermment
working capital support to parastatals would decline. Third, it was
anticipated that exports from new investments emerging out of the studies
would help improve Tanzania's balance of payments position. Finally, the
studies would be used as a basis of attracting new foreign investments,



-4-
Chanellin  of Funds
4.03      The proceeds of the credit were provided to TIB by the Govemment
as a grant. Similarly, the funds which financed the consultants and
studies were passed on to individual parastatals as grants by TIB. It was
agreed, however, that TIB would recover, from the sponsoring agencies,
cost of those studies which resulted in bankable projects. Expenditures on
some studies have, however, not been recovered as projects identified in
these studies could not be implemented for a variety of reasons, largely
due to adverse economic conditions prevailing in the country.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.01      The Technical Assistance Project initially experienced implemen-
tation delays due to several administrative bottlenecks. The Goverment of
Tanzania and TIB lacked relevant experience in the management of such a
multi-sectoral and complex technical assistance project. New administra-
tive structures (such as the establishment of the Technical Assistance Unit
(TAU) in TIB and procedures had to be introduced and these resulted ln
delays. The Government, in an attempt to centralize consultancy services,
wanted to move the project unit from TIB to the newly fomed Tanzania
Industrial Studies and Consulting Organization (TISCO). However, after
several consultations with IDA and taking into account TIB's relative expe-
rience in technical assistance administration, the Government agreed to
leave the project unit within TIB. Initially, TIB had difficulties In
identifying suitable consultants to help manage the TAU but finally
selected an overeas group of consulting engineers. A contract was signed
in October 1976 and the personnel for the Unit arrived later that year.
TIB allowed the contract to lapse in October 1978 because the consultants'
performance was considered to be below expectations,, TIB professional
staff, having gained some operating experience in the interim, was able to
manage the unit adequately with limited assistance of expatriate staff then
working for TIE.
5.02      The project completion timetable, in retrospect, was too optimis-
tic. TIB needed time to learn Bank technical assistance procurement proce-
dures, procedures for hiring consultants, and preparation and appraisal of
numerous subprojects, Sub-borrowers were, at first, slow in submitting
applications for utilization of technical assistance funds available under
the credit, partly because of lack of awareness and partly because of an
atteQpt to secure technical assistance on a grart basis from other external
sources (during the 1960s and early 1970s, Tanzania received substantial
extemal bilateral technical assistance), TIB subsequently also mounted an
awareness campaign among its borrowers about the facilities available under
the credit.
5.03      The Bank Group initially gave project supervision responsibility
to the Bank's Resident Mission in Dar-es-Salaam. Due to the shortage of
staff, the Resident Mission acted mainly as a collection point for project
approval requests between the Borrower and IDA headquarters. This led to
additional delays because of the increase in turnaround time for subproject
approvals. In 1978, supervision responsibility was transferred to the IDR
Division in the Eastern Africa and Southem Projects Department, in order
to speed up the subproject approval process . With there new arrangements



- 5 -
the various bottlenecks were resolved, project Implementation picked up
momentum sudh that by the revised Credit closing date of December 1982,
US$5.2 million, representing 87% of the credit amount, had been committed.
The balance of US$0.8 million, which was initially set aside as a hedge
against currency fluctuation, was cancelled. A total of 33 consultancy
studies were undertaken (Annex 1(A) and 1(C) and 389 individuals were spon-
sored either for training abroad or pirticipated in training seminars and
workshops organized by TIB in Tanzania, mainly at the Eastern and Southern
Africa Management Institute at Arusha (Annex 1 (B)).
5.04      The feasibility studies component was expected to cover most pro-
ductive sectors of the economy and thus received the largest allocation of
US$4.2 million (70% of the total credit)(Annex 1(A). The feasibility
studies helped promote some financially viable projects in Tanzania. Some
of the reports were also useful in identifying risky or non-viable
projects. Nineteen studies resulted in identification of potentially
viable investment opportunities and seven in risky or unviable ones.
Eleven of the projects identified have already been launched (Annex 1(A)).
5.05      Some of the large projects Identified in these studies and which
are currently under implementation are the Kapunga Rice Irrigation Project,
Agricultural Sector) and the Aimonia/Urea Fertilizer Project (Industrial
Sector), Tanzania Tourist-Corporation development program (Tourism Sector),
and the oil exploration program by Tanzania Petroleum Development Corpora-
tion (Energy Sector). Six studies that were dropped on either economic or
technical grounds include proposals for a Lime Processing factory, manufac-
ture of civil explosives, purchase of a passenger cargo vessel, and a
castor seeds factory.
5.06      Capacity utilization and efficiency studies (Annex 1 (C)) proved
useful in identifying some of the underlying causes of declining capacity
utilization and made several c'rrectional recommendations. Altogether
seven capacity utilization studies were undertaken out of which recommenda-
tions made in five have either been implemented or are due to be implemen-
ted. The studies whose recommendations are implementable include the
MOPROCO Technical Evaluation Study t refurbish the oil mill (implemented
with assistance from the Dutch Government), the textile sector rationaliz-
ation study (no capital expenditure involved), the Productivity Measurement
and Lmprvcsement study and inventory management study. TIB completed the
first phase of a productivity improvement program for major industrial
enterprises.
5.07      The training component of the project was the fastest disburs-
ing. The component was designed to train suitably qualified (typically
mid-level managers) Tanzanian candidates in project design, evaluation and
implementation, principally in the industrial, agricultural and tourism
sectors. By early 1978, all the initial allocation for training of
US$200,000 had been committed. The Govetnment requested an additional
allocation of US$300,000 for the training component. This was agreed to by
IDA in late 1978.  A total of US$465,000 of the allocated amount was
disbused by the closing date of December 31, 1982. At the time of the
project appraisal, it was estimated that the objectives of the training
component could be met through the provision of fellowships for overseas
training. However, in the course of implementation it was realized that



-6-
locally arranged training, particularly in project preparation and
evaluation, was more appropriate for Tanzania's training needs and also was
more cost-effective because a larger number of candidates could thus be
trained. Ultimately only 25 individuals (6% of total) were trained
overseas at a cost of US$214,500 (19% of the total funds allocated for
training), while the remaining 94% were trained locally within Eastern
Africa either at the Eastern and South Africa Management Institute (ESAMI)
and the Arusha International Conference Center in Arusha, Tanzania or in
Nairobi, Kenya. A total of six group courses and seminars were conducted
for 364 participants from parastatals, government agencies, and private
institutions (Annex 1(B)). One of the most effective applications of the
component was in organizing two project preparation and evaluation courses
in Arusha in collaboration with ESAMI and EDI, and holding two seminars in
Dar-es-Salaam on project implementation for public sector managers.
5.08      During the period under review compliance with financial
covenants, described in Article III of the Project Agreement, wa
satisfactory. TIB maintained adequate records and appropriate accounting
practices and also submitted audited accounts and financial statements each
year on time.
VI. DISBURSEMENTS
6.01      The Credit was expected to finance 100% of the foreign
expenditures or 80% of the total expenditures on consultant contracts
(including contracts with Project Unit staff). Similarly, the Credit was
to finance 100% of foreign expenditures and 75% of local costs for overseas
training and for expenditures on vehicles and equipment for the Project
Unit. Initially, the credit was expected to disburse a cumulative 8% in
FY76, 42% by the end of FY77, 83% by end FY78 and 100% by end 1979. As it
turned out, the actual cumulative disbursements were much slower with 0t
disbursements in FY76 and FY77, 12% by FY78, 37% by FY79, finally reaching
87% in FY83. As mentioned earlier, the slow rate of disbursement was
largely due to start-up administrative delays and lack of awareness on the
part of client parastatals. In addition, initially all subprojects were
being submitted to the Resident Mission in Dar-es-Salaam which then
forwarded these requests to the IDA headquarters in Washington, and this
contributed to significant delays in approval of the subprojects. The
delays were reduced after responsibility for review of subprojects was
transferred to the Eastern Africa Projects Department.
VII.  GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND IN3TITUTION BUILDING
7.01      In general, the Credit succeeded in attaining its primary
objectives. A strong pipeline of new investment projects resulted from
some of the studies. Other studies made substantive recommendations on
capacity utilization Improvement and training was provided for staff from
TIB and other Tanzanian parastatals. Finally, the studies proved some
investments to be uneconomic and resulted in their not being pursued. The
inability of the Government to translate a number of the study proposals
Into investment commitments mirrors the general macroeconomic environment
in Tanzania rather than on the quality of the studies or the ability of the



-7-
implementing agencies. By the end of the 1970s decade, Tanzania faced
severe economic problems: a general deterioration in the economy, balance
of payments difficulties, and a shortage of imported raw materials and
spare parts for industry. These difficulties have prevented, to some
extent, the realization of the two major objectives underlying the Credit,
which were to increase the level of investments in Tanzania's productive
sectors and increase industrial capacity utilization.
7.02      The other objective of institution building within TIB and the
other sub-borrowers was, by and large, met. Specifically, it was
anticipated, under the Credit, that the newly created Technical Assistance
Unit (set up within TIB's Planning and Development Department) would
develop the capacity to promote, prepare and implement projects and offer
related consultancy services in collaboration with TISCO. This wa
subscantially realized.
7.03      The fellowships provided by the Credit sponsored personnel from
TI8, the parastatals, government agencies and private institution  for
trianing and helped alleviate some of the critical manpower bottlenecks In
the recipient institutions* The Client Seminar  and group courses at ESAMI
sponsored by TIB under the Credit acted as forum for exchange of views on
policy issues by high ranking public and private sector officials. Within
TIB, the Credit helped to develop the capacity for effectiveness in project
identification, appraisal and promotion by sponsoring 10 of its staff for
overseas training (42% of all Tanzanians trained overseas under the
Credit). This increased capacity gave TIB the capability to make
independent checks on the technical, financial and economic feasibility of
those investments in which it was involved financially. The TAU also
gained considerable experience in the administration of the Credit without
outside technical assistance after 1978 (the contract with the foreign
consultants had been allowed to lapse in that year). The objective of
institution building was therefore fulfilled, as demonstrated by the fact
that the Bank Group retained TIB as the executing agency for the Second
Technical Assistance Credit to Tanzania.
7.04      The objective of developing capacity in arranging consultancy
services was the most difficult to assess in terms of the Impact of the
Credit. At the conclusion of the Credit, although TIB had developed some
in-house capability, there was still considerable reliance on expatriate or
external consultants for specialized studies. Indeed the Second Technical
Assistance Credit has pointed out this deficiency. Half of the training
component allocation under the Second TA Credit was to be devoted to
training staff of the Tanzania Audit Corporation which offered consultancy
services in addition to its priuary accounting and audit roles.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01      The International Development Association adequately fulfilled
its obligation (that of assisting Tanzania in its development process)
under the Credit. IDA provided funds to TIB to finance technical
assistance to support pre-investment, feasiblity and capacity utilization
and efficiency studies in Tanzania. The longer tenm real impact of the
Credit (increasing investments in Tanzania's productive sectors, improving
capacity utilization and providing project reiated training) was achieved



-8-
to a good degree. A large number of the studies have either already been
acted upon (new investments undertaken in the case of feasbility studies
and recommendations implemented for capacity utilization studies) or are
awaiting an improvement in the macroeconomic environment. The studies also
highlighted some bad investments that might have been undertaken if the
studies had not been done. However it is clear that the Bank Group and the
Tanzanian Government underestimated the amount of resources needed to
alleviate Tanzania's acute shortage of manpower resources. Recognizing
this inadequacy, a second IDA Technical Assistance Creidt 1060-TA was made
to Tanzania in October 1980.
8.02      There were ten supervision missions to Tanzania by Bank staff
which, among other tasks, reviewed the performance of this Credit. In the
course of supervision, it became increasingly clear that the amount of US$6
million provided under the Credit was inadeqbte to meet the set
objectives. Much of the rationale for IDA's first Te.hnical Assistance
Credit remained valid. The country's scarce human resources continued to
be spread thin across a broad spectrum of development activities. The
Government's efforts to implement an economic re-orientation program
stretched farther than these limited resources. Funds from bilateral
sources and the UNDP were used largely for institutional support ratner
than for new investment studies or rehabilitation of existing investments.
As a result, IDA made the second Technical Assistance Credit 1060-TA in the.
amount of SDR 8.4 million, to the Government. The Credit, which somewhat
overlapped with the first Technical Assistance Credit, became effective
during the first quarter of 1981 and has objectives similar to Credit
601-TA.
8.03      During implementation of the Credit, relatiens with TIB were very
good, with favorable comments In various Bank reports about the
institution, especially by the Project supervision missions that visited
Tanzania. Problems which arose in the course of implementation were
promptly communicated to Washington and solved. The shortcomings that had
faced the First Technical Assistance Credit were improved upon in the
Second Technical Assistance Credit 1060-TA, drawing upon the experience of
the First Technical Assistance Credit and general Bank experience with
technical assistance projects elsewhere in the world.
IX. SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
Summary
9.01      The First Technical Assistance Credit to Tanzania was
successfully implemented. The objectives of the project were, to a large
extent, met.  All funds had been committed by the extended commitment date,
with the exception of the portion that had been set aside to cover currency
fluctuations.   At the project level, the Credit resulted in the
development of a pipeline of bankable projects that could be drawn from by
interested business entities. The majority of the feasibility studies
undertaken resulted in identification of viable projects. Some of these
projects have, however, not been undertaken due .o the poor macroeconomic
environment in Tanzania. Only one capacity utilization study ws not
Implemented due to the lack of funds to purchase spare parts, weak
management and poor incentives to staff. A substantial number of
Tanzanians benefited from the training component ant were a valuable
addition to Tanzania's manpower resouroe pool,

Lessons Learned fram the Credit
9.02      The First Technical Assistance Credit provided some valuable
lessons. First, to avoid delays in project execution, the complex
administrative structures and procedures of a multi-sector project
(especially in a country like Tanzania with little experience, weak or new
institutions and limited qualified manpower) need to be clearly defined.
This allowB the local institutlons to more easily hir consultants,
procure, and process sub-project documents.
9.03      Second, as a fin t time operation, the schedule should have been
more realistic to allow TIB time to gear up for the implementation phase.
TIB needed time to select consultants to man the TAU, promote the Credit to
sub-borrowers and set up the internal machinery to administer the Credit.
9.04      Third, the Bank needs to give Technical Assistance projects
closer supervision during the implementation phase and, even more
importantly, preparation efforts should anticipate and resolve potential
problems before the project is approved by the Board. The difficult
balance of paymnts porition in Tanzania see_s  to suggest that in future
more emphasis should be given to studies for projects with a higher local
raw material content.
