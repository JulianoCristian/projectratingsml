The project has three\n            main components: 1) strengthening administration and\n            planning in MINESEB, 2) quality improvement of basic and\n            lower secondary education and 3) strengthening higher level\n            education. Both economic and educational benefits are\n            expected. The institutional measures will improve long term\n            resource allocation, allowing strengthening  of quality and\n            increased enrollment to respond to demographic pressures,\n            within the education budget likely to be available.
