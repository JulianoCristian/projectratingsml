improve the quality\n            of water supply and sanitation service delivery, through\n            cost recovery, and institutional reforms, by implementing\n            new decentralized service models, and improving sector\n            management capacity. The components will: 1) improve the\n            operation of the Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Agency (KRWSA), by promoting a sanitation, and hygiene\n            strategy, and framework, through information, education, and\n            communications development. Capacity building includes\n            development of knowledge, skills, and management practices\n            in technical, institutional, financial, and management\n            aspects. This will be strengthened by financing staff\n            capacity building, and installation/operation of computers,\n            and office equipment; 2) support community development, and\n            infrastructure building, ensuring mobilization, and\n            women's participation in a broad range of activities.\n            Design, and engineering support will address community\n            managed water supply systems, in addition to construction,\n            drainage, and environmental management. The tribal\n            development program will address water scarcity, and\n            capacity building; 3) provide technical assistance (TA) for\n            comprehensive statewide planning, development and management\n            aspects; and, 4) provide TA to the Central Government, to\n            foster sector reforms."}, "docdt": "2000-10-11T00:00:00Z"}
