This\n            environmental assessment provides information on the policy,\n            legal, and administrative framework to assess environmental\n            adversity as a result of the project, and includes the\n            population profile based on the 1991 Census, the water\n            potential in the river basins of Kerala, ground water\n            resources utilization with details of contaminated wells,\n            bacteriological characteristics of the water supply, and\n            sanitation coverage status in the state. Public\n            consultations were conducted, and include issues of concern\n            in the project design. Mitigating measures will: 1)\n            establish scientific integrated watershed management at the\n            micro level to enhance ground-water recharge, minimize soil\n            erosion, and promote re-vegetation, particularly during the\n            dry season; 2) focus on appropriate site selection to\n            minimize hydraulic interference between existing, and new\n            dug/bore well sources; and, 3) build weirs and barrages\n            across the river to ensure water flows and flush off pollutants."}, "docdt": "2000-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
