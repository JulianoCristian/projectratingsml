Kerala Rural Water Supply\n            and Environmental Sanitation Project and Maharashtra Rural\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project for India were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; the risk to development\n            outcome was negligible to low; bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. These two projects increased access to rural\n            water supply and sanitation in India. Some lessons learned\n            included; improving the quality of rural service delivery to\n            increase access to water supply and sanitation improves\n            environmental health. Given a supportive institutional\n            environment, decentralized, community led water supply and\n            sanitation projects can be both effective and less costly at\n            providing new rural infrastructure. Government line agencies\n            that have traditionally delivered services through a\n            centralized, government-led approach face challenges in\n            supporting decentralized, community led rural water supply\n            and sanitation approaches. The limited availability of\n            experienced Non-government Organization (NGOs) capacity to\n            facilitate community capacity building can constrain\n            adoption of the community-led approach for rural water and\n            sanitation service delivery. And there is a role for public\n            or private support agencies to provide much-needed expertise\n            and technical support to trouble-shoot community-owned water\n            schemes. Where this is missing, communities have difficulty\n            in planning and managing major maintenance and budgeting for\n            the schemes."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
