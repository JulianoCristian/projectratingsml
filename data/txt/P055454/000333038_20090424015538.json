Rural Water\n            Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project for India were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: i) ownership of\n            the project design and continuous support during its\n            implementation at the political, bureaucratic, and\n            operational levels is a prerequisite for project success.\n            Conducive policy environment and willingness to learn by\n            doing are equally vital for success; ii) while piloting new\n            approaches and implementing paradigm shifts - the borrowers\n            must consistently provide sound and continuous leadership\n            and staff in the project management units throughout the\n            project period. The Bank too should have adequate remedies\n            (such as suspension of disbursements) to address the issue\n            of frequent and arbitrary turnover of key project staff\n            which can affect pace and quality of implementation; iii)\n            projects implemented directly by communities can earn cost\n            savings than when done through contractors. In this project,\n            for example, actual costs were approximately 15 percent less\n            than those estimated at appraisal. Greater accuracy can be\n            introduced in cost estimation at appraisal by factoring-in\n            the procurement selection method and implementation\n            procedures; and iv) the small national Technical Assistance\n            (TA) component of the project which aimed at supporting\n            nationwide advocacy of the sector reform policy did not take\n            off due mainly to diminishing of Government of India's\n            (GOI's) interest during implementation. It may be best\n            for the Bank to continue concentrating its support on state-\n            level projects only."}, "docdt": "2009-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
