Re:
OECS Telecommunications Reform Project (Loan 4338-SV - Credit 3089-SV)
Amendment Letter
Dear Mr. Primer Minister:
We refer to the Loan Agreement between the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (the Bank) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (the Borrower) (the Loan 
Agreement), and the Credit Agreement between the International Development Association 
(the Association) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (the Borrower) (the Credit 
Agreement) both dated June 8, 1998, for the above-captioned Project, and your request 
of April 2, 2001.  We, therefore, propose to amend the Loan Agreement and the Credit 
Agreement by replacing, in its entirety, Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement and Credit 
Agreement by the new Schedule 1 detailed below: 
"SCHEDULE 1
Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Credit and of the Loan
1. 
The table below sets forth the Categories of items to be financed out of the 
proceeds of the Credit and of the Loan, the allocation of the amounts of the Credit 
and of the Loan to each Category and the percentage of expenditures for items so to be 
financed in each Category:
   Amount of the 
 Amount of the 
 Credit Allocated
Loan Allocated
     % of 
(Expressed in SDR

to be Financed
(1)   Goods 
105,600
    140,800
20%
(2)   Consultants'
services and

     21,000
20%
(4)   Operating 
costs
 77,400
    103,200
100% of expenditures 
incurred from 
the Effective 
Date until 
October 8, 2001; and
50% of expenditures 
incurred from

(5)   Unallocated

2,000
TOTAL
450,000
600,000
2.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no withdrawals shall be 
made in respect of:
Page  2
(a)
payments made for expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement, 
except that withdrawals, in an aggregate amount not exceeding an amount equivalent to 
SDR45,000, may be made before that date but after April 22, 1998 or a date twelve 
months before the date of this Agreement, whichever is later; and
(b)
goods for the RTA, unless such entity has been established in a manner 
satisfactory to the Bank and the Borrower shall have become a member thereof.
3.
For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a)
the term "Audits" means expenditures incurred by the Borrower in the 
carrying out of Project audits and RTA compliance audits; and
(b)
the term "Operating costs" means expenditures incurred by the Borrower 
for the management of the Project, including salaries of non-consultant personnel 
employed by the PMU (Project Manager, Accountant, Administrative Assistant, Office 
Cleaner and Clerical Assistant), travel and meeting costs and per diem, office space 
rental, maintenance of facilities, office supplies and stationery and utilities which 
would not have been incurred absent the Project.
4.
The Bank and the Association, as the case may be, may require withdrawals from 
either the Loan or the Credit Account (as such term is defined in the Development 
Credit Agreement), as the case may be, to be made on the basis of the statements of 
expenditure for expenditures: (a) for training; (b) under contracts for: (i) goods 
costing less than $50,000; (ii)  services of consulting firms costing less than 
$100,000 equivalent each; and (iii) services of individual consultants costing less 
than $50,000 equivalent each; all under such terms and conditions as the Bank and the 
Association, as the case may be, shall specify by notice to the Borrower."
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating 
both originals of this letter in the spaces provided below, and returning one to us.  
The provisions set forth in this amendment letter shall enter into effect as of the 
date of this letter upon receipt by the Bank of one original of this letter signed by 
you.
