however, a regional approach was seen as\n            viable, since the telecommunications issues facing each\n            island were similar, and there was firm commitment from the\n            Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Heads of\n            Government, to liberalize telecommunications services and\n            address telecommunications regionally. This allows small\n            countries to benefit from the shared fixed costs of\n            regulatory institutions. Nevertheless, the approach\n            concerning spectrum management, and monitoring prior to the\n            project was rudimentary, and would not have been sufficient\n            to support the expansion of wireless services, had it not\n            been for the increased capabilities accorded by the Radio\n            Spectrum Monitoring and Management System (RSMMS), essential\n            during rapid growth in the use of the spectrum. A competent\n            spectrum management and monitoring system is necessary for\n            an expanding, modern telecommunications sector. Moreover, it\n            is highlighted that coordination of a regional project is\n            complex, and stretches very thinly both project management,\n            and supervision resources. Even with the best intentions,\n            there were delays, particularly in obtaining signatures from\n            the five countries on the two extensions of the closing\n            date. However, financing and retention of high caliber\n            technical advisor, critical in negotiations with dominant\n            operators, proved successful."}, "docdt": "2005-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
