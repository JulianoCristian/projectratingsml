Reducing Telecom Costs in the Caribbean                                                                     July 1, 2002
As in any society, access to information and the ability to communicate are essential if people are to participate in economic
development.

In five countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)—Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia and
St. Vincent—an expensive and erratic telephone system held back development as the information age unfolded in the 1980s
and 90s. Cable & Wireless, a British multinational company, enjoyed what was effectively an unregulated monopoly over
telecommunications services among the islands.

In 1998, the World Bank helped the OECS countries set up a regional telecommunications authority, which ultimately
negotiated the terms for liberalization of the eastern Caribbean’s telecom market.  So far, the telecommunications project has
reduced telephone and internet charges by nearly half.  Lower rates have helped to stimulate new, more diverse businesses
in these small economies.  Low costs have also enabled the OECS countries to connect their businesses across national
borders, through increased communication via the Internet, fax, phone, and teleconferencing.
