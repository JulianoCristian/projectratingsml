Agricultural Development Project are to improve\n            agricultural productivity and farm incomes in the Tihama\n            region.  This will be accomplished by propagating suitable\n            technical packages, improving irrigation water management\n            and to strengthen the development institutions to ensure\n            sustainability of benefits envisaged under various\n            agricultural projects in the area.  The project will consist\n            of:  the establishment of a regional extension network,\n            veterinary, operations and maintenance services for the\n            Tihama region; and irrigation development in Wadi Siham.\n            This last component will include the construction of\n            demonstration farms to train farmers in improved irrigation\n            and agricultural practices.  Finally, the project will\n            finance construction of about 62 km of feeder roads;\n            technical assistance and training.  The project will benefit\n            44,000 farm families, or about 220,000 people, through the\n            development of agriculture in the Tihama region."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
