in Yemen are as follows:\n            overall outcome of the project was rated satisfactory, and\n            the performance of the Bank and the Borrower were also rated\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) using realistic data at appraisal facilitates the\n            evaluation of project achievement. Therefore, emphasis is\n            needed on quality at entry. Under Fifth Tihama, the\n            substantial overestimates of agricultural yields at\n            appraisal made them unrealistic for use as comparator for\n            measure of project achievement; 2) flexibility to reallocate\n            resources is necessary to ensure substantial achievement of\n            project goals when a major and dependable co-financier\n            discontinues funding due to unanticipated circumstances,\n            such as the Gulf Crisis; 3) extension cannot function fully\n            effectively without research. If research does not have\n            adequate staffing, operating budget, and superior competence\n            to produce suitable packages, then its input into extension\n            is likely to be limited. Moreover, extension cannot be\n            effective without adequate operating funds; 4) the design of\n            a cost recovery system should be based on a realistic\n            appraisal of what is workable and achievable given local\n            circumstances. The full cost recovery objective under the\n            project was ambitious. The zakat (religious) cost recovery\n            system is prone to misuse. There is no objective means of\n            assessing farmers' declarations; hence farmers\n            understated their income and thereby the resulting zakat\n            religious tax, without penalty; and 5) inadequate\n            counterpart funds have been a major limitation to project\n            implementation. This suggests that new projects should be\n            undertaken only after a careful review of their incremental\n            demands on the government budget."}, "docdt": "1996-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
