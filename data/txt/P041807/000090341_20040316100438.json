The lessons learned indicate that the Bank\n            should be more sensitive to the political changes taking\n            place in a country, in order to analyze the implications,\n            moreover when the Project has not been approved, signed or\n            implementation has not begun. When a project restructuring\n            is needed, the Bank should agree with the Government on a\n            time-bound action plan, with specific benchmarks and\n            milestones, in order to avoid never-ending discussions.\n            Whenever changes occur at the level of a minister or vice\n            minister of the executing agency, the task team should take\n            the initiative to approach the new authorities, clarify any\n            doubts that they could have about the Project, and make\n            special efforts to involve and commit them to the process.\n            Project approval or signing around the time of a\n            Presidential election or inauguration may be highly\n            counterproductive even for the best technically designed\n            operation. While the continuity of task manager may assist\n            in the generation of sound technical proposals at the design\n            stage, the frequent changes at the time of supervision may\n            erode the quality of the constant dialogue and follow up\n            required for Project implementation to proceed smoothly.\n            Participation and consultation are not exhausted during the\n            preparation. The Bank should coordinate closely its\n            decision-making process with multilateral or bilateral\n            partners, in order to take joint decisions at the project\n            design or implementation stages."}, "docdt": "2004-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
