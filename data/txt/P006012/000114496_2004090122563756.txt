            Amendment to the Japanese Grant Agreement
Dear Sir,
Please refer to the Japanese Grant Agreement dated January 21, 1993 between the 
Argentine Republic (the Recipient) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank), acting as Administrator of Grant Funds provided by the 
Government of Japan (Japan), for the above mentioned Japanese Grant.
In response to the request made by Minister Domingo Cavallo and the discussions 
among the Bank, Japan and the Recipient, we are pleased to inform you that the Bank 
agrees to amend the Japanese Grant Agreement in order to reflect the fact that the 
Recipient, and not the Bank, will be the executing agency for this Grant. Therefore, 
the Japanese Grant Agreement above referred is amended to read as spelled out in the 
Annex to this letter.
In your capacity of duly authorized representative of the Recipient, please 
indicate your agreement to the foregoing amendment by signing and dating the duplicate 
original of this letter enclosed herewith and returning the same to us.
This amendment shall take effect as of the date of this letter upon receipt by 
the Bank of the countersigned copy.
Very truly yours,
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
  RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
