MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Indonesia
Second East Java Water Supply Project
(Loan 2632-IND)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Indonesia - Second East Java Water Supply
Project (Loan 2632-IND) prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Region Office, with Part II
contributed by the Borrower.
The project focused on meeting physical targets for limited water supply coverage in
Surabaya and 83 smaller towns in East Java, using a Basic Needs Approach in smaller towns,
and the poorer neighborhoods of metropolitan areas. Selection of project towns was governed
by a top-down, supply-driven process, largely without direct beneficiary involvement.
The project's physical construction targets were generally met (with minor delays), yet
unaccounted-for water losses and operating costs remain high in completed Ibu Kota Kecamatan
(principal towns of sub-districts) (IKK) systems. Cost recovery and institutional strengthening
aspects fell short of expectations, and the final ERR is estimated to be about 6 percent. Staff
training, as well as subproject monitoring and evaluation improved considerably over previous
efforts.
The project experience raises concerns that the IKK component for water supply involves
a weak policy framework, largely divorced from economic realities and necessitating
unsustainable subsidies. The outcome of the project is rated as marginally satisfactory, and its
institutional development impact as modest. The sustainability of project benefits is rated as
uncertain.
The PCR is of good quality. No audit is planned.

SECOND EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (Loan 2632-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.           This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second East Java Water
Supply Project in Indonesia, for which Loan 2632-IND in the amount of US$43.3 million was
approved on November 12, 1985. The loan was closed on December 31, 1993, 15 months
behind schedule. It was 96 percent disbursed and the balance of US$1.574 million was cancelled
in two stages: first an amount of US$108,000 was cancelled in following the reduction in the
project scope and finally, following the last disbursement on April 30, 1994 the balance of
US$1.466 million was cancelled. The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations
Division in Department 3 of East Asia and Pacific Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III). The revised guidelines for PCR preparation dated June 1989 have
been followed insofar as possible.
2.           As the supervision mission aide memoirs indicate, the Bank paid early attention
to preparation of the PCR. The Bank worked closely with the implementing agencies and the
consultants in preparing outline, first draft, and revised drafts, relating to technical, financial, and
institutional aspects. In anticipation of the original closing date on September 31, 1992, a
working draft was submitted by the Borrower in September 1992, i.e., 15 months before the
actual closing date. A revised draft was received on April 22, 1994
3.           This report is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan
Agreement, detailed aide memoirs from the Supervision missions, correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda; and the Borrower's drafts. In view of the
close collaboration and substantial input from the Bank in analyzing the project results, there is
no major difference in conclusions drawn by the Bank and the borrower. Accordingly parts of
this PCR have been extracted from the Borrower's drafts. The PCR also incorporates findings
of a brief mission by the task manager in February 1994. It may be noted that the Borrower has
not completed audit of the final Project cost. Accordingly, the data contained in the PCR is
based on a reasonable estimate. Differences if any are expected to be minor.
4.           A copy of Parts I and III was sent to GOI in May 1994 for review. Borrower's
verbal comments were received and incorporated in early June 1994.

SECOND EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(Loan 2632-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
i.           Objectives: (Section 3) In line with the Bank strategy, the objectives of the
proposed project were to provide continuing support to GOI's water sector development and
investment program, specifically: (a) to substantially increase low-cost clean water production and
distribution facilities throughout East Java Province in conformity with Repelita IV targets; (b) to
provide technical assistance to forthcoming or recently established water enterprises in East Java
for sounder operation and system expansion through introduction of and training in appropriate
management, accounting, operating and maintenance practices; (c) to improve provincial
government level capability in: (i) planning and implementation of water supply investment
programs; (ii) monitoring and development of PDAM performance; (iii) provision of technical
assistance and training to PDAMs; and (iv) water pollution control; (d) to implement improved
financing policies; and (e) to help in preparation of other urban and water supply projects.
ii.          Implementation Experience: (Section 5) All components of the appraised project
were fully implemented with the exception of some public taps. The implementation schedule is
shown in Table 4. Project implementation indicators are detailed in Tables 6(a) through (g). There
were savings on procurement of the treatment plant in Surabaya, and due to devaluation of the local
currency. Tle savings were used to extend transmission and distribution network in Surabaya and
to fund part of the preparation effort for several new projects.
iii.         Project Results: (Section 6) Direct benefits as a result of this project have been
gained through substantial increases in (a) the quantity of water produced, (b) the number of service
connections and public taps (thereby improving access) and (c) the quantity and quality of drinking
water sold. Summary of operating results for each WE is shown in Table 6(e). The Loan closing
date was extended by 15 months in order to complete the procurement for extended network in
Surabaya. Loan covenants have been generally complied with, with three exceptions: (a) there has
been persistent lag in achievement of cost recovery, which is affected by depreciation allowances
and tariff levels. (b) there have been delays in completion of audit reports; and (c) clean up of Kali
Surabaya has proven to be much harder than assumed. Setting of tariffs is in the hands of local
governments. Baupatis have resisted attempts to give more autonomy to the PDAMS in setting
tariffs. Efforts continue to encourage WEs to fully account for and recover their costs. While all
WEs are covering O&M cost and a part of depreciation, only a few are able to cover full
depreciation at legally authorized rates. The ongoing East Java Bali UDP (Loan 3304-IND) will
monitor further progress on audit and cost recovery issues. Efforts are still needed for continuing
attention for carrying out action program about abatement of pollution by industrial and residential
effluents discharged into the Surabaya river. Given the limited scope of pollution control under the
project, the recently approved Surabaya Urban Project includes substantial work to carry forward
the pollution control.
iv.          Project Sustainability: (Section 7) The project has a number of aspects which
were designed to secure sustainability of the WE investments and sector progress. These included
inter alia: (a) maximum use of groundwater and minimum use of surface water sources and
complex treatment plants; (b) provision of a full range of tools and equipment to each WE for



- iii -
O&M; (c) careful division of investment in each Kabupaten between BNA and IKK-sized towns to
ensure that in spite of their small size and relative poverty, the WE had a chance to be viable
financially; (d) periodic revision of tariffs to ensure better cost recovery while still maintaining the
tariff's social objectives; (e) provision of training and on-the-job assistance to all 13 WEs to make
their operations more efficient; (f) establishment of the PTU and PMDU to provide on-going
training, monitoring and development assistance to all WEs in East Java, and east Indonesia through
PTU; (g) assistance to strengthen DGCK's ability to direct development of the sector.
v.            Low tariffs and higher UFW have prevented full financial viability in most WEs.
In any case all are covering O&M and at least a part of the depreciation. The above measures have
succeeded some way in ensuring present benefits are maintained and are likely to be raised in the
future. Recovery of O&M and even partial depreciation costs through better tariff structure is
making funds available for improved O&M and even small extensions of the distribution system.
Concentrated efforts in human resources development under this and previous projects are beginning
to improve WE efficiency and enable them to become relatively self-reliant.
vi.           Findings and Lessons Learned: (Section 13) Major lessons learnt in terms of
project design, implementation, technical, financial and institutional areas are listed below.
Elements of project design found to be useful were: (a) the devolution of implementation
responsibility to the province through PMU/PIUs; (b) preparation of detailed design almost
coincidentally with project preparation; and (c) using stockpiled material to commence physical
work quickly.
vii.          Implementation experience indicates that: (a) larger work packages facilitated by
larger multi-year budget allocation benefit the result; (b) not all people can be persuaded to take
piped supplies of water, but most people prefer house connections; (c) improved access is important
to ensuring demand; (d) difficulty in achieving public tap numbers illustrates the importance of
accessibility of alternate sources (wells); (e) including construction of house connections under the
project is helpful in ensuring reasonable cost of connections, and making water available for sale
quickly; (f) commissioning of works requires careful allocation of capital and manpower resources;
(g) considerable TA is needed to prepare projects and are not easily estimated during preparation
of sector projects; and (h) clean up of a major river is a complex task in technical, financial,
institutional, and legal terms.
viii.         Technical aspects of project results offer the following lessons: (a) further demand
for water exists in Surabaya and BNA towns; (b) balanced development of water treatment,
transmission, distribution and consumer services is required; PDAM Surabaya continues to suffer
due to delay in the next phase of water production facilities; (c) chlorination of supplies is
objectionable to some people in semi-rural areas; (d) reduction in UFW is difficult and requires
large incentives and investment, but is vital; (e) use of flow restrictors in IKK systems should be
abandoned; and (f) WE should consider further investment in upgrading IKK system for example
by installation of water meters in the remaining areas.
ix.          Flnancial and institutional results show that: (a) a large and viable PDAM like
Surabaya is able to handle its own project preparation and implementation, while small PDAMs
largely rely on central government; (b) a separate PDAM for each Kabupaten is difficult to make
viable for East Java; (c) timely and sufficient tariff adjustments are essential for financial viability;
(d) adjustment every three years causes large tariff increases; more frequent adjustments are needed
(PDAM Surabaya is now adjusting every two years); (e) investment in training infrastructure has
been very beneficial and should continue; (f) poverty alleviation strategies can be addressed through
careful targeting, project design including public taps, favorably priced; house connections, and well
directed incentives to WEs.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1.    PROJECT IDENTITY
Name:                     Second East Java Water Supply Project
Loan No.:                2632-IND
Loan Amount:             US$43.3 million
Country:                 Indonesia
Sector:                  Infrastructure
Subsector:               Water Supply
2.    BACKGROUND
Sector Development, Planning and Policy
2.1         In East Java province the population during the project implementation period has
increased from 31 million in 1984 to some 33.6 million people by 1993. It equals almost a fifth
of Indonesia's population.
2.2          Of urban and semi-urban populations few were served by piped water system at
the end of REPELITA II in 1979. It required a fundamental reformulation of policy for the
provision of water supply. Therefore, the government embarked upon the "Basic Needs
Approach' (BNA) program. This program targeted investment at small towns, medium cities,
and poorer areas in big metropolitan areas. The objective of these programs was to (a) build
systems which provide an essential service at an affordable price, (b) carry out institutional
development, (c) use scarce manpower effectively and (d) to demonstrate to consumers the
benefits of safe water supply and to encourage the communities themselves to take initiatives to
extend and improve the service. Under the basic needs approach, it was recognized that limited
central government funds required relatively low service levels in order to provide water supply
to the largest number of people.
2.3         To achieve these objectives, the programs (especially the IKK program) were to
(a) use standardized design procedures, (b) be executed in the provinces and Level II governments
(Kabupatens) by local staff to the extent their capabilities permitted (c) use goods purchased in
bulk and distributed from regional and central stores, (d) finance projects by loans which were
then to be given free to the Kabupaten government, and (e) set tariffs which were expected to
cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and depreciation.
2.4         Based on a review in 1981, the Government decided to add a crash program aimed
at supplying piped water by 1985 to about 1,700 subdistrict capital towns (IKK), ranging in
population from 3,000 to 20,000 people. These IKK projects were designed to provide an
average of 45 Ipcd to about 60 percent of the project area population, compared to the 60 lpcd
for the BNA projects.



- 2 -
2.5          The national BNA and IKK program supported under the East Java Water Supply
Project (Loan 2275-lND) (the first project) and this project was therefore distinguished from
earlier efforts in that special attention was given to (a) low cost construction, (b) rapid
implementation and (c) focusing design on household needs, especially the poor (hence half the
population were to be served through public taps).
2.6          Responsibility for planning and engineering under the project was allocated by the
National Planning Board (BAPPENAS) to the Directorate General of Human Settlements
(DGCK). Although Level II governments were in theory responsible for provision of water
supply, they were technically weak and needed central government assistance. However, in line
with a desire to decentralize development efforts, the East Java Provincial Government, through
the Governor, was to provide assistance. The provincial government was also to play a larger
role in O&M matters in the water enterprises (WEs) benefitting from the project while the central
government implementing agency (the Directorate of Water Supply in DGCK) were to withdraw
from direct involvement in the WEs after they had been firmly established.
Experience from the Previous Project
2.7          Before this project, the Bank had assisted through (a) Loans 1049 and 1709 to
construct water supply systems in only 12 large towns spread across Indonesia, and (b) East Java
Water Supply Project (Loan 2275-IND) for about 50 small towns and semi-urban areas in East
Java. However the basic approach had been established whereby Bank financed projects were
not only to assist in rapid provision of piped water supplies but were also to enhance
sustainability through improved cost recovery and strengthening of the various institutions
responsible for the sector development.
2.8          Experience from the previous projects highlighted a number of policy issues which
were to be addressed under the two East Java projects. These included:
(a)   efforts were needed to improve cost recovery, given the large investments
required to meet sector service targets.  Hence a tariff study was to be
undertaken;
(b)   the need to decentralize project implementation to improve the results. Hence the
project was to be managed and implemented from East Java;
(c)   improvement in operations of WEs was essential. Hence the establishment of a
Provincial Monitoring and Development Unit (PMDU) was agreed;
(d)   rapid growth in the sector required sustained support for human resources
development. Hence substantial staff development was targeted.
2.9          The experience from previous projects also indicated a number of desirable
features of project design which were considered in preparation of this project and generally
incorporated. These included:
(a)   establishing a Project Management Unit (PMU) and Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) close to the project sites as a means to (i) ease the workload which was



- 3 -
threatening to overstretch Cipta Karya's line organization and (ii) help decentralize
the GOI's development efforts;
(b)   reducing the geographical dispersion within a project to certain kabupatens in one
province to aid preparation and implementation;
(c)   early recruitment of consultants and reasonable preparation of designs in advance
of loan effectiveness to ensure rapid implementation;
(d)   institutional development activities to keep pace with physical work; and
(e)   early attention to difficulties in procurement of material to remove the most
common cause of serious delay in implementation.
2.10         Conclusion and lessons from the Bank's Project Performance Audit Report for
East Java Water Supply Project (Loan 2275-IND) in 1991 were:
(a)    There was better performance in the institutional and financial areas than in the
traditional technical provisions.
(b)   The excessive emphasis on high speed development resulted, in some areas in a
superficial preparation process.
(c)   The Bank must make stronger efforts to help eliminate the extensive and
expensive procurement delays in Indonesia.
(d)   The operational issues that fledgling water utilities are likely to face must be fully
considered at the preparation stage, particularly where planning and
implementation are carried out by a central authority.
(e)    Special attention was needed for the selected issues raised by the project:
operational (e.g., water quality, unaccounted for water and service level) and
financial (e.g., viability and sustainability of PDAM, affordability of tariffs,
accounting and monitoring).
IJsues and Constraints During Project Preparation
2.11         Even though this project was appraised in April 1985, some six years befbre the
PPAR of the first project, many of the PPAR issues and constraints were the subject of policy
dialogue during preparation of this second project.
(a)    xnplementation Capability: Cipta Karya was experiencing increasing difficulties
in implementing its growing development program in time. Many of its
difficulties stemmed from the logistically complex nature of the sector involving
numerous local authorities spread over a wide area, as well as restrictive central
budgetary and procurement procedures and manpower shortages. As a result,
Cipta Karya had started moving toward decentralization of its operation to
provincial level agencies. Thus, the use of PMU/PIU established under the first
project in East Java was included in the project.



- 4 -
(b)   Procurement: The Bank was working with the government at national and lower
levels, to resolve the identified generic and specific issues which were resulting
in excessive procurement delays.
(c)   Personnel Requirement for the Urban Water Program: The Directorate of
Water Supply (DAB) and PUOD had in progress a human resources development
program which started in 1979 with the objective of training management,
administrative and operations personnel for DAB and water enterprises. For
Repelita IV a "Manpower Development Program" would be established with
training aimed at six broad staff groups.
(d)   Operation and Maintenance: Newly employed PDAM staff required extensive
training and accounting, management and operational system had to be developed.
MHA, MPW and the Governor of East Java had agreed to assign development
functions to the Provincial Cipta Karya in East Java which would monitor the
performance and provide assistance to all water entities in a systematic and timely
manner.
(e)   PDAM Organization Structure: The Bank felt that creation of a separate water
enterprise for each Kabupaten was not a viable option, particularly for the small
ones. GOI agreed to conduct a study of alternative organization structures in Irian
Jaya, and North and South Sulawen provinces. It examined several options and
recommended strengthening of the Kabupaten model but did not accept the
establishment of an organization on a province-wide basis.
(f)    Water Resource Management: The growing scarcity of water supplies for
agricultural, municipal and industrial purposes in Java highlighted the need for
increased emphasis on water resource management and appropriate allocation of
supplies. Accordingly, a water resources master plan study for East Java was
included in the project.
3.    The Project Rationale, Objectives, and Description
3.1          Bank Role and Rationale for Involvement. The Bank's role and rationale for
involvement in this sector in general and this project in particular was to: (a) support low-cost
technology development; (b) strengthen the central agencies responsible for sector planning;
(c) strengthen provincial and local government capabilities to plan and implement; (d) support
GOI's programs of physical development; (e) assist in manpower development; and (f) improve
resource mobilization through increase in locally generated funds and introduction of improved
financial management.
3.2          The project was also important in terms of (a) poverty reduction, specifically with
targeted programs to deliver water; (b) improved public sector management, specifically in
strengthening institutions at all government levels, but particularly at local government levels, and
(c) in increasing public sector efficiency through cost recovery, etc. At the time the project was
approved, its objectives fit into the broader country assistance strategy as then articulated by the
Bank.



- 5 -
3.3          Project Objectives. In line with the Bank's rationale, the objectives of the
proposed project were to provide continuing support to GOI's water sector development and
investment program, specifically: (a) to substantially increase low-cost water production and
distribution facilities throughout East Java Province in conformity with Repelita IV targets; (b) to
provide technical assistance to recently established, or planned, water enterprises in East Java for
sounder operation and system expansion, through introduction of and training in appropriate
management, accounting, operating and maintenance practices; (c) to improve provincial
government level capability in: (i) planning and implementation of water supply investment
programs; (ii) monitoring and development of PDAM performance; (iii) provision of technical
assistance and training to PDAMs; and (iv) water pollution control; (d) to implement improved
financing policies; and (e) to help in preparation of future urban and water supply projects.
3.4          Project Description. The project had four major components, described in the
Loan Agreement as Parts A, B C and D.
Part A: BNA/IKK Towns - provision of new water supplies totalling 0.75 cu m/s to at
least 75 medium-to-small sized towns and development of 12 water entities in East Java;
Part B: Surabaya - major works including source development, treatment plant and
transmission/distribution pipelines for a 1 m3/s expansion, as well as rehabilitation of the
existing water supply system; and measures to abate water pollution in the Surabaya river
and reduce the cost of water to low-income groups in the provincial capital of Surabaya;
Part C: Institutional Development - provision of central and various provincial training
facilities, equipment and tuition; and strengthening of pollution control mechanisms and
establishment of a PDAM development unit in East Java; and
Part D: Other Technical Assistance - provision of (a) advisory services and staff
training in project implementation, management, and operations for the purposes of part
A and B of the project; and (b) future project preparation studies.
3.5          The total cost of the project, including physical and price contingencies was
estimated at Rp 88.4 billion equivalent to US$80.4 million, of which the direct and indirect
foreign exchange component totalled US$41.6 million.  Technical assistance for project
management/engineering services, training, institutional development and preparation of other
projects was estimated to cost US$15.3 million equivalent. Part A (44.3 percent of total project
cost) as well as Parts C and D were to be financed by the loan and GOI equity. Part B
(29.2 percent of total project cost) was to be financed by the loan, GOI subloan (in local
currency) to PDAM Surabaya and PDAM equity. The Loan was to be closed by September 30,
1992. A notable feature was GOI's intention to provide the completed assets as equity injections
to all 12 Part A WEs.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1         Innovative Features of Project Design: Decentralization.  PMU and PIU
(outside the daily supervision of DAB) were established for the first project in East Java as a
major step in the progressive delegation of implementation and expenditure authority to the
provinces. It was continued for the second project. This establishment coincided with the
establishment of the deconcentrated MPW organization under "Kanwil" (the Minister of Public



- 6 -
Work's representative in East Java), through which the project was to receive guidance. Further
steps were taken to foster decentralization with the plan to (a) draw most PIU staff from
provincial and kabupaten public works offices and (b) early consultation with the provincial
government and level II relating to the proposed works, their ownership and future operation and
maintenance. PDAM Surabaya exercised full control over Part B through a separate PIU.
(PDAM Surabaya had much less control under Loan 1709).
4.2          Like the previous project (2275-IND), physical works under the Loan were to be
constructed only in one province, East Java. Works were to be constructed in 75 towns, 63 of
which could be classified almost as rural. Furthermore, the large number of project towns
necessitated GOI staff become responsible for supervision (again a departure from previous
projects) with Consultants acting in the role of Advisors.
4.3          A number of innovative features were also introduced in terms of the project
content and technical aspects. The most significant of these were:
(a)    A "fast-track" approach to water resource investigation whereby groundwater
drilling during project preparation focused only on those towns where doubt
existed about the presence of suitable supplies.
(b)   Consolidating management of all systems in the kabupaten under a single PDAM
with cross subsidization of the IKK towns from the larger and more profitable
BNA towns; and
(c)   emphasis on institutional development issues by the Bank and other donors
through the Human Resources Development Project (HRDP) and the Institutional
Support for the Water Supply Sector Project (ISWSS).  This latter project
included studies associated with establishing (i) a Provincial Training Unit (PTU),
(ii) a Provincial Monitoring and Development Unit (PMDU) in East Java, and
(iii) development and implementation of suitable water enterprise monitoring
indicators.
4.4          A further feature, although not a part of the original project designs, resulted from
the introduction of a GOI decree in 1984 (KEPPRES 29/30, 1984) requiring the use of small
"economically weak" local contractors to implement many of the government development
projects, and certainly all work on projects of the nature of the Second East Java Water Supply
Project.
4.5          Most features of the project design have been successful.  Aspects which
contributed most to project success were:  (a) early completion of design; (b) early land
acquisition e.g., for land acquisition process Karangpilang treatment plant started in 1984 and was
fully completed in 1986; (c) use of stockpiled material to obviate early procurement delays;
(d) devolving central power to the PMU/PIUs and providing these organizations with staff of
sufficient experience and competence; and (e) ensuring early involvement of provincial
government and PDAMs. However, some problems were experienced with required use of
(i) economically weak, small local contractors, and (ii) use of flow restrictors (instead of meters)
in IKKs which is discussed below.

5.    Project Implementation
5.1          Loan Approval and Effectiveness. The loan (2632-IND) for US$ 43.3 m was
approved on November 27, 1985 and became effective on April 29, 1986 by which time the work
on BNA and IKK project towns had begun. Table 5(b) of Part III show the original allocation
of loan proceeds (with a revised) and then final allocation). US$11.08 million was allocated after
the November 1990 allocaiton, for civil work (Part A, B and C), US$18.63 million for equipment
and material (Parts A, Part B and Part C), US$12.98 million for Consultants and Service (Part
A and Part B) and US$0.60 million for training under Part C.
5.2         Implementation. With the exception of some public taps, all components of the
appraised project were fully implemented. The implementation schedule is shown in Table 4.
Project implementation indicators are detailed in Table 6(a) through (d). There were savings on
procurement of the treatment plant in Surabaya. This was partly due to devaluation of the local
currency. The savings were used to extend transmission and distribution network in Surabaya
and to fund part of the preparation effort for several new projects. Details are discussed below.
5.3          Project Revision.  The project was appraised from  feasibility studies and
preliminary designs, but no significant revision of these designs for physical works was necessary
despite completion of final designs after appraisal. The revisions related mainly to: (a) changes
(generally increased pipe length) resulting from changes in water sources location; (b) additional
distribution pipes to improve access to piped water; (c) additional water sources development to
improve water source problem; and (d) increased TA for subsequent project preparation.
5.4          A notable variation was the decision to increase the length of pipelines (almost
exclusively distribution system). The low rate at which house connection were being achieved
in most BNA town prompted the decision in FY 89/90 to extend the systems to outlying areas
and infill within the existing system. The original design assumption that all households within
the service area would use piped water was found to be incorrect. Their choice of source
depended on many factors, among which the most important appeared to be (a) accessibility and
reliability of existing sources, (b) cost, and (c) perception of the benefits of piped water. To
provide greater access to the distribution system, "infill" pipe as well as extensions to more
outlying unserved "urban" areas were therefore undertaken as GOI counterpart funds became
available.
5.5          The considerable increase in TA beyond that appraised is one of the most
significant revision to the project. This increase was agreed with the Bank and resulted from the
need to continue future project preparation in terms of (a) detailed design and supervision of
Surabaya distribution system extension and rehabilitation; and (b) technical advisory services for
preparation of other projects discussed below. Details of TA contracts are given in Tables 7(a)
and (b) of Part III. This increase in TA requirements shows that project preparation requires
considerable input which can easily be underestimated or overlooked.
5.6          Loan closing was delayed by a total of 15 months (in 3 steps) mainly due to
additional works for Surabaya. Originally agreed components of Part B were completed on
schedule with a substantial cost saving from the Karangpilang treatment plan. However,
distribution need in Surabaya was expanding at a faster rate than expected. Pending processing
of Surabaya Urban Development Project (Loan 3726-IND approved in April 1994), the Bank



- 8 -
agreed to allow PDAM Surabaya 1/ to use the saving for further expansion of distribution and
system  rehabilitation.  The additional equipment/material included:  (a) PVC  pipe for
rehabilitation; (b) steel pipe for northern link; (c) secondary steel pipe; and (d) tertiary PVC pipe.
Overall additions to the original design are estimated to have added about 4.2 million or about
17 percent of the project cost.
5.7          Public Taps. The number of public taps constructed was some 41 percent less
than planned. Public taps have generally proved unpopular with many WEs and of little interest
to many people in the beneficiary towns. Some reasons given (as under Loan 2275-IND) are:
(a)    given a choice of drawing water from a traditional source (a dug well close to
their residence in most cases under this project) and a more distant public tap,
people will choose the former for convenience;
(b)   social stigma attached to drawing water from a public tap;
(c)    public taps provide water for those who cannot afford a house connection, but that
same group is unlikely to appreciate the benefits related to improved quality of
public tap water compared to traditional sources;
(d)   WEs find administration of public taps difficult and expensive; and
(e)   improving incomes led people to seek a private connection as soon as possible,
with once patronized taps becoming "abandoned".
5.8          The poor acceptance of public taps prompted the Project to construct them only
as requested. Instead attention was directed to increasing the number of residential connections,
which, because of low connection fees and sale on credit terms, ensured piped water to all but
the few desperately poor. Total connections exceeded estimates by 9 percent for Part A systems.
Details of water connections are shown in Table 6(c).
5.9          Procurement. As a result of the experience from the first project, the effects of
possible delay were recognized in the project design and mitigated by: (a) ensuring that all bid
documents were ready before or just after loan signing; (b) early agreement with the Bank on
standard tender documents; and (c) early tendering. The first pipe work contract was advertised
in November 1985 i.e., before loan signing. Table 5.1 summarized the four types of tendering
procedures (based on tender value) followed for the project (Parts A and C) and compares
planned and achieved times for the 31 materials and equipment contracts awarded under the
project through September 1992. As shown below, the actual tendering period was shorter than
planned for all sizes of the contracts. Twenty-three of the contracts had a value of less than
Rp 500 million.

Cost and Financing
5.10        The total cost of the project was Rp 131,395 billion ($76.781 million equivalent),
versus the appraisal estimate of Rp 86.99 billion ($79.1 million equivalent). The actual cost was
51 percent higher in local currency terms but 3 percent lower than the estimate in dollar terms.
The large increase in terms of local currency is due to its devaluation from Rp 1,026 to Rp 2,120
per dollar or by 52 percent. These unaudited figures indicate correct order of magnitude, but are
subject to verification and audit by GOI. Details are shown in Table 5.

5.11        Table 5.2 indicates that the increased cost of the project in Rupiah terms is also
due to a doubled allocation to the Part B with its share increasing from 29 percent to 37 percent
in order to finance additional transmission, distribution and rehabilitation for PDAM Surabaya
(see para. 5.6). In general the increases can be attributed to an expansion in the scope of works.
5.12        Financing for the project, estimated and actual, is shown in Table 5.3. For Part A
WEs, some material stockpiled under the first project (Loan 2275) was used. Under Part B,
PDAM Surabaya installed some pipes acquired under the Second Water Supply Project (Loan

Government of the Netherlands provided technical assistance for human resource development

Disbursement
5.13         For several years, the loan disbursement exceeded the appraisal estimate. As of
June 30, 1988, actual disbursement was in fact almost double that estimated at appraisal. This
good performance was due mainly to (a) contract packaging being ready at loan signing indicating
good preparation of the project; (b) Consultants being in place at loan signing; (c) experienced
Project Manager, Assistants and Staff being in place; (d) Contractors/suppliers being more
experienced with GOI procedures than the previous ones; (e) use of multi-years civil work
contracts in 1987/1988 until 1988/1989; (f) good cooperation of local government, especially in
the provision of major plots of land for facilities (such as reservoir, pump station) and supply of

slippage in disbursement rate and eventual need to extend the closing date by 15 months was
almost entirely due to revision in scope of Part B of the project as explained below. Details are
shown in Tables 3 and 5(b).

Commissioning and Handover
5.14         Part A Systems. All systems have been completed. The first IKK and BNA
systems began operation in 1989 and 1990 respectively. All commissioning of IKK systems was
completed in 1990 and most BNA systems by the end of 1990. Extension of distribution
pipework in each FY year after 1989/1990 was also accompanied by certain remedial work such
as redevelopment of wells, replacement of control equipment and repair of pumps and pipework.
These works were undertaken to correct deficiencies and improve the operational performance
of a number of the systems and to complete handover of systems.
5.15         Most of the 75 systems were in fact brought into production without major
trouble. The deficiencies arose through a combination of circumstances, probably the most
important being (a) unforeseeable declines in water source quality and quantity, in some areas,
(b) difficulty in arranging remedial work once contractors had left the site or the contract
maintenance period had expired, and (c) the limited mechanical and electrical (M&E) maintenance
experience of personnel involved in the project. Efforts to remedy deficiencies were delayed in
some cases due to (i) the time necessary to gain budget approval to undertake further work and
(ii) difficulty in persuading contractors to return to site after their responsibility for contract work
had expired. Since then, all Part A assets have been completed and handed over to the water
enterprises.
5.16         Part B Systems. PDAM Surabaya completed (a) Karangpilang treatment plant,
(b) the distribution works as planned, and (c) additional works as agreed during the
implementation. PDAM Surabaya already had full control over the assets since it used own
internal cash generation and assumed responsibility for the loan.
5.17         Asset Transfer. For Part A WEs the assets were handed over to WEs for
operation as soon as the trial runs were completed. With regards to the formal transfer for all
assets, the BPKP audit verifying the asset value has been completed. Ministry of public works
is in process of transferring the assets to the Ministry of Finance. Following the transfer to MOF
by end-1994, the assets are expected to be transferred to Ministry of Home Affairs by mid-1995
who will in turn transfer to the concerned local government.
Loan Agreement Covenants
5.18         Loan covenants have been generally complied with, with three exceptions:
(a) there have been delays in completion of audit reports; (b) clean up of Kali Surabaya has
proven to be much harder than assumed; (c) there has been persistent lag in achievement of cost
recovery, which is affected by depreciation allowances and tariff levels. Setting of tariffs is in
the hands of local governments. Efforts continue to encourage WEs to fully account for and
recover their costs. While all WEs are covering O&M cost and a part of depreciation, only a
few are able to cover full depreciation at the legally authorized rate. The ongoing East Java Bali
UDP (Loan 3304-IND) will monitor further progress on audit and cost recovery issues. Efforts
are still needed for continuing attention for carrying out action program about abatement of
pollution by industrial and residential effluents discharged into the Surabaya river. Given the
limited scope of pollution control under the project, the recently negotiated Surabaya Urban
Project includes substantial work to carry forward the pollution control. Details are discussed
below and shown in Annex 1.

6.1          General. Direct benefits as a result of this project have been gained through
substantial increases in (a) the quantity of water produced, (b) the number of service connections
and public taps (thereby improving access) and (c) the quantity and quality of drinking water
sold. Summary of operating results for each WE is shown in Table 6(e). SAR projections cover
the period through 1991. However, the project was completed on December 31, 1993. Since
generally there has been no investment in Part A WEs besides the project, one can safely assume
that the 1993 results can be attributed to the project.
6.2          Production. Only 7 of 13 WEs (including PDAM Surabaya) under the project
were already established and in operation before 1985. Total production (except PDAM
Surabaya) was roughly 5.98 million m3. By 1991, total production for the 12 WEs reached 20.62
million m3, or an increase of 3.5 times the production prior to the project implementation. By
end-1993, it reached 23.29 as compared to the target volume during the appraisal which was
23.96 million m3. One reason for the lag is that most systems (especially those using deep well
as source) operate only for 12 hours instead of the 24 hours projected. PDAM Surabaya
produced about 124 million m3 in 1991 but reached the target 134 two years later in 1993.
6.3          Water Sales have generally been lower thana the target in most Part A WEs.
Only four (Kab. Madium, Nganjuk, Pasuruan, and Kot. Pasuruan) reached or exceeded the
target. Total water sales in 1993 reached about 17 million m3 as compared to the 1991 target of
about 20 million m3 i.e., a shortfall of 15 percent. PDAM Surabaya was expected to have sold
100 million m3 by end of 1991. The actual was 18 percent less. As of December 31, 1993, the
PDAM sales are even further behind earlier targets. This was largely due to delayed investments
in water production facilities which were to start in 1988 but had not started by early 1994 due
to protracted negotiations for Umbulan Springs with a private partner. The follow-on SUDP
includes construction of the Karangpilang treatment plant II originally scheduled to be constructed
starting 1988. The difference in sales is also due to the high actual unaccounted-for-water which
averages (a) about 25 percent compared to appraisal's projection of 15 percent of total production
for Part A enterprises; and (b) about 36 percent for PDAM Surabaya compared to an estimated
25 percent.
6.4          Total Water Connection targets have been met. The project WEs (Part A) were
expected to have 74,430 connections by end 1991 and maintain that level through the projection
period to 1994. Actual number was 80,265 by the closing date of end 1993. PDAM Surabaya
was expected to have 168,050 connections by the end of the project on December 31, 1991. It
reached that target in 1993. By December 31, 1993, it had 170,593 connections.
6.5          The population with access to piped water from the 12 Part A WEs is estimated
to have risen from about 66,860 in 1985 (SAR estimate) to about 631,000 in 1991. The total
appraisal estimate was 775,000 by 1991. More recent data are not available. The shortfall is
a consequence of a reduced number of public taps which were expected to serve (200 persons per
public tap). In Surabaya, the number of people served reached 1.848 million in 1993 as
compared to estimated 1.996 million. By end of 1993, 64 percent of the population is served in
Surabaya as projected in the SAR.

6.6          Improved Water Quality. Before the project, most beneficiaries obtained their
water from shallow wells close to their residence. Health statistics on the decrease in incidence
of diseases arising from water quality between 1983 and 1990 are not readily available, but a
study 2/ in 1984 indicated at least 60 percent and probably more of traditional water sources
in the towns studied were bacteriologically unacceptable. Regular testing of the produced water
is now undertaken at the treatment plants in Surabaya and in other large towns. The results are
mostly satisfactory. However, generally people still boil their water, indicating a lack of faith
by the consumers and probability that water quality at the consumer's tap is sometimes not
satisfactory. Given the low service levels, the focus in the past has tended to be on providing
quantity of water rather than quality.
6.7          Although boiling of water taken from the distribution system may still be common,
there have been few source quality problems experienced in all 76 systems (Surabaya is using
aerators at intake in order to dissolve oxygen in water). The most common treatment in Part A
systems is now precautionary chlorination, although the operation of many chlorinators by WE
staff in a continuous manner has been erratic. WE staff cite various reasons for not operating
equipment, ranging from people "not liking the taste" to faulty equipment. This matter impacts
especially on IKK consumer water quality where intermittent operation of source works makes
chlorination all the more important. The conclusion is that deep wells sources are particularly
appropriate in ensuring higher quality water as they minimize the need for high levels of operator
skill required to maintain even simple treatment works. GOI is increasingly emphasizing water
quality issues in the new projects particularly in large towns and cities.
6.8          Unaccounted for Water (UFW). The Unaccounted for Water (UFW) was higher
than expected for the project towns. It averaged about 25 percent _/ compared to 15 percent
expected at appraisal for Part A WEs; and about 36 percent compared to an estimated 25 percent
for Surabaya. Details are shown in Table 6(b). Reasons noted include: (a) the apparent levels
maybe in error, particularly for Part A because metering is often not adequate especially in IKKs;
(b) experienced installers and constant supervision to ensure leak free systems were often lacking
for pipe laying including service connections; (c) loss detection systems are still weak, and
(d) "administrative" losses may be higher than assumed.
6.9          Under this project, Unaccounted for Water (UFW) is higher than expected for the
12 WEs in Part A but it is better than under the first project (averaging 32 percent), because:
(a) production meter on all IKK has been installed in early implementation; (b) improvement of
contractors/supervisors skill has been raised with training program by PTU, PMDU assistance;
(c) use of better quality pipe for house connections; and (d) use of more valves in distribution
system, which is for better control of leaks.
6.10         For PDAM Surabaya, UFW was expected to be reduced gradually from 36 percent
in 1984 to 25 percent in 1991. The task proved to be more difficult than expected. After start
of the project implementation, UFW showed limited improvement but increased to about
2/ Sanitation Identification Study Report, August 1984 by Sir M. MacDonald and Partners Asia as part
of preparation of the Second East Java IBRD Water Supply Project.
2/ UFW was 22 percent in 1993 if water leaving production facilities (rather than source) is used. In
addition, Wes give free water for fire fighting, public gardening, and in some cases for mosques.
The real" UFW is thus even lower.

39 percent in 1990 after the Karangpilang treatment plant commissioning and resulting pressure
increase. Since then, rehabilitation efforts (including establishment of zones, repairs of pipes,
and improved administration) have begun to show some improvement. Based on PDAM data
UFW for Surabaya at the end of 1993 had declined to about 33 percent. In the rehabilitated
zones of the city UFW is as low as 20 percent. Additional efforts will be continued under the
SUDP.
6.11         IKK Operation. Demand for connections in the IKK systems was unexpectedly
high. However, as reported for the first project, both capital and operating costs have proved
to be high and revenue (based on flat monthly tariff) less than expected. WEs are therefore
reluctant to operate the IKKs for long periods. In addition, it has been found that the use of flow
restrictors is not acceptable to consumers and cannot be enforced.  Restrictors are always
tampered with, be it to increase the flow rate or just to clean dirt flushed from the mains during
commissioning or after repair.
6.12         Flow restrictors were changed to water meters starting 1990/91. The change
indicated remarkable success; the meters in effect have acted as "acceptable" restrictors. The
need to read the consumer meters also ensures that regular inspection is made of the distribution
system. Revenues (based on consumption) have doubled, and even quadrupled in one case.
6.13         Other improvements made in the project IKK systems include: (a) formation of
"loops" in the network layout; (b) installation of more line valves to enable manipulation of the
distribution system into "blocks" if required; (c) installation of PLN (grid) power supplies and
more electrical protection equipment in the control panels to safeguard against the all to frequent
pump-motor damage from electrical surges; and (d) use of production water meters.
Flnancial Aspects
6.14        In 1984, not only were six out of the thirteen WEs not established, but also six
out of the seven established WEs were financially in a poor shape. Audited financial statements
were available for only four: PDAM Surabaya, PDAM Ngawi, BPAM Nganjuk and PDAM
Kab. Pasuruan. In most others, the first income and cash flow statements were under
preparation. The project has improved financial position and management capacities of all, and
therefore their ability to maintain their new level of service. The improvement can be seen from
examination of the loan covenants related to financial performance of the WEs (Annex 1).
6.15         Accounting and Audit. Accounting before the project was on a cash basis.
Accrual accounting is now established in all WEs as is an annual audit (by BPKP) of the financial
reports. The quality of implementation of accounting is presently variable but is improving, with
assistance from the PMDU and PTU. Accounts for audit are now prepared soon after the close
of the financial year. Although audits by BPKP could be done more quickly, the accountancy
standards have improved. BPKP financial audit for 1992 has been completed for all WEs except
one. With the exception of Surabaya, all WEs have some audit qualifications even though the
number of such qualifications has been declining over the period. Almost all have qualifications
relating to value of fixed assets. Other qualifications in 1992 relate to accounts receivable; and
tax liability. 1991 and 1992 qualifications are shown in Table 6(g). PMDU is working with each
one to help remove the audit qualification.

6.16           Water Tariffs. The improved financial position of the enterprises is tied
closely to the structure and level of tariffs. In accordance with the recommended National Water
Rate Structure promulgated by the GOI June 1988, tariffs with a progressive structure are applied
in each WE. The degree of progressivity however varies widely between the project WEs. The
key issue relates to the low level of tariffs.
6.17        As compared to the earlier practice of tariff adjustment every five years, the
adjustments were made approximately every three years, for all the WEs under the project.
However the amount of increase was often inadequate to generate gross revenue enough to cover
O&M and depreciation. The WEs found some difficulty in implementing higher tariffs due to
the following reasons: (a) the issue of affordability of water tariff to the consumers; (b) limited
autonomy of WEs requiring lengthy approval from local assemblies and Bupati; (c) long
procedures relating to formal transfer of assets; as a result, new tariff proposals may not include
adequate allowance for the depreciation of new assets; and (d) special circumstances, such as
elections, resulting in delays. As a whole, these have weakened the WE ability to discharge their
commercial responsibilities for cost recovery. Baupatis have resisted attempts to give more
autonomy to the PDAMs in setting tariffs.

6.19         Revenue Covenant and Cost Recovery. Covenant 4.06 (a) required each of the

in each year after 1991. Based on unaudited operating results for 1993, all 13 WEs covered

O&M. Even though the actual average tariffs as of December 31, 1993 were generally higher
than those estimated in the SAR, only two (Surabaya, and Kot. Pasuruan) covered depreciation
also. This is explained by higher operating costs and depreciation. The issue has been repeatedly
discussed with GOI. Following detailed discussions during the World Bank mission in July 1992,
based upon data from PMDU and PPSAB, GOI suggested and the Bank agreed to a phased
approach. Based on unaudited data for 1993, tariff increases of of 9 to 63 percent are needed
in average tariffs in order to fully cover the depreciation. East Java provincial government has
promised that tariffs will be adjusted by end of 1994 which would result in coverage of O&M
plus depreciation for all WEs. In future these WEs will be monitored under East Java Bali UDP
(Loan 3304). A recent supervision mission for that project was assured that on-lending to the
concerned WEs will be withheld pending tariff adjustments. Operating results of two WEs (Kab.
Ngawi and Kot. Pasuruan) are summarized below. Results for the remaining 10 WE are shown
in Table 6(e).

Financial performance for 1993 onwards is being monitored under the approved Surabaya Urban
Development Project. (Loan 3726-IND)
6.22        Assets and Depreciation. The value of fixed assets for the towns included in this
project are based on the capital costs calculated for each BNA and IKK town. Based on SAR
data, (a) fixed assets were assumed to be revalued using the local inflation rates; and
(b) depreciation expenses were calculated using a straight line method based on the economic
lives of the assets. The composite depreciation rates in the project PDAMs ranged from
2.87 percent to 3.28 percent. In the actual audited statements, fixed assets are shown at historic
costs. However, depreciation is shown at rates allowed by tax authorities which are based on
straight line method but averaged 4 to 9 percent of the gross asset value in 1992. As a result,
actual depreciation charges are considerably higher than those of the SAR. If estimated 1992
depreciation (based on revalued assets) as shown in SAR were applied, more WE would have
been able to break even.
6.23        Profit Distribution.  A MHA circular in 1985 "suggested" to provincial
Governors that distribution of 55 percent of PDAM net profits to their local governments (as



- 18 -
allowed by laws constituting the WEs) be foregone until at least 70 percent of people within the
serviced areas received piped water. However, except PDAM Surabaya which has been generally
able to limit its payments based on a revised negotiated formula, most of the project PDAMs
continue to make payments even though they are not even able to cover depreciation. PDAMs,
while technically "autonomous", are under the control and ownership of local government, who
have a major voice in tariff setting, capital investment plans and distribution of PDAM profits.
Payment to local government can be viewed as providing support to provision of other essential
public services, but also can create a relationship where the PDAM becomes a cash generator for
the local government while ignoring the need to build up funds to replace capital assets and
undertake improvement and expansion. It is not known how much amount, if any, is reinvested
in the enterprises. PMDU has not been able to collect all data. TKPP and Level I Government
have been requested again to insure that there are no net payments to the local governments until
at least 70 percent of population is served. East Java Provincial government assured the February
94 supervision mission for East Java Bali Urban Development Project (Loan 3304) that funding
under subsidiary loans will be withheld for the local governments which continue to withdraw
money from their WEs. MHA indicated that they are considering changing "the suggestion or
guidance" in this regard to "instruction".
6.24         Connection Charges. Connection charges to customers have generally been
limited to their estimated cost to improve the poor's access to piped water. Charges have varied
between WEs. In addition, all enterprises have allowed credit terms from 3 to 5 years for the
project-financed connections. The achievement of targeted connection number in most systems
would indicate the prevailing level of charges combined with the credit terms, were not a serious
deterrent to people wanting connection.
Institutional Development
6.25         National Water Enterprise Development. Introduction of the "Kabupaten-wide
PDAM" concept under the earlier project (as compared to separate WE for each town) has been
moderately successful under this project even though most of the WEs are small and continue to
struggle financially. Several WEs were started from scratch. Gradually improved efficiency has
been obtained, partly as a result of this approach and also because of direct assistance given to
the project WEs.
6.26         Institutional study for Irian Jaya and Sulawensi funded under this project explored
possibilities of combining Kabupaten WEs. GOI did not proceed with the recommendation
because of lengthy legislative procedures and possible administrative problems.  Instead,
improved performance has resulted from assistance by the provincially based PMDU for training
and monitoring; and a more active role of MHA, especially in overcoming some of the
administrative and organizational problems identified. Action is still needed by MHA and local
governments to improve (i) supervisory boards, (ii) personnel policies, and (iii) career prospects
for WE staff.
6.27         Transformation of all WEs from transitional BPAMs to PDAMs was completed
by end 1992. Some of it may have been premature in the sense that the new WEs were
(a) barely covering O&M costs at that time, and (b) could have benefited from continued
DAB/PSAB assistance.



- 19 -
6.28         Local governments have the final decision with regard to operation of their WE.
Further decentralization of local government public service delivery under the IUIDP process,
has been agreed after approval of this project. Such an environment should make the local
governments and their WEs (a) more responsive to local needs, (b) conscious of the need to
recover costs, and (c) apply funds to improvement and expansion of their service. Continued
technical assistance to WEs through East Java Bali UPD (Loan 3304) should also ensure further
development.
6.29         Sector Organization. Sector responsibilities have not changed greatly during the
project implementation period. The Directorate of Sanitary Engineering (DSE) was reorganized
in 1984 which resulted in creation of a separate Directorate of Water Supply (DAB). Technical
assistance under the loan to build sector organizations was channelled through DAB.
6.30         Sector development has been greatly helped by the Human Resources Development
Projects (HRDP) jointly funded by the Government of Netherlands (GON), the Bank and the
Government. HRDP developed some 500 training modules for different levels and expertise of
staff to assist PDAM training and assessment. The output from this project will have continuing
usefulness. Furthermore assistance to establish the Provincial Training Unit (PTU) and PMDU
in East Java has made East Java the leading province in Indonesia with regard to decentralization
of sector development institutions. Study of the role and function of the Directorate General of
Public Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD) in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
in the water sector reviewed its organizational structure, recommended several modifications, and
prepared work program to implement the agreed changes. Some improvement in functioning of
POUD is visible.
Provincial Monitoring and Development Unit (PMDU)
6.31         Even though the concept of PMDU for monitoring of the water enterprises was
agreed under the earlier loan (2275-IND), final agreement on (a) its location within provincial
Cipta Karya, (b) definition of role and TOR, (c) construction of office space, (d) recruitment of
staff, and (e) purchase of equipment and material, was achieved as a part of this project. [See
paras. 2.12 and 6.01(c), and Annex 5 of SAR.] The PMDU was relatively quickly established.
It was able to provide assistance to WEs under the first project during the last few years of
implementation. It has provided valuable assistance to WEs covered under this project, and all
of the remaining (24) WEs of the province in terms of (i) assisting with technical, financial, or
management tasks in which they may lack expertise; (ii) lending material from its stockpile;
(iii) verifying requests for tariff adjustment. PMDU's job will be much easier if WEs were
viable and healthier. Nevertheless, it is a useful monitoring and development intermediary.
6.32         Since then, the concept of PMDU has been replicated in 25 out of 27 provinces
of Indonesia. PMDU in East Java is still weak. Its data often needs to be verified. It is currently
receiving institutional development TA funded under East Java Bali UDP (Loan 3304-IND). The
Bank is currently urging GOI to meet needs of PMDUs all over Indonesia which require
(a) structural place in respective provincial governments e.g., under provincial Cipta Karya;
(b) support from provincial governments in terms of ability to work directly with PDAMs and
budget for their operations; (c) sufficient number of experienced permanent staff; (d) suitable
office space; (e) supporting equipment (vehicles, computer etc.) and facilities (workshops etc.);
and (f) expert consultants specially in early phases of their development. Given the importance



- 20 -
of PMDUs in monitoring the enterprises, they ought to be formally made a part of the respective
provincial IUIDP organization.
6.33         Training. This component of the project as continuation of Loan 2275, has been
very satisfactory. Training facilities have been improved in East Java and five other regional
training centers. Complete training software developed, and about 70 trainers accredited.
Classroom training is favored for technical staff. Staff of DAB as well as WEs all over Indonesia
have benefitted. Training efficiency would further benefit from (i) the full support of WE
management in the form of willingness to nominate the staff and pay the nominal cost of training;
and (ii) availability of additional O&M equipment before training. Dialogue with GOI is
continuing.
6.34         PTU in East Java is currently training (each year) about 450 to 500 staff members
(directors through operators) for duration of one to two weeks. Additionally about 100 staff
members from contractors are trained principally in pipe laying. Thus direct assistance to the
WEs to improve their organization have been parallelled by development in training
infrastructure. Some of the WEs have established their own training programs too-PDAM
Surabaya being a prime example.
6.35         Project WE Organization and Stafring. The project WEs already established
in 1984 had small systems rarely covering more than one community, high staff levels and weak
organization. Local Consultants reviewed their organization, and gave training both on and
off-the-job. The assistance provided to each WE included (a) on-the-job and classroom training,
(b) instruction manuals for implementing the agreed changes i accounting and technical areas, and
(c) introduction of WE monitoring indicators developed under other TA. All enterprises are now
operated on a Kabupaten-wide basis. A measure of the improved organization is reflected in the
staffing levels for each WE shown in Table 6(d), which shows the staffing/1,000 connection
ratios falling from 24 to 13.9 on average or by about 42 percent for Part A WEs; and from 16
to 10 or by 38 percent for PDAM Surabaya over the project period.
6.36         On the whole, the project has contributed to improved awareness of sound water
utility practices within the WEs. However organizational problems still exist, typically (as noted
by the PMDU) (a) Bupatis/Walikotas are too busy and the Board of Supervisors of WEs often
meet too infrequently to pay the required attention to problems faced by PDAMs (b) Directors
and other senior staff are often not selected on the basis of their professional qualifications
(c) these staff often have limited career prospects in the PDAM and prefer to remain Level 11
employees, thus encouraging frequent transfers and imposing heavy new training loads, (d) the
existence of large numbers of temporary employees (on secondment from local governments) in
the WEs, even though regulations require they become permanent (direct) employees of the WE
within three years, and (e) poor communication with their central government overseer, the
MHA. Many of these organizational shortcomings have now been exposed under project
assistance to the WEs. An increasingly active role of MHA is needed to obviate them. The Bank
is planning to address some of these issues under the proposed National Water Sector Project
which is now under preparation.
6.37         Technical assistance provided under the project, manmonths and cost are listed in
Table 7(a) under the headings "Training", "Monitoring and Development", "Pollution Control",
and "Implementation Assistance". The details of the services, purpose, status and impact of each
service are given in Table 7(b).

Overall Enterprise Performance
6.38          As mentioned in PPAR (Report No. 10853 dated August 20, 1992) for East Java
Water Supply Project (Loan 2275-IND), PMDU has a simple scoring system for monitoring
performance of the PDAMs. Total score of 200 points is divided into six categories of
performance: service level-50 points; finance-50; efficiency-30; important functions-20;
organization-20; continuity of supply/maintenance-30. Enterprises receiving 60 percent or
more are rated "good"; the rest are considered "problem PDAMs". Action plan is devised to
assist each in removing the weaknesses.
6.39          The latest available report was prepared in 1993 and evaluated 1992 performance.
The project WEs were evaluated as follows:

6.40          The results may be summarized as follows:  (a) service level (composite of
population served, quantity and quality of water) in most is below the average for the province
even though the number of connections targeted under the project have been achieved;
(b) financial performance (in terms of net income after depreciation and liquidity) is below
average for all except one indicating inadequate tariffs; (c) efficiency (enterprise as a whole,
production, distribution) is below average for most; (d) performance of important functions
(inventory control, customer service, reporting system) is above average for almost all, indicating
that the technical assistance provided in these areas has been useful; (e) organization (structure
and coordination) is above average for most indicating usefulness of technical assistance;
(f) continuity of supply, reflecting maintenance is above average in most enterprises.
6.41          Overall most WEs ranked below the provincial average. Only two (Kab. Pasuruan
and Kab. Bondowoso) received more than 60 percent of the total score. The fact that this project
consisted of the poorest among the poor areas and WEs may be a part of the explanation. PMDU
has an ongoing monitoring and corrective action program. The progress will be further
monitored under the on-going East Java Bali UDP.

OrHER PROJEcT RESULTS
6.42         Future Project Preparation. GOI budget difficulties in the mid-1980s required
an increased allocation from loans to support and accelerate preparation of future projects. This
enabled a pipeline of projects to be maintained in the sector. Thus Parts C and D of the loan
were used to finance a series of consultancy contracts, some of which had not been considered
at appraisal. In summary they were: (a) Karangpilang II Design; (b) Provincial Water Resources
Master Plan Study; (c) detailed Design of PDAM Surabaya Distribution System Expansion and
Rehabilitation; (d) East Java/Bali IUIDP; (e) institutional study for North - South Sulawesi Water
Supply; (f) study of the role and function of PUOD in water supply sector; and (g) consultant
Services for Jakarta Rehabilitation Pilot Project. Thus several projects namely East Java Bali
UDP (Loan 3304); Sulawesi Irian Jaya UDP (Loan 3340); Second Jabotabek UDP (Loan 3219)
have materialized in part thanks to funding from this project. Summary assessment of the impact
of each service is at Annex F.
6.43         Impact on Physical and Technological Environment. Some minor disturbances
to traffic and access during construction were experienced but their impact was minor, mainly
because hand-dug pipe trenches require little access and road surface damage is quickly repaired.
Matters which could have been troublesome were not, these being (a) land acquisition (a number
of sites, particularly for reservoirs, were relocated to less populated locations) and (b) pipelaying
in built-up areas (the generally small diameter pipes can be easily re-routed and require no heavy
equipment for laying). The impact of additional waste water generated in supplied areas cannot
be easily assessed, however the proportion of waste water in the drainage systems in the wet
season is very small in comparison to stormwater. Improved sanitary practices introduced under
other GOI programs (mainly through the Health Ministry) also reduced the risk of water borne
disease being transported in the extra waste. A further positive impact is that clean water has
been supplied to a large number of people who would otherwise have relied on unsafe supplies.
6.44         The project introduced electro-submersible pumping technology while experience
of pumped systems was minimal prior to the project. Pumped systems are unavoidable on many
occasion but project experience (and some analysis under the East Java Water Resources Study)
indicates preference should be given to gravity schemes wherever possible even where the capital
costs are a little higher than for pumped systems. The project also introduced sophisticated
electronic telemetry control systems in a number of towns, but this should be minimized as
difficulties in obtaining spare parts and local electronic technicians to repair the units have already
occurred.  Electrical control equipment has been less than satisfactory, but at least most
components are available in the market and trained maintenance personnel are becoming
available.
6.45         Kali Surabaya Pollution Control. Appraisal of the Project showed that severe
industrial pollution occurring in Kali Surabaya would adversely affect the existing works at
Ngagel and the proposed works at Karangpilang. The problem was tackled in a number of ways:
(a) design of the treatment plant to allow for dealing with the level of pollution identified;
(b) provision of additional cost of operation of the plant; (c) initiation of work on pollution
control through a first-stage study aimed at preparing recommendations for improvement; and a
second stage for implementation of the recommendations. The project included a total of
US$0.47 for pollution control activities. The task proved to be more complex in technical,
financial, institutional, and legal terms. Lack of a single provincial authority responsible for
cleanup of the river proved to be the most serious problem.



- 23 -
6.46        The plant was built and is operating as intended. Major polluters were identified
and persuaded to instal pre-treatment facilities on their sites. The consultants hired for (c) have
made a number of proposals, but momentum was lost when the TA budget was exhausted, and
GOI did not request further funding. The current problems are two-fold: First, the provincial
government is unable to take action on key organizational issues pending central government
decision about formation of environmental agencies at provincial level. Second, shortage of
funding to obtain additional consultancy equipment for the laboratory staff and transport for
monitoring and meeting other O&M.
6.47        Through the PROKASIH (Clean Rivers) program for the Brantas River Basin, GOI
and the East Java Provincial Government have initiated actions of their own to clean several
rivers,including Kali Surabaya. This program appears to be reducing the pollution from
industrial sources upstream of Surabaya. Raw water analyses show a considerable reduction of
the main pollutants since 1991. Furthermore, the ongoing East Java Bali Urban Development
Project provides funds to reduce the largest source of pollution to Kali Surabaya, human waste
discharges from Surabaya's upstream neighbors (Gresik, Mojokerto and Sidoarjo). Additional
funds would be provided under the recently approved Surabaya Urban Development Project
(Loan 3726-IND)to support a K. Surabaya Pollution Control Action Program, largely by
improving their capacity to monitor river water quality.
E. RATES OF RETURN
Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR)
6.48        The appraisal recognized that the EIRR would be low, averaging +4.4 percent.
'he ex-post EIRR for 3 of the 12 WEs averaged one to two percent, and was negative for the
rest of Part A WEs. These low rates reflect low tariffs and provide the economic justification
for higher tariffs. As noted in the SAR, these EIRR calculations are not a fair measure of the
true EIRR because they do not adequately capture other externalities such as health benefits and
time savings and increased property values. In the meantime essential and safe water will be
provided to a heretofore unserved population at a price which will encourage community
acceptance.
6.49        The EIRR for PDAM Surabaya (Part B) is estimated at 16 percent. As shown
above, the PDAM has consistently earned over 15 percent financial rates of return on revalued
assets for the last five years. Since the willingness to pay is usually equal to or higher than the
tariffs, real EIRR would be higher than the financial rate of return.
Poverty Alleviation
6.50        During the appraisal, it was estimated that Part A of the project (12 BNAs and 63
IKKs) would benefit 820,000 people by 1991, through house connections and standpipes. About
90 percent of the total population or 1.2 million persons in the beneficiary towns were below the
relative poverty level of US$ 130 equivalent/household/month in 1985.  Based on GOI
calculations as of 1991, actual population served by the project in Part A alone, totaled 631,000
persons through house connections and standpipes. The number of people served has increased
since then. In Surabaya about 470,000 additional people are being served since commissioning
of the project-funded Karangpilang WWTP in late 1989 which is larger than the 240,000
mentioned in the SAR.



- 24 -
6.51         Although numbers of public taps intended for use by the poor were not achieved,
the impact on the poor may not have been severe because tariffs remain low in the social
consumption blocks and shared connections are common. It must be noted that about 80 percent
of the total connections have been directly funded by the project while the remaining have been
installed by the WEs. The low use of public taps experienced in many locations may also partly
reflect the improving incomes, and hence reduced poverty.
6.52         Direct benefits have also flowed to the poor from the project. These include
generation of employment, cheaper water through PDAM as compared to earlier reliance on
vendors,, better health and extra time, especially for women, for more productive activities.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.1          The project has a number of aspects which were designed to secure sustainability
of the WE investments and sector progress. These included inter alia:
(a)    maximum use of groundwater and minimum use of surface water sources and
treatment plants which are dependent on mainly imported mechanical and
electrical plant;
(b)   provision of a full range of tools and equipment to each WE for O&M including
water loss reduction activities;
(c)   the careful division of investment in each Kabupaten between BNA and IKK sized
towns to ensure that in spite of their small size and relative poverty, the WE had
a chance to be viable financially;
(d)   periodic revision of tariffs to ensure better cost recovery while still maintaining
the tariff's social objectives;
(e)   provision of training and on-the-job assistance to all 13 WEs to make their
operations more efficient; in case of Karangpilang treatment plant for Surabaya
and other WEs, staff used in construction phase were largely kept once the plant
was commissioned to ensure sound operation;
(f)   establishment of the PTU and PMDU to provide on-going training, monitoring
and development assistance to not only under these project WEs loan 2275 and
loan 2632, but also the other WEs in East Java, and east Indonesian through PTU;
(g)   assistance to DGCK to not only develop training materials and WE monitoring
and development methods but also to strengthen DGCK's ability to direct
development of the sector.
7.2          Low tariffs and higher UFW  have precluded full financial viability to date for
most Part A WEs. The base tariff in December 1993 varied from Rp 125 to Rp 220/ni3 i.e., US
6 cents to 10 cents equivalent. At the time, average tariff in Swabayer and Jakarta equalled about
US$28 and 50 cents respectively. In any case, all WEs are covering O&M and at least a part of
the depreciation. The above measures have succeeded some way in ensuring present benefits are



- 25 -
maintained and are likely to be raised in the future. Recovery of O&M and even partial
depreciation costs through better tariff structure is making available funds for improved O&M
and even small extensions of the distribution system. Concentrated efforts in human resources
development under this and previous projects are beginning to improve WE efficiency and enable
them to become self-reliant, viable bodies providing a public service responsive to the needs of
the population in the Kabupaten.
7.3          There is little doubt that the market exists for clean water supplies. That demand
however is influenced not only by water costs and people's incomes but also the quality of service
the WE maintains. It is in this area that benefits could be increased in many WEs through future
action in both technical and institutional development. The proposed National Water Sector
Project is expected to address these issues.
8.    Performance of Suppliers Contractors and Consultants
8.1          Supplies. Twenty-six of 28 bids were won by local suppliers while the other two
(for workshop maintenance equipment and well screen pipe) were foreign contractors with local
offices. Seventeen of the 28 bids were on an ICB basis and 22 different suppliers were awarded
the 28 contracts.
8.2          The performance of suppliers of pipe, well equipment, miscellaneous items and
most mechanical and electrical equipment has been acceptable. Experience indicates that M&E
and imported materials contracts still should be awarded as early as possible (before all others
if practicable) because of the time required to complete them. Lack of clear standard documents
has been a part of the delay.
8.3          The recent introduction of standard documents by the Bank should assist in
harmonizing the conditions suppliers experience between projects, improve quality control and
enhance project staff management of supply contracts.
8.4          Civil Contractors. GOI regulations require that all development budget work
over Rp 1 million be performed under contract. Contracts (over 137) were undertaken by some
67 different Indonesian contractors, mostly small local companies. The presidential decrees of
1980 and 1984 stipulate that projects with a value less than Rp 200 million must be tendered
among small "economically weak" contractors established in the districts where the works will
be undertaken. These contractors must also be prequalified to undertake government works.
There are more than 3,000 prequalified contractors for MPW work in East Java. Less than 100
are classed as not "economically weak", and most rely upon government works for their survival.
8.5          The ability of the contractors for Part A towns depended mainly upon the ability
of their management and senior site staff. Many of the contractors employed at least one
(generally young) engineering graduate on site. Quality of the work performed by these small
contractors was often less than satisfactory. However, all contracts were completed and their
performance generally improved over time, as their experience increased. Factors which helped
performance have included: (a) "slicing and packaging" of the works into elements which
reduced contractor's risk; (b) decentralization of payment procedures during the project to enable
payment through local treasury offices (KPN) rather than in Jakarta; (c) allowing price escalations
in 1986 following devaluation; (d) limiting tender invitation lists to those who had previously



- 26 -
worked on the project; (e) government intervention to control prices nationwide of cement, steel
and other construction materials, thus reducing price fluctuations; and (f) tradesman and
contractor training at PTU. During the process, a large number of small contractors received
training and experience.
8.6         In the case of Part B, the main contractor (P.T. Wijaya Kusuma) for Karangpilang
had experience of similar treatment plants and did not experience any major problem.
Performance of Consultants
8.7         The proportion of the loan used to finance TA increased substantially with 45
contracts awarded to 22 different consulting firms. Much of this increase was due to additional
new project preparation. Consultants therefore played a significant role in the project. Under
the project 233 manmonths of foreign consultant and 5,197 manmonths of local consultants were
contracted. Large number of local consultant man-months is partly explained by wide spread
nature of the project and exclusive use of local consultants in the field. Appraisal estimates were
234 foreign and 1,249 local man-months. Co-financiers (ADAB and GON) also provided
technical assistance for human resource development, WE institutional development, and PMDU.
Division of work was clear. Each agency followed its own contractual arrangements.

8.8         Project management and advisory services to the PMU/PIU following on from
project preparadon enabled early momentum to be maintained through support of the new PMU.
These services relied more on the local consultant. Although not intended to provide full
supervision of the works, the consultants provided valuable support for GOI supervision staff by



- 27 -
ensuring timely preparation of each year's tender documents and providing experienced
construction engineers to advise PIU subsections. They were also useful in consolidating loan
monitoring, management and reporting under the East Java PMU.
8.9         Institutional development aspects have involved local consultants most heavily,
although foreign consultants, also provided very useful inputs. There was useful transfer of skills
and knowledge (especially under HRDP) in the fields of training, management and finances and
the material produced have been, and will be, very useful in improving enterprise performance
in the sector.
8.10         Preparation of future projects required more foreign consultant services than other
parts. The performance of these Consultants was also satisfactory. Use of foreign consultants
was found to be necessary partly because of the projects' complexity. These services were all
completed satisfactorily.
9. Performance of Borrower
9.1          The Project Office. The PMU and PIU were officially established in March 1983
for the first project. In 1984 the PMU/PIU and the local PPSAB merged. During this project,
a much greater responsibility for procurement, payments and supervision of consultants has been
given to the provincial staff. All these new found responsibilities have been soundly discharged.
9.2          The credit for these achievements (and the early project preparation) lies mainly
with the project staff, who have demonstrated that, with appropriate guidance and assistance from
DGCK, deconcentration of central government activities is a workable concept. PPSAB in East
Java now have a large staff experienced in water supply project implementation. A number of
these staff have now been sent to other provinces as project managers, while those who remain
in East Java will fill many key positions for implementation of the much larger investments under
future projects.
9.3          Directorate of Water Supply (DAB). The DAB subdirectorates directly involved
in the physical implementation were those responsible for Implementation, Planning and Design
(Perencanaan), and Development (Pengaturan). Their performance has been steadily improving
as increased experience of staff and improved coordination of the numerous agencies providing
assistance to DAB has taken effect through such measures as creation within DGCK of the
Central Project Finance and Central Project Management Offices. Staff training provided through
DGCK and MPW has been beneficial and ongoing projects will further improve GOI staff
performance.
9.4          Provincial and Local Government. Provincial and local government have also
played useful roles, although not the complete one foreseen at appraisal. Local governments were
particularly efficient in land acquisition matters while provincial government, through BAPPEDA,
have played a useful role in early project establishment and then later in the project as an
overseer of commissioning and hand-over of the facilities. The experience gained will be
invaluable for the much greater role of these parties in the future IUIDP approach. The local
governments have been less supportive in terms of timely tariff adjustments and reinvestment of
funds.



- 28 -
9.5         The performance of PDAM/BPAMs has been mixed. BPAMs have generally been
staffed by younger and better trained people originating from DGCK. Their enthusiasm and
commitment to the project helped in relatively fast project implementation, and institutional
development of the new enterprises. PDAMs have also generally been supportive of the project.
Creation of the PMDU under the MHA and provincial government, along with greater WE
involvement in project preparation, are expected to improve PDAM performance under future
projects. PDAM Surabaya which assumed full responsibility for Part B completed the original
component on original schedule and below cost.
10.   Performance of the Bank
10.1        The project grew out of preparation work for the first project. Early preparation
work on two separate projects (one for 25 BNA towns and another for 100 IKK towns in East
Java) were recast into one (Loan 2275) for immediate implementation, and this Loan 2632 to be
delayed by a couple of years. A number of Bank missions in 1984 (during Loan 2275
implementation) assisted in bringing the first project quickly to the appraisal stage, with issues
such as WE organization, O&M capacity, WE monitoring and project implementation
arrangements being set-out early. Valuable dialogue ensued between GOI and Bank staff.
10.2        Appraisal. Unlike Loan 1709 which required a post-appraisal some two years
after appraisal in 1977, and even then did not become effective until 1980, appraisal to loan
effectiveness for Loan 2632 was completed in one year in April 1986. This achievement was
partly due to the cooperation of Bank staff, who were able to ensure that the issues did not
become obstacles to progress, but nevertheless were satisfactorily resolved.
10.3        Supervision. The timing and number of supervision missions was satisfactory
with a suitable selection of members from appropriate disciplines. Twenty-two staff in total
contributed to 20 missions. There have been several changes in the technical staff. However,
the task manager remained unchanged.   There has been appropriate attention to
institutional/financial aspects of the project, technical issues and to the application of lessons
learnt in the follow-on projects.
10.4        Bank staff have maintained good working relationships with all GOI agencies and
their inputs have provided valuable support and guidance to GOI staff responsible for sector
development. Advice from and ideas generated by the missions have been welcome and a basic
source of guidance to GOI staff. The support provided in overcoming obstacles to progress such
as making provision of extra funding during times of limited GOI budget in 1986/87, agreeing
revised procurement procedures and acting to coordinate efforts between agencies have been
particularly appreciated. The contributions of the Bank's resident staff in Indonesia relating to
procurement have been helpful with prompt responses to GOI queries and ready access being the
norm.
11.   Project Relationships
11.1        GOI and Bank. A good working relationship between DGCK and the Bank staff
have enabled early and effective resolution of obstacles to progress and was an underlying reason
for the good progress on physical implementation of the project. Regular supervision has



- 29 -
minimized the potential for conflict. Improved familiarity of Bank staff with Indonesian custom
and exposure of GOI staff to new ideas and concepts introduced by the Bank has been beneficial
in bringing change to the sector.
11.2        Continuing dialogue has taken place throughout the project, primarily in the
context of Bank supervision of the various loan covenants relating to institutional development
and water enterprise performance. In spite of slow change, persistent supervision in this area has
been particularly beneficial in raising the awareness of all involved in the sector to these issues
and creating an atmosphere conducive to change.
11.3        Apart from considerable informal discussion, the main medium or "vehicle" for
communication has been the aide memoires, which are discussed widely in the implementing
agencies during and after preparation. Because of the aide-memoire's importance, and the need
for it to be relevant to all GOI agencies involved in the project (including MOF and
BAPPENAS), particular attention was given in later years to increased GOI participation in its
preparation and use of summaries to highlight findings. Continued efforts in this regard would
bear fruit.
11.4        GOI, Bank and Cofinanciers.  The Bank's role in coordinating assistance
provided by the Australian and Netherlands Governments (cofinanciers of this project) has also
been helpful as it has brought some uniformity of approach to the sector which otherwise may
have been lacking, given the large number of bilateral/multilateral agencies working with DGCK.
DGCK have had a long relationship with both AIDAB and GON and a good dialogue has been
established with both.
12. Project Documentation
12.1        Loan Agreemnent. The loan agreement covenants have not only provided useful
targets for GOI, but have also provided a structured means through which the project could be
supervised. The sections of the loan agreement most often referred to were those about
procurement. Simplification of previous loan covenants requiring a fixed rate of return on
"revalued assets in operation" to one requiring that GOI ensure "gross revenues be not less than
operating expenses and depreciation" has proven to be more easily understood by operations staff
and also more easily monitored.
12.2        Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).  This document proved invaluable during
implementation as a reference and "control" document. As the project progressed and staff
changed, it became ever more useful. Hence the clarity and accuracy are very important. The
SAR for this project was probably the document most often referred to by the Borrower. One
section which could have been better was that relating to TA. The services expected could have
been more clearly defined. However, most of the TA for future project preparation was not
foreseen at the time of the appraisal.
12.3        WE Monitoring Indicators. Performance indicators for WE's were developed
and introduced to the WEs under the project. These indicators are now provided quarterly by
the WEs to the PMDU and PPSAB. However, as review of PMDU quarterly reports shows there
is still considerable progress to be made in ensuring that these indicators have been completed



- 30 -
correctly. Frequent changes to WE staff has hampered progress in this area. This system of
indicators is now used for monitoring all WEs in Indonesia.
12.4         Detailed (Flnal) Engineering Design.  A large number of drawings were
produced along with Bills of Quantities. Contract packaging required some modification at
tendering stage.
13. Major Lessons Learned
13.1         Experience from previous projects had already highlighted the delay to projects
because of (a) cumbersome procurement (b) insufficient project preparation and (c) mismatches
between ability to produce water and of that to sell it. The experience of those projects also
confirmed that expectations about reduction in the level of unaccounted-for-water have been
over-optimistic and that alternative sources of supply need to be considered when preparing
demand projections.
13.2         Major lessons learnt in terms of project design, implementation, technical,
financial and institutional areas are listed below. Elements of project design found to be useful
were:
(a)   the devolution of implementation responsibility to the province through
PMU/PIUs;
(b)   limiting the project sites to one province;
(c)    preparation of detailed design almost coincidentally with project preparation; and
(d)   using stockpiled material to commence physical work quickly.
13.3         From implementation, experience indicates:
(a)   larger work packages facilitated by larger multi-year budget allocation benefit the
result;
(b)   not all people can be persuaded to take piped supplies of water, but most people
prefer house connections;
(c)   improved access is important to ensuring demand;
(d)   difficulty in achieving public tap numbers illustrates the importance of
accessibility of alternate sources (wells);
(e)   including construction of house connections under the project is helpful in
ensuring reasonable cost of connections, and making water available for sale
quickly;
(f)   commissioning of works requires careful allocation of capital and manpower
resources;
(g)   considerable TA is needed to prepare projects and are not easily estimated during
preparation of sector projects; and
(h)   provision of technical assistance constitutes only the first step in clean up of a
major river.  It must be followed up with institutional reform  and actual
implementation of the clean up.
13.4         Technical aspects of project results offer the following lessons:



- 31 -
(a)   further demand for water exists in Surabaya and BNA towns;
(b)   balanced development of water treatment, transmission, distribution and consumer
services is required; PDAM Surabaya continues to suffer due to delay in the next
phase of water production facilities);
(c)   chlorination of supplies is objectionable to some people in semi-rural areas; is still
erratic in some IKKs and needs improvement;
(d)   reduction in UFW is difficult and requires large investment but is vital, especially
for a large city like Surabaya;
(e)   use of flow restrictors in IKK systems should be abandoned; and
(f)    WE should consider further investment in up-grading IKK system for example by
installation of water meters in the remaining areas.
13.5         Financial and institutional results show that:
(a)    a large a viable PDAM  like the one in Surabaya is able to handle project
preparation and implementation on its own without a significant input from the
central government;
(b)   a separate PDAM for each Kabupatan is difficult to make viable for East Java.
(c)   timely and sufficient tariff adjustments are essential for financial viability;
(d)   adjustment every three years causes large tariff increases; more frequent
adjustments are needed (PDAM Surabaya is now adjusting every two years);
(e)   investment in training infrastructure has been very beneficial and should continue,
(f)   poverty alleviation strategies can be addressed through careful project design and
targeting, including public taps, favorably priced house connections, and well
directed incentives to WEs.
13.6         Sustained operation of project works will depend upon (a) the WEs being helped
by PMDU and PTU to continue to provide a reliable service; (b) timely and sufficient tariff
adjustments being made to cover O&M, depreciation and taxes if any. GOI should revisit the
issue of appropriate size of WEs. Regional WEs are likely to perform better by pooling
resources.  The role of PMDUs may also be enlarged.  They may be able to provide
reimbursable services to the needy WEs through management or service contracts.

SUMMARY
BACKGROUND (Section 2 of Part II)
S.01. The Government of Indonesia has directed ever larger amounts of funds into the water
supply sub-sector since the beginning of REPELITA I in 1969. A major acceleration of efforts
took place at the end of REPELITA II in 1979 when the GOI embarked upon the Basic Needs
Approach (BNA) programme and then added the Ibu Kota Kecamatan (IKK), programme.
These programmes were to quickly raise the levels of population benefitting from piped water.
S.02. The Second East Java IBRD Water Supply Project (Loan 2632-IND) constructed water
supplies in 12 BNA towns and 63 IKK towns under these programmes. The approach of the
programmes was similar to previous ones in that special attention was focussed on low con-
struction and rapid implementation with only an essential level of service being provided.
Furthermore, the finance was to be provided by central government in the form of grants.
Recovery of 0 & M plus depreciation was targetted.
S.03. Responsibility for planing and engineering under the project was allocated by the
National Planning Board (BAPPENAS) to the Directorate General of Human Settlements
(DGCK) because, although Level II government are in theory responsibility for provision of
water supply, they are technically weak and need central government assistance. However in
line with a desire to decentralize development efforts, the East Java Provincial Government,
through the Govemor, was to provide assistance. The provincial government was also to play a
larger role in 0 & M matters in the 12 water enterprises (WEs) benefitting from the project
while the central government implementing agency (the Directorate of Water Supply in
DGCK) were to withdraw from direct involvement in the WEs after they had been firmly
established.
S.04. Before this project, the World Bank had assisted 2 others (Loans 1049 and 1709) to
construct water supply systems in only 12 large towns spread across Indonesia and I other
(Loan 2275-IND). However the basic approach had been established whereby Bank financed
project were not only to assist in rapid provision on piped water supplies but were also to
enhance sustainability through improved cost recovery and strengthening of the various institu-
tions responsible for the sector development.
S.05. Experience from the previous projects highlighted a number of issues which were to be
addressed under the project. These included:
(a) efforts were needed to improved cost recovery, given the large investments require to meet
sector service targets (hence a tariff study)
(b) the need to decentralize project implementation to improve the results; (hence the project
was to be managed and implemented from East Java
(c) improvement in the levels of 0 & M were essential (hence the establishment of a Provin-
cial based Monitoring and Development Unit - PMDU and
(d) rapid growth in the sector required sustained support in the area of human resources
development (hence substantial development in this field was targetted).

PROJECT OBJECTIVES, DESCRIPTION (Section 3)
S.06. The specific project objectives were to:
(a) substantially increase low cost water production and distribution facilities through-
out East Java Province,
(b) provide technical assistance,
(c) improve provincial government capability,
(d) implement improved financing policies and,
(e) help in preparation of other water supily project.
The description of the project were:
(i) Part A : BNAtIKK towns in East Java
(ii) Part B: Sub-project PDAM Surabaya
(iii) Part C : Institutional development and
(iv) Part D : Other technical assistance
PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION (Section 4)
S.07. The project was to be implemented in one province (East Java) and to include the
developed IKK programme in a Bank project. From experience, implementation was to have a
number of new approaches, these being (i) reduced geographical dispersion, (ii) decentralized
management and implementation units (PMU/PIU), (iii) early recruitment of consultants and
attention to procurement and (iv) provision of sustained institutional development activities.
S.08. A number of other innovative features introduced were:
(a) accelerated project preparation including detailed design and making use of ground-
water resources previously not considered
(b) use of flow restrictors and less usual design criteria as well as standardized modules
in the IKK programme to minimize costs
(c) cross subsidization and expansion of WE responsibilities to cover all systems in the
K.abupaten, and
(d) a commitment to support a number of institutional development projects.
S.09. Most aspects of the project design have been successful. Aspects which contributed
most to project success were:
(a) early completion of design, aided by a new approach to water resource investigations
(b) use of stockpiled material and or workshop to obviate early procurement delays
(c) devolving central power to newly established PMU/PUI and providing these organi-
zation with staff of sufficient experience and competence, and
(d) ensuring early involvement of provincial government and PDAM.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION (Section 5)
S.10. Preparation and appraisal were completed in less than 1 years. Loan effectiveness and
then good disbursement rates followed. Early discussion and agreement with EWs on their
responsibility and the simple (grant) financing arrangements ensured work under the project



- 36 -
could commence quickly. Early launch of works were facilitated by there being no delay in
materials supply because they were available from stockpipe. At the same time most IA
services were also contracted. The combined result was that disbursement rate exceeded that
estimated until 1988.
Revision and Delays
S.11. There has not been major revision of the physical works although (i) about 60% more
distribution system costing about Rp. 4,6 billion has been added to improve people's access to
piped water, (ii) some revision of many IKK systems has been undertaken before implemen-
tation. A large increase in TA has occurred during the project. Although time overrun on
physical work under the project was about 60%, this time was necessary to complete the dis-
tribution extensions. These extensions resulted in targetted connection numbers being
surpassed. Part A completed in March 1992 but not Part B for pipe procurement.
S.12. The distribution system required extension because not all people wanted a connection
(as initially assumed). Public taps were supposed to serve 50% of the beneficiaries but 41 %
less were constructed than planned because, inter alia, for those who want piped water, house
connections are seen as being much more desirable. These assumption that a strong demand for
piped water exists among all groups in society is not always correct because water exists
among all groups in society is not always correct because
(i) traditional sources are often seen as more convenient
(ii) there is some stigma attached to drawing water form a public tap and
(iii) there is little incentive for WEs to promote the use of public taps.
Improving socio-economic conditions also leads to decreasing dependence on taps. Because of
these factors and the low cost of obtaining private connections, connections have been
promoted under the project.
Procurement
S.13. Procurement experience under the project also indicates (i) foreign suppliers are now
unlikely to be competitive for most ICB contracts in Indonesia (ii) LCB procedures are must
faster than ICB (iii) increased support of the deconcentrated/decentralized logistics section of
project, (iv) greater use of supply and install contracts (especially for M & E work) should be
encouraged and (v) M & E contracts remain the most crucial in project completion and should
be awarded as early as possible.
Costs and Fmancial
S.14. The project cost US$ 63.22 million compared to an appraisal estimate of US$ 79.08
million. The cost of components (actual vs estimated) in Rp billion was:
Component                Cost (Rp. billion)              Percentage of Total
Appraisal      Actual            Appraisal     Actual
Part A                  38.53         45.70                44          43
Part B                  25.07         27.17                29          23
Part C                  10.49         17.10                12          16
Part D                  12.90         15.59                15          18

equivalent US$ million    79.08        63.22



- 37 -
GOI contribution USS 16.7 million from its own sources. The cost expressed in rupiah has
increased from Rp. 86.99 to 105.57 billion mainly because the value of the rupiah has
depreciated from USSS 1 = Rp. 1.100 at appraisal to about US$ 1 = Rp. 2.033 at project
completion. However the scope of the project also increased (especially TA Services), so a
comparison of actual and estimated costs has little meaning.
S.15. Financing came not only from Loan 2632, but also other Bank Loans (1709 and 2275-
IND) as well as GOI and the Governments of Australia and the Netherlands. The wide source
of finances is indicative of the way that the loan was used to support a number of different
projects as GOI budget restrictions became more severe in what has become known as the
"adjustment period" (1983 - 88).
Commissioning and Handover
S.16. Some technical difficulties were experienced during commissioning and hand-over, but
these were not exceptional. However, the time taken to resolve them could have been less.
Logistical support, budget and manpower were all required to commission the works. The
lessons learnt from the first project in this regard have however been applied to the Second
East Java project with success.
Loan Agreement Covenants
S.17. AU covenants have been complied with except those relating to cost recovery, which is
effected by depreciation allowances and tariff levels. Setting of tariffs is outside the control of
central government, but efforts continue to encourage WEs to fully account for and recover
their costs and still needed for continuing attention for carry out action program about
abatement of pollution by industrial and residential effluents discharged into Surabaya river.
PROJECT RESULTS (Section 6)
S.18. Total production (except PDAM Surabaya) was roughly 5.98 million m3. By 1991, total
production for the 13 WEs reached 20.62 million m3, or an increase of 3,5 times the produc-
tion prior to the project implementation. This is however below the targe volume during the
appraisal which was 23.96 million m3. One major reason is that most system (especially those
using deep well as source) operate only for 12 hours instead of the 24 hours projected.
S.19. Water sales are lagging appraisal values by about one year. The 1990 estimate was
15.07 million mi3 while 1991 actual was 15.02 million m3. This differences is not the effect of
delay of construction and commissioning but due to the high actual unaccounted-for-water
which average 27% compared to appraisals 15% total production.
S.20. The population benefitting from piped water under the 12 project WEs is estimated to
have risen from about 66.860 in 1985 (SAR estimate) to about 631.000 in 1991. The total
appraisal estimate was 775.000 by 1991. The short-fall is consequence of less number people
served per public tap (200 persons per public tap in appraisal).
S.21. Further benefits area accruing from better water quality. However many people still boil
their water out of habit as high levels of preventable disease were common in these towns
before piped water was provided.
S.22. Boiling of water may still be common, but there have not been a lot of source quality
problems. Those experienced were typically excess salinity, turbidity or iron content. Most
problems have been rectified without complicated treatment. Precautionary chlorination



- 38 -
equipment is universally installed but its operation is erratic for technical and sociological
reasons. The use of deep wells under the project is therefore an appropriate policy as water
from them require little treatment.
Unaccounted for Water
S.23. Unaccounted for water (UFW) is higher than expected for the project towns (averaging
about 25 %, compared to 15 % expected at appraisal). Improvement under this project include
(i) production meter on all IKK has been used in early implementation,
(ii) improvement of contractors/supervisors skill has been raised with training
programme by PTU, PMDU and consultants,
(iii) use of GI pipe for house connections,
(iv) use of more valve in distribution system, that is for easily controlled leaking.
The lessons of experience have been learnt and corrective actions such as establishment of
UFW detection training facilities, programmes and monitoring system are being implemented.
IKK Operation
S.24. The initial IKK programme was a bold programme initiated in response to a need
improve coverage quickly. Demand for the water exists but an analysis of recorded operating
costs for selected systems show IKK costs to be higher than BNA as below

Economeis of scale are not available in the IKK towns and low income generation potential
tends to discourages WEs from operating them for long hours.
S.25. Flow restrictors in IKK systems were found to be unacceptable and impractial. Recent
installation of water meters in trial towns found meters act as "acceptable' restrictors. This
improvement, along with a number of others introduced to customize design for individual
systems improved IKK performance. The results could be further studied and the findings
applied nationally.
Financial Aspects
S.26. The finances of all project WEs has improved along with their management and
accounting. Accounts for audit are now prepared soon after the close of the financial year,
and, although annual audits could be done more frequently, the accountancy standards were
improved.
S.27. As of March 1992 out of the 13 WEs covered by SEJWSP, only PDAM Surabaya
covers 0 & M and depreciation. Other 4 PDAMs covered 0 & M only while 2 PDAMs
(Kabupaten Ngawi and Kabupaten Pasuruan) were not able to cover 0 & M cost. Out of 6
BPAMs, only 2 covered 0 & M costs. GOI indicated that it will be very difficult this year to
implement the large increases needed to cover 0 & M and depreciation.

S.28. Water tariffs have been generally applied in accordance with the recommend National
structure. Often however they need "fine tuning" with regard to progressivity and consumer
classification. They also require more frequent adjusment. Average levels now exceed
expected levels calculated at appraisal. Tariff adjusment is a lengthy process which will be
assisted by the newly formed PMDUs and is sometimes hindered because cost recovery is not
seen as all important by some local authorities.
Depreciation
S.29. Full value assets, and therefore full dipreciation, is frequently not being accounted for
(it is the second most commonly identified reason for BPKP qualification WE accounts).
Programmes have been impelemented through DAB to improve accounting of these costs.
Local government have the final decision with regard to operation of their WEs therefore
significant decentralization of local government public service delivery under the IUIDP
process should make them more responsive to local needs and conscious of the need to recover
costs and apply funds to improvement and expansion of their service.
Institutional Results of Project
S.30. Introduction of the "Kabupaten-wide PDAM" concept under the project has been
successful and a similar approach is being use in other provinces. Improved efficiency has
been obtained, partly as a result of this approach and also because of direct assistance given to
the project WEs. Staffing levels have fallen on average from 25 employees/1000 connections
to 11.
S.31. Some investigation has been made of combined Kabupaten WEs but it was not pro-
ceeded with because of probable administrative problems. Instead, improved performance will
result from assistance by newly established provincially based units for training and monitoring
and a more active role of MHA, especially in overcoming some of the administrative and
organizational problems identified. Action to improve (i) supervisory boards (ii) personnel
policies and (iii) career prospects will flow from greater MHA oversight.
Sector Organization
S.32. Sector responsibilities have not changed greatly during the 1980's. The Directorate of
Sanitary Engineering (DSE) was reorganized in 1984 while assistance under the loan to build
sector organizations was channeled through DAB. Many PDAMs received assistance and are
now in a stronger position to play an increased role in future intergrated development projects.
S.33. Sector development has been greatly helped by the Human Resources Development
Projects (HRDP) and also the Institutional Support for the Water Supply Sector (ISWSS)
projects. HRDP developed many modalities to assist PDAM training and assessment. The
output from this project will have continuing usefulness even when transferred to MHA.
Furthermore assistance by the ISWSS project to establish the Provincial Training Unit (PTU)
and PMDU in East Java has make East Java the leading province in Indonesia with regard to
decentralization of sector development institutions.
Training
S.34. This component of the project as continuation of Loan 2275 has been very satisfactory
as well as training facilities being improved, complete training software developed, and some
70 trainers accredited. Classroom training is being directed to WE management and new



- 40 -
employees while on-the-job training is favoured for technical staff. Training efficiency would
benefit from (i) appropriate timing, (ii) the full support of WE management, and (iii) provision
of paper 0 & M equipment before training. HRDP developed a full range of training tools.
Future Project Preparation
S.35. This enable a pipeline of projects to be maintained in the sector. Thus the loan was used
to finance a series of consultancy contracts, some of which had not been considered at
appraisal. In summary they were:
(a) Karangpilang II Design and Provincial Water Resources Master Plan Study
(b) Detailed Design of PDAM Surabaya Distribution System Expansion and Rehabilitation
(c) East Java/Bali IUIDP
(d) Institutional Study for North - South Sulawesi Water Supply
(e) Study of the role and function of POUD in water supply sector
(f) Consultant Services for Jakarta Rehabilitation Pilot Project
Impact on Environuments
S.36. A small negative impact during construction has been far outweighed by the positive
impacts of clean water, given that some 80% of illness is generally attributed to consumption
of unsafe water. Use of deep wells mostly have been successful and most of the technology
appropriate. The project has also helped to improve the technical ability of government and
consultant staff.
Rates of Return
S.37. The appraisal recognized that the EIRR would be low, averaging + 4.4%. The actual
EIRR for 3 of the 12 WEs averaged + 1.24%, and for the 8 WEs it is - 2.97%. The other
WEs EIRR is too negative to be calculated. The FIRR during the appraisal was computed but
not given in the SAR. A recalculation of actual and appraisal rates indicates that PDAMs
Kabupaten Pasuruan, Kotamadya Pasuruan and Ponorogo, and BPAM Kediri are positive
while all were probably negative during the appraisal. For the actual FIRR all WEs are nega-
tive. Again the low tariffs is the major reason for this low financial ratio.
Poverty Alleviation
S.38. Quantifying the poor and the improvement to their life caused by this project are
difficult, but national studies indicate that poverty fell nationwide from 28.6% of the popula-
tion to 17.4% in the period 1980 to 1987. The largest reduction were in rural areas of Java,
but poverty in urban areas also decreased. One of the main reason given for this reduction is
the substantial investment in physical infrastructure, such as water supplies provided by this
project.
S.39. About 66% of planned public taps were constructed but more house connections were
installed because (i) even low income people favour the use of private connections whenever
possible (ii) public taps are more difficult to administer and (iii) the incidence of poor areas are
becoming less. These "pockets" of poverty are now the target of special programmes and even
some projects towns have already received assistance under these programmes.

PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY (Section 7)
S.40. Sustainability of project benefits has been secured by
(i) use of simple sources
(ii) provision of 0 & M equipment
(iii) cross-subsidization
(iv) revision of tariffs to achieve cost recovery
(v) establishment of PTU and PMDU, and
(vi) assistance to DGCK to develop training system
(vii) further review of same project town's needs under follow-on IUIDP projects.
S.41. Demand for piped water undoubtedly exists but it is influenced not only by costs but
also quality and reliability. These latters factors can be improved by various actions to (i)
improve levels of 0 & M, (ii) strengthening financial management of WEs through opera-
tional, and (iii) continued assistance to PTU and PMDUs.
PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS (Section 8)
Suppliers
S.42. All supplies for this type of project will probably be local companies, and although their
performance has be acceptable, experience indicates special attention should be given to M &
E contracts.
Contractors
S.43. Over 136 contracts were completed without default by 66 East Java contractors. Almost
all were small local contractors whose performance was related more to individual managers
than to results of prequalification examinations. These contractors performed acceptability,
with a number of factors being important (especially packaging and payment) in achieving this
result.
S.44. Overall the construction industry is still developing as evidenced by the heavy super-
vision needed during construction of the water towers Training of contractor staff is being
introduced into the sector and the legal and administrative framework for contractors
improved.
Consultants
S.45. Consultants played a significant role in the project with 34% the loan being disbursed
against 44 contracts. Man-month inputs and costs were:
Man-months                   Costs (US $ million)
Local       5192
Foreign      233
S.46. Project management consultants have been used continously since loan effectiveness.
The role of the local consultants has been dominant and a wide range of assistance given to the
PMU/PIU. Institutional development and preparation of future projects was undertaken using
associations of local and foreign consultants. Again the local role has increase over and a now
most often they are lead consultant in any association. Technology transfer could have been
better. Although the performance of consultants has been satisfactory and billing rates recently



- 42 -
increased to ensure talented consultants remain in the sector, reduced levels of their use is
desirable to lower costs. However continued growth will require their use in future projects
with much the same design as was applied to TA under this project.
PERFORMANCE OF BORROWER (Section 9)
PMU/PIU
S.47. Despite rapid growth in staff from about 60 in 1983 to 300 in 1980, the PMU/PIU have
taken on many new responsibilities and have discharged these soundly. Increased training of
project staff will be beneficial. Four senior member of the PMU/PIU staff have become project
managers in other provinces and those who remain provide a nucleus of key staff to "seed"
into larger future projects.
DAB
S.48. During the project central DAB sub-directorate concerned with the physical works have
generally had to shift from a role of direct involvement to one of providing guidance, coor-
dination and oversight. Performance in this new role has been good. On-going projects for
staff training and development along with the experience gained by staff under this project will
further improve performance in their new roles in both Jakarta and the provinces.
Provincial and Local Governrent
S.49. Both played useful roles but not as central as originally envisaged. However the
experience gained will be very useful for the up-coming role they will have under IUIDP. The
performance of WEs has been mixed, with BPAMs being better than PDAMs because PDAMs
tend to have of less well trained staff, and also for institutional reasons. PDAM performance
will be improved with PMDU support.
PERFORMANCE OF BANK (Section 10)
S.50. A number of missions in 1981 and 1992 brought this project quickly to appraisal.
Negotiation, signature and effectiveness were completed within 4 months. This achievement
was partly due to Bank staff ensuring issues did not become obstacles to progress, but were
nevertheless satisfactorily resolved.
S.51. Supervision missions were satisfactory with respect to timing and selection of disci-
plines. 14 staff were used on 20 missions. Their inputs have provided valuable guidance to
GOI. The contribution of RSI has been especially pleasing and expansion of RSI's role should
be considered.
PROJECT RELATIONSHIPS (Section 11)
S.52. Good working relationships maintained between all parties have contributed to the
project's successes with intelligent supervision minimizing the potential for conflict and
enabling fruitful dialogue to continue. Attention to ensuring aide-memoires remain widely
circulated would be beneficial while continued support from the Bank in coordinating other
bilateral/multilateral agencies is appreciated.



- 43 -
DOCUMENTATION (Section 12)
S.53. Simple loan covenants in the Loan Agreement have provided meaningful targets and a
means of supervision but the sections most commonly referred to are those relating to pro-
curement. Wherever possible these should be harmonized with GOI regulations.
S.54. The staff Appraisal Report (SAR) proved invaluable as a reference and 'control'
document throughout the project although sections on TA and costs could have been better.
S.55. WE monitoring indicators have also proved useful for supervision but their accuracy is
presently not good and action is being taken to improve it.
S.56. Documents for procurement of the works prepared under the detailed design assign-
ments could have been broken into more packages to facilitate the yearly procurement cycle.
Drawings capable of reduction to A3 size are also very useful to facilitate field supervision.
S.57. Data related to the project are not readily accessible. Improved areliving would provide
a stronger basis for a control system.
MAJOR LESSONS LEARNED (Section 13)
S.58. The lessons of experience from previous projects were all incorporated into this project
in some manner and all have been confirmed by the experiences of this project.
S.59. Elements of project design found to be useful were:
(i) the devolving of implementation responsibility to the province,
(ii) limiting the geographycal dispersion of sites,
(iii) preparation of detailed design almost coincidently with project preparation, and
(iv) using stockpiled material to commence physical work quickly.
S.60. From implementation, experience indicates:
(i)  larger work packages facilitated by larger budget allocation benefit the result,
(ii) not all people can be persuaded to take piped supplies of water,
(iii) improved access is important to ensuring demand,
(iv) difficulty in achieving public tap numbers illustrates the importance of accessibility
(v) including construction of connections under the project is very beneficial,
(vi) commissioning of works require careful allocation of resources, and
(vii) considerable TA is needed to prepare projects and are not easily estimated during
preparation of sector projects.
S.61. Technical aspects of project results offer the following lessons:
(i)  further demand for water exists in BNA towns,
(ii) chlorination of supplies is erratic and needs improvement,
(iii) reduction in UFW is difficult but is vital,
(iv) use off flow restrictors in IKK systems should be abandoned, and
(v) further investment in up-grading IKK system for example by installation of with
water meters should be studied.
S.62. Financial and institutional results show that
(i) cost recovery can be improved through tariff adjusmetment,
(ii) Kabupaten-wide PDAM's (with strengthening) are viable for East Java,



- 44 -
(iii) investment in training infrastructure should continue,
(iv) poverty alleviation strategies can be included though careful project design.
S.63. Sustained operation of project works will depend upon the WEs being helped by PMDU
and PTU to continue to provide a reliable service.
S.64. Mechanical and electrical supply contracts need special attention in any project.
S.65. The Bank's Staff Appraisal Report is widely referred to and should identify all compo-
nents as explicitly as possible. All other project documents should be archived in an easily
accessible centre which could form the basis of a "control system".
S.66. Part III contains statistical data in Tables while the Appendices contain concise back-
ground data from which the statistical data has been compiled. The appendices also contain
useful data on costs for each system and detailed reviews of the training component and the
impact of every consultant service contract.

Note:
1/ Category l(b) crated in 1996 to provide 100% financing (net of taxes) from the loan proceeds as a stop-gp mewre to nitiate th
i--pat of evere GOI FY86/87 budget deficiencies. This financing of the work assisted in ealy commiioning of a number of the
wshemes, and mainained the momentum of the project. The reallocated loan funds were mainly sourced from r vings from the balance
of disbumrnments under Category I(a) due to changes in the Rupiah to USS exchange ate nd use of some previously unallocated fonda.
a` The increase in Consultant services (Category 3) was due primarily to increaed allocation to future project prepartion activitie under
die project. This wu necessary because GOT funds have becomne increasingly redricted during the decade while the need to maintain
a pipeline of new projects remained.
