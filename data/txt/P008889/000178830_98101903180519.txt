INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMU4ENDATION OF TIHE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR AN INTENSIVE DAIRY PRODUCTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$h.5 million
to the Republic of Turkey.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The Government of Turkey has asked the Bank Group to finance
several interrelated livestock projects, all of which are part of a
program for livestock development in Turkey's Second Five-Year Plan
1968-72. The proposed Intensive Dairy Production project was the
first project to be ready for appraisal. A second livestock project is
being prepared. The proposed credit would be the twenty-first Bank/IDA
operation in Turkey and the fourth for agriculture, as IDA has already
extended two credits, and the Bank two loans, for irrigation in the
Seyhan area and for grain silos.
3.        The project was appraised in September/October 1969.   Nego-
tiations with representatives of the Government and the Agricultural
Bank of the Turkish Republic (ABT), started in Washington on May 19,
1970.  The Government was represented by Mr. Ahmet Tufan Gul, Economic
and Financial Counselor of the Turkish Embassy, Dlr. Orhan Ozdural,
Director General of Livestock Development Projects of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Mr. M. Peker of the State Planning Organization, Mr. Teoman
Koprululer, Financial Counselor of the Ehbassy, and Mr. Onur Gokce,
First Secretary of the Embassy. The ABT was represented by its Secre-
tary General, Mr. N. Parman. Negotiations were temporarily adjourned
on June 5, 1970, to enable the Turkish delegation to discuss several
outstanding issues in Ankara. The economic stabi].ization program
introduced by the Government on August 10, 1970, affected some of
the issues which further delayed the processing of the project.
Su`'sequently, discussions about the proposed credt continued
th::cough correspondence and missions to Ankara in Sewp-ember and in
Decam>er 1970. Final agreement on the credit eiccuTncnts was reached
in mid-January 1971.
4.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits to Turkey as at December 31, 1970:

5. -   Execution of most of the projects has been satisfactory.
Progress with on-farm development under the Seyhan Irtigation
Projects (Credits 38-TU and Loan/Credit 587/143-TU) had been
disappointing until 1967, but is now satisfactory. The excavation
work on the Second Cukurova Power Project (Credit 59-TU) was
originally substantially delayed because of hard rock formation,
but since 1969 progress has been satisfactory. It may be necessary
to postpone the closing date from June 30, 1971 to December 31, 1971.
The Third Cukurova Power Project (Loan 623-TU) has consequently
been delayed by one year and there have been cost overruns which
have, however, not materially affected the viability of the project.
The Bank is considering a supplementary loan to Cukurova Elektrik
to meet the cost overruns and to finance additional transmission
work. The coming into operation of the Bank Transmission Project
(Loan 568-TU) will be held up by delays which have occurred in the
building of the related Keban Power Project (not financed by the
Bank), but construction of the transmission lines is progressing
satisfactorily and most contracts have been awarded.
6.     Further projects in technical education, agriculture (fresh
fruits and vegetables, irrigation, livestock and forestry), power,
and industry (steel and fertilizer) are now under consideration.
7.     IFC carries in its portfolio investments in the Industrial
Devalopment Bank of Turkey (TSKB), Sentetik Iplik Fabrikalari (SIFAS)
(textiles), Viking KCagit ve Seluloz (paper mill), Anadolu Glass Co.,
(ACS) and NASAS Aluminium Co., and is prepared to finance industrial
projects and to take equity where appropriate. IFC has a number of
projects in various stages of analysis or discussion, including
soda ash, lead-zinc smelting, dairy, and alloy steel.

To cover the foreign exchange cost of
technical services, studies and traini.ng
abroad amounting to $0.6 million.



- 
Amortization:             In 50 years including a 10-year period

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.     A report entitled "Turkey - Appraisal of Intensive Dairy
Production Project" (PA-36a, dated January 26, 1971) is attached.
10.    Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic life of
Turkey and in any effort to further economic development. Although
Government expenditure for agriculture has substantially increased,
particularly for expansion of irrigation and increased availability
of inputs, the effects of adverse weather conditions, primitive tech-
nology and the under-utilization of agriculturas  resources continue
to be major constraints on development.
11.    The country has resources suitable for livestock production
and needs to increase the supply of fresh milk, milk products and
meat to a growing urban population. Demand for food is expected
to increase by about ) percent per annum as higher levels of income
are attained. Turkey exports live sheep and cattle and to a lesser
degree mutton and beef to its Mliddle Eastern neighbors and hopes
to develop meat exports to EEC countries. The growing tourism
trade also consumes beef and milk of the quality the proposed
project would supply. WThile this pilot project would ilot by itself
contribute significantly to export earnings, subsequent projects
would benefit from the experience gained and should contribute
substantially to foreign exchange revenues.



12.    The proposed project represents a first phase in the development
of modern dairy farming in Turkey and is centered around the four
main milk consuming areas -- Adana, Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir. The
project is designed to overcome traditional limitations of primitive
technology, especially in animal husbandry and forage production, and
the scarcity of long-term credit.   The total cost of the project would
be about $7.5 million, of which IDA would finance US$4.5 million.
Up to US$3.9 million would be relent to farmers, at 9 percent over
12 years, to finance the foreign exchange costs of dairy cattle,
essential farm machinery, tractors and seed under a four-year program
of lending through ABT for on-farm development of selected irrigated
commercial dairy farms. It is estimated that 250 to 300 farmers
would benefit from participation in the project.   This part of the
project would be governed by a Project Agreement between the Association
and ABT.
13.    ABT, the largest bank in Turkey, is a semi-autonomous Government-
owned statutory body, founded in 1863. Its purpose is to finance
agricultural, fishery and forestry production and marketing, and
allied activities, and as such it provides almost all the institutional
credit available to farmers. ABT has over 750 branches and holds
about 25 percent (about US$582 million) of all deposits in the banking
system. Assets on December 31, 1969 totaled TL 16,760 million
(US$1,120 mil'ion).  Though profit is not its primary objective, ABT
is administered as a profit-making institution, and all profits are
reinvested. In 196), ABT started a medium and long term credit scheme,
and in 1968, for larger loans, established a Development and Encourage-
ment Loans Division, which would be responsible for administering
credit under the Project.
1b.    The balance of the IDA credit, $0.6 million, would be used by
the Government to meet the foreign exchange expenditures on related
technical services, studies and training abroad. This part of the
project would be carried out by the newly established General Direc-
torate for Livestock Development Projects (IDPD) of the Ministry of
Agriculture with the assistance of two technical specialists provided
under the project.
15.    The text of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, wqhich governs the
relationship under the project between the Government and the ABT,
has been agreed upon during negotiations. The Government's contribution
towards the project would be about US$1.0 million equivalent in local
currency as capital to ABT and about US$D.b million equivalent in local
currency for technical services. Farmers would contribute 20 percent
of the cost of on-farm investments during the first three years, with
80 percent coming from ABT. Farmers would finance continued fodder
crop establisbment beyond the initial three-year development period,
which would increase their total contribution from 20 percent to
25 percent.

16.    Livestock would be purchased following the receipt of
quotations from at least three different countries, but farmers
would remain free to choose whichever source suited them best;
such importation would be free of any import taxes.  Farm aquip-
ment and machinery, of the types required for the project, are
not made in Turkey and would be imported in bulk on the basis of
international competitive bidding; the effective rate of import
duties would not exceed 20 percent ad valorem.  Agricultural
tractors would also be procured under international competitive
bidding and up to 15 percent domestic preference or the amount
of import taxes, whichever is lower, would be allowed local bidders
for purposes of bid comparison.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.    The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Turkey and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association and the Agricultural Bank of the Turkish Republic,
the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in 4rticle V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and
the text of a Resolution approving the credit are being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors.
18.    The relending to ABT under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
approved by the Association is provided for in Section b.02 of the
Development Credit Agreement.
PART V - THE ECONOIY
19.    A report entitled "The Development Prospects of Turkey"
(EMA-30a, dated February 1, 1971 which was recently distributed to
the Executive Directors describes Turkey's economic performance
and appraises the country's prospects. A basic data sheet is
attached.
20.    At the time of devaluation in August 1970, the Government
adopted a far-reaching stabilisation program which is intended to
lay the foundation for a new period of economic development leading
to external viability of the economy. However, the Goverrnment still
has some difficult problems to face. It is particularly important
to avoid any rapid price increases and to benefit as much as possible
from the opportunity to expand exports provided by the cbanges in
relative prices following devaluation. The disappointing balance
of payments position in 1968 and 1969 has made the authorities
extremely conscious of the need to increase the export orientation
of the economy. Intensive efforts are therefore being made to promote
exports and increase investment in export oriented activities. The
annual program for 1971 envisages an export increase of some 10 percent,
the increase being the heaviest in manufactured exports, and the
prospects for further growth of exports on this scale are good.



21.    Unfortunately, at this time there are large inc:eases in
salary costs to be met together with increased cost of imports
throughout the public sector. There are also difficul;ies in
adjusting the level and composition of public investmelt to
conform to ble new policGy F_4ATis. Budgetary management luring the
next 12 montts will therefore be especially important :.f Turkey
is to provid.i a suitable environment for building up e:xtports.
22.    Despise these problems, the short term managemenit of the
economy in 1970 has been good and there is every reasor to believe that
during the longer period 1971-77, Turkey can achieve a real growth
rate in exceiss of 7 percent per annum and still maintain a reasonable
degree of internal price stability.  The balance of payments never-
theless rermains vulnerable. Foreign exchange reserves are not suffi-
cient to tide the country over adverse developments in the balance
of payments due, for example, to adverse weather conditions. New
markets for exports of manufactured goods have yet to be established.
The present level of imports is low but in all these circumstances
further liberalization of impor-ts can only be undertaken slowly so
that ability to import essential goods is maintained.
23.    Turkey's needs for external assistance are likely to exceed
recent magnitude for some time, and moreover, Turkey is still facing
a heavy burden of external debt service and may have to accept further
debt on harder terms than in the past. Following successive debt
rescheduling and arrangements for debt relief Turkey's debt service
obligations in 1970 are likely to be about 19 percent of foreign
exchange earnings but are expected to drop to about 16 percent by
1977. In all these circumstances, wihilst Turkey has a margin for
borrowing on conventional terms ,its borrowing capacity will need to
be kept under continuing review and it should continue to seek as
much as possible of future external aid on concessionary terms.
In the light of these factors I consider that Turkey is eligible for
assistance from IDA.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREE*EIlT
2h.    I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECONNENDATION
25.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
