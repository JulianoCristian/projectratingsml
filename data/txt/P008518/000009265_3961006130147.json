The second component, institutional development,\n            includes assistance to the telecommunications operator\n            (Kyrgyz Telecom) to carry out institutional reforms. The\n            third component, sector restructuring, provides assistance\n            to the Ministry of Communications to carry out the reform\n            program and to train Ministry staff in regulation and policy formulation."}, "docdt": "1994-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
