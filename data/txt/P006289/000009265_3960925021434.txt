PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL -COPESUL PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT
(LOAN 1562-BR)
PREFACE
1.        The Bank approved a loan of US$85.0 million equivalent (Loan
1562-BR) in May 1978 to Companhia Petroquimica do Sul (COPESUL), guaranteed
by the Government of Brazil (GOB), to assist in the financing of the
Copesul Petrochemical Project. COPESUL, a public sector company, is
majority owned by the Government through PETROQUISA (68%) and FIBASE (301),
an equity financing arm of Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e
Social S.A. (BNDES). The remaining 2% of the shares is owned by the public
(para 2.08).
2.        The Project was part Gf the Brazilian Government's plans to
achieve self-sufficiency 'ln major petrochemical products, thereby improving
the country'S long-term balance of payments position, as well as
industrial decentralization by locating the Project in Porto Alegre, Rio
Grande do Sul, a relatively sparsely populated southern state away from the
industrially congested Sao Paulo region. The Project was the third major
integrated petrochemical complex, following the first complex near Sao
Paulo commissioned in 1972 and the second complex (COPENE) at Camacari in
the State of Bahia commissioned in 1978. The Project scope included
establishment of the core unit--the naphtha cracker--to produce olefinic
intermediates for downstream private sector companies manufacturing second
genera'ion petrochemicals, primarily plastics, and a utilities generation
center to support the core unit and the downstream units. The Bank loan
was fully disbursed by January 31, 1985.
3.        In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Depart-
ment (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. Copies of the
PCR were sent to the borrower. Their comments are reproduced as an
Attachment.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL -COPESUL PETROCHEMICATJ PROJECT
(LOAN 1562-BR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Project was part of the Brazilian Government's plan in the
1970s to expand petrochemical capacities in Brazil to meet the rapidly
growing domestic demand for petrochemical-based products. Despite the
adverse economic situation whichi has prevailed in Brazil since the early
1980s, the Project has been implemented successfully, and has been
operating above capacity utilization levels estimated at appraisal. The
successful implementation and commercial production is largely due to the
project entity's efficient management (para. 2.01).
2.        The Project scope has remained substantially unchanged except for
the construction of a 7.5 km canal linking the Project site to the Jacui
River, to ensure a more dependable and cheaper means for transporting coal
to the complex, as compared to the difficult overland hauling over swampy
terrain envisaged at appraisal. The caral construction has proven to be
extremely beneficial also for shipping out surplus liquid ethylene and
propylene not 'nvisaged earlier (para. 2.07).
3.        The Project was commi3sioned in December 1982, and on-
specification ethylene was produced within 15 days. This remarkable
performance was achieved through careful planning and implementation of
precommissioning activities and appropriate training of the operators. The
Project was commissioned about 11 months behind the appraisal estimate of
January 1982 partly due to a planned delay of about 6 months to allow
ethylene production from the core unit to be concurrently completed with
the downstream units. Unexpected poor demand for major petrochemicals,
coinciding with restrictions on foreign financing for the downstream units
in the wake of the recession whi,zh began in 1980, posed constra.nts on
these private sector investments. As a result, two of the originally
planned do'.nstream units were cancelled while the others were delayed.  The
residual delay of about 5 months is considered reasonable for a Project of
this size and complexity (paras. 3.02-3.08).
4.        The final Prolject cost of US$760 million equivalent is US$76
million (or 9.1%) below the appraisal estimate of US$836 million. The
savings were mainly derived from: (i) US$41 million lower than anticipated
price for the boilers and the steam system; (ii) lower international
inflation than forecast ac appraisal; (iii) more favorable prices for
services and other elements in the Project due to good procurement
practices; and (iv) smaller working capital requirements due to lower
input/output prices thar, appraisal estimates and changes in credit sales
policy (paras. 3.09-3.10).
5.        Commercial operations since commissioning have been excellent by
inJustry standards. Due to careful planning, commissioning of the various
units was successfully completed within two weeks instead of the



- VI -
anticipated six months. Capacity utilization during the first and second
years (1983 and 1984) waa at 732 and 852, respectively, compared to the
appraisal expectation of 50 and 752, During its third year (1985), the
company is expected to operate at full capacity. Glven the depressed
domestic demand for petrochemical products, the high capacity utilization
is the result of successful export promotion In a highly competitive
International market, and Is considered a remarkable achievement by
COPESUL's management. The complex, originally designed solely for the
domestic market, to now exporting to the US, Europe, Chile, Venezuela, and
South Korea (paras. 4.03-4.07).
6.        Although the company Is financially vlable, Its financial reaults
remain short of appraisal estimates mainly due to: (1) the depressed
market prices of petrocheuicils in both domestic and international markets;
(11) the sluggish local petTochemicals market; and (111) the delay In
Project completion. COPESUL has, however, met all the financial covenants
under the legal agreements, except for the quick ratio, This ratio would
also have been met fully, provided two extraordinary Items had been treited
on the same basis as applied at appraisal. Due to the lower-than-forecast
petrochemical prices, the Project's FRR is now 8.3%, 9.92 lower than the
18.22 estimated at appraisal. The ERR for the complex, Including
downstream units, is now calculated at 13.92, 5.62 lower than the appraisal
estimate of 19.52 (paras. 5.01-6.02).
7.        As part of the underdtandings reached during loan negotiations.
GOB had agreed to carry out a study on the Brazilian petrichemical market
and prices. The study is yet to be carried out, even though the breach of
this agreement was brought to the attention of GOB in the various Bank
supervision missions. COPESUT has recently agreed to appoint specialist
consultants to carry out the study by end 1985 (para. 7.01).

PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL -COPESUL PETROCHEKICAL PROJECT
(LOAN 1562-BR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In the late 1960., Brazil had no large integrated petrochemical
production capacity; nearly all of Ite requirements were imported. To
satisfy the country's rapidly growing demand, and following the example of
most large countries, the Government decided to develop a competitive
domestic petrochemical irndustry. In 1972, Brazil commissioned Its first
petrochemical complex, Petroquimica Uniao (PQU), with a capacity of 360,000
toinnes per year (tpy) ethylene and associated dewnstream units near Sao
Paulo. A second complex, COPENE, near Camacarl in Bahia State, with
raphtha cracking capacity to produce 380,000 tpy of ethylene, came on
atream in late 1978. Both units were of world-scale capacities exploiting
to the fullest the prevailing economies of scale. During the period of
rapid economic growth in Brazil in the 19109, the rapidly growing domestic
lemand for petrochemical consumer goods could not be fully met with
domestic production. By 1976, even before the second complex came on
stream, it was apparent that the resulting very large Import demand
provided further opportunities for efficient import substitution. gainst
this background, the Government of Brazil's development plans In the
mid-1970s included the establishment of a third petrochemical complex to
enable the country to achieve self-sufficiency in most petrochemical
products by the early 19809. To meet Irs other objective of dispersal of
industrial development away from the industrially congested Sao Paulo
region, GOB further decided that the third complex should be located in
Porto Alegre in the sparsely populated southern state of Rio Grande do
Sul. The Project, a naphtha cracking plant of 420,000 tpy ethylene
capacity ilus associated downstream units, was Initiated in mid-1978, and
completed in December 1982.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.   Project Origin. Preparation, Appraisal, Approval,
and Loan Effectiveness
2.01      As mentioned In para 1.01, the Project was part of GOB's
development plan to achieve self-sufficiency In petrochemical products
through efficient import substUtution. The Project was prepared by
COPESUL, a public sector company majority owned by the Government through
PETROQUISA (68%) and FIBASE (30%), the equity arm of the state-owned BNDES.
COPESUL was incorporated in June 1976 to own, implement, and operate the
Project, Brazil's third petrochemical complex. In November 1976 following
completion of basic engineering, the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) were requested for assistance in financing the
Project. Two Bank missions, one in January 1977, and the other In July
1977, visited Brazil to discuss and agree on the project concept, scope and



- 2 -
Bank role. A subsequent meeting in Washington In August 1977 between the
Bank, IDB and COPESUL agreed on issues critical to processing the Project,
particularly on cofinancing and procurement a:rangements. The Project was
appraised in September 1977 and January 1978, negotiated in April 1978, and
approved by the Board of the Bank for a loan of US$85 million in May 1978.
2.02      The Bank loan was made to COPESUL on repayment terms of 15.5
years, including 3 years of grace, at an annual interest rate of 1.5% and a
commitment fee of 3/4X per annum (p.a.), with the guarantee of the
Government of Brazil (GOB).
B.   Project Description and Objectives
2.03      The COPESUL Project was designed as an import-substitution
projec. to provide petrochemical intermediates to downstream petrochemical
plants for conversion into final petrochemical-based products. The Project
included: (1) the raw materials plant to furnish the intermediates such as
ethylene, propylene, butadiene and benzene to the downstream units;
(ii) the utilities plant to supply steam and treated water for the raw
materials plant and the downstream units; and (ili) storage and other
ancillary facilities and transportation systems. The core unit is the
naphtha cracker, where ethylene and its co-products are produced through
steam cracking of naphtha. It included facilities for separate ethylene,
propylene and other derivatives in a complex series of steps, i.e.,
compression, refrigeration, fractionation and heat recovery. The
technology was selected to enable a flexible range of product mixes by
varying the degree of cracking severity without significantly changing the
raw materials consumption.
2.04      The Project's production capacity under two severities is shown
below:

2.05      Straight-run naphtha, the main raw material for the Project, ts
supplied from the REFAP refinery via a 25 km pipeline. COPESUL produces as
by-products liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and pyrolysis gasoline which are
either used internally as fuel or returned to the REFAP refinery via a
pipeline. In case of interruptions in REFAP operations, naphtha from other
sources can be delivered to COPESUL through a pipeline from an adjacent
tecminal.
2.06      Steam for the raw materials and downstream plants is produced in
three large boilers using locally available low-grade coal (47X to 502 ash
content) from nearby mines. The boilers can also use fuel oil if coal
supplies are inadequate. Private coal mining capacity in the area has been
expanded to provide the requirements of COPESUL and of other users.
Infrastructure facilities include water supply system, sewage treatment, a
river jetty, and road and rail extensions to the site. The Project draws
its water requirement from the nearby Cai river, and includes the necessary
water treatment and demineralization facilities for utility and process
requirements. Two 15 MW turbogenerators provide power for critical
operations (18 MW out of 24MW total demand) which require sustained high
quality power supply.
C. Project Scope Ravision
2.07      The Project scope underwent no significant changes either in the
main COPESUL process facilities or in the utility plants. The only
significant scope change was the construction of the Santa Clara
Channel and Terminal, 7.5 km long and 9 meters wide, connecting the Jacui
river to the Project site to facilitate transport of raw materials and
products. Implementation of two of the seven downstream units originally
envisaged--the styrene and propylene glycol unit and the polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) plant--was delayed several times and finally cancelled in 1982 due to
depressed domestic demand for their final products and financing
difficulties resulting from restrictions in the wake of the Brazilian
recession. As a result, COPESUL has to sell more of its surplus products
otitside the complex to companies manufacturing downstream products in the
Sao Paulo area as well as overseas.
2.08      The structure of COPESUL's ownership also turned out different
from that originally envisaged at appraisal. At its incorporation, 51% of
equity was planned to be contributed by PETROQUISA, and the remaining
portion (49%), by FIBASE, an equity financing arm of BNDES. FIBASE
was unable to fully meet its commitments of equity participation in the
course of Project implementation due to financial constraints; PETROQUISA
therefore increased its share to 68%, resulting in a drop of FIBASE's share
down to 30%. Minority share of 2% is currently owned by the public.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The Project has achieved most of its original objectives, the
key ones of which were to:



- 4 -
(a)  establish an efficient and compotitive petrochemical complex
to help meet the then rapidly growing demand for
petrochemicals;
(b)  utilize the local expertise obtained from the previous two
complexes in the Implementation of the Project to the
maximum extent possible;
(c) absorb modern technology from foreign firms involved in the
Project to improve efficiency of the Brazilian petrochemical
industry; and
(d)  locate a major industrial complex in the sparsely populated
southern state of Rio Grande do Sul.
3.02      Since mechanical completion in November 1982 and comissioning in
December 1982, the COPESUL facilities have been in satisfactory operation
for 29 months to date. The production achieved during the initial two
years of operations, was as follows:

B.   Project Management
3.03      Project management was drawn from COPESUL's own staff, plus
experienced personnel from PETROBRAS, PETROQUISA, and COPENE. Most of the
key and senior stiff had previous experience in managing and operating
similar projects. The Project management during construction was
coordinated by the Superintendent with two groups that carried out
different project-related tasks: a Project Director responsible for
engineering, procurement, and pre-operation management; and a Construction



- 5 -
Director responsible for all activities related to foundations, buildings
and plant erection. As construction neared completion, organizational
arrangements were changed, as necessary, to create manaheaent units for
production and marketing, and necessary operations staff wera additionally
hired according to a well-prepared project administration and planning
schem. Currently, COPESUL is managed along four functional lines: a
Production Director responsible for production management and technical
development; a Marketing Director for sales and marketing development; a
Finance Director for accounting and financial management; and a Manager for
personnel and administration. The overall project management was carried
out in a very competent and professional manner, primarily due to excellent
staffing and planning. It also reflects the high degree of autonomy
enjoyed by COPESUL's management. The current organization of the company
is presented in Annex 3-1.
C. Training
3.04      COPESUL planned and implemented a satisfactory training program,
covering 186 professional engineers and 4,936 technicians during
1977-1982. The training areas included plant operationu, maintenance,
construction, analytical control, inspection, and plastics conversion. The
program included both classroom training as well as on-the-job training in
operating petrocheamcial complexes in Brazil. The success of the extensive
training program is reflected in the smooth commissioning and efficient
operation of the facilities.
D.   Use and Performance of Engineering Contractors and Consultants
3.05      COPESUL drew fully from previous experience in the implementation
of the two earlier petrochemical complexes. For engineering services
related to the basic design, installation, and start-up of the Project,
COPESUL contracted with a consortium of two foreign engineering firms
specializing in petrochemical technology, with worldwide project
experience. In addition to the technology for naphtha cracker provided by
the consortium, additional licensing of technology was obtained from
several foreign firms for the following complementary processes:
Ci) extraction of butadiene; (ii) hydrogenation of pyrolysis gasoline;
(iii) extraction of aromatics; and (iv) hydrodealkylation of toluene.
Detailed engineering for all the facilities required for the Project was
subcontracted to local engineering firms. Procurement services were also
obtained from the consortium and its subcontractors. Generally, the
quality of technology transferred and the overall performance of
contractors, both foreign and local, was satisfactory.
E.   Transfer of Technology
3.06      The Project has been implemented with substantial involvement of
Brazilian institutions. As mentioned in the above paragraph, using
know-how and basic designs ootained from the process licensors, the
detailed engineering was carried out by local engineering firms under the
supervisil)n of a consortium of foreign technology firms. The consortium
undertook, as required by the engineering contract, measures to transfer



- 6 -
technology to Brazil for design, construction, and local operatian of
complete ethylene plants by: (1) training of PETROBRAS and engineering
company personnel; (ii) transferring of technical documentation; and
(iii) provision of technical advisory services. The related Brazilian
entities (including COPESUL) absorbed very effectively the technology,
acquired capability in ethylene plants and integrated petrochemical
complexes, and increased the level of Brazilian equipment supplies.
Therefore, the responsibility for Project implementation could be
transferred to the COPESUL project team early in project implementation.
The licensors and engineering firms who provided services came from the US,
France, Japan and Brazil.
F.   Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.07      The Bank's procurement guidelines were followed with no
significant problems impacting on Project implementation. For the Project
components procured following international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures, COPESUL obtained adequate international competition and
contracts were awarded for technically acceptable supplies at competitive
prices. The countries of orIgin of the suppliers for equipment, materials,
spares and services financed by the Bank are shown in Annex 3-2.
G. Implementation Schedule
3.08      The Project was originally scheduled to be completed mechanically
by July 1981 and commissioned by January 1982. Mechanical completion of
the Project could only be achieved by November 1982 but the Project's
successful commissioning was, however, achieved in two weeks from
mechanical completion instead of the anticipated six months. The Project
delays were mainly due to delays in the implementation of downstream
units. As a consequence, COPESUL deliberately slipped the Project schedule
in order tc have the naphtha cracker concurrently completed with the
downstream facilities. The actual schedule and the original estimates are
presented in Annex 3-3.
H.   Project Cost
3.09      The Project was completed at a total cost of US$760 million
equivalent, US$76 million or 9.1% below the appraisal estimate of US$836
million. The following table compares the appraisal capital cost estimates
with the actual costs:

The major cost differences were due to the following factors:
(a)  the boiler and steam systems were procured for US$43 million
instead of the appraisal estimate of US$84 million;
(b)  actual erection services and the foreign costs of some
equipment were less than anti:lpated at appraisal due to
efficient procurement practices adopted;
(c)  actual world inflation rates during the Project
implementation period were lower than the projected rates
used for the appraisal estimates;
(d)  working capital requirements were overestimated at appraisal
mainly due to assumptions on prices and credit sales policy
of COPESUL;
(e)  the decision to construct the Santa Clara Canal--not
originally envisaged--increased the project cost by US$15
million; and
(f)  the actual costs for civil works and buildings were higher
than in the appraisal estimates partly due to delays in
project completion; however, these were slightly offset by
savings in land acquisition and site preparation.

I.   Financing
3.10      In view of the lower Project costs, the share of equity
contribution to the Project financing requirements increased by about 42,
thereby reducing the borrowing requirements. The Project financing plan
envisaged at appraisal is compared with that realized as shown below:

3.11      The major differences between the original and the actual
financing plan are due to: (i) reduced overall financing requirements due
to lower Project costs; (ii) the resulting larger share of equity funding;
(iii) lower local costs expressed in US dollars due to the faster
devaluation of the local currency; (iv) reduced foreign currency debt
financing (mainly from the IDB loan, and French bilateral credit) to
reflect the cost underrun; and (v) increased commercial borrowing arranged
by Bank of America at favorable Eurodollar credit terms.
J.   Disbursement of Bank Loan
.3.12      The Bank loan for the Project was fully disbursed by January 31,
1985. The estimated and actual disbursement schedule for the Bank loan is

Major slippages in disbursements were due to delays In Project implementa-
tion, as discussed in pa-a 3.08, and legs in submission of disbursement
applications after 1982.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A.   Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      As mentioned earlier, the Project facilities were commissioned in
December 1982, about 11 months behind schedule. Mechanical completion was
achieved 16 months behind schedule, as shown in key project data, but about
five months of the delay could be recovered by overlapping the initial
testing and commissioning with the final stages of construction. The
smooth commissioning of the Project is attributable to: (i) competent
management; (ii) well-trained manpower; and (iII) adequate arrangements for
supply of raw materials and utilities.
4.02      All the downstream units, except the two which were not
implemented, were also commissioned. As summarized below, three downstream
units were commissioned at about the same time as COPESUL, and two other
units were cooiissioned about two years later:
(a)  The high-density polyethylene (HDPE) unit of POLISUL was
started up in December 1982, and went into commercial
operation in January 1983;
(b)  The low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit of POLIOLEFINAS had
a trial start-up in 1982, and its actual start-up took place
in January 1983;
(c)  The polypropylene (PP) unit of PPH was mechanically
completed in December 1982, and commissioned in January
1983;

(d)  The 100,000 tpy low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit of
TRIUNFO started operations in March 1985; and
(e)  PETROFLEX's ethyl benzene (EB) plant started operations in
September 1984 and its styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) plant
was started up in the first quarter of 1985.
B.   Build-up of Production
4.03      During the first (1983) and second (1984) full years of
operation, COPESUL performed well, achieving production levels better than
the appraisal estimates which were based on performance normally achieved
in such plants in initial years. COPESUL achieved 73% capacity utilization
in the first year, and 85% in the second year. In 1985, the third year of
operation, COPESUL expects to achieve full capacity utilization one year
a;iead of the SAR estimates which had envisaged full production only from
the fourth year of operations.

C.   Market Development
4.04      Despite operational constraints on the sales side due to
cancellation of the two downstream units and partly due to delays in
commissioning of the other two units, COPESUL was able to build up
production smoothly through its effective efforts to develop outside
complex sales, including exports. In 1983, COPESUL's outside-complex sales
were 463,000 tonnes of basic petrochemicals, including 142,000 tonnes of
ethylene, accounting for 69% of its total basic petrochemicals production
and 46% of ethylene production. In 1984, 45% of basic petrochemicals
production and 28% of ethylene production were sold outside the complex.
COPESUL's ability to sell its excess production has been significantly
enhanced by: (i) the construction of the Santa Clara Channel and Shipping
Terminal; (ii) additional shipping tankage, and (iii) acquisition/conver-
sion of mediur-size tankers for transport of liquid product to Porto Alegre

harbor. At full production of the complex's downstream units from 1986
onwards, outside-complex sale requirements will be 33% of COPESUL's basic
petrochemicals production and 11% of ethylene production. In order to
consolidate its sales and operational bane, COPESUL is currently
investigating possibilities of establishing naw downstream units within the
complex based on excess production of olefins and aromatics from its core
unit.
4.05       As was mentioned earlier, the Brazilian market for thermoplastics
suffered serious setbacks in the early 1980s due to the country's economic
recession. As a result, the apparent domestic consumption (domestic
production plus imports minus exports) of the five major thermoplastics
(LDPE, HDPE, PP, PVC, and PS) declined from 1,042 million tonnes in 1980 to
0.924 million tonnes in 1984--an annual decline on the average of about
3%--as sharply contrasted with the high consumption growth rate of 18.6%
during 1970-1980 as detailed in Annex 4-1. The resulting differences
between the actual demand for thermoplastics, and the appraisal estimates
are summarized below.

4.06      As may be seen, the consumption of thermoplastics rose rapidly at
12.2% p.a. during 1976-80--almost in line with appraisal estimates.
However, due to the economic recession experienced by Brazil in the early
1980s, consumption dropped dramatically by 28% in a single year from 1.04
million tonnes in 1980 to 0.75 million tonnes in 1981. The local market
has, however, started to show signs of recovery recently.



-  12  -
4.07      As a result of the decline in domestic demand, all of Brazil's
three petrochemical complexes have been pursuing export markets. Brazil's
net exports of petrochemical products increased sharply from a very low
level of 31,000 tonnes in 1980 to 447,000 tonnes in 1984. Despite the
depressed world market for petrochemical products, COPESUL has successfully
marketed its surplus products internationally through aggressive marketing
efforts. Countries importing COPESUL's products included USA, Chile,
Venezuela, South Korea, and West European countries. Recent external trade
of the five major thermoplastics are presented below:

V.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Financial Rate of Return
5.01      Key assumptions and parameters updated in calculating the
financial rate of return (FRR) are as follows: (i) actual capital costs
were used; (ii) the production level took into account COPESUL's actual
production since commissioning; however, future capacity utilization is
assumed to be the same as appraisal estimates; (iii) the current market
price structure was used, and it is assumed to persist In the future; and
(iv) the surplus production of COPESUL is assumed to be exported at border
prices, and the size of exports is based on the nation's projected
petrochemical product balance.
5.02      Under these updated parameters for the Project, its financial
rate of return (FRR) is now estimated at 8.3% before taxes in constant
terms (Annex 5-1), 9.9% lower than the appraisal estimate of 18.2%. The
difference in the FRR is due to: (i) unfavorable developments in the
relative price structure of naphtha and petrochemicals which has reduced
the Project FRR by 8.4%; (ii) delay in Project completion which reduced the
FRR by 2.4%; (iii) the depressed local demand necessitating a portion of
the output to be exported causing a 0.9% drop in the FRR; and (iv) the cu.st
underrun which increased the FRR by 1.8%.

5.04      With start of commercial operations in December 1982, the company
moved to normal financial and operational conditions smoothly. In the
first and second years of commercial operations COPESUL achieved
satisfactory financial performance. The company realized operating incomes
of Cr$17 billion for 1983 and Cr$ 29 billion for 1984, although net income
was negative for both years due to )'eavy interest expenses normal in the
initial years for capital-intensive ventures of this type.  Debts were
fully serviced from internal cash generation with a debt service coverage
ratio of about 1.9; the current ratio reached a relatively satisfactory
level by 1984; and the debt/equity ratio continued to improve (partly due
to debt conversion into equity), and is at present 36/64, better than the
industry average level of 60/40.

5.06      The differences between the appraisal projections and the actuals
have arisen from three major factors.  Firstly, domestic demand remained
lower than the appraisal forecast, and, as a result, surplus products had
to be exported at lower prices. Secondly, due to the very depreased world
market conditions, petrochemical product prices in both local and
international markets have been about 35-40% lower than appraisal forecast
prices, resulting in substantially reduced revenues. More importantly, the
price ratio of petrochemicals to feedstock (naphtha) declined
substantially, thus squeezing margins of the intermediate producers. At
the time of planning for the Project, naphtha was the most economic
feedstock for petrochemicals. However, with the shift since then to
cheaper natural gas feedstock, naphtha has increasingly become an exoensive
raw material and, as a consequence, naphtha/product price ratios have
declined in the international market. This price relationship has also
been reflected in the local market price structure, reducing the company's
profitability substantially. The price ratios of major intermediates to
naphtha estimated at appraisal are compared on the following page with the
actuals for December 1984:

5.07      The third reason for the difference between the financial
performance forecast at appraisal and the lower actual results is the
11-month delay in Project completion.
C.   Financial Covenants
5.08      To build up and maintain sound financial practices for COPESUL,
the Project loan egreement included several financial covenants, which
required the Borrower to:
(a)  maintain a ratio of liquid assets to current liabilities (quick
ratio) of not less than 1:1 on completion of the Project and
thereafter (Section 5.04 (b));
(b)  maintain a debt/equity ratio not greater than 70:30 before
Project completion date and not greater than 60:40 thereafter
(Section 5.04(c));
(c)   maintain its projected debt service coverage ratio over 1.5
(Section 5.03 (d)).
5.09      Except for the quick ratio covenant which COPESUJL could not
comply with, the other financial covenants have been met satisfactorily.
The company's 1984 debt/equity ratio of 36:64 was better than the
stipulated level. Debt service coverage ratio has been maintained at 1.9.
5.10      Despite COPESUL's sound financial situation over the past two
years, the quick ratio, 0.7 for 1983 and 0.8 for 1984, was lower than the
required ratio of 1.0 for the following reasons: (1) as of December 1983, a
substantial amount of equity contribution from the parent company was kept
in the form of short-term loans before its formal conversion in the
following year; and (ii) in September 1984, the Central Bank of Brazil



- 16 -
changed its regulation on the withdrawing conditions of foreign exchange
deposits, and consequently, about US$20 million deposits of foreign
exchange with the Central Bank have been reclassified from current assets
to deductions from COPESUL's long-teru liabilities. Had these two items
been treated otherwise, COPESUL would have been in full compliance with the
covenanted ratio for both years. The independent auditor officially
informed COPESUL's creditors of the above actions in the opinion to the
audited financial statements for those years.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A.   Economlc Rate of Return
6.01      Based on actual investment costs and other updated assumptions,
the Project economic rate of return (ERR) has been calculated as presented
in Annex 6-1. Key updated key assumptions were the following: (i) border
prices of inputs and outputs were adjusted on the basis of latest price
projections; (it) surplus products were assumed to be exported, while at
appraisal total production was originally assumed to be absorbed fully in
the domestic market; (iii) increased sales of intermediate petrochemicals
resulted from the cancellation of two downstream units; and (iv) the local
currency costs were converted to US dollars with a premium of 20% over the
official exchange rate of the Cruzeiro against 25% used at appraisal. For
calculating the ERR, financial costs and benefits have been converted into
economic cost and benefit streams in 1984 US dollars excluding taxes,
duties, interest and other transfer payments. Details of the economic
costs and benefits are presented in Annex 6-2. The ERR was calculated for
the entire complex, including downstream units as was done at appraisal.
6.02      The updated ERR for the complex is 13.92 compared to the
appraisal estimate of 19.5%. The decline in ERR in spite of the lower
capital costs and better performance during the initial years of operations
is due to the following: (i) updated assumptions on the projected prices
for inputs and outputs reduced the ERR for the complex by 3.12;
(ii) reduced local demand for thermoplastics resulted in export of the
surplus output, and thus lower economic value of the exported portion of
the output which decreased the ERR by 1.6%; (iii) the delay in Project
implementation caused a drop of 2.82; and (iv) the cost underrun increased
the Project ERR by 1.9%.
B.   Environmental Aspects
6.03      The COPESUL Project has been implemented in conformity with
environmental star ards agreed with the Bank. The measures taken under the
Project include: (i) adjustments on the balance of steam for the removal
of dispersions to the atmosphere; (ii) estabtishment of air pollution
monitoring system; and (iii) installation of liquid effluents treatment and
monitoring system. These features incorporated in the plant design for
reduction of noxious emissions, as well as treatment of potentially



-  17  -
polluting effluents, conform to the latest standards for petrochemical
plants.
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01      At various stages of the Project cycle, good working relation-
ships were established between the Bank, COPESUL and IDB. During Project
preparation and appraisal, the Bank reviewed the COPESUL Project, and
closely monitored the plans for downstream units so that the implementation
of the entire complex could be coordinated in a timely manner. The Bank
also worked out prolect financing arrangements together with COPESUL, and
helped COPESUL sort out procurement problems arising from cofinancing with
a large number of financiers. During supervision, various problems In
relation to the declining market situation and delays In the Initiation of
the downstream units were identified and recommendations were conveyed to
COPESUL. The Bank had also followed up the implementation of a study on
'the Brazilian petrochemical market and prices", which was agreed on as
part of the understandings reached during loan negotiations, but is yet to
be carried out. This issue was consistently brought to the attention of
GOB in the various Bank supervision missions. Ultimately, COPESUL has
recently appointed specialist consultants to carry out the study by end
1985.
VIII. LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      The Project was successfully implemented and completed in an
efficient manner mainly because most of the key and senior staff involved
in the Project are capable and had previous experience in managing and
operating similar projects. Their previous experience allowed them to
maximize foreign consultants' contribution to Project implementation. The
successful completion of the Pro4ect confirms what has been observed In
other successful Bank projects--that local expertise previously obtained
from similar projects is a key element in the successful implementation of
new projects.
8.02      Although the Project has been successfully implemented and
completed in terms of technical, institutional, and financial arrangements,
an important lesson that has been learned is that unforeseen adverse
economic developments such as prolonged world recession and adverse
economic conditions make it difficult for a Project to achieve the economic
benefits anticipated during appraisal. Such developments may fall outside
the normal risks inherent in a given project at the time of appraisal.
When such unforeseen project risks are perceived, the best that can be done
is consider alternative options, and to respond quickly. COPESUL managed
the impact of adverse market conditions extremely well by: (a) closely
monitoring the schedules of the downstreas units; (b) delaying the core
of the complex to match its completion with downstream units; and
(c) aggressively developing outside-complex sales, including exports.



- 18 -
8.03      The COPESUL Project has also indicated the need for conservative
capitalization plan for new companies. Adverse economic conditions may
entail shareholders' difficulties in honoring their equity contribution
commitments made at appraisal. In the case of the COPESUL Project, as
FIBASE, the equity financing arm of BNDES, could not fully contribute its
commitment, PETROQUISA took over the uncontributed portion. However, the
implementation of the Project could have been severely jeopardized if
PETROQUISA was not in a position to extract additional funds for equity
contribution. In this regard, a rather conservative approach should be
made towards the capitalization plan of new companies at the appraisal
stage to allow room for adjustments to adverse financial and economic
conditions during implementation.

Key As"sumptions Underlying FRR Calculations
1.        General.  The streams of benefits and costs were calculated for
the COPESUL Project only. All prices are expressed in 1984 dollars unless
otherwise mentioned.
2.         Capital Costs.  Capital costs have been derived from installed
costs after inflation adjustments as follows.

a/   This factor was derived from local inflation, world inflation, and
foreign exchange rates.
b/   Based on MUV index.
3.        Working Capital.  The working capital requirements took into
account the result of actual operations. These requirements are based on:
(a) 5-day naphtha requirements for work-in-process; (b) one-month inventory
of other major inputs; (c) 10-day inventories of finished products; and (d)
additional requirements for credit transactions of inputs and outputs.
4.         Production and Sales.  Future production levels are assumed to be
the same as appraisal estimates.  However, while at appraisal total
production was assumed to be absorbed fully in the domestic market, a part
of production is assumed to be exported due to the smaller projected local
demand. Over the period 1985-94, sales of COPESUL's major products are
assumed as follows:

5.        Prices of Inputs and Outputs.  The prices for inputs and outputs
are based on the present price structure, and the existing price
relationship between inputs and outputs is assumed to persist in the
future. The assumed prices for major inputs and outputs over the 1985-94
period are shown below:
