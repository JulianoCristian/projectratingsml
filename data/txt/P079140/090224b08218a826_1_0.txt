                         The development objective of the proposed project is to increase, in a sustainable manner, the level of involvement of targeted communities in their local development
                         through increasing oil palm revenue and local participation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project will only partially meet its development objective by the closing date of December 31, 2013. The scope of the Project was significantly scaled back and the completion
                         date was extended by one year during the restructuring of the Project in June 2012.The restructuring was required as a result of long delays in implementation and limitations
                         surrounding OPIC's capacity to implement the Project.

                         Many of the project targets have been met and exceeded. Smallholder income increased from K75.1 million in July 2006 to K204 million in September 2012, compared to the end

                         target of K96 million. While some of this increase was due to favorable price, the improvement to smallholder incomes was also due to the infill program and improved extension
                         support. Smallholder yields have increased by 25.7 percent, which surpasses the 15 percent target for the project. Hundred percent of the targets for road rehabilitation and
                         upgrades have been met (190 km); however, some of the rehabilitated roads were of a lesser quality (compared to initial design) due to increased rehabilitation costs. While there has
                         been good progress with roads and other works, achievements under the infill planting program fell short of the revised 2,500 ha target, with only a total of 1,140 ha planted (about

                         The Road Maintenance Trust Fund study has been completed. Any new road maintenance arrangements emerging from this study is expected to be implemented following the
                         Project completion. The Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) Price formula review is underway, with the first report issued in December 2013. The study will continue after the Project closes on
                         December 31, 2013, and OPIC has made arrangements with the Institute of National Affairs (INA) which will ensure quality control over this complex study.
