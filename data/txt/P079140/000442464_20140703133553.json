"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Smallholder Agriculture\n            Development Project (SADP) for Papua New Guinea were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: project\n            preparation and implementation demonstrate that development\n            of an effective communication and outreach strategy can help\n            generate awareness and participation at the community level,\n            which will help farmers understand the benefits of a project\n            such as SADP and not be misguided by external influences.\n            For extreme fluctuations, mitigation measures can be as\n            simple as properly calibrating communication around project\n            activities so as to effectively manage expectations. Where\n            roads within a network are prioritized for improvement, the\n            prioritization process needs to be very carefully managed to\n            maintain transparency and objectivity. Oil palm areas are\n            generally very flat and the roads are usually constructed at\n            ground level, so there is little opportunity to divert\n            surface water away from the road reserve, and in these\n            circumstances shallow longitudinal side drains quickly silt.\n            It is therefore critical to provide a good cross-sectional\n            shape with a minimum 5 percent camber, and the road pavement\n            sufficiently elevated above the side drains to avoid\n            waterlogging. Screened gravel has to be used but should meet\n            the specification and be within an acceptable grading\n            envelope, which requires mechanical screening."}, "docdt": "2014-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
