                         through increasing oil palm revenue and local participation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Upgrading of 189 kilometers of roads is now underway, which will improve smallholders' ability to transport harvested oil palm bunches to the palm oil mills, while infill planting
                         financed by the project will eventually increase harvested yields. A number of key studies (design of a road maintenance trust fund, environmental and social audits, effluent baseline
                         and audits) are also being carried out to help in the development of policies and strategies aimed at improving efficiency, sustainability, and environmental and social outcomes in the
                         palm oil sector. As of 31 December 2012, spot repairs and drainage work had been completed on 55 km of roads and 742 hectares of infill planting had been completed.
