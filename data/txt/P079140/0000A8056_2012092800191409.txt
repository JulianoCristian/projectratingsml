                         The development objective of the proposed project is to increase, in a sustainable manner, the level of involvement of targeted communities in their local development
                         through increasing oil palm revenue and local participation.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation has improved during the past six months, but the project is still making up ground after a very slow start-up and some unexpected hurdles in its first years. The
                         summary ratings may be upgraded based on the findings of the upcoming supervision mission. The first phase of road upgrading work in one area is almost complete, smallholders
                         have begun in-fill planting of oil palm, and more than 300 farmers have been trained in sustainable production practices. If progress continues to improve, these measures are
                         expected to reduce losses and increase both yields and incomes for smallholders in the project area.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured in June 2012 to drop Component 2 (Local Governance and Community Participation), redistribute financing from that component to other activities,
                         reduce the scale of road work and infill planting, and extend the closing date by one year. The next implementation support mission is planned for November 2012.
