On December\n            17, 2009, the Inspection Panel registered a Request for\n            Inspection for the Smallholder Agriculture Development\n            Project (SADP) for Papua New Guinea. The Board of Executive\n            Directors on March 25, 2010 approved the Inspection Panel\u2019s\n            recommendation to carry out an investigation of the alleged\n            instances of harm fromnoncompliance. On September 19, 2011,\n            the Panel issued its Investigation Report outlining\n            thefindings of the investigation to the Board. On October\n            31, 2011 Bank Management submitted itsResponse along with a\n            detailed Management Action Plan (MAP), in response to the\n            Panel\u2019sfindings. The MAP committed to actions in three key\n            areas (a) information disclosure,consultation and broad\n            community support; (b) environment; and (c) institutional\n            sustainability. Management appreciated the Panel\u2019s finding\n            of broad concurrence with Bank policiesand procedures\n            applicable to the Project and further noted the Panel\u2019s\n            conclusion that the Projectis an effective response to\n            poverty reduction, and that the Project as designed includes\n            provisionsto avoid conversion or degradation of critical\n            forest areas and habitats.
