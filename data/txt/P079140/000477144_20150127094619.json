The\n            Management Action Plan (MAP) committed to actions in three\n            key areas (a) information disclosure, consultation and broad\n            community support; (b) environment; and (c) institutional\n            sustainability. (Development and Implementation of a\n            Consultation Framework). In the first progress report, it\n            was reported that OPIC prepared a Consultation Framework and\n            has been implementing the framework for all major Project\n            activities, such as the infill planting and road works. The\n            framework was also used to collect views of farmers and\n            milling companies on the conditions under which an RMTF\n            could be set up and operationalized in a sustainable manner.\n            Additional infill planting activities conducted since the\n            first progress report have continued to use the framework.\n            (Documentation of Consultations) OPIC has continued to\n            support smallholder farmers and held consultations as part\n            of the infill program. The quality of the documentation has\n            also continued to improve, and the continued use of\n            plantation approval forms by OPIC field offices is\n            encouraging. The sustainability of these achievements will\n            depend on improved overall management of OPIC and stronger\n            oversight from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock\n            (DAL). (Road Maintenance Trust Fund Consultations (RMTF)\n            Consultations) The study proposed that the Government of\n            Papua New Guinea (GoPNG) contribute the full cost of the\n            one-time road rehabilitation (PGK60 million) and 80 percent\n            of the annual maintenance cost of PGK50 million. The\n            remaining 20 percent would be covered by the mills (15\n            percent) and the growers (5 percent). (Institutionalizing\n            the Road Maintenance Trust Fund) There is a need to\n            institutionalize the RMTF. Without this, there is a\n            potential risk that the pickup and transport of FFB to the\n            mills will be affected. The interim arrangement to purchase\n            one grader for each of the Project areas is useful."}, "docdt": "2014-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
