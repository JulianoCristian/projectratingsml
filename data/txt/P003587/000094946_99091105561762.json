IDA performance is rated satisfactory and Borrower\n            performance is rated as highly satisfactory. Five key\n            lessons from this project have been taken into consideration\n            by follow-on projects. First, long-term loans to poor\n            villages can complement village resources to sustainably and\n            significantly improve water supply. The project demonstrates\n            that government capital subsidies can be substantially lower\n            than typically argued for when discussing improved rural\n            water for the poor. Second, demand for improved latrines is\n            correlated with higher income levels, and, in contrast to\n            improved water supply, the income levels of the rural poor\n            in this project were too low to support the latrine\n            improvement strategy. Third, investing in model villages is\n            not a successful strategy for yielding demonstration effects\n            when the external government financing needed to construct\n            the model is unavailable to other villages seeking to\n            replicate the model. Fourth, training of water plant\n            managers, operators, and accountants is critical to the\n            sustainability of the water plant subprojects and Credit\n            proceeds should be made available to ensure that adequate\n            training occurs. Fifth, in order to increase the acceptance\n            of health messages and encourage behavior modification,\n            inhibitors to improving practice must be identified and the\n            health education program refined accordingly."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
