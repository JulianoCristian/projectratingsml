             HOUSING SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN

I.     Introductory Statement

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to restructure the
Brazil Housing Sector Technical Assistance Loan (Loan No.7338) (the Project) and
proceed with the amendment of the Loan Agreement entered into between the Federative
Republic of Brazil (the Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (the Bank) dated September 21, 2006. The proposed restructuring is aimed
at adjusting Project objectives and activities with the current priorities of the Borrower
and reflect a reduced loan amount.

2.      The proposed restructuring includes the following: (i) revision of the Project
Development Objective (PDO); (ii) elimination of a component on Housing Finance
Market Development; (iii) restructuring of the remaining three components into two
components; (iv) revision of the Monitoring Indicators to reflect the changes to the
Project components; and (v) introduction of Single Source Selection among the Particular
Methods of Procurement of Consultants' Services to be used in the project.

3.      Recognizing the need to reduce the scope of the Project and realign its activities
to reflect the shift in Government priorities, in March 30, 2009, the Borrower notified of
a cancellation of US$ 2.7 million of the original loan amount of US$4.0 million and an
extension of the Closing Date from September 30, 2009 to December 31, 2010. The
request was approved by the Country Director in a letter dated May 18, 2009. It is
expected that the above-detailed changes will strengthen Project design and greatly assist
the Borrower with the achievement of satisfactory outcomes in line with the reduced loan
amount and current Government priorities.

II.    Background and Reasons for Restructuring

4.       On June 14, 2005, the Bank Board approved the Programmatic Loan for
Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Housing Sector Reform (Loan 7306-BR). This
Development Policy Loan (DPL) operation was part of a set of four loans (two related to
housing and two related to employment and poverty) to support the Government of Brazil
in its agenda for sustainable and equitable growth. An accompanying Technical
Assistance Loan, the Project, was approved by the Board on November 10, 2005 to assist
the Government in pursuing its new housing policy and design the necessary policy
reforms which would be in part supported by Bank lending through the planned second
DPL.

5.      The original PDO of the Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) was to support the
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the Government reform program
supported by the above referenced DPL. The Housing Sector DPL aimed to improve the
policy environment for improving the living conditions of the poor and strengthening
their access to assets, notably housing and serviced/serviceable land and was embedded
in the cluster of support for the Government's growth agenda. The TAL was designed to
                                             1
mirror the components of the Housing Sector DPL, specifically: (i) Supporting the
Institutional and Legal Framework for Housing Policy; (ii) Housing Finance Market
Development; (iii) Housing Subsidies for the Poor; and (iv) Land and Urban
Development.

6.      The first housing sector DPL was a single-tranche loan that closed June 30, 2006.
The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) for this DPL was completed
June 30, 2009. As the DPL program was initially planned to include four loans, it was
originally conceived that one consolidated ICR would be completed six months after the
closing date of the last DPL in the series, which would have been the second housing
sector DPL. However, the second housing DPL did not move forward as Government
did not require a fast-disbursing loan at this time due to its improved fiscal stance.
Therefore, the second employment and poverty DPL, which closed June 30, 2008,
became the last DPL in the series and their respective ICRs were prepared separately.

7.      Over two years after Effectiveness, the amount of Loan proceeds disbursed from
the Housing TAL remains extremely low at 0.8% of the original loan amount (or 2.3% of
the reduced loan amount). Implementation progress was upgraded from "moderately
satisfactory" to "satisfactory" in the ISR of May 2009 reflecting the actions taken by the
Government to reduce the scope of the Project and confirmation that the new
implementation plan--prepared for the reduced loan amount--shows that loan proceeds
can be fully utilized by the new extended closing date.

8.     There are three main issues that have negatively impacted Project implementation
and disbursement to date and would be resolved through the proposed restructuring:

9.      The first issue is a shift in Government priorities. The Housing Sector DPL, for
which the TAL was designed to support, closed in June 2006 and its ICR was completed
June 2009. During that period, the housing sector increased in prominence within the
national agenda. First, within the PAC (Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento),
housing was allocated R$ 10.7 billion for 268 urban upgrading initiatives. Second, the
recent R$ 34 billion economic stimulus package, Minha Casa, Minha Vida, focuses on
the housing sector, and specifically on the provision of housing for low-income families.
The package includes upfront subsidies combined with housing loans, infrastructure
financing, and housing production chain financing. The Government's objectives in the
housing sector, especially with only one year remaining in the presidential term, have
shifted from sector-wide policy development to the execution of these large investment
programs. The proposed restructuring would address this shift in priorities by focusing on
technical assistance that would facilitate the role of the Ministry of Cities, especially the
National Housing Secretariat, in these large programs and by strengthening knowledge at
the local level necessary to improve the implementation of them.

10.    The second issue is availability of other funds to implement key activities. For
example, the preparation of the National Housing Plan, which was financed using funds
from an existing IDB project (Habitar Brasil-BID1), is currently at a final stage. Contracts

1
  Habitar Brasil BID was a US$250 loan signed in 1999. As of December 2005, the procurement plan was
revised to include funding for the preparation of the National Housing Plan and related studies.
                                                  2
related to the National Housing Plan and subsidy policy represented approximately 20%
of the original TAL budget, which are no longer needed.

11.     The design and development of a monitoring and development system represented
the largest portion of the original Loan allocation at US$1.13 million or approximately
28% of the loan amount. The latest draft of the procurement plan, prior to the partial
cancellation of loan in May 2009, allocated as much as 48% of the budget for the M&E
system. Yet, after unsuccessful attempts within the Ministry of Cities to use the loan
funds to hire a consultant to prepare the diagnostic and design of an M&E system, the
Ministry of Cities' National Housing Secretariat decided to remove the activity from the
TAL due to the unlikeness of being able to complete it prior to the loan closure.

12.     Given that the National Housing Plan was completed and financed outside of the
loan, and that there is no longer demand from the Borrower to use loan funds for the
development of an M&E system, the Housing TAL components would have a revised
focus on institutional strengthening related to capacity building for social housing
programs at the local level (including distance learning programs and technical assistance
in the preparation of state-level housing plans) and specific technical assistance needs
within the Ministry of Cities, and especially the National Housing Secretariat.

13.     The third issue is difficulty in the procurement process of studies to be financed
under the TAL, including the unavailability of consultants in Brazil with the necessary
housing sector expertise to execute the contracts. The Housing TAL faced initial delays,
including a lag of more than a year between approval and effectiveness. Once the project
moved to the implementation phase, the Ministry of Cities encountered difficulties in the
execution of the loan, especially in the development of Terms of Reference for
consultancy assignments due to obstacles in the adaptation of procurement procedures
stipulated in the loan agreement to Brazilian law (all proposed contracts must be
reviewed and approved by the Ministry's legal department ahead of being sent to the
Bank). The situation was particularly compounded by the difficulties faced in hiring local
consultants (requiring proof that no Ministry staff has the skills to implement the specific
task) and international consultants (as it must be proven that no Brazilian consultant is
capable of performing the task), which proved time-consuming.

14.     The revised scope of the project and the related procurement plan is now limited
to contracts that have either already been approved within the Ministry of Cities or that
have specifications that make their approval highly likely.

15.    With significant Government support, the Project restructuring will address the
new priority needs of the Borrower, while expediting Loan disbursements.

III.   Proposed Changes

16.    The Bank has worked with the Borrower to define an updated set of activities that
could be implemented by 2010 and which would better meet the current needs of the
Government. Based on the Government's request and the evolving housing sector agenda
in Brazil, the PDO is revised, one component is dropped, the three remaining components

                                             3
are consolidated into two, and Sole Source Selection is added to the Particular Methods
of Procurement of Consultants' Services to be used in the project.

17.    The initial PDO as defined in the Loan Agreement was to "assist the Borrower in
the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Program".2 The proposed revised
PDO is: "To strengthen the Ministry of Cities' capacity to manage housing and urban
development policy and programs at the federal level and to improve capacity for the
development of social housing programs at the local level."

18.     The project initially had four components, as follows: (A) Institutional and Legal
Framework for Housing Policy; (B) Housing Finance Market Development; (C) Housing
Subsidies for the Poor; and (D) Land and Urban Development. The restructuring
proposes to eliminate Component B on Housing Finance Market Development and
restructure the remaining three components (A, C and D) into two components.

19.    As such, the restructuring's proposed two components to substitute for the initial
four components are:

20.    Institutional Strengthening and Support for the National Housing System
through the allocation of US$715,000 in order to support the elaboration of housing
subsidies programs, technical assistance to the Ministry of Cities' National Housing
Secretariat, strengthening of knowledge related to construction technology, and the
development of methodologies for the collection of real estate market data in Brazil.

21.     Capacity Building of Urban Development at the Local Level thought the
allocation of US$575,000 in order to support distance learning programs related to the
preparation of local social housing plans, urban upgrading, and the integration of social
work in social housing developments.

22.    Table 1 presents the revised project components, objectives and activities. Table 2
represents the proposed reallocation in terms of categories of expenditures - Schedule 1.

  Program is defined as "Program to support policy reforms in the Borrower's housing sector, particularly
regarding low income housing, aimed at increasing housing affordability and improving urban
development," which was supported by the Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth:

23.     The restructuring proposes to add Sole Source Selection among the Particular
Methods of Procurement of Consultants' Services to be used in the project. This would
enable the Ministry of Cities among other activities to undertake an update of its flagship
study and publication about the national housing deficit in Brazil, which helps to inform
policymaking especially on the allocation of housing subsidies/incentives to address the
existing housing deficit. This study, which has been undertaken in previous years and is
periodically updated and published, is undertaken by the Fundação João Pinheiro using a
specific proprietary methodology.

IV.    Analysis

24.     The proposed changes do not have a major effect on the original economic,
financial, technical, institutional, or social aspects of the Project as appraised.

25.     The proposed changes do not change the Project's environmental classification
(Category C) nor trigger the application of any new, or exceptions to any Bank safeguard
policies.

26.    The restructuring does not involve any exceptions to Bank policies.

V.     Expected Outcomes

27.    The Results Framework and Monitoring Indicators table in "Supplemental Letter
No. 1: Monitoring Indicators", dated September 21, 2006, has been revised to reflect

IV.     Benefits and Risks


28.    The primary benefit of the restructured project is an enhanced capacity of the
National Housing Secretariat to develop and manage housing policy, and its ability to
provide capacity building opportunities to local governments.

29.     There are two main risks that could jeopardize the achievement of the restructured
outcome targets. First, the borrower could experience further procurement delays and
obstacles which could result in not completing some of the Project activities within the
agreed timeframe (current closing date of December 31, 2010). This risk is considered to
be moderate because the major activities included in the revised scope are either
underway or in the final stages of contracting. The second risk is that the presidential
elections in 2010 will cause turn-over within the Ministry of Cities/National Housing
Secretariat and/or a significant change in policy action that would slow or stop
implementation. This risk is also considered to be low because the revised scope is very
limited and does not include activities that could be considered politically sensitive. This
second risk is mitigated by the fact that all Project activities should be underway by early
2010.
