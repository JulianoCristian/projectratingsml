Housing Sector Technical\n            Assistance loan (HSTAL) Project for Brazil were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the HSTAL project appraisal document (PAD)\n            recognizes the need for flexibility to allow for changes in\n            macroeconomic conditions and for adjustments needed as the\n            reform program progressed. At the same time, it includes a\n            very detailed list of activities to be financed throughout\n            the life of the project in the procurement plan formulated\n            at appraisal. These activities were directly linked to the\n            project's monitoring indicators and hence to the\n            results and outcomes. Consequently, the supervision missions\n            spent\u00b7 considerable amount of time and effort following up\n            on completion of the activities (some of which lost\n            relevance as developments in the sector occurred), and less\n            on policy dialogue and capacity building with the Borrower.\n            To the extent possible, a technical assistance operation\n            should remain focused on the strategic objectives and remain\n            flexible regarding the specific activities to be financed. A\n            technical assistance loan to support a programmatic series\n            should avoid emulating the program's project\n            development objective (PDO) since specific investment loan\n            (SIL) is not an adequate instrument to support policy\n            reform. The PDO indicators for the HSTAL were directly\n            linked to sector reform (Subsequent Housing DPL triggers are\n            met, and program implementation, monitoring, and evaluation\n            based on the results of the analytical and technical work of\n            the HSTAL) when reform, as mentioned before is a function of\n            several variables, including but not reduced to relevant\n            studies, workshops or dissemination strategies. In\n            hindsight, a more focused PDO for the project, confined to\n            the outcomes of the TA to be provided and associated (but\n            not linked) to the program objective might have been more effective."}, "docdt": "2011-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
