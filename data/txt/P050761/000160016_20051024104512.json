The Housing Sector Reform Loan aims to improve the\n            policy environment for improving the living conditions of\n            the poor and strengthening their access to assets, notably\n            housing and serviced/serviceable land. There are four\n            project components. Component 1supports the Institutional\n            and Legal Framework for Housing Policy, which includes\n            resources to support the Ministry of Cities in its internal\n            reorganization by consolidating the National Housing\n            Secretariat as the key technical and policy entity for\n            coordinating policy design across the many public sector\n            actors. Component 2, the Housing Finance Market Development\n            Component, supports improving the legal and regulatory\n            framework for housing loans, including incremental reforms\n            to the existing housing finance system, the future\n            integration of the Brazilian Savings and Loan System into\n            the full market system, and overall strengthening of the\n            market-based Housing Finance System. The focus of technical\n            assistance activities in Component 3, Housing Subsidies for\n            the Poor Component, relating to housing subsidy policy is\n            the rationalization of the Government's various subsidy\n            programs and the establishment of effective targeting,\n            monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms. Component 4, Land and\n            Urban Development, includes the provision of technical\n            assistance for (a) the designing and implementing programs\n            for the Ministry of Cities to strengthen local governments\n            in their efforts to achieve accreditation of their\n            institutional capacity to take the lead in local urban\n            development policy setting and implementation; and (b) the\n            development of a national urban upgrading program,\n            including: (1) research, monitoring, and evaluation\n            activities, at the Borrower's federal level, of policy\n            and regulatory efforts for urban development and land\n            subdivision; and (2)a series of activities to facilitate the\n            implementation of the policy innovations under the Program\n            for progressive housing development, the preparation of\n            local master plans; and the demand-side organization for\n            housing subsidy programs."}, "docdt": "2005-10-13T00:00:00Z"}
