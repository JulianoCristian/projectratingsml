 1.1       Context at Appraisal

 Access to housing and reliable urban services is essential· to poverty reduction and economic
 growth in Brazil. Brazil is among the most urbanized countries in Latin America, with
 approximately 80% of the population living in urban areas and 90% of the country's GOP being
 generated in cities. By 2004 the housing deficit was estimated at 7.1 million units~ equivalent to
 28 million people without access to adequate shelter. At the same time, urban informal
 settlements were growing four times faster than average urban growth; and an estimated 65% of
 new households formed annually could not afford the. most basic house produced in the formal
 market. Overall, the performance of the housing sector in Brazil was deemed as inadequate; with
 outstanding mortgage loans representing only around ~-4% of GOP (compared with 15% in
 Chile and 65% in the US).

Some years before project appraisal, in 2001, Brazil's Congress passed a constitutional
amendment that guaranteed the right to adequate housing for all Bra?:ilians. This was an
important step towards a comprehensive reform process to improve access to housing for
Brazilians. At the same time, accomplishing this goal, while maintaining fiscal discipline,
presented a major challenge. While the issue of housing was a priority in the electoral campaign
of President Lula in 2002, progress in housing sector had been limited by 2005.

  Reform in the· housing sector acquired relevance in 2005 as a key component to reinforce the
. growth agenda; given the impact of housing and housing finance in promoting poverty
  alleviation and expanding the efficiency of the financial· sector respectively). Housing was
  recognized as an important component of the economy, contributing to job creation (housing
  investment has a multiplier effect of 1.8), expansion of the finance system and creation of
  household wealth.

The Programmatic Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth: Housing Sector Reform (OPL)
(Loan 7306-BR) was approved in June 2005 to support the first stage of reforms in the
Government's reform agenda in housing and urban sectors. The program's P.OO was to support
the Government's efforts to improve access of the poor to improved housing and serviced
serviceable land ~hi~e maintaini~fiscal discipline. Specificall~, the oper~tion aim~d t~ support
the Government m lts efforts to : (a) develop a sound national pobey and IDstitutlonal
framework for housing and urban development; (b) strengthen the housing credit and savings
systems, and provide incentives for the housing finance market to expand as well as move
"down-market"; (c) design and implement a unified federal housing subsidy system to address
the affordability of housing solutions for the poor; and (d) reduce the costs of formal urban lalid
development by strengthening land legislation and regulations and real property registries. This

logistics costs to raise productivity and ease trade; (b) improving the business environment to enable better market functioning;
(c) enhancing financial efficiency and depth; and (d) transforming knowledge into productivity through innovation.

 loan was designed to set the stage for further support to the housing sector, including a
 subsequent DPL and a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) operation linked to housing.

 The Housing Sector Technical Assistance loan (HSTAL) was approved in October 2005 to
 support the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Government's reform program
 supported by the DPL. The proje((t was designed in parallel to the DPL (and incorporated the
 same project components) to channel Bank financial support to the four policy areas and to help
 the Government _ of Brazil to establish the necessary conditions 'under which the Bank could
 provide further investment-linked support to the housing subsidy programs through a sector
 investment loan under the SWAp. As such, the HSTAL was meant to facilitate policy dialogue
 amongst the Bank and the ,Government of Brazil (GoB,) in-between the DPL and subsequent
 housing-related operations.

The main objective of a subsequent growth DPL supporting the housing sector would have been
the deePening of the reforms -initiated- by the policy changes supported _     through the first
operation. Nine prior actions were (pre)identified as key in the DPL policy matrix (out of 42).
For the institutional framework, the focus was on institutionalization of a medium term
development plan (through the elaboration and dissemination of National Housing Plan), and
improving the regulation for subsidies. In terms of the housing finance system, the main
objectives were to reduce the judiciary risk of housing fmance contracts, increase private sector
utilization of subsidy funds and analyzing the development of new instruments in housing
finance such as mortgage _ insurance. The housing subsidies component was focused on
rationalization and harmonization of subsidy programs and on the implementation of a
comprehensive m,onitoring and evaluation system for subsidies. Lastly, the program envisaged
the launch of a national urpan upgrading program and measures to increase available urban land
as the key prior actions for the urban_and land component.                                 '

 1.2       Revised PDO

 During the mid-term review of the project (November 2008), the.Ministry of Cities (MOC) and
 the World Bank agreed to restructure the project. The project restructure included: (a)
 cancellation of USS2.7 million of the loan amount, (b) elimination of Component 2: Housing
 Finance Market Development, and (c) restructuring the remaining three components (1,3 and 4)
 into two components. In practice restructuring occurred in two stages:· the cancellation ofUSS2.7
 million on May 19,2009 and the restructuring of items (b) and (c) above which was approved a
 year later on May 19,2010.

  Table 1 below includes a summary of the key changes. The reVised PDO became: to strengthen
  the Ministry of Cities' capacity to manage housing and urban development policy and
. programs at the federal level, and improve capacity for the development of social housing
  programs at the local level. The key indicators included:

The reasons for: restructuring include low disbursement level, the shift in government priorities
and the availability of other sources of funding. These are briefly analyzed below.

a. Low disbursement level. By the end of2008 the project had disbursed less than 1% of the loan
amount. The main reason for the slow implementation pace was the lack of familiarity within the
Ministry of Cities (MOC), and specifically the National Housing Secretariat (NHS) - responsible
for the day-to-day operation of the program- with the Bank's fiduciary procedures and
requirements. Procurement was a major challenge for project implementation until the project
was restructured. The NHS was at the time of appraisal a small unit without dedicated
procurement staff and with limited procurement responsibilities or experience - as it mostly acted
as a policymaking entity. Difficulties had to do with the· development of bidding documents for
consultancy assignIllents due to obstacles in reconciling/adapting Bank procurement procedures
as stipulated in the loan agreement with Brazilian law (all proposed bid documents.and contracts
must be reviewed and approved by the Ministry's legal department - Consultoria Juridica -

                                                                     17
 ahead of being sent for the Bank's no objection); The situation was particularly compounded by
 the difficulties faced in hiring local consultants (reqUiring proof that no Ministry staff has the
 skills to implement the specific task) and international consultants (usually highly questioned by
 local stafl), which proved cumbersome and extremely time-consuming.

 b. Shift in Government priorities. Housing remained at the top of the Government's agenda
 during the period, but the focus of government action was narrowed from the all-encompassing
 approach supported by the DPL (which included institutional reform, housing finance,.subsidies
 and urban interventions) to targeted interventions in the areas of urban/slum upgrading and
 housing subsidies, which are the two main areas of housing policy that benefit from Federal
 financing. These new priorities were derived from the National Housing Plan (planHab), which
 was prepared during 2Q08. As a result, government focus shifted to operative implementation of
 two .large-scale investment programs; a major urban/slum upgrading program under the PAC
 (Programa de Acelerofao do Crescimento) with an allocated budget ofRS 10.7 billion-making
 it in effect the l~gestslum upgrading program in the World, and the housing subsidy program
 Minha Casa, Minha Vida, with an allocation of RS 34 billion 3.                    .


 c. Availability of other sources of funding. In 2005 the· procurement plan of the existing US$250
 million loan from the IADB to the Ministry of Cities - "Habitar Brasif' was revised to include
 the preparation of the National Housing Plan and other related studies. In addition, funding from
 UNDP was also available to finance reports and studies.

 1.3       Main Beneficiaries:

The primary target group of the original PD~ was the Ministry of Cities, in particular the
National Housing Secretariat as the technical assistance activities financed through the loan were
expected to support the implementation and M&E of policy reforms carried out prior to the DPL
and prepare those actions that were pre-identified as triggers for the subsequent operations. After
restructuring, the National Housing Secretariat remained as the main beneficiary since the
activities financed aimed at increasing its capacity to manage urban and housing policies and
programs. Other beneficiaries of the restructured project include local governments as the
recipients of the capacity building activities led by the NHS.

1.5        Original Components (as approved):

Component 1: Supporting the Institutional and Legal Framework for Housing Policy (US$ 1.31
million). Support the Ministry of Cities in it s internal reorganization, including the consolidation

Component 2: Housing Finance Market Development (US$· 0.29 million). Support the
improvement of the legal and regulatory framework for housing loans, including incremental
reforms to the existing housing finance system, the future integration of the SBPE in the full
market system, and overall strengthening ofthe marKet-based Housing Finance System (SFI).

Component S: Housing Subsidies for the Poor (US$ 1.33 million). Support for the rationalization
of the Government's various subsidy programs, and the establishment of effective targeting,
monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms.

 Component 2: Capacity Building of Urban Development at the Local Level (U$575,000).
 Support distance learning programs related to the preparation of local social housing plans, urban
 upgrading, and the integration of social work in social housing developments.

 1.7    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale. implementation arrangements and
 schedule. andfunding allocations):

 The project restructuring also added the Sole Source Selection method to the procurement
 methods included under the project. The results framework and monitoring indicators of the
 project were also modified to reflect changes in outcome indicators and expected intermediate
 results.                                            .

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes.

 2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

  The background analysis supporting the reform program was robust and based on extensive
  analytical work conducted both by Bank and Borrower; and the activities included in the HSTAL
. were adequate to support the Government's gradual reform agenda. During the preparation of the
  DPL and HSTAL, the Bank Team, with support from international and Brazilian housing
  experts, worked closely with the Borrower to fully understand the challenges facing the housing
  and land sectors. Specific reforms necessary to reach the development objective of improving
  access to housing for the poor were clearly defined and laid out. The core areas of reform were
  incorporated as policy areas of the DPL and components of the HSTL. The associated tasks
  needed to achieve further gradual reform Were later included as tasks to be financed by the
  HSTAL project components. This approach adequately recognized the synthetic nature of the
  housing, financial and urban sectors needed for a comprehensive reform agenda. The main tasks
 expected to be financed by the project are presented in Table 2 below. Each task was further
 associated to a group of activities including hiring consultants, preparing studies, conducting
 workshops and study tours, or purchasing electronic and physical publications. Emphasis (in
 terms of loan allocation) was put on the technical assistance for the dissemination of the National
 Housing Policy and preparation of the National Housing Plan (component 1), development of an
 M&E system for subsidies (component 3), and development of an urban upgrading program for


                                                20
 metropolitan areas (component 4). Component two (housing finance development) received
 considerable less funding from the project (7%) to finance strategic studies and high level
 dialogue with the judiciary on the efficiency and coherence of the housing finance system in
 Brazil.                                                            .

                                           Development of a national urban upgrading program

 In hindsight, it is likely that reform in the housing finance sector required a joint leadership from
 the MOC along with the financial authorities and institutions involved in housing finance, such
as the Ministry of Finance (Fazenda)~ the FGTS Conselho Curador (Council) and Caixa
Economica Federal (CEF). The attributions of the MOC did not allow it to lead these efforts on
its own, without the active leadership of other housing finance institutions. The project
restructuring eliminated this component and in 2009 the Bank initiated a non-lending technical
assistance (NLTA) project to the Government of Brazil in Housing Sector Reform and the
Implementation ofthe MiDha Casa, MiDha Vida (MCMV) subsidy program. The NLTA included
a strategic analysis on how to increase private lenders participation in FGTS lending and making
the Guarantee Fund sustainable in the long-term. The NLTA - which was carried out at the
demand of the Ministry of Finance and working in close collaboration with the Ministry of Cities
- seems to have been a better instruinent to support the technical background analysis needed for
reform.

Project design was strong at technical level but failed to recognize the implementation risk
derived from the limited prior experience of the implementing agency with Bank-:ftnanced
projects. At a technical level, the design was consistent with the PDO and took into account
lessons learnt during project preparation. Moreover, the project document recognized the need
for flexibility within the loan to account for the evolution of the macroeconomic conditions and
the adjustments needed from the expected progress in the sector as reforms matured. However,

                                                     21
the implementation arrangements do not seem to have been carefully thought through, neither the
implementation challenges recognized or addressed. The procurement assessment undertaken
during preparation identifies the "lack of specialized procurement staff in the implementing
agency" as a major·issue but this risk is not documented in the risk section of the PAP and no
mitigation action was considered. The internal procurement procedures within MOC-NHS were
not adequately analyzed to ensure consistency between Bank arid client procedures. The fact that
there was no operational manual prepared for the project until the project was restructured in
2009 is an indication the implementing arrangements were not adequately clarified during
project preparation. As a result, implementation Was to become an important shortfall for the
project until it was restructured.

A larger loan amount was considered and rejected during project preparation. In hindsight, the
loan amount appears very small relative to the size and needs of the housing sector, and in
particular when the other programs being implemented (PAC, MCMV) are considered. A larger
and hence more visible loan amount might have been able to obtain more attention from both the
Bank and the Borrower towards ensuring a successful project implementation, and especially· in
terms of being able to equip itself with adequate staffing/consultant capacity to support Project
implementation. However, the loan amount needs to be also compared with the yearly budget
allocation of the activities implemented by the NHS so as to make sure that the program remains
manageable for the implementing entity. As a reference, the NHS received a budget allocation of
USS 5 million in 2010 for similar technical assistance activities. Compared to this figure, the
project expected disbursements of USSI million per year appear reasonable. It is not clear that a
larger amount would have translated into better results, in particular considering the Jack of .
attention ·givento.·implementationarrangements.

2.2     Implementation

 The project had a very slow start (13 month delay between approval and effectiveness) and even
 slower implementation pace. Two years after effectiveness only USSO.03 million had been
disbursed. The learning period for the implementing agency to familiarize itself with Bank
procedures was long and cumbersome and the Bank did not provide timely or effective
implementation support. The decision ofthe GoB not to go ahead with the subsequent DPL (the
second housing DPL and the fourth in the Growth DPL series) reduced the relative importance of
the project, in contrast with the successful achievements of the macro economy and housing
sector reforms and should have triggered.a formal review of the. project's ability to meet its PD~.
By the end of 2008 the project had reached a stand-still that effectively forced the cancellation of
67% of the loan proceeds since the PD~ had become irrelevant and there was only a short
implementation period left. During the first two years of project implementation the Bank seems
to have underestimated the implementation challenges that were causing the delays since all
ISRs . reflect Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory ratings despite the lack of progress. In
hindsight, the project restructuring should' have occurred at an earlier date - as soon as the Bank
and borrower realized that the priorities had moved and that no additional DPLs would be
requested - this could have avoided the need to cancel such a large loan amount.

In hindsight, it seems that adequate implementation of the project lost relevance for both the
Bank and the Bo~ower. Several reasons help to explain this fact: First, the loan amount was too

                                                22
    small relative to the needs of the sector; and later relative to the other programs that were under
    implementation by the Borrower. Second, the subsequent DPL (for which this TA was designed
    mainly for) did not materialize, reducing the sense of medium term target for the project. Last,
    the Bank and Borrower remained engaged in a strong policy dialogue throughout the life of the
    project that contributed to capacity and consensus building (despite the disbursement lag or
    procurement hurdles) so there probably was a sense that reform was progressing satisfactorily,
    even if the HSTAL was underperforming.

Throughout 2008 the MOC developed the Plano Nacional de Habitaciio (PlanHab) which
articulates the key directives of the housing policy for the medium term (to 2023). The PlanHab
defines the policy instruments and expected outputs in the four key policy areas addressed by the
DPL and HSTAL4 - plus one: construction supply chain for affordable housing. Preparation of
the National Housing Plan was one of the activities to be financed by component one of the
project; but in the end no HSTAL funds were used. The PlanHab - finalized in December that
year - became the guiding instrument for the policy actions in the sector; once it was finalized it
gave a sense of policy direction which seems to have allowed the project to be restructured. In
hindsight, the PlanHab was prepared supported by the technical dialogue between the Bank,
Cities Alliance and the Borrower, and represented a very important step to strengthen the
housing sector in Brazil and a pillar for the programs launched recently afterwards.

Once the main guiding principles were consolidated into the PlanHab, the authorities decided to
cancel the amount of the loan that was deemed unable to be disbursed, and to reduce the
project's scope and align its focus to the new government priorities. The new activities to be
financed were directly .linked to strengthening the MOC- NHS as the key implementing agency
and only those which the MOC was already implementing or which were already programmed
for procurement launch to ensure that the remaining funds were fully utilized before the closing
d~.                                                                                                                                    .

In May 2009 the Borrower requested Bank's support for a non-lending technical assistance to
support Housing Sector Reform and the Implementation of the MCMV Stimulus Program derived
from the PlanHab. This request - in the midst of a poorly performing loan - suggests that the
borrower valued the technical assistance provided by the Bank, but did not find the SIL -with its
implementation challenges-an adequate instrument to obtain it. Moreover, several of the
activities originally planned to be financed by the Bank were in fact completed with other
sources of funding, suggesting that the activities were relevant but the SIL was not the correct
mechanism to achieve the outcome.

After restructuring, project performance and disbursement ratios improved substantially. The
May 2010 ISR upgraded all project ratings (DO from MS to S, given that the reformulation of
the PDO and the extension of the closing date made it possible to meet the DO), and
commitment and disbursement ratios improved to 57% and 25.8% respectively. By the closing
date all of the activities had been completed and all (revised) targets met or surpassed.

2.3       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

4 The five policy areas addressed by the PlanHab are: (i) housing financing and housing subsidies, (ii) land and urban policy, (iii)
institutional development and (iv) construction supply chain for affordable housing

                                                                23
 Assessing progress of a SIL for technical assistance linked to a refonn program - such as the
 HSTAL - is not straightforward. The underlying assumption is that the project will finance
 certain outputs that will trigger refonn in the selected policy areas. Yet policy refonn is a
 function of a multiplicity of factors, many of which are beyond the scope of the project (the
 output is likely to be a necessary but not sufficient condition). Monitoring progress would then
 need·to include indicators to assess completion of the outputs (and hence disbursements) as well
 as indicators to gauge progress in the refonn agenda, even if causality between output and refonn
 is not always straightforward..

 M&Edesign for the original PD~ was entirely output based. No indicators were included to
 capture the overall progress of the housing sector which was an underlying objective of the
 HSTAL -through support to the refonn program linked to the DPL. Given the implementation
 problems faced by the project the monitoring framework was literally not utilized during the first
 three years, until the project components and indicators were restructured. When the project
 scope was narrowed and de-linked from the programmatic refonn agenda, the revised indicators
 that were selected adequately captured the project's new objective and were utilized to monitor
 progress. The indicators after the restructuring were routinely updated to reflect progress in
 completion of the outputs which were in turn clearly linked to the project's revised PD~.

An equally important objective was to support the Government to set up an M&E system for the
housing sector, which was intended to be supported under the HSTAL. Despite that the housing
sector M&E agenda was at first not pursued under the HSTAL, it remained subject of extensive
engagement between the Bank and the NHS teams. The Bank team designed and delivered a
tailor-made M&E workshop for NHS staff in September 2009. As a result, NHS decided to use
the remaining HSTAL resources to finance an individual consultant to design the concept and
overall outline of an M&E system for the housing sector. A system is currently in the early
process of being designed and created, with the detailed work being carried out under an ongoing
Cities Alliance Trust Fund.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as
applicable):

Fiduciary issues remained a challenge until project restructuring, in particular procurement of
consultants. A shortcoming of project design was a lack of realism over the possibility of the
NHS to contract the activities included in the procurement plan. During the early years of
implementation no actions were taken to overcome the bottlenecks created by the restrictions in
national legislation to contract international consultants and the NHS' s limited procurement
experience. As mentioned before, the procurement procedures were not even explained in an
operational manual making compliance more difficult. By the time of restructure, these issues
were resolved by focusing on activities that the NHS was already undertaking, preparing an
operational manual and also by the fact that NHS had become somewhat more familiar with
Bank procedures. Similarly, as far as IFRs were concerned, no IFRs were prepared by the
Borrower during the first years of implementation as there was practically no disbursement. Only
after the restructuring and with the acceleration of implementation and the beginning of the Bank



                                               24
  staff providing hands-on implementation support, in proc\ll'ement and financial management, did
  the Pl'Qject implementation improve and its pace accelerate.

  No safeguards were triggered under the H$TAL.

  2.5    Post-comple;tion Operation/Next Phase: '

 During project preparation it was envisioned that Bank support'to the Government's reform and
 investment program would be strUctured over' the four years fol\owing the DPL and would
 comprise. loans aligp.ed with the Government's budget cycle and linked to federal policy reform
 efforts, and. a possible investment-linked" operation, to be prepared under the SWAp modality.
 The DPL policy matrix pre-identifies potential prior actions for subsequ~nt support in the sector,
 some of which were to receive funding from the· HSTAL, and some of which have been met.
 However, given the improvements in the ,Brazil's macro-economy no further support in the form
 of policy lending or SWAp for the housing sector is envisaged in the medium term. As discussed
 above, this decreased the relative importance of the project for both Bank and borrower and
 contributed to the poor implementation performance. Still, through the NLT A requested by the
 GoB in 2009 coupled with the continued demand of Bank-executed trust funds from the Cities
 Alliance for the purpose of capacity builc:Jingof the NHS, the Bank continued to provide strategic
 advice for the housing progr~ in' Brazil at the federal level, to both the Ministries of Finance
 and Cities, in particular for housing finance sector development.

 3. Assessment of Outcomes

 3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
 priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

   The Brazilian housing sector asa whole has made significant progress since 2005, as a result of
   Government reform and good macroeconomic fundamentals. The, Government of Brazil has'
  deepened the reforms started in 200112002 to strengthen the housing sector as an engine of
  economic growth and to increase access to housing for the poorer segments of the population.
  These efforts were combined with strong macro performance; the Brazilian economy grew at an
 ,average of 4.25 percent ·between 2004 and 2010, while inflation dropped from 12.5 percent in
  2002 to 4.5 percent in 2010. Brazil was able to withstand the recent economic crisis quite
  successfully with GDP declining only 0.2% in 2009 to bounce back in 2010 t07.3%. The
  headline interest rate (SELIC), which was identified in the project documents as one of the main
. obstacles to the sound expansion of the housing sector dropped from 26.5 percent in 2003 to
  9.25 percent in June 2009, although it was increased again recently to 11.5% by the Central
  Bank to contain inflationary pressure. As a result, the total funding for housing in Brazil
  increased from RSI0 billion in 2005 to R$83 billion in 2010 and is expected to increase to
  RSI08 billion in 20 II.

Both the HSTAL and associated DPL addressed key issues which remain a priority for the
Gov~rnment   and relevant to the country's strategy. The assessment and recommendations
encompassed in the detailed analytical work and dialogue between the Government of Brazil and
the Bank that supported both operations is robust and continues to be relevant. The DPL and


                                                25
 HSTAL supporting low-income housing and housing finance market development - were
 designed to deepen and expand the growth program based on deep new reforms in the housing
 sector, which is consistent with the Brazil CAS - structured the Bank support along three pillars:
 Equity, Sustainability and Growth.                                    '

The· HSTAL design followed the" project layout of the DPL. While this maintained coherence
between the two operations it defacto set a policy lending objective (Le. support the
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the Government reform program ...... ) linked to
a sector investment loan. This inherent conflict makes the PDQ difficult to achieve (even if all
the activities are duly undertaken and -finalized) since reform is not only a product of a single
output (study or workshop) but rather reflects a set of gradual actions that coincide with a
favorable political-economy environment. This conflict was resolved when the project was
restructured. The revised PD~ was more modest than the original one and it was directly linked
to the activities to be financed, thus making it achievable and commensurate with the activities
being financed.

The HSTAL implementing arrangements seem to have given little attention to the lack of
experience of the implementing agency in procurement procedures. As a result, the procurement
and contracting hurdles impeded progress in the project up until the restructure, and captured
most of the attention and time of project supervision. This was particularly frustrating (for both
Bank and Borrower) when the objective of the loan is to increase capacity at a technical level -
through a technical assistance loan. Again, the restructure contributed to resolve this issue by
reducing the number of activities to be financed, including activities which had already been
approved internally by the MOC and allowing the single source selection method for contr~cting
of consultants.

3.2    Achievement ofProject Development Objectives

Before project restructure, operational difficulties made it impossible for the HSTAL to
contribute to the achievement of the successful implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the
program supported under the DPL. For this reason, the outcome of the projects original PD~ is
rated as Unsatisfactory. Perhaps the most significant contribution from the HSTAL to the PD~
was through the policy dialogue and advice that the Bank's technical specialists and consultants
could provide to the NHS's team during project supervision. There are at least two good
examples of this technical dialogue that deserve recognition; First, the technical discussions
between the Bank and the Inter-Ministerial Working Group. This group was created to support
sector reform and included representatives from all the agencies and institutions that are related
to housing and urban sectors. The Bank's technical ,experts played a key role informing and
guiding the discussions of this high-level group, which is recognized by the Borrower as
extremely valuable in terms of building new knowledge and increasing institutional capacity.
One of the most important learning activities was a study tour of the members of the group to
Mexico in mid-200S. At_ the time, Mexico was also undergoing an important reform in the
housing sector which led to substantial growth in housing production. The trip provided a unique
opportunity for the members of the group to brainstorm over different policy alternatives. Such
occasions are rare for high-level inter-ministerial groups. Second is the dialogue during the
preparation of the National Housing Plan (PlanHab). The Borrower highlights the valuable

                                               26
     contributions from the Ba,nk's team on consolidating the sector priorities among federal
     stakeholders, which later derived into the development of the PAC and MCMV programs.

     As mentioned, many of the tasks planned to be financed by HUTAL (Table 2 above) have been
     completed, .including the dissemination of the National Housing Policy and preparation of the
     National Housing Plan and the development of a national urban upgrading program. Perhaps the
     most important challenge that remains is the establishment of a comprehensive M&E system for
     housing subsidies. No relevant progress has been achieved in this regard. The NHS has
     undertaken an ad hoc evaluation of the MCMV program, but the need to systematically assess
     housing needs, monitor implementation and service delivery of the various programs within the
     Politica Naeional de HabitacicOo, and assess effectiveness and efficiency of the housing
     subsidies (including up-front, implicit, in kind, and from all levels of government) remains.
     Overall, despite the lack· of fmancial support from the HSTAL, the broad set of housing sector
     reforms implemented by the GoB since 2002 and supported by the DPL (since 2005) have made
     a significant impact in improving access to affordable housing and serviced land.

   After restructure, the project successfully achieved the objective of strengthening the Ministry of
   Cities' capacity to manage housing and urban development policy and programs at the federal
   level, and improving capacity for the development of social housing programs at the local level.
   The outcome of the project's revised PD~ is rated as Satisfactory. The HSTAL financed
   important studies to (i) characterize and analyze the housing market dynamics, an input to
  determine the housing sector priorities thatwei'e eventually agreed in the Plan Hab, (ii) update
  the housing deficit of Brazil, .a publication that guides policy programs and that helps private
  sector and stakeholders plan investments and actions, and (iii) elaborate an ad-hoc evaluation of
  the first stage of the MCMV program, the results of which will feed the next phase policy
  adjustments in the program, tentatively to occur in late 20 n. These activities have all
  strengthened the capacity of the NHS to design and manage the housing programs at federal
  level. These federal programs 8.Ilow for sufficient decision making at local level to ensure
  flexibility and responsiveness. However, not all local government officials or relevant
  stakeholders· have equal or enough capacity to effectively implement them. To overcome this
  shortcoming, the HSTAL financed the elaboration of content material and implementation of the
  distance course learning programs on (i) social work on housing projects, (ii) urban upgrading
  and (iii) preparation of local housing plans. The latter is extremely important to avoid that the
  recent expansion of the housing sector in Brazil comes at the cost of disorderly urban expansion
  andlor social exclusion. A total of 7,849 participants were training during the distance learning
  sessions in the three topics between June 2008 and September 2010. Participant's evaluation
  reports show that 83% of participants evaluated high or very high the relevance of the course
. given their respective fields, and 98% report that the quality of the materials presented was either
  good or excellents.                                                                   .

 3.3       Efficiency

 As the project did not finance physical investments the most relevant discussion on efficiency of
 the HSTAL relates to the costs incurred during preparation and supervision relative to the final

 SIncludes urban upgrading and preparation of local housing plans only. Results on the distance learning course for social work
 were not yet available at the time of the IeR preparation mission.

                                                               27
    amount disbursed from the loan. Overall, the Bank expenditures represent 35% of the amount
    disbursed6• The percentage is particularly high given that the total disbursed amount was only
    around 30% of the original loan amount and highlights the importance of addressing the project
    shortcomings early.

    3.4     Justification ofOverall Outcome Rating

    As per the ICR guidelines, the evaluation of project performance takes into account performance
    both before and after the revision of 'project objectives, weighting pre- and post-revision
    performance by the share of actual loan disbursements before and after the revision took place 7•
    Project performance previous to the second restructure (May 2010) is rated as Unsatisfactory
    (Rating 2), which weighted by the amount of funds disbursed (30%) up to May 2010 results ina
    score of0.06. Project performance after the second restructure is rated as Satisfactory (Rating 5),
    which weighted by the amount of funds disbursed (70%) later than May 2020 results in a score
    of 4.1. The resulting overall rating for the project is considered to be· Moderately Satisfactory.

    The rating resulting from the application of the formula is strongly biased towards the
    performance of the project after restructuring - when disbursements occurred. Considering all
    the elements analyzed in this document, it appears to represent a rather "theoretical" rating. If the
    time elapsed at each phase of the project (pre and post restructure) would have been included
    into the rating guidelines, it is very likely that the project would have been rated as
    Unsatisfactory, given that it only performed satisfactorily for around seven months out of the
    four years that it was effective; or five years elapsed between Board approval and project
    closing.

Beyond disbursements, it is clear that the revised project successfully met its development
objective - even in the short implementation period - given: (i) i~s alignment with the
government priorities, (ii) a much better understanding the fiduciary requirements by the
Borrower, and (iii) the relevance of the activities financed towards achieving the PD~. In
addition, the Bank did manage to support the GoB's housing sector reform agenda through
capacity building and technical assistance in a meaningful way, even if the funds from the
HSTAL were not the main instrument for this. The continued dialogue of Bank experts with
government officials during project prepm:ation and supervision of both the DPL and the
HSTAL,and the NLTA delivered in 2009 are extremely valued by the Borrower asa prime
achievement of the project.

3.5        Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)       .Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

It was anticipated that most of the specific policy measures supported by the Program and the
HSTAL would have significant positive poverty-alleviation impacts.. At the program level,
performance outcomes such as the down-market movements of the FGTS and SBPE, the

6 This amount might include efficiency gains from project preparation as the HSTAL was prepared jointly with the DPL.
7 Assign a .value for each rating: Highly Satisfactory=6, Sati&/actory=S, Moderately Satisfactory=4, Moderately
Unsatisfactory=3, Unsati&/actory=2, and Highly Unsatisfactory= I. Then derive the actual total BanklIDA disbursements before
and after the date when the revised project objectives were formally approved. Finally. arrive at an overall rating by weighting
the two ratings by the proportion of actual total disbursement in each period, and rounding to the nearest whole number (I to 6).

                                                               28
    significant increase in housing subsidy funds for low-income households through the MCMV
    program (supporting in its first phase the delivery of one million housing units for families
    earning up to 10 minimum wages, and an additional two million units in its second phase,
    relative to a total accumulated housing deficit of slightly over 7 million units), and the sharp
    increase in families benefiting from urban upgrading investments' (nearly one million households
    under PAC slum upgrading between 2007-2010), seem to confirm this assumptionS. Similarly,
    low-income households' ability to access shelter has' been significantly improved ~ a result of
    the increased down-market penetration of housing lenders (namely public lenders, predominantly
    CEF and the recent entry of Banco do Brasil) and housing developers under MCMV. Just as an
    example, in Rio de Janeiro, before MCMV, 95 percent of all housing starts were for units of over
    BRL 200,000, whereas since the launch of MCMV, close to half of the housing starts were for
    eligible units under the Program (i.e. of less than BRL ,130,000). Still, an important shortcoming
    is the lack of evaluation mechanisms to confirm this assumption, in particular for subsidies. This
    was one of the main (original) objectives of the HSTAL and remains a pending item in the
    housing sector agenda, although one which has recently started taking off and wiU"continue
    receiving TA support from the Bank.

    (b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

The HSTAL had both direct ,and indirect positive impacts on the institutional strengthening of
the Ministry of Cities, and especially of theNHS. Direct positive impacts relate to the
contribution made by the revised project through the financing of strategic studies that provided
inputs to the design ofthe MCMV program (such as the study on the housing market dynamics)
or to the PlanHab (such as consultant for scenario modeling). Indirect positive impacts of the
project refer to the policy dialogue between the Borrower and the Bank's team which contributed
to the decision-making process for continued reform. This indirect contribution of the Bank was
highlighted by the Government counterparts during the ICR preparation mission. In particular,
the informal technical contribution of the Bank during the preparation of the PlanHab in the form
of recommendations and international references is recognized.

 In addition, the distance learning courses and course material funded through the HSTAL are
expected to have positive impacts in the institutional capacity of local governments and agencies
implementing the government housing programs. The current growth rates of housing
construction in Brazil - supported to a large extent by good macro conditions and the stimulus
programs PAC and MCMV - is putting enormous pressure on the ability of local governments to
increase availability of land for low income housing and to provide adequate services and
infrastructure, in particular for the poor. In this context, the distance learning courses for capacity
building in preparation of local housing plans and social work are particularly relevant and
timely to mitigate disorderly expansion of the cities, to reduce the risk of the creation of ghettos,
and to ensure that the housing sector grows in a sustainable manner. Moreover, the distance

Refonn is a gradual process that generates new demands and requires re-setting of the priorities
as it progresses. The success of the housing sector refonn in terms of expansion of housing
supply since 2005 generated the need to revise the land and urban policies that are in place,
mostly implemented by localgovemments.. Originally, the project documents refer to reform in
land and urban sector as medium to long term agenda which ''would be unlikely met during the
project's term", .recognizing that reforms needed to increase the supply of urban land are
complex and take time to mature. The ·HSTAL made these reforms more expedite through the
provision of learning material and the distance learning platform. Although capacity building of
the local governments was an intentional outcome of the revised objectives, the speed at which
this is likely to occur has been a positive unintended impact of the project.

3. 6   Summary of Findings ofBeneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops (optional for
Core IeR, requiredfor ILl, details in annexes):

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The GoB is committed to refonn in the housing sector as evidenced by the development of a
medium term policy agenda (p18nHab) and the large investments in the sector (PAC and
MCMV) which reduce the risk of reverting the development outcome of the reforms. In
particular for the HSTAL-financed activities, the main risk is associated to the limited capacity
of the NHS to offer the distance learning courses in a permanent way. The current organizational
structure presents challenges since courses are designed and procured individually. This makes
implementation cumbersome and costly. In the medium ~nn, a suitable arrangement could be a
knowledge partnership between the MOCand an entity that could take over the day to day
operation of the distance learning training with technical oversight from the NHS. At the sector
level, significant challenges remain, notably establishing a robust and systematic M&E system
for subsidies. This challenge has probably gained relevance given the large budget allocation to
the MCMV program. Also, increasing private housing finance and developing alternative lenders
and products is necessary to expand access to the lower income segments.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation
   and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The project was designed in parallel to the first DPL with particularly strong analytical
underpinnings; the project components were adequately selected to contribute to the
Government's refonn agenda and the main tasks to be financed were relevant. However, the
design of an investment project requires also a thorough analysis of the existing implementation
capacity of the relevant agencies and any measures to improve it if necessary. In hindsight it
seems that the Bank did not give enough attention during project preparation to make sure that:

                                               30
 the .local procurement arrangements Were adequately. assessed to understand their relevance and
 implications for project implementation,· the implementation arrangements were fully understood
 by the implementing agency, and that the latter were documented through an operational manual.
 Lastly, the design seems to have overestimated the ability of the NHS to conduct reform in the
 housing finance development component.

 (b) .Quality ofSupervision:
 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The rating reflects the slow response from the Bank to react to delays in project implementation.
The Bank should have sought a much earlier restructure of the project to avoid cancellation of
more than 60% of the loan amount. To some extent it seems that the supervision efforts
diminished once it became obvious that no follow-up operations would take place. Despite the
recurrent delays in procurement of consultants no specific training was conducted for the project
and the borrower received little implementation support from the local Bank's office. As such,
the Bank's quality of supervision in the first years of implementation was.unsatisfactory.

 Supervision improved substantially with some changes in the task team including procurement
 and especially once the project was restructured. The Bank became more responsive to the needs
 of the borrower including the provision of implementation support and improved the level of
 realism over project expectations. The Bank's performance in the last stretch of implementation
 coinciding with the restructuring is rated as satisfactory. Although for most of the life of the
 project the quality of supervision was unsatisfactory, the efforts to restructure the project and
 address the new government priorities and the implementation problems - albeit late - deserve
 recognition. Had the restructure occurred at an earlier date, the satisfactory rating might have
 been able to counter the poor initial performance, however, considering the brief period of
.satisfactory supervision from the Bank, the overall rating is considered to be Moderately
 Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification ofRatingfor Overall Bank Performance:
Rating: Moderately Unstllisfactory

Despite the strong technical background supporting the project, the disregard for project
implementation arrangements in the project design: and the supervision shortcomings for the first
years of implementation, contributed to the cancellation of a large portion of the loan and
negatively affected project implementation and outcomes prior to. revision. Restructuring
improved the outcomes in an important way because it was carefully designed and thoroughly
discussed with the client to ensure full ownership and realism over the expectations; however it
was done at a late state allowing for a very short period of satisfactory implementation.

5.2     Bor.rower Performance
(a) Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately Satisfactory
(b) Government Performance: Satisfaciory
(c) Implementing Agency Performance: Moderately Satisfactory
(d) Justification ofRatingfor Overall Borrower Performance:


                                               31
As mentioned before, commitment to reform in the housing sector, (and its ability to promote
growth and equity) was strong at the onset of the project and even gained momentum during the
project implementation yearS: as evidenced by the important budget allocations to the MCMV
and PAC programs. At the program level, the borrower has· made significant progress in the
housing reform agenda in all the areas of project components despite the global economic crisis.
For this reason, the government performance is considered to be satisfactory. At the HSTAL
level, many of the tasks that were idell:tified during project preparation were actually undertaken
-albeit using other sources of funding- with important positive results. A notable example is the
preparation of the PlanHab.

 At the operational level, ·the implementing agency responded to the new Borrower's priorities
 instead of lining up the necessary. resources to support project implementation. Indeed the US$6
 billion PAC slum upgrading program and the US$20 billion MCMV program, both of which
 emerged during the HSTAL implementation period obtained their full attention at the expense of
 the implementation of the project. In addition, the Ministry did not receive implementation
 support to overcome the necessary learning period to gain familiarity with the Bank's fiduciary
 requirements. Notwithstanding these new priorities and conflicting demands, the MOC should
 have been more proactive on re-aligning the project to their new priorities and implementation
 capabilitie$~ through an earlier restructure. For this reason the implementing agency's
.performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

To the extent possible, a technical assistance loan linked to programmatic operation should
remain focused on the direct outcome of the activities financed rather than "adopt" the PDO of
the programmatic series. A technical assistance loan to support a programmatic series should
avoid emulating the program's PDO since aSIL is not an adequate instrument to support policy
reform. . The original PDO indicators for the HSTAL were directly linked to sector reform
(Subsequent Housing DPL triggers are met, and Program implementation, monitoring, and
evaluation based on the results of the analytical and technical work of the HSTAL) when reform,
as mentioned before is a function of several variables, including but not reduced to relevant
studies, workshops or dissemination strategies. In hindsight, a more focused PDO for the project,
confined to the outcomes of the TA to be provided and associated (but not linked) to the program
objective might have been more effective.

It pays to restructure an underperforming project sooner rather than later. The relative
importance of the HSTAL (for Bank and Borrower) vis a vis other programs was substantially
reduced as soon as it became clear that the subsequent operations would not materialize. This
occurred around 2006-2007. Had the project been restructured at that point - and ~ action plan
to make sure that the implementation hurdles were overcome put in place - the cancellation of
the loan amount might have been avoided (or the cancelled amount reduced). Once the project
was revi~ed to align it to the Borrower's priorities, project performance was satisfactory. This
outcome could have been. initiated earlier. Sometimes project supervision delays restructure
because during missions there is a natural optimism that performance will improve, and also
because there is the perception (in many cases from the borrower) that a restructure is associated
wi.th poor performance from the responsible team. To avoid this, it can be helpful to explain the

                                                32
 option of restructure· to the Borrower-at the early stages to increase awareness of the benefits of
 early restructuring if needed.

 Technical assistance loans, in particular those linked to a reform program, need to be flexible to
 adapt to changing priorities and demands. The HSTAL PAD recognizes the need for flexibility
  to allow for changes in macroeconomic conditions and for adjustments needed as the reform
  program progressed. At the same time, it includes a very detailed list of activities to be financed
. throughout the life of the project in the procurement plan formulated at appraisal. These
  activities were directly linked to the project's monitoring indicators and hence to the results and
  outcomes. Consequently, the supervision missions spent· considerable amount of tim.e and effort
  following up on completion of the activities (some of which lost relevance as developments in
  the sector occurred), and less on policy dialogue and capacity building with the Borrower. To the
  extent possible, a technical assistance operation should remain focused on the strategic
  objectives and remain flexible regarding the specific activities to be financed.

 Flexibility can also help to strengthen· the ability of technical assistance loans as instruments to
 maintain policy dialogue. The Borrower recognizes the techni~al expertise from the Bank's team
 and in many cases prefers to take advantage of it in a more direct and concrete way focusing on
 strategic decision-making, rather. than dedicate a lot of attention and time to procedural issues
 (This helps to explain why while having the HSTAL option, the GoB requested a NLTA support
 for strategic advice). By keeping a flexible approach on both preparation and supervision a TA
 can become more responsive to the borrower's needs.                                             .

 The size ofthe loan needs to be relevant relative to the needs of the sector to secure the required
 implementation attention. Considering the sector needs, the alternative investment programs
 (MCMV, PAC) and the improvements in the macro economy, the size of the loan appears too
 small to attract the necessary attention from the Borrower. Assigning dedicated staff for project
 implementation, strengthening capacity or hiring new personnel for the project could have eased
 the implementation problems. Had the loan amount been higher, the relative cost. of these·
 additional measures would have decreased for the MoC, increasing the chances of successful
 implementation.

           Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and / or Comments on Draft ICR


 We will develop in the following sections, a brief summary about the Technical Assistance Loan
 - TAL, (External Loan 7338-BR), administered by the National Housing Department of the
 Ministry of Cities. Following the template provided for this purpose by the local representation
 of the World Bank, the topics were addressed in a very brief manner, given that all facts stated
 here were the subject of previous periodic progress reports submitted to and approved by the
 World Bank.

 (A) Purpose of the operation, design. implementation and operation

Considering the significant housing deficit, which was observed with greater intensity between
the low-income population and the lack of urban infrastructure, there was a need to develop a
new National Housing Policy to better target investments in the housing, urbanization and
environmental sanitation sectors. Based on the diagnosis which showed that 80% of the
population lives in urban areas and that Brazilian cities have common problems which were
aggravated over the years by lack of planning, land reform, control on the use and oc~upation of
land; the Federative Republic of Brazil and the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development - IBRD (World Bank) agreed on a credit transaction or Programmatic Reform
Development Policy Loan (PDPL), in which scope the so-called TAL-Housing Loan Agreement
for the Technical Assistance (Technical Assistant Loan) was included in order to assist the
Ministry of Cities in achieving the goals envisaged in the reform agenda signed on September
21,2006. .

The contract would last for three years and the funds - U.S. $ 4,000,000.00 (four million U.S.
dollars) would pass through - on loan from the IBRD to the Ministry of Cities on September
2009. The amount was made available to support actions undertaken by the Ministry of Cities on
four fronts,· described below:

• Legal and Institutional Framework for Housing Policy.
This area concerns the strengthening of housing policy and institutional framework for the
government housing sector, as the integral part of the National Urban Development, and received
support through· the provision of technical assistance to both the Ministry of Cities and the
members of the National Social Interest Housing established by Law No. 11,124 of June 16,
2005.

• Housing Finance Market Development
This second front, sought to design· reforms that resulted in improvements on the legal and
regulatory framework for housing loans in the country. It involved also the strengthening and
integration of systems of collection of funds from the capital market (the Brazilian Savings and
Loan - SBPE and Real Estate Financial System - SFI).

• Housing Subsidies for Low-Income Families
Part of the loan proceeds would be used by the IBRD in order to develop activities related to
technical assistance for harmonization of subsidies distributed among the programs of the


                                              39
 Ministry, together with the expansion and dissemination of research programs at the subnational
 level.

• Urban Development and Land
As part of initiatives developed by MCid, this topic included the creation and evolution of a legal
framework and promotion of initiatives that were to reduce the production cost of urbanized land
and accelerate the promotion of urbanization and regularization of informal settlements.
                                                            ,                       ,

The initial Procurement Plan prepared for the loan provided for purchase of various goods, in
addition to contracting for services and studies with the following objectives:
to implement the system of monitoring and evaluation of policy and housing programs, as well
as, design, review and disseminate existing programs. Subsequently, the purchases of goods were
excluded, and using resources more intensely focused on training technicians from the various
governmental levels.
              .                                     '

The initial value of the Loan Agreement was $ 4,000,000.00 (four million) and comprised the
following components:                                  '
(I) Institutional Strengthening and Policy Support to the National Housing
(II) reforms to increase the stability and scale of the housing finance market,
(III) Improvement and Harmonization of Policies and National Programs Subsidized Housing,
and;
(IV) Establishment of a Legal Framework and Actions to Reduce the Cost of Urban Land.

In December 2008, the National Housing Department, through the Executive Secretary of that
Ministry, presented toCOFIEX - External Financing Committee of the MOP, a proposal to
reduce the contract value by $ 2,7000,000.00 (two million seven hundred thousand U.S. dollars),
as well as to extend the contract term to 31112/2010. To this end, the Procurement Plan was
reviewed and a list of contracts in line with the guidelines ofPlanHab - National Housing Plan
was prepared. The new plan was consistent with the new value of the Loan Agreement, as agreed
to the reduced amount of $ 1,300,000.00 (one million and three hundred thousand dollars).
Wh~ some of the goals initially set were being achieved gradually, especially the formulation
and adoption of new laws, as the time elapsed since the signing of the loan agreement, a new
proposal for the project Components was presented. Components 1 and 4 would have been
adapted from the initial design, while components 2 and 3 were reduced and incorporated into
one component. Therefore, the project was restructured to include effectively the following
components:
(1) Institutional Strengthening and Policy Support to the National Housing and
(2) Training on Urban Development.

On May 2010 there is another revision of the procurement plan, to include the hiring of,an
individual consultant, a specialist in Monitoring arid Evaluation to design, develop and test a
system of Monitoring and Evaluation of the following subprograms on the MCMV program: .

(A) Residential Lease Fund and
(B) PMCMV municipalities for up to 50 thousand inhabitants.



                                               40
 This contract was included in Subcomponent 1 - Institutional Strengthening and Support to the
 National Housing Policy.

 (B) Operation Results According to the Agreed Objectives

 It can be stated that, overall, the operation was successful, and that successive changes resulted
 from the need to adapt to various external circumstances. During the period covered by the loan
 agreement that is now closed, the National· Housing Policy has mature4; innovations in terms of
 relevant legislation, including grounded in. research conducted within the NAR Housing,
 contributed to a new approach to resolving housing problems. Moreover, exchange rate
 fluctuations affect the total amount available to be spent in local currency.

The products delivered as· a result of Administrative Contract signed with the object of
"providing consulting services specializing in urban development programs for slum studies and
technical inputs to support and monitor implementation of the PAC-Slum Upgrading,"
contributed significantly to enable the implementation of the National Housing Policy, among
other factors, by providing subsidies to the definition of criteria for the characterization of
settlements, to enable scaling of the phenomenon and the integrated planning of urban slums.
The material produced was the basis for defining the content of training courses, specifically
designed for· coaches of municipalities that receive funds from FNHIS and integrate the PAC,
and also defined the parameters of urban and environmental policy, especially related to cost and
quality of works in slums         .

Moreover, the contract the consultant specialist in housing finance and subsidies, despite its
premature termination due to inability. to deliver any of the products agreed, brought positive
results, considering that the "Feasibility Study for alternatives to current enforcement policy and
investment of the FGTS, in accordance with PlanHab" and the "Proposal for operationalizing the
policy of subsidies from the flow of resources proposed by PlanHab" represented fundamental
contributions to the formulation of their guidelines.

From the simplification of components and reducing the total amount of the loan, the vast
majority of the objectives proposed in the revised Procurement Plan were reached.· The early
termination of contracts with consultants, by factors external to the program, had not caused
major negative impacts of rides on all the activities planned.

COllfSes were held in the form Distance Teaching and Learning on· three themes: PLHIS (Local
Plans for Social Housing), Social Work and Slum Upgrading, reaching in all, 6771 (six thousand,
seven hundred and seventy one) participants. The dissemination of such knowledge has
contributed significantly to raising the level of institutionalization of local administrations. One
can gauge the level of success achieved by the courses, to find that some of the contents will be
replicated in 2011 and 2012, in view of the turnover in the technical areas of the City and State
Governments as well as the interest of representatives of not governmental organizations in the
housing sector.

At the end of several courses in the form Distance Teaching and Learning, its technology
platforms have been transferred to the Ministry of Cities, allowing for future repetition of


                                                41
 courses. The method of Distance Teaching and Learning was established as an important tool for
 technical training and dissemination, together with municipalities, government policies of social
 concern.

 The studies on the H,?using Deficit in Brazil, using as its data source for calculating the data
 from the National Household Sample Survey-PNAD, .the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
                                                         a
 Statistics - IBGE, contributed to the consolidation of series, consisting subsidies to assist in
 decision making and the formulation, monitoring and evaluation of housing policies at different
 levels of government, providing greater efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement of financial
 resources. They also favored the disclosure of production analysis with updated information, and
 facilitated comparability with national scale and are used to support planning in the urban and
 housing sectors.

 The study conducted in 2007, which used the numbers from PNAD 2006, worked on a new
 aspect of the methodology, which hitherto was not possible to be analyzed. Thro~gh the
 incorporation of questions to PED - Survey of Employment and Unemployment (PED I RMBH),
 we obtained information about family cohabitation. This. provided the identification for the
 metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte, with numbers that more accurately portrayed the reality
 of their housing needs.

 This methodology was based on a broad definition of housing requirements that encompasses
 both the quantitative housing deficit (households that 'demand growth and replacement of
 housing stock), and the deficit by inadequate or poor quality (the number of households in
 inadequate ~ousing condItions, requiring improvement actions from the viewpoint of urban and
 land regulation, without the need for constructing new units).

 It was· therefore due to the need to work with similar information for the entire country and in
 order to obtain the most current data possible regarding the housing needs, that the Jofto Pinheiro
 Foundation - FJP, was hired under contract Loan 7338-BR, signed with the IBRD. The purpose
.of this report was to prepare the study on Housing Deficit in Brazil in 2008.

 This study of the deficit and housing inadequacy covering Brazil, Federative Units and selected
 metropolitan areas for the year 2008 by processing microdatafrom the National Household
 Sample Survey (PNAD) 2008, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( IBGE), was
 presented by using the methodology that has been adopted by the Ministry of Cities to guide the
 National Housing Policy, which became a national reference, being constantly consulted by state
 governments, the academic field in general and by various professional bodies.

. The final report of the Consultant on Monitoring and Evaluation, whose task was to design,
  develop and test ~ools for Monitoring and Assessment Program actions for the MCMV program
  contains recommendations to SNH that will allow the identification of flaws in the design or
  implementation of those programs. The study points out the reasons for success or failure in the
  implementation, supports the decision-making processes in order to improve them, and
  contributes to organizational learning.

 (C) Assessment of Borrower Performance During Preparation and Execution, with Special
 Emphasis on Lessons Learned that can be useful in the future.

 Legal barriers encountered by the National Housing Department - SNH - during the
 implementation of the TAL - Housing corresponded, especially: (i) the difficulties of
 harmonization of information between the teams responsible for the borrowing, (ii) the overlap
 between the agendas of implementing the Agr.eement and the preparation of the National
 Housing Plan - PlanHab, and (iii) legal and operational limitations of the loan that did not fit the
 profile of studies and consultancies that SNH needed. Legal requirements related to the type of
 loan contracted and the procedural' requirements to be observed led to lengthy procurement
 procedures. However, the resolve to such barriers with guidance provided by local consultants
 from the Bank· after the conclusion of the restructure caused the Secretariat to adapt to
 contingencies and to take measures to prioritization and streamlining of the Agreement in the
 Year 2009.

 The obstacles encountered in drafting terms of reference were due to the need for adequacy of
 internal procedures to international standards governing the Agreement. The novelty of these
 procedures, at first, caused the impasse between the teams involved in the progress of work.

It is worth noting, however, that the familiarity gained with practice of procedures allowed for
alignment of legal and administrative procedures among workers at the National Housing
Department and World Bank staff.

(D) Assessment of Bank performance during Preparation and Execution, including the
Effectiveness of its relations, with special emphasis on lessons learned and;

The Housing STAL was the first experience of contracting with the World Bank experienced for
the National Housing Department, so that the staff involved had to familiarize themselves
gradually with the routines and procedures expected. For example, there was ignorance about the
need to establish a Project Management Unit,an omission that only came to be settled after 'the
supervision mission in October 2009.

Moreover, early in the project was not clear who was the representative of the World Bank office'
in Brasilia to issue guidance to implementers of the Ministry of Cities, which caused some
setbacks. Staff from MCidades was only able to participate in a training program provided by
World Bank in August 2009. Throughout the duration of the loan, there were several
replacements of actors in both institutions, fostering the need of a better dialogue between the
participants.

It can be considered as a lesson learned, should it be signed another loan facility with the World
~ank in the future, that the terms of reference and contracts for purchases or services must
contain a sum of formal legal requirements and specific Bank, with those required under national
law, with a view to placing the standards of the Ministry of internal and external control in
accordance with applicable Brazilian law.



                                                43
Another lesson learned is that hiring separate companies to develop the content and the
technology platfonn to deliver the Distance Learning, can bring problems. From now on, we
intend to make efforts to instruct a single entity, preferably a federal educational institutio~ with
recognized expertise in Distance Education, in all· stages of each project.

(E) Description of the proposed mechanisms for the future operation of the project.

The institutional strengthening, the urban development and training and the support to the
National Housing Policy continue to receive funding from the Federal Budget.

  members; and distributes the bulk of the public housing subsidy resources.
  Estatuto daCidade (the City Statute) is a law related to urban development which decentralized to
  municipalities  a  number of housing and land responsibilities and required cities to develop their
  institutional capacity, as well as participatory urban plans
  FGTS"Fundode Garantia do Tempo de Servi~o is the cornerstone of both the directed credit system as
  well as the housing subsidy system. It is funded by the monthly compulsory contributions of employers
  for all salaried employees into accounts linked to the workers managed by CEF.                 .

 MOC (Ministry of Cities). Created in 2003, the ministry filled an important vacuum in terms of urban
 and housing policy. It has made important advances to coordinate and defme low-income housing
 policies, including the preparation of the National Housing Plan (PlanHab) and the Minha Casa Minha
 Vida program.
 NBP (National Housing Poliq) was prepared by the Ministry of Cities in wide consultation with
 partners and civil society. The Bank was very active in the review of early drafts and in sharing
 methodology and conceptual framework.
  PAC (programa de Acelera~lo do Crescimento). The government introduced the PAC in January 2007
. with a goal of encouraging RS S04 billion in public and private investment over the subsequent four
  years. The measures are divided into five groups:. infrastructure (transport, sanitation and housing), credit
  stimulation, institutional ~evelopment, tax exemption, and long-term fiscal measures.

PSH (Social Housing Subsidy Program) Parcelamento is the component of the PSH that provides
upfront subsidies to the beneficiaries and pays financial institutions to supervise the actual construction or
purchase 0 f the house. Municipalities contribute with the land and enforce the contracts. Financiamento
is the component of the PSH that subsidizes both the final beneficiary as well as the bankto finance low-
income households. In most cases, municipalities are the guarantors of the loan advanced to the
households.
