Achievement of these objectives will remove\n            bottlenecks to trade, reduce transportation costs, attract\n            private investment to the transport sector (reducing the\n            need for public funding) and help redirect the focus of the\n            state away from the provision of services. The project has\n            three main components: (1) the policy component is reflected\n            in the Government's transport sector policy\n            declaration, which spells out a medium-term strategy for the\n            sector, and in the related action plans specifying the\n            measures to be taken to address the most important sector\n            issues; (2) the investment component will finance a time\n            slice of the Government's 1993-1996 Transport Sector\n            Investment Program; and (3) a institutional development\n            technical assistance component."}, "docdt": "1993-01-11T00:00:00Z"}
