Borrower performances were\n            satisfactory. Important lessons cited from this project\n            concerned: Long-term Bank support for well-defined national\n            education programs; recognition of the role of the different\n            levels of Government; seeking strategies to mobilize\n            support, generate local demand, and ensure sustainability;\n            balancing hiring external implementation agencies and\n            consultants with building Borrower's institutional\n            capacity; and the importance of establishing a strong\n            control framework with clear and transparent institutional\n            and implementation arrangements during project preparation\n            to avoid reliance of external agencies for project implementation."}, "docdt": "2006-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
