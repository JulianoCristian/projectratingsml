Improvement Project\n            (FUNDESCOLA II) for Brazil is the second in a series of\n            projects designed to improve the performance of public\n            primary education in selected areas of the North, Northeast,\n            and Center-West regions. There are five components. The\n            first raises schools to minimum operational standards by\n            funding minor school repair and purchasing supplies,\n            instructional material, and equipment; training and\n            certifying teachers for distance learning programs,\n            supplying basic furniture, renovating schools, and\n            constructing new model primary schools. The second component\n            designs and implements school development plans, finances\n            school improvement projects, and develops, tests, and\n            implements pedagogic models. The third component promotes\n            communication and social mobilization by disseminating\n            strategy and results and building a network of social\n            communicators. The fourth component improves national\n            assessment and integrates national and international best\n            practice, supports an integrated education information\n            system and a school census, and develops evaluation studies\n            and educational research. The fifth component strengthens\n            state and municipal collaboration, develops new management\n            models for state and municipal educational secretariats, and\n            develops surveys and a geographic information database."}, "docdt": "1999-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
