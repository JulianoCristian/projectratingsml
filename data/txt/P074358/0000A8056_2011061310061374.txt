                         period.

                         All of the project activities related to the pension system reform have by now been completed. With the support from the project, major steps in pension system reform have been
                         completed, by strengthening pension policy, both by parametric changes in the existing system, and by introduction of mandatory and voluntary funded pension schemes, and by

                         enhanced, efficiency and effectiveness in collection of pension contributions and pension benefit administration system were improved. Moreover, new pension contribution collection

                         system was the basis for expansion of the collection system to include all social contributions. Also, overall public knowledge of the pension system was strengthened through an
                         extensive public education campaign.

                         Although it was initially envisaged that the project support to the reform of social cash benefits would remain relatively modest, the targeting of the major cash benefit program (social
                         financial assistance) has been improved, and it served as a solid basis for the introduction of the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. Besides, the new business processes that
                         would improve the administration of cash benefits have been defined, and the Social Welfare Centers (SWCs) have been modernized. Also, the Cash Benefits Management and
                         Information System (CBMIS), is being developed. While its full development will not be finalized before the closing date of the project, the development is going to continue under the
                         Conditional Cash Transfers Project and it is expected that the new system would be fully tested and implemented by September 2011 (to support the continuation of the CCT
                         program.
