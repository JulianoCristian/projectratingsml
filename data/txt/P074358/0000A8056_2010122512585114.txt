                         activities related to the pension system reform have by now been completed or are in the last stage of implementation.

                         The development of the Cash Benefits Management and Information System (CBMIS), however, is lagging behind. The tendering process is on its way, and it is expected that the

                         One area of concern is continuous struggle with insufficient capacity in the MLSP for policy monitoring, evaluation and for the development of possible reform options. The teams
                         discussed the issue at length with the Minister, who informed the team that the Ministry plans to strengthen those capacities in the MLSP Pensions Department and in the Policy Unit.
