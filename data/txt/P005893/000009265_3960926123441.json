In order to achieve these objectives, the project\n            is composed of the following components; (1) drilling and\n            equipping of a borefield at An Naga'ah, together with\n            associated works, (2) a transmission pipeline from the\n            borefield to Al Mukalla, (3) re-equipping and upgrading of\n            the Wadi Buwaysh borefield, (4) improvement and\n            strengthening of primary and secondary water distribution\n            networks. The project further provides for the  supply of\n            water meters, tools, and  operational and office equipment,\n            (6) construction and rehabilitation of resevoirs to meet\n            daily peak demand, and (7) provision of technical assistance\n            to the Public Water Corporation (PWC), including detection\n            and control of water losses, systems analysis and operation,\n            construction supervision, and selection and development of a\n            computerized accounting system."}, "docdt": "1988-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
