AL MUKALLA WA MER SUPPLY PROJECT
Credit & Priest Su r
Borrower:               The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY)
Beneficiary:            Public W8cer Corporation (PWC)
Creit Amount:          SDR's 8.7 million (US$12.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                  Standard IDA terms with a 40-year maturity
Re1egd4ng Terms:        Twenty-five years including a five-year period of grace
at an interest rate of 8% per annum
Project Desription:     The objectives of the proposed project are to v2et
future water demands in Al Mukalla, the second largest
city of the Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen, up to
the year §.00O and to strengthen the capacity of the
Public Water Corporation to operate and maintain the
water supply system. The project will include (i) the
construction of a new borefield at An Naga'ah; (ii) a
50 km transmission pipeline to the town; (iil)
re-equipping and upgrading of the existing Wadi Buwaysh
borefield; (iv) improvement of about 20 km of the water
distribution system; (v) the supply of water meters and
operational and office equipment; (vi) construction and
rehabilitation of distribution reservoirs; and (vii)
technical assistance to PWC for construction
supervision, detection and control of water losses,
system analysis and operation, selection and
development of a computerized accounting system,
analysis of PWC's training needs and development of a
training program, and a study to improve PWC's overall
financial performance.
Benef'its and Risks:    The project would provide a safe and uninterrupted
water supply service to all of the inhabitants of Al
Mukalla, estimated to reach 10G,000 people by 1996,
including about 28,000 poor people. It will provide a
necessary pre-requisite for improving public health by
providing sufficient water for personal cleanliness and
hygiene, and improve the living conditions of women who
bear most of the responsibility for these aspects of
family well-being. The project will create conditions
whereby the town c&n more rapidly develop as a certre
of economic activity in the region, and reduce the2 high
operating costs of the present system. There are no
special risks associated with execution of the project.

PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBUC OF YEMEN
AL MUKALLA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
L THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
CountyB
1.01     The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) is located in the
western corner of the Arabian Peninsula. It occupies an area of 333,000 km2
and extends nearly 1,400 km along the Gulf of Aden. It is a semi-arid land of
rugged configuration, with sparse vegetation and few natural resources. The
majority of the population lives in the narrow coastal plain. Further inland
to the north, the country becomes very mountainous, with ground elevations
exceeding 2,000 meters. Beyond the mountains, the land flattens again to form
the high plateaux and the Northern Desert, which extend into the Yemen Arab
Republic and Saudi Arabia.
1.02     Overall, the climate of PDRY is harsh and dry, though it is milder in
the interior plateaux. In general, temperatures in the coastal areas are more
uniform and humid throughout the year than in the interior. The hottest
months are May through September; temperatures higher than 430C have been
recorded in June. Rainfall in the coastal areas is irregular but more
frequent during the winter months; the mean annual rainfall in the coastal
plain is about 50 mm. In the mountains, it is more regular and occurs in -the
summer months with an average annual rainfall of about 500 mm. The rate of
evaporation is high and runoff is limited.
1.03     Administratively, PDRY is divided into six Governorates.  Each
Governorate is administered by a Governor arad a Local People's Council.
One-third of the estimated total population of 2.2 million (mid-1986) can be
considered urban. Almost half of the urban population or 0.33 million is
concentrated in Greater Aden, the nation's capital and largest city. The
second largest town is Al Mukalla with a population of 76,000. There are
three other smaller towns, Seiyun, Abyan and Ghaida Ataq with populations
ranging from 10,000 to 30,000. The remaining urban population is distributed
in towns with less than 10,000 people. About 102 of the total population is
nomadic.  The country has very limited natural resources.  rn the mid 1980's,
PDRY's development effort began to face considerable financial constraints as
a result of the economic slowdown in neighboring oil-producing countries.
Foreign aid was reduced and workers remittances declined. In addition to
external factors, production growth slowed down, the floods of 1982 caused
considerable damage, while the drought (1983-1986) hampered agricultural
production. GNP per capita was estimated at about $480 in 1986.
W Re
1.04     PDRY relies essentially on underground water resources for its
supply, as few perennial water streams exist in the country. There are seven



- 2 -
major catchment areas which drain into wadis of which the most important are
the Hadramaut with a drainage area of 90,000 km2, the Rana with 9,600 km2
and the Tuban with 5,0OO km . Since 1970, various studies of the major
groundwater aquifers have been made by the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO). IDA also assisted in this area by financing water resources studies in
Wadi BadramautL' and Wadi Tubanl'.
1.05     With the exception of Wadi Radramaut, where large groundwater
resources are still available, adequate water supply sources are scarce
throughout the country. Several of the aquifers slong the coast have for some
time been overexploited. As a result, seawater has sterted to intrude into
these aquifers, causing in some cases permanent deterioration of the quality
of the waters. Water demands for urban and agricultural uses in the Aden area
have already excieded the available groundwater resources of Wadi Tuban, and
water must be br4ught in from the adjacent Wadi Bana.
l
1.06     Water resources are also scarce in the Al Mukalla area where for the
proposed project, potential resources were investigated in an area extending
from 12 km west o.. Al Mukalla to 50 km east of the city. Some of the small
villages located on the plateaux depend on deep wells drilled by the
Directorate of Local Government (DLG) or on the collection of rainfall in
mostly unsanitary open ditches.
Sector Development
1.07     The Government's current sector objectives are to develop the urban
water supply systems to meet the reasonable demand of a population projected
to grow at about 2.6% per year through the year 2000 and to improve access to
water for the rural and nomadic populations. The great scarcity of water and
the need to increase agricultural production may be expected to pose difficult
water allocation issues in the future. For this reason the management of
water resources should receive particular attention.
1.08     In 1986, the Government requested IDA to undertake a water supply and
sewerage sector study to assist the Government to review the organizational
structure of the sector and to develop criteria for the allocation of water
resources and the establishment of investment priorities. The terms of
reference have been agreed with the Government, and the collection of the
basic data has already started. The study is tentatively scheduled to begin
in March 1989.
1.09     The development of the sector has been hampered by water scarcity,
remoteness of urban centers from major aquifers, the country's rugged

topography, and the scarcity of financing. In the rural area, development has
also bsen constrained by a shortage of trained personnel to effectively
operate and maintain existing systems. The United Nations Development
Program, in association with the Danish Development Agency, is preparing a
project to address the rural system maintenance issue.
1.10     Until about ten years ago the Government gave comparatively little
priority to the sector. For instance, in the period 1969 to 1978, a total of
only about US$12.5 million equivalent, representing less than 2% of the
national capital budget, was invested in the sector. However, in the early
1980s, the Government began to give the sector greater priority. This is
reflected in the ensuing Government Plans. During the second Five-Year Plan
1981-85, sector investments totalled US$58.0 million (in 1980 prices), or 6.5%
of total investments, while the third Five-Year Plan 1986-90 (Annex 1)
foresees sector investments of US$126 million (in 1986 prices), or about 8.5%
of the total investment budget.
1.11     In the urban areas, emphasis was first given to meeting the needs of
Aden, the capital city, where groundwater resources had become contaminated by
seawater infiltration as a result of overpumping. However, other cities have
now received or are receiving attention, most notably Seiyun, Al Mukalla,
Laboos, Rami, Atay, etc. In the rural areas, many villages are served by
piped water systems, and a program of well construction is underway to
eliminate unsanitary sources and improve access to potable water.
Sector Ormaiatlan
1.12     The National Water Committee consisting of representatives of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAAR), the Ministry of Planning
and the Public Water Corporation (PWC) was established in 1981 to determine
development priorities and allocate water resources. The Water Resource
Section of the Department of Irrigation within MAAR is responsible for
managing water resources. Lack of control and inadequate coordination between
the various authorities, however. have resulted in haphazard drilling of
wells, overpumping of aquifers , duplization of studies and a less than
optimal use of resources. The sector study which is expected to get underway
iu March 1989 (para. 1.08) would assis'+ the Government to address these issues.
1.13     PWC was established in 1970 (para. 4.01).  It is responsible for the
planning, design and construction of potable water supply systems and for the
operation and maintenance of these systems in the major urban centers. It
also provides te:bnical assistance to the Local People's Councils and DLG in
the design and construction of water supply facilities.
1.14     The Local People's Councils and local cooperatives operate the small
piped water systems which serve small towns and villages, while the DLG's
rural program constructs wells in rurals areas.
1.15     DLG and the Local People's Councils share the responsibility for
sewerage. DLG is responsible for the planning and construction of sewer
systems and the Local People's Council for operating and maintaining them.



- 4 -
DLG employs consultants to carry out technical studies to identify and prepare
sewerage projects in urban centers and contractors to implement these
projects. A 1983 study financed by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development recoimended the establishment of a sewerage development unit
within DLG as an interim step in the development of a public corporation for
sewerage. No decision has yet been made.
Service Levels
1.16     It is estimated that about two-thirds of the total population of PDRY
or about 1,500,000 inhabitants can be reached by piped water supply systems
and the remaining third, consisting of nomads and small communities, will
continue to rely on individual wells. Of the population which can be reached
by piped systems, about 732 is already served. Water supply systems operated
by PWC in six towns: Aden, Al Mukalla, Howtah, Dhala, Ghail Bawazir and Shihir
and by systems which PWC is constructing in the Seiyun region serve about 441
of the population and the other 292 are served by systems operated by the
Local People's Councils or local cooperatives. Given the very limited
resources of the country and the high cost of development, this level of
service compares favorably with other countries in the region.
1.17     Over 95% of the households in the cities served by PWC have house
connections. The other 51, located mainly in outlying areas, depend on public
staMdpipes. Al Mukalla has 1001 house connections. The systems operated by
the Local People's Councils serve about 401 - 451 of the houses with direct
connections. Standpipes are provided for the other households. Nomads living
in the hills depend on small dams, dykes and a number of deep wells for water
for domestic consumption and livestock. Nomads on the plains depend 'a
boreholes maintained by the Local Peoples Council.
1.18     Most of the densely populated areas of Aden are sewered.  Parts of
the older syatems are inadequate and discharge directly to the habor or open
sea through short outfalls. However, a substantial part of the city is
sewered by a new system connected to stabilization ponds. In Al Mhukalla, a
new sewer system to serve about two thirds of the population is under
construction. There are sewer lines in the de3sely populated areas of a few
other towns, but in the vast majority of the towns and villages individual
systems such as cesspools, dry pits and septic tanks are used for waste
disposal. As water consumption increaes, leaks from cesspits and septic
tanks in some densely populated areas saturate the surrounding ground,
creating unsanitary conditions and weakening foundations of mud brick
buildings. This affects particularly some of the historic towns on the old
incense route through the Wadi Radramaut. Introduction of appropriate
wastewater disposal is becoming urgent in these areas. The Third Five-Year
Plan provides for an investment of YD 8.7 million (US$25.0 million) for
wastewater collection and disposal, the major part for Al Mukalla.

and debt service and to finance a portioni of its investments (para. 5.02).
Households not connected to the supply network pay a flat charge for the use
of public standpipes. Financing for the water supply systems of small towns
and villages is provided for the most part by multilateral and bilateral aid
agencies and Government grants.  At present, no direct charges are levied for
sewerage services.  Firtincing is also generally secured from aid agencies,
whila operating expenses are met from the municipalities' general revenues and
Government subventions.
FPevious DDA Involvement In the Sector
1.20     IDA has played an active role in the sector since 1978 and has
contributed substantially to the development of PWC particularly in
strengthening its technical capacity and improving its financial position. In
1973, IDA undertook a study of the water supply and sewerage sector in PDRY.
The study recommended that, because of the severe shortage of funding,
priority should be given to investment in water supply facilities. A Water
Supply Engineering Credit (S-21-YDR) was made in 1978 to undertake feasibility
studies for Aden, Al Mukalla and Laboos. To date, IDA has financed four water
supply projects; two in Aden (1038-YDR and 1739-YDR)1', one in Al Mukalla
(1159-YDR)-' and one in Seiyun (1418-YDR)"'. The total costs of these
projects is estimated at about US$90.0 toward which IDA provided US$29.0
million and five other agencies contributed coflinanclng of about US$50.0
million. After initial delays due to failure to find adequate water at the
propcsed borefield, the first Aden project was completed at the end of 1987.
Thi- project has shown the importance of carrying out very thorough
investigation to locate and assees the sustainable yield of groundwater
resources prior to project appraisal. The Al Mukalla rehabilitation project
was completed in June 1987 and the Seiyun project is progressing extremely
vell and should be completed on schedule by mid-1988. Some delays have been
experienced in getting the second Aden project underway. PWC's performance
under IDA credits has been satisfactory.
Rationae for IDA Involvement
1.21     IDA's role in the water supply sector follows closely its overall
strategy for lending to PDRY which includes inter alia the provision of
foreign exchange on concessional terms, the mobilization of cofinancing,
technical aseistance and institutional building. This strategy supports
several of the Government's major objectives. Adequate water supply in urban

areas is an essential element of industrial development. In addition, the
manpower training and institutional development of PWC contribute to the
efficient management of the sector which is essential to minimize the
constraints of scarce water resources on the economic development of the
country. For these reasons this project has first priority in the
Government's sector development program.
DL PROJECr AREA. SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND
2.01     Al Mukalla is located on the northern shore of the Gulf of Aden about
midway between the Red Sea and the Oman border. It is the capital of the
Hadramaut Province which contains about 452 of the country's land mass and
about 30% of its population. The population is concentrated in the historic
valley of the Wadi Hadramaut and along the coastline. The remainder of the
province consists mainly of barren mountainous land with some isolated
cultivated areas.
2.02    Al Mukalla owes its existence to the rich fishing grounds off its
coast and the cape of Ras Al Mukalla which provides one of the few deep and
safe harbors of the region during the winter monsoon (IBRD Map No. 19947). Up
to 1915, when the town became the capital of the Qu'aiti Sultanate, Al Mukalla
was mainly a fishing village with an estimated population of 6,000. During
the ne,xt fifty years it developed slowly as an administrative and distribution
center for the area. By the time of PDRY's independence in 1967, Al Mukalla's
population had reached about 36,000 inhabitants. Since then major
developments have taken place. In the transport sector, highways and paved
roads linking Al Mukalla with Aden and towns in the Wadi Radramaut have been
constructed. An international airport has been established and a major
expansion of the port undertaken. In the industrial sector a fish canning
factory, industrial zone and transit area have been established. The water
supply, sewerage and electricity systems have been expanded into most areas
and modern health and educational, facilities established. The population is
currently about 76,000.
Project Area
2.03     The older areas of Al Mukalla, known as Old Town and Al Omal, are
located on a narrow strip of land between the sea and the nearby steep rocky
outcrops. Recent urban development has proceeded along the wadi which runs
through the October district and in less constrained areas to the east and
west, including the Fuwwah area about 11 km to the west.- Most buildings are
multi-story, four to six levels, constructed of stone blocks in the
traditional style. Density is high, with only narrow walkways between
buildings, particularly in the old town where all useable land is developed.
Exiding Faciities
2.04     The existing water supply of Al Mukalla includes three water sources
and a distribution system. The original source, the Bagrain spring, has a



-7-
capacity of 0.25 MMm3/yr (8 lls). It provides water of poor quality causing
rapid encrustation of pipes and blockage of water meters. This water cannot
be economically treated and the source will be abandoned on completion of the
proposed project. The Wadi Buwaysh borefield located about 12 km northeast of
the town, has provided most of the town supply since 1965. Its maximum safe
yield has recently been estimated at 1.25 Mm3/yr (40 lls). A new borefield
in Wadi Khirba, with a long-term capacity of about 0.31 Mm3/yr (10 /ls)
serves the newly developed suburb of Fuwwah. A pipeline has just been
completed to transmit excess water from Fuwwah to Al Mukalla. Total safe
yield of the two viable sources is about 1.56 Mm3/yr (50 l/s).  However,
because of current acute shortages Wadi Buwaysh is at present providing up to
1.83Mm3/yr (58 l/s) and Wadi Khirba up to 0.7 Mm3/yr (23 lls). The static
level of the water table is, therefore, falling about one and a half meters
per year. Continued pumping at this rate would cause complete failure of the
borefield in the long-term.
2.05     The water distribution system serves the entire population through
house connections. Service is also provided to several villages to the north
and east of the town. Connections are all metered. There is essentially a
single pressure zone. Only one small area requires that pressure be boosted
to give adequate service.
2.06     Overall water quality is inadequate, with total salinity, hardness,
sulphates and fluoride exceeding the World Health Organization's standards.
Electrical conductivity often exceeds 2,500 uS.cm-f indicating cxcessive
salinity. There is considerable scaling of pipes and meters. Water is
untreated except for chlorination. Service is provided for only 6 to 12 hours
per day at a time to different parts of the town. Such intermittent operation
creates a serious health hazard as contsmi4nated water could be drawn into the
system. It also causes unreliable meter readings and other operational
difficulties due to air entering pipelines.
Present Population and Water Consmpton
2.07     Al Mukalla's population, according to the last census carried out in
June 1983, was 65,602. At the previous census of June 1973 it was 44,626.
Thus for the ten years 1973-83 population increased at e.a average of 3.92 per
year. These figures include the Fuwwah' area and other nearby villages which
would be served by the proposed water skxpply scheme. The population growth
rate of the country as a whole is about 2.6X.
2.08     Metered domestic water consumption in 1986 was a little over 40
litres per capita per day (l/c/d). This may be compared with consumption nf
62 l/c/d in 1978. Even at that time, demand was suppressed because of
inadequate supply, although less so than at present. Consumption by
commercial, administration and industrial consurtrs brings the overall 1986
average consumption to 58 l/c/d. Unaccounted-for water in 1986 was 292, down
from 342 in 1985 and 391 in 1984. Some of this reduction was due to lower
water pressure and the shorter period of the day during which supply was
available. Unaccounted-for water is expected to exceed 30% during the early
years of the project, but to gradually drop as a result of thie proposed

technical assistance to improve system operation (para. 3.07) to about 2A by
1996 and to remain at that level afterwards. This performance has been
achieved by PWC in other areas. There were 12,300 water supply connections at
the end of 1986, including 1,650 non-domestic connections.
Proeoed Poltio and Cpti
2.09     Based on the 1983 census and the population growth pattern specific
to the Al Mukalla region, population is conservatively projected to grow at an
average of 3.32 per year during the 1987-1993 period and 3% thereafter. The
total population in the project area is thus expected to reach 100,000 in
1996. Detailed projections are presented in Annex 2.
2.10     Due to the current shortage of water, the per capita consumption can
only vary marginally until the proposed project comes into operation at the
end of 1992. Consumption is then expected to rise rapidly and reach 80 l/c/d
by the year 2000. Such a per capita water consumption is low for the level of
development of Al Mhukalla. However, it reflects the high water tariff
resulting from the scarcity of suitable water resources. Average domestic
revenues in Al Mukalla is obout 662 higher than in Aden, where consumption
reached 140 l/c/d in 1985. Beyond 2000, the per capita consumption is
expected to increase only marginally.
2.11.    Water consumption for commercial, government and industrial users is
also projected to increase, from a present level of 0.5 Mms/yr to 1.4
Mm3/yr in the year 2000. This projection is based on an examination of
plans for industrial development in the area, particularly the second harbor
extension due for completion in 1989, and related industry. Projects for fish
processing, poultry processing and soft drink manufacture are presently being
developed. Construction of a new district hospital is almost completed and an
international hotel is planned.
2.12    A comparison of projected production and sales with the production
capacity appears at Annex 3.
M. tRE PROJECT
3.01     In the early 1970s, Al Mukalla was already facing serious water
supply shortages, the sector study carried out by IDA in 1973 had recommended
inter alia the preparation of feasibility studies to rehabilitate the water
supply system and to increase water production for Al Mukalla. However, it
was not until 1978 that, with the approval of IDA Credit S-21-YDR, these
studies began.
3.02     The feasibility studies concluded that only some relatively minor
improvements to the existing distribution system were required, but that the
available water resources should be incre&sed to meet the current and



-9-
projected demand. Immediate work to improve infiltration in the wadis near
the town was recommended to increase supply.  It was decided, however, to
proceed first with a rehabilitation project which included improvements to the
existing borefield and further investigation of infiltration works. This
decision was based partly on concerns regarding the feasibility and cost of
works to increase infiltration but also on the prevailing sanitary situation
which required substantial improvement before significantly increasing water
supply.
3.03     The rehabilitation project financed by IDA under Credit 1159-YDR,
included strengthening and extension of the distribution system, improvement
and rehabilitation of the existing water sources, a health education
component, water resource studies including feasibility studies of the
proposed infiltration works and design of the proposed project. However, it
proved impossible to increase the capacity of the existing borefield to the
extent expected. In addition, it was concluded that increasing the amount of
infiltration into the existing aquifers was not viable. Additional studies
were therefore undertaken to identify other suitable groundwater resources.
These studies, which identified an adequate source of supply, were completed
in April 1987.
3.04     The water resource inv stigations mentioned above included the
construction and testing of 29 boreholes over a wide area, covering all
potential aquifers from Wadi Khirba, 12 km west of Al Mukalla to the Ghail
Bawazir area, 50 km to the east. Reconnaissance further to the west indicated
no other potential aquifers. A resource adequate for needs to the year 2002
and with capacity to meet later increases in demand has now been proven at An
Naga'¶h about 50 km east of Al Mukalla. This thorough investigation of water
resources was undertaken in view of the experience under the first haden Water
Supply Project (para 1.20).
Project Objectives
3.05     The main objectives of the proposed project are to increase water
production for Al Mukalla to the level required to meet effective demand to
the year 2002 and to strengthen and expand the existing primary and secondary
distribution systems. The other objectives are to enhance the operational and
management capacity of the Public Water Corporation (PWC), reduce
unaccounted-for water, increase productivity and improve construction
supervision and system management.
Project  dscito
3.06     The major elements of the project are shown on Map No. IBRD 19947.
It consists of the following components, which are indicated in more detail in
Annex 4:
(i)    drilling and equipping of a borefield at An Naga'ah together
with associated works;



- 10 -
(ii)    a transmission pipeline of about 50 km from the borefield to Al
Mukalla;
(iii)    re-equipping and upgrading of the Wadi Buwaysh borefield;
(iv)    improvement and strengthening of primary and secondary water
distribution networks;
(v)    supply of water meters, tools and operational and office
equipment;
(vi)    construction and rehabilitation of reservoirs to meet daily peak
demand; and
(vii)    provision of technical assistance to PWC including detection and
control of water losses, system analysis and operation,
construction supervision, financial performance, selection and
development of a computerized accounting system and training.
3.07     Technical assistance under this project will be dIrected particularly
towards improving the efficiency of operation of the Al Mukhilla system.
Consultants will be appointed to assist PWC make necessary measurements of the
operation of the system, analyze results, and propose necessary remedial
works. On-the-job training of operators will also be included. Terms of
reference for this technical assistance were agreed at negotiations.
Consultant assistance to define PWC's entire training needs is also included
in the project (para 4.08), and provision has been made for funding a limited
number of overseas fellowships for PWC staff. Furthermore, PWC's overall
financial performance will be reviewed under terms of reference agreed upoL at
negotiations.
Status of Preparation
3.08     PWC's consultants have prepared final designs and tender documents
for all of the project componients except for minor works to be carried out
under force account by PWC. Minor modifications only were required to satisfy
project packaging requirements of the cofinanciers. A project manager has
already been appointed by PWC.
Projet Cost
3.09     Total project cost, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at US$34.7
million, of which foreign exchange requirements are estimated at US$31.4
million. It includes an estimated US$0.75 million of taxes on services which
amount to 52 of the cost of civil works and engineering services; customs
duties are not levied on imported equipment for development projects in PDRY.
The estimated project cost by component is summarized in Table 3.1. A more
detailed cost estimate is presented in Annex 4.

PDRY. Physical contingencies are about 102 of base cost; local price
contingencies are about 10%, and foreign price contingencies about 61 of the
respective base cost plus physical contingencies. Price contingencies have
been calculated on the basis of 3% per year increase in local costs, and 12
per year in 1988-1990 and 3.52 per year thereafter for foreign costs.
Completion of construction of bore fields and trunk mains is expected by June
1993 and remaining parts of the project by June 1995 (Annex 5).
3.10     The project provides for 150 man months of consulting services for
construction supervision and 70 man months for other technical assistance.
Pro, Fiancig Plan and Financing Ariements
3.11     Of the foreign exchange requirement of US$31.4 million, US$12 million
would be financed by the Association, leaving US$19.4 million to be financed
by other sources. The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development have confirmed their interest in
providing financial assistance to the project. The financing plan for the

Onlending Arneet
3.13     The proposed credit would be made to the People's Democratic Republic
of Yemen at the standard IDA terms. The Government would onlend it to PWC at
a fixed interest rate of 81 for a term of 25 years including a five-year grace
period. The loans of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and
the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development are expected to be made to the
Government at an interest rate of 42 with a repayment period of 20 years
including five years of grace.  These loans are expected to be passed by the
Government to PWC as equity contributions.  The foreign exchange risk on the
IDA credit would be borne by the Government. The execution of a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Government ar4 the PWC on terms and conditions
sattsfactory to IDA would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed IDA
credit. The signing of the Arab Fund and the Kuwait Fund loans to the
Government would also be a condition of effectiveness.

3.14     PWC will be responsible for project implementation, through a Project
Manager located in Al Mukalla. He will be assisted by consulting engineers
for construction supervision, training in system operation and management and
leak detection. During negotiations, PWC agreed that the selection of the
consultant for the supervision of the project would be a condition of
effectiveness and that this consultant would be employed by February 28,
1989. PWC also agreed the consultants for studies other than the

computerization of accounts would be employed by July 1, 1989 and that for the
computerization of accounts by December 31, 1989 (pata. 3.07). Furthermore,
PWC agreed to provide IDA, for its review and comments, with the findings aLd
recommendation of each of the studies included in the project and to arrange
for the implementation of such recommendations, taking into account IDA's
comments.

"Other" covers procurement of services in accordance with IDA
guidelines, and FA covers work by PWC force account on distribution
system upgrading.
3.16     Civil works will be packaged into tbzee contracts, one for drilling
of boreholes (US$1.2 million), the second (US$9.1 million) for supply and
installation of equipment and materials and civil works and the third for the
main transmission line to the town (US$20.4 million). The first two contracts
will be awarded under international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with IDA guidelines. The third contract will be entirely financed by the
cofinanciers and their procurement guidelines will apply.
3.17     Goods and works financed in whole or in part by IDA would be procured
in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement. Operational and office
equipment, and goods required'under the program of assistance in system
operation, costing less than US$100,000 per contract, and aggregating not more



- 15 -
than US$850,000 would be procured by Limited International Bidding (LIB) after
seeking quotations from at least four suppliers, in accordance with
guidelines. With the exception of sand and aggregate for concrete, all goods
and equipment for the project would be imported, and consequently, the 15%
preference for domestic manufacturers would not apply. Employment of
consultants will be in accordance with IDA's Guidelines. Due to the limited
capacity of local general civil contractors, the major civil works contract
are expected to be won under ICB by foreign contractors; borehole drilling
under ICB could be won by a foreign or local contractor. Distribution system
improvements will be financed by PWC and carried out by force account in order
to avoid disturbances in day-to-day operations. Documents for all contracts
expected to cost more than US$100,000 will be reviewed by IDA prior to
inviting tenders. PDRY's law requires that all tenderers take out tender
security with the National Bank of Yemen. During negotiations, agreement was
agreed that tenderers will be able to take out tender security with the
National Bank of Yemen or with a foreign bank which is acceptable to PWC.
Disbursement
3.18     The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against the cost of
project components as shown in Table 3.5.

- 16 -
project costs based on the anticipated construction schedule are given in
Annex 8. The closing date of the proposed credit would be December 31, 1995.
3.20     In order to enable PWC to effectively implement the project and to
make prcmpt payments to contractors and consultants, IDA will advance funds as
needed to a special account open at the National Bank of Yemen for a maximum
amount of SDR 375,000 (US$520,000) which is expected to cover IDA's share of
eligible expenditures over a period of four months. The Fund will be
denominated in US dollars and replenished against withdrawal applications of
at least US$ 100,000 equivalent. Applications with appropriate supporting
documentation should be submitted when approximately half of the maximum
allowed amount of the Fund has been spent. All disbursements under the
project will be made against standard documentation except for contracts below
US$20,000 equivalent to be claimed under Statements of Expenditures for which
related documentation will be retained for review by IDA missions and audited
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Agreement was reached tLat the
Special Account will be audited annually by the Central Organization for
Control and Audit, an independent auditor acceptable to IDA.
Land RuMirementes
3.21     PVC has the right of way for its systems.  The land for the borefield
is owned by the Government and will be to transferred to PWC at no cost.
IV. THE BENEFICIARY
4.01     The beneficiary of the proposed credit will be the Public Water
Corporation (PWC). PWC was established by Law No. 19 of 1970 to take over the
operations of the former Aden Water Authority. PWC is also subject to the
provisions of the "Law Organizing Public Corporations"1' which details the
principles governing the organization, responsibilities and authority of
public corporations in PDRY. PWC is responsible at the national level to
develop and operate urban potable water schemes in PDRY and to provide
technical assistance to other agencies for the development of potable water
schemes in the rural and desert areas of the country. PWC presently provides
water supply services to the major population centers in the country
(para 1.16). As a public corporation, PWC is required to pursue its economic
activities and establish prices in such a manner as to ensure that income
covers expenses and generates a reasonable surplus (para. 5.02).
OrXization and Management
4.02     PWC is a semi-autonomous organization responsible to the Minister of
Energy and Minerals. The General Manager of PWC is also Chairman of the Board
of Directors. He is appointed by Decree of the Prime Minister on the
recommendation of the Minister of Energy and Minerals. The other members of
1'111    Law No. 13 of 1979.



- 17 -
the Board are all employees of PWC appointed by the Minister of Energy and
Minerals on the recommendation of the General Manager. The present eight
members, in addition to the General Manager, include the Planning Director,
the Chief Engineer, the Financial Manager, the Personnel Director, the
Operations Director, the Secretary of the Union and the representative of the
Executive Br; ich of the Government in PWC. The Board is responsible for
preparing the corporation's five-year investment program and annual budgets
and accounts for submission to the Government for approval. The General
Manager is responsible for implementing the Board's decisions and for the
day-to-day operations of the corporation.
4.03     PWC's equity is owned by the Government which exercises control over
the corporation's activities. In addition to the appointment of the General
Manager and Directors, the Government must approve PWC's operational budget,
investment programs, tariff adjustments and borrowings. Furthermore, there
are major limitations on PWC's powers to award contracts. All contract awards
exceeding YD30,000 (US$87,000) must be approved by the Government's Higher
Tender Board Coraitte, which consists of the Minister of Planning, Minister of
Construction and the Minister of Finance.
4.04     Under IDA's engineering project (Credit S-21-YDR), a study of PWC
organization was undertaken and recommendations were made to improve the
structure. The new organization structure, together with job descriptions for
the management positions, was implemented by Ministerial Decision No. 10 of
1981. The organization chart is in Annex 9. The organization is now
functioning satisfactorily. However, recent changes in personnel in the
Government and PWC and the introduction of new Government regulations, have
resulted in delays in decision making particularly in the procurement area.
This was taken into account in preparing the project timetable and.
disbursemen' schedule.
4.05     Salaries paid by PWC are in line with those offered by other public
corporations so there is no major constraint in recruiting. As of December
1986, PWC had a total management and operating staff of about 960 of which 29
were engineers, 14 college graduates and 30 technicians. In addition, PWC has
6 engineers, 4 graduates and 62 labourers engaged in design of new works and
construction programs. This is a substantial improvement over its position in
1980 when PWC had only five young graduate engineers and no graduate in the
administrative and finance 4epartments. PWC now has a nucleus of qualified
and experienced engineers but the majority of the professional staff still
lack experience. PWC continues to employ the engineering and accounting
experts recruited under the first Greater Aden Water Supply Project (Credit
1038-YDR). In addition, the Hungarian Government, through its bilateral
assistance program, has provided technical assistance to PWC during the past
five years. At present, three expatriate engineers are mainly involved in the
design of village and rural water suply systems. The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) has also provided PWC with an engineer to assist in
the implementation of rural water projects.
4.06     The current staffing is equivalent to about 12.6 staff per 1,000
connections which is high compared to a ratio of 8 normally found in water



- 18 -
utilities of similar sixe and organizational structure in developing
countries. PWC's management agrees that this ratio is too high and has been
gradually reducing it through attrition from 14.9 in 1983 to the current 12.6.
4.07     Lack of suitably qualified candidates has been a serious constraint
to PWC's staff development program. Under the first Greater Aden Water Supply
Project, which became effective in early 1981, PWC's training activities were
considerably stepped up. A program consisting of (i) seminars on general
management techniques and on the operation of water supply systems;
(ii) in-service training by consultants; and (iii) participation in selected
specialixed courses was instituted. These seminars cover operation control
and leak detection in water distribution systems, water metering, maintenance
of water production facilities and distribution networks, chemicals and
bacteriological requirements of potable water, and administration, accounting
and finance of water utilities. In addition, special courses in plumbing work
have been organized and engineers have been sent abroad to specialize in
sanitary engineering. The Seiyun Regional Water Supply Project and the second
Greater Aden Water Supply Project provided further support for the extension
of the ongoing training activities.
4.08     That PWC's training efforts have been successful is evidenced by the
fact that the overall capacity of its staff has improved markedly in recent
years. PWC intends to continue giving emphasis to training. In this
connection, in April 1987 its Board authorized the establishment of a Training
Section within the Personnel Department, and a training officer has been
appointed. The Government has requested WHO to help finance the cost of a
consultant to assist PWC to analyze its future training needs and develop a
program aimed at meeting these needs for the next five years. However, should
the WHO financing for the training needs study not materilize, PWC agreed
during negotiations that it would request IDA to reallocate some of the Credit
proceeds for this purpose.
Operating E"miien" Improvement
4.09     The proposed project will include a component aimed specifically at
improving the operacing efficiency of the Al Mukalla water supply system.
Consultants to be contracted under terms-of-reference satisfactory to IDA,
will assist PWC to analyse its system and its operation, and to make proposals
to enable PWC's engineers and technicians to monitor adequately the operation
of the system in the future (para. 3.07). These consultants will also train
tecbuicians in proper system operation and maintenance through formal and
on-the-job training. During negotiations, the terms of reference for these
consultants were discussed and agreed with PWC (para. 3.14).
4.10     Over the years, PWC has had no difficulty to meet its financial
targets. Uutil recently, this was due mainly to a combination of Government
equity contributions and regular tariff adjustments. PWC now wishes to
improve its overall financial performance by improving its operating
efficiency not only in its technical but also in its administrative and



- 19 -
cosmercial op-Frations, in particular by improving its administrative and
commercial systems, procedures and practices. For this purpose, a study will
be carried out to establish alternative investment scenarios and financial
forecasts for the period through 1998 and to propose action plans based on an
analysis of the productivity gains which could be effected in the metering,
meter reading, billing, and collection of water revenues for water consumed as
well as in the management and control of inventories and payables. The study
would also review the adequacy of water tariffs, the ability of water
consumers to pay and the effect of price on overall water consumption. During
negotiations, the terms of reference for this study were discussed and agreed
with PWC. It was also agreed that the consultants who would carry out this
study would be employed by July 1, 1989.
BUling and Collection
4.11     PWC bills its customers every two months for water consumed plus a
fixed charge for meter rental and maintenance. Billing at all branches is
up-to-date. In Aden, it is processed on electronic accounting machines which
are now obsolete, while at Al Mukalla and other branches, it is undertaken
manually. Provision is made in the project for the purchase of a new computer
for the Aden office, and for a consultant to assist PWC in the selection and
installation of this computer. During negotiations, the terms of reference of
this consultant were reviewed and agreed with PWC (para. 3.14).
4.12     As of June 30, 1987 PWC's accounts receivable from Government were
equivalent to about 4.3 months of billing and domestic and other accounts to
about 3.6 months of billing. Arrears are mainly a problem of the Aden area
and result from the events of January 1986, and the major increase in tariffs
implemented in July 1986 (43.7%). PWC's recent collection efforts, including
the more rapid disconnecting of unpaid services, have succeeded in reducing
the private sector arrears from 4.8 months of sales in September 1986 to the
present 3.6 months. PWC is discussing with the Government, measures to
further reduce the receivables from Government agencies.
Accounting Prcies and Procedures
4.13     PWC prepares annual budgets which must be approved by its Board and
the Government. Accounts are maintained on an accrual basis and in accordance
with standard public utility practicea. However, recently some capital
investments were not booked until payment was made. PWC is taking steps to
resolve this matter. In Aden, the customer billing and stock control systems
are mechanized but all other accounting functions are undertaken manually.
Most of the accounting functions in Aden and all those of the branches,
including Al Mukalla, are undertaken manually. The accounting advisor
(para 4.05) is gradually improving the quality of the management information
system. Gradual computerization of the accounting systems is contemplated,
starting with the Aden headquarters (para. 4.11).
Auit
4.14     The latest Project Agreement (Credit 1739-YDR) provides for the
submission by PWC of the Corporation's annual financial statements within six



- 20 -
months after the end of a fiscal year, followed by an auditor's report on the
accounts which should be submitted to IDA not later than nine months after the
end of a fiscal year. Past audits have been carried out in a timely manner by
the Central Organization for Control and Audit, a state agency acceptable to
IDA. During negotiation, agreement was reached on maintaining existing
auditing requirements.
Insurance
4.15     PWC carries insurance covering fire damage, motor vehicles, workman's
compensation and third party liability. All civil works contractors for the
project will be required to insure against accidents, civil liability, fire
and property damage. Government policy requires that all other insurance
including marine insurance be effected through the National Insurance
Company. During negotiation, agreement was reached with the Government to
permit all insurance for the project to be obtained in accordance with the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
Tame
4.16     All corporations in PDRY are required to pay to the Government 852 of
their surplus, after meeting operating expenses, including depreciation and
interest. The rate is not excessive in view of the substantial annual capital
contributions which the Government is making towards PWC's investment program
(para 5.02).
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance and Present Position
5.01     PWC's income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements
showing the actual results for the three years 1984-86 and projected results
for the nine years 1987-95 appear at Annexes 10 through 12. The assumptions
used in preparing the financial projections are given at Annex 13, and the
actual and forecast water production and consumption volumes of PWC's Branches
at Annetx 14.
5.02     Article 58 of the "Law Organizing Public Corporations" (para. 4.01)
requires these entities to pursue their economic activities in a manner which
will ensure that their income will cover expenses and generate a reasonable
surplus. PWC achieved this objective in each of the three years 1984-86. In
this period, PWC's net internal cash generation averaged about 152 of ita
investments, while its operating ratio improved from 791 in 1984 to 722 in
1986, and its rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation exceeded
121 in all three years. At the end of December 1986, PWC had a current ratio
of 2:3 and a debt/equity ratio of 36:64. This favorable financial position
was due to good control over operating expenses, the substanti £l tariff
increase of July 1986, sizeable Government equity contributions, and the fact
that service of the debt incurred to carry out its major ongoing expansion did
not begin until 1987.



- 21 -
Tariffs
5.03     Each of PWC's Branches has its own tariff schedule so as to reflect
the local cost of water production and distribution. As of the end of 1986,
about 902 of PWC's water produced and roughly 912 of its water sold was
concentrated in Greater Aden and Al Mukalla. The current tariffs for Greater
Aden and Al Mukalla which became effective on June 16, 1986 appear at
Annex 15. PWC's domestic tariffs are progressive in the sense that unit
prices per m3 increases with the quantity consumed so as to promcte water
conservation while ensuring affordability to the poor.
5.04     The long-run incremental costsl' of the water sold in Greater Aden
and Al Mukalla have been estimated at YD 0.224/m' (US$0.65/m3) and YD
0.238/m3 (US$0.69/m3) respectively.  A comparison of these costs with the
higher block rates of existing tariffs shows that the tariff structure and
levels are adequate at both Branches for all categories of consumers with the
exception of the domestic tariffs for Greater Aden whose highest block rate is
only YD 0.142/m3 (US$0.41/m3 ).  For all other categories, the tariffs
exceed the long-run incremental cost.
5.05     In the past, tariffs have been adjusted regularly in line with
costs. These have been increasing rapidly due to the great scarcity of water
and the consequent need to develop sources increasingly distant from the
consumption centers. Indeed, the last adjustment of 1986 increased tariffs
severely, on the order of 401. The measure was not well received by the
affected population, many of whom stopped paying their bills (para. 4.12). As
a result of the events of early 1986, when project implementation came to a
virtual standstill, a situation of severe bunching of investments has
developed with a peak expected around 1989-90. While the anticipated level of
activity is feasible, the unexpectedly high level of investment makes it very
difficult in the short- to medium-term for PWC to generate enough funds to
meet its existing financial covenant which calls for net internal cash
generation equivalent to 122 of its average investments over a three-year
rolling period. This is particularly so because PWC is subject to an 852 tax
on its income. For these reasons, PWC's contribution to investments in 1987
was slightly below the covenanted level. With increased sales, the current
tariff level would yield sufficient revenues to cover operating and
maintenance expenses, service debt, and contribute the equivalent of 101 of
the average investments on a rolling three-year basis through the end of
1988. A tariff increase of about 161 in 1989 would then be required to ensure
continued contributions to inBestments of at least 101 through 1991 after
which the investment peak would begin to subside, and the additional
production capacity for the Greater Aden area would come on stream. This
adjustment would also give PWC an opportunity to improve its domestic tariff
structure. Further adjustments could be made later should the Government wish
to increase PWC's surplus under Article 58 of the "Law Organizing Public
Corporations" (para 3.02). This scenario is both feasible and realistic.

of October 3, 1986, Report No. 5858a-YDR; Al Mukalla - para 6.09.



- 22 -
Accordingly, the existing agreement would be amended to temporarily set
contributions at 101 in the period 1988-1991, maintaining the 12% covenanted
level for the years thereafter (para 5.06).
5.06     During negotiations, agreement was reached with PWC that it will take
any action necessary, including adjustments to its tariffs, to ensure that
each year, in the period 1988 through 1991, its revenues will be sufficient to
cover its expenses (other than depreciation, non-cash charges and interest),
net working capital increases other than cash, debt service, and the
equivalent of no less than 10% of the average of its investments for the
current year and the two years next following, and 121 of the average of such
investments for the year 1992 and all years thereafter. Agreement was also
reached with PWC that before November 30 of each year it will, on the basis of
reasanable forecasts, review the adequacy of its tariffs and take appropriate
measures including adjustments to its tariffs, in order to generate the funds
required during the following year, and provide IDA with a copy of such review
and description of measures taken or to be taken. Finally, agreement was
reached with the Government that it will authorize PWC to implement the tariff
adjustments which would be required to meet its obligations under the project.
PWCts FInaci.  Plan
5.07     PWC's Financing Plan for the period 1988-95 is shown in Table 5.1.
In addition to the proposed project, investments include the ongoing second
Aden Water Supply Project, some locally financed -slatively minor projects and
future expansion expected to be carried out after 1992. Net internal cash
generation amounts to about YD 6.5 million representing some 181 of total
financing requirements after estimated payments of over YD4.6 million in
income tax to the Government. Borrowings consist of some YD 6.8 million from
IDA for the proposed and ongoing projects, which will be onlent to PWC, and an
amount of YD 6.7 million from each of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development which will be
loaned on soft terms to the Government and passed on to PWC as equity.

Future Financial Performance
5.08     The financial projections are based on reasonable implementation
schedules, taking into account some gains in operating efficiency, and reflect
the financial discipline described in paragraph 5.06 above. In the period
1987-95, PWC's volume of water sold would increase by about 522, while
unaccounted-for water would remain at the same level, i.e. about 26X of water
produced. Average revenues would move up by about 291 and total revenues
would more than double from YD 4.0 million to YD 9.1 million. Expenses would
also double. The operating ratio, although somewhat higlher than in the past,
would remain acceptable at about 801, while the rate of return on average net
fixed assets in operation would drop as relatively massive new investments are
placed in service, reflecting the ever increasing cost of new water sources.
In the forecast period, fixed assets will more than double from about YD 24.4
million to YD 53.8 million. The debt/equity ratio would remain very low,
reflecting Government contributions to finance investments.  The current ratio
would not go below 1.6 and the debt service coverage ratio would be in the
same range. Overall, PWC's financial performance would remain satisfactory.
During aegotiations, agreement was reached with PWC that it will not, without
prior consultation with IDA, incur debt other than for carrying out the
project or other ongoing projects unless its projected net revenues, before
1'       Includes the loans from the Arab Fund and the Kuwait Fund.



-24-
depreciation and interest but after taxes, are at least 1.2 times the annual
debt service on the proposed and existing debt.
5.09     The proposed technical and financial indicators which will be used to
monitor progress during project implementation are shown in Annex 16. These
indicators were discussed and agreed upon during negetiations. Agreement was
also reached with PWC that it will report the evolution of the project and the
indicators to IDA on a quarterly and annual basis respectively and take all
necessary measures to improve PWC's performance as measured by such indicators.
5.10     Within six months following the closing date of the credit, PWC will
prepare and submit to IDA a completion report on the execution and initial
operation of the project, its cost and the benefits derived or to be derived
from it, the performance and fulfillment by the Government, IDA and PWC of
their respective obligations under the Development Credit Agreement and the
Pronect Agreement, and the accomplishment of the objectives described in IDA's
Development Credit Agreement.
VI PROJECT BENEFrT  AND IMPAC
Project Benefits
6.01     The Project will provide piped water supply to 90,000 people in Al
Mukalla when it commences operation in 1993 and will meet projected water
demand to the year 2002. It will improve supply from an intermittent service
providing limited quantities of water of marginal quality, to a continuous
service providing adequate quantity and pressure for normal domestic needs.
Quality will be considerably improved and safe for consumption. Continuous
pressure will eliminate the present danger of back syphoning contaminated
water. The project will provide a necessary pre-requisite for improving
public health by providing sufficient water for personal cleanliness and
hygiene.
6.02     Water will also be provided to meet projected demand of commercial
and industrial users, removing a major obstacle to development in these
sectors, and creating conditions whereby Al Mukalla can more rapidly develop
as a regional center of economic activity. This development has been
seriously hindered in recent years by the inadequacy of the water supply
system.
6.03     The project will reduce operating costs, eliminate serious
operational problems and decrease water losses by improving the pumping
efficiency at Wadi Buwaysh, eliminating as a source the Bagrain spring which
is causing deterioration of existing water mains and meters (para. 2.04), and
undertaking a leak reduction program to reduce water losses in the system.
The capability of PWC to operate the system efficiently will be considerably
enhanced, and this, together with the training activities proposed under the



25 -
project will strengthen PWC as an efficient and effective authority. PWC's
billing and accounting system will also be upgraded.
Emnneuta Impct
6.04     No significant detrimental environmental impact is foreseen as a
result of the implementation of the pboject. Indeed, in addition to the
improvement to the health apd general living conditions of the population
located in the Al Mukalla area already noted above, some beneficial effects
are expected to accrue. The project will provide the additional water flow
without which the sewerage system under construction could not operate
satisfactorily. The system being built was designed to cope with the quantity
of wastewater that will be produced when the proposed project is completed,
including the wastewater from the October district, a recently developed area
not included in the sewerage network currently under construction.
6.05     The October district is located along the banks of a wadi where at
present its wastewater are evacuated. Although there is no record of
associated health hazards, the district's effluents create pools of stagnant
water which cause undesirable odors. By providing more water to the October
district, the proposed project will improve the flow of effluent in the wadi
and reduce the risks of disease. The Government will also clear the wadi bed
to allow it to drain freely in order to abate water stagnation. This
situation, however, is temporary since the Government has every intentions of
sewering up the district as soon as it can put together the necessary
financing. Detailed designs have already been prepared, and the Government is
seeking funding of some US$14 million for its construction. IDA is discussing
with the Government the potential financing of this work under a future
project. The particular siting of Al Mukalla does not allow the economic
reuse of this wastewater.
land Ruixrements and Resettlement
6.06     All pipelines and other structures involved in the project will be
located in existing road easements or unused public land. No resettlement or
acquisition of land will be required.
6.07     The poverty level in Al Mukalla is estimated at about US$200
equivalent per capita per annum or US$1,200 per household. Monthly household
water consumption for the poor is projected at about 10 m3. At present
tariffs this would cost US$38 per year and represent about 3.21 of current
family income and so is affordable. The tariff for this income group will not
increase in real terms. The average family income is projected at about
OS$2,500 equivalent per annum and average family water consumption is
projected at 14.5 m3 per month in the year 2000. This consumption is
estimated to cost about US$73 per annum or 31 of family income which is
reasonable.



Least Cost Solution
6.08     The proposed project represents the least cost solution for meeting
Al Mukalla's water supply needs. It is a minimum first stage component of a
long term program to exploit available water resources. The scope, capacity,
and complexity of technology used in the project have all been maintained at
the lowest viable level to ensure that cost is minimized and the project
remains affordable as indicated above. Examination of alternatives for
long-term development of the water resource involving booster pumping, various
pipe sizes, and materials showed that the proposed project is the least cost
solution.
Adeauacv of Tariffs
6.09     The average incremental cost of water to be produced from the new
borefield at An Naga'ah is estimated at about 238 fils per m3 .  This cost is
substantially less than the highest step of the present domestic tariff of 440
fils rer m and the commercial and construction Larliis wnichi reach uuO f;,ai
per m (Annex 15). These high tariffs are justified to conserve water given
the limited resources available in the area.
Poverty impact
6.10     It is estimated that about 28% of the population are at the poverty
level. As all households will be served by the proiject about 28,000 poor are
estimated to benefit from the project by 1996. Project expenditure to provide
service to the poor is estimated at US$7.0 million, or 20% of project cost.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
6.11     A rate of return was calculated using the incremental water sales at
current tariffs plus the estimated reduction in pumping cost for a 50-year
period as a proxy for benefits. Costs included the project expenditure,
replacement costs for mechanical and electrical equipment and incremental
operating costs. The resulting ERR was 6.51. This rate is a minimum
indication of the benefits since quantification of the environmental and
health benefits is not possible. The ERR is sensitive to a 10% increase in
costs or a 102 reduction in benefits by about 0.62. A combined 101 increase
in cost and iOZ reducLioni iu vbuCSiaI would result- in an E"R  Of 5.1R.
Rlks
6.12     The risks normally associated with the implementation of a project
such as the Al Mukalla Water Supply project are essentially linked to (i) the
capacity of the implementing agency to execute the project, (ii) its ability
to operate the facilities once constructed, and (iii) the availability of
funds. This is the fourth major project to be undertaken by PWC. Its
performance under the first three projects is satisfactory, and with the
proposed technical assistance, it should have no difficulty in implementing
the proposed project. Likewise, with its experience in running its existing
systems, and with the ongoing and proposed training, PWC will have the



- 27 -
capacity to efficiently operate the newly built Al Mukalla facilities when
they are placed in service. Finally, slightly over 90S of the financing needs
of the project are being provided by IDA and the Arab and the Kuwait Funds,
the remainder by the Government and PWC. As explained in the Financial
Analysis Chapter of this report, PWC's overall net internal cash generation is
expected to be above that required for Al Mukalla and should pose no risk
since only few and moderate tariff adjustments are foreseen to achieve this
result.
VS. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECObMMNDATIONS
7.01     Agreements having been reached on the issues referred to in Chapters
III through V of this report, and subject to the conditions of effectiveness
set forth in paragraphs 3.13 and 3.14, the project is suitable for an IDA
rvaMI- n^f Q1W R7 mi-l4on eqln4valent tn the Covernpment of the Peonl#'A
Democratic Republic of Yemen, which would onlend the proceeds of the Credit to
PWC for a term of 25 years including 5 years of grace.

ANNEX 13
Page 1 of 2
PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
AL MUKALLA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Proetions
Water Projection and Sales
1.       Details of the projected production and sales in Al Mukalla for the
period 1987-95 appear in paragraphs 2.10 through 2.12 of the SAR and at Annex
2. Projections of production and sales in other towns served by PWC, updated
to take account of the ongoing capital projects, appear at Annex 15.
Income Statement - Revenues
2.       Water sales revenues for 1987 are the product of forecasted sales
volumes multiplied by the average revenues per ms obtained during the first
six months of 1987 and are based on the latest tariffs which became effective
in June 1986 (Annex 16). A tariff increase which would yield a 162 increase
in average revenues is foreseen for 1989 in order for PWC to meet its proposed
financial discipline. Although not mandatory, other small increases have been
introduced in 1993 and 1995 for the purpose of maintaining a certain level of
"surplus" under Article 58 of the Organization of Public Corporations.
3.       Other revenues, covering meter rental and maintenance, new
connections, network expansion, and sundry have been estimated on the basis of
the anticipated volume of activies, adjusted for local inflation which in the
forecast period is expected to be around 31.
bcome Statement - EDpenses
4.       Wages, salaries and associated benefits have been forecast taking
into account PWC's ongoing endeavor to increase labor productivity. It has
thus been assumed that additional staff would be engaged for the new Seiyun
branch; otherwise staff would stay at the same level throughout the project
period, thus reducing the number of employees per 1,000 customers. Costs were
also increased for the expected inflation and for minor job enhancement costs.
5.       Energy, fuel and chemicals costs are based on anticipated volume of
activities, including the additional costs which will accrue when the new
production capacity of Aden comes on stream in 1992. Inflation was also taken
into account.
6.       Operation and maintenance costs as well as general administrative
expenses have been estimated on the basis of the average value of gross fixed
assets in operation at 1.5S and 1.0X, respectively.

ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 2
7.       Depreciation was calculated at the average rate of 32 on the average
value of gross fixed assets in operation.
8.       Interest charges were derived from existing and proposed credits.
9.       As a Public Corporation, PWC's profits are subject to an 85X tax.
Sources and Appliation of vumds
10.      Capital investments comprise mainly the proposed project, the Greater
Aden first and second water supply projects and the Seiyun project.
11.      The debt service is based on the existing and proposed IDA credits
which are onlent to PWC.
12.      Borrowings include only IDA credits, the loans from the Arab and
Kuwait Funds being passed on to PWC as equity.
13.      The bulk of Government contributions consists of the loans from the
Arab and Kuwait Funds. The funds provided by lenders other than IDA for the
Greater Aden first and second water supply, the Al Mukalla Rehabilitation, and
the Seiyun projects have likewise been contributed by the Government to PWC as
equity. Such contributions are justified taking into account the very high
costs of providing additional water, the low income of a large segment of the
population and the high tariffs which already prevail.
Balance Sheet
14.      Fixed assets are carried at historical cost on PWC's books.  Ongoing
projects which will be transferred to fixed assets in service during the
forecast period comprise the Greater Aden first water supply which is
scheduled to go on stream partly in November 1987 and fully in March 1988; the
Seiyun project which is expected to commence operation in April 1988 and to be
fully operative by March 1989; and the Greater Aden second water supply
project which is scheauled for completion in early 1993. The cost of these
projects were updated in line with the latest outlook and construction
schedules.
15.      Receivables, which had increased to about 5.8 month sales equivalent
in the wake of the 1986 events and the substantial tariff increase of June
1986 (average revenues increased over 40%), are expected to decrease to about
three months as a result of PWC's collection efforts which, inter-alia
includes service disconnection.
16.      Other items, such as customers' deposits, payables, pension fund and
contract retensions have all been factored on the basis of related activities.
