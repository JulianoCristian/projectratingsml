Areas Project (BPAP) is to\n            contribute to the integrity of the Honduran section of the\n            Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) through better\n            conservation of biodiversity in core areas and more\n            sustainable use of biodiversity in the corridor buffer\n            zones. The project consists of four components: 1)\n            strengthening the Department of Protected Areas and Wildlife\n            (DAPVS) and local capacity for protected area management; 2)\n            managing globally important protected areas (PA); 3)\n            improving natural resource management in buffer zones; and\n            4) biological monitoring. The first component: a)\n            strengthens DAPVS at the national level, primarily at the\n            field office and protected area levels; b) builds local\n            capacity for PA management through training and workshops\n            for nongovernmental organizations, local government, and\n            both members of the regional and local protected areas\n            management committees; and c) coordinates support for\n            project implementation. The second component finances: a)\n            management plans for the globally important protected areas;\n            b) demarcation of core and buffer zones; c) construction of\n            a visitor's center in the Atlantic zone; d) personnel\n            recruitment; and e) construction of park guard facilities.\n            The third component finances buffer zone investments\n            previously identified; and the fourth finances: a) computer\n            and software installation in four regional offices and at\n            headquarters; b) purchase and interpretation of satellite\n            images generating a baseline and comparative analyses of the\n            protected area; c) overflights and four field visits to the\n            project area; d) collection and analysis of data derived\n            from on-the ground surveillance by park guards and others;\n            and e) two annual workshops on monitoring."}, "docdt": "1997-09-11T00:00:00Z"}
